The tournament concluded with the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Boston Celtics]] defeating the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 4 games to 3 in the [[1984 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. [[Larry Bird]] was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]].\n\nThis was the first postseason allowing 16 teams to qualify, a format still in use.\nThe first round format was also changed from best-of-3 to best-of 5.\n\nIt was the first NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Lakers since [[1969 NBA Finals|1969]]; they met 7 times in the Finals from 1959\u201369, with Boston coming out on top each year. Going into the 1984 playoffs, the Lakers had already won 2 titles in the 1980s and the Celtics 1, making the revival of the [[Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry]] arguably inevitable and certainly highly anticipated.\n\nTwo teams made their playoff debuts and won their first playoff series: the [[Utah Jazz]] (who joined the NBA for the [[1974\u201375 NBA season|1974\u201375 season]] as the New Orleans Jazz) and [[Dallas Mavericks]], a [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1981]] expansion team. The Jazz did not miss the playoffs again until [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004]].\n\nThe [[Detroit Pistons]] made the playoffs for the first time since [[1977 NBA Playoffs|1977]], starting a string of nine consecutive appearances that included five straight Conference Finals appearances (1987-1991), three consecutive NBA Finals appearances ([[1988 NBA Finals|1988]], [[1989 NBA Finals|1989]], and [[1990 NBA Finals|1990]]) and two NBA Championships. They did not miss the playoffs again until [[1993 NBA playoffs|1993]].\n\nThe [[New Jersey Nets]] won a playoff series for the first time in their NBA history, upsetting the defending champion [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in 5. This was also the only time the road team won every game in a five-game playoff series. The Nets would not win a playoff series again until [[2002 NBA playoffs|2002]].\n\nThis was the final postseason appearance for the [[Kansas City Kings]], as the team moved to [[Sacramento, California]] [[1985\u201386 NBA season|two seasons later]]. [[Kemper Arena]] hosted its final NBA playoff game.\n\nThe [[Kingdome]] also hosted its final NBA playoff game, as the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] moved back full-time to the [[Seattle Center Coliseum]] two years later. However, the Kingdome continued to host Sonics regular season games on occasion until {{nbay|1993|end}}.\n\nThe 1984 playoffs also involved two of the hottest games in NBA history. Game 5 of the First Round between the Knicks and Pistons was played at [[Joe Louis Arena]], as the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] was unavailable, with temperatures reaching as high as 120\u00b0. Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Celtics and Lakers at [[Boston Garden]] reached temperatures as high as 100\u00b0, as the Garden lacked air-conditioning, coupled with the sweltering outdoors conditions in Boston.\n\n==Bracket==\n{{16TeamBracket-NBA \n| RD1=First Round\n| RD2=Conference Semifinals\n| RD3=Conference Finals\n| RD4=NBA Finals\n\n<!-- Eastern Conference First Round -->\n| RD1-seed01='''1'''\n| RD1-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD1-score01='''3'''\n| RD1-seed02=8\n| RD1-team02=Washington\n| RD1-score02=1\n\n| RD1-seed03=4\n| RD1-team03=Detroit\n| RD1-score03=2\n| RD1-seed04='''5'''\n| RD1-team04='''New York'''\n| RD1-score04='''3'''\n\n| RD1-seed05=3\n| RD1-team05=Philadelphia\n| RD1-score05=2\n| RD1-seed06='''6'''\n| RD1-team06='''New Jersey'''\n| RD1-score06='''3'''\n\n| RD1-seed07='''2'''\n| RD1-team07='''Milwaukee'''\n| RD1-score07='''3'''\n| RD1-seed08=7\n| RD1-team08=Atlanta\n| RD1-score08=2\n\n<!-- Western Conference First Round -->\n| RD1-seed09='''1'''\n| RD1-team09='''Los Angeles'''\n| RD1-score09='''3'''\n| RD1-seed10=8\n| RD1-team10=Kansas City\n| RD1-score10=0\n\n| RD1-seed11='''4'''\n| RD1-team11='''Dallas'''\n| RD1-score11='''3'''\n| RD1-seed12=5\n| RD1-team12=Seattle\n| RD1-score12=2\n\n| RD1-seed13=3\n| RD1-team13=Portland\n| RD1-score13=2\n| RD1-seed14='''6'''\n| RD1-team14='''Phoenix'''\n| RD1-score14='''3'''\n\n| RD1-seed15='''2'''\n| RD1-team15='''Utah'''\n| RD1-score15='''3'''\n| RD1-seed16=7\n| RD1-team16=Denver\n| RD1-score16=2\n\n<!-- Eastern Conference Semifinals -->\n| RD2-seed01='''1'''\n| RD2-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD2-score01='''4'''\n| RD2-seed02=5\n| RD2-team02=New York\n| RD2-score02=3\n\n| RD2-seed03=6\n| RD2-team03=New Jersey\n| RD2-score03=2\n| RD2-seed04='''2'''\n| RD2-team04='''Milwaukee'''\n| RD2-score04='''4'''\n\n<!-- Western Conference Semifinals -->\n| RD2-seed05='''1'''\n| RD2-team05='''Los Angeles'''\n| RD2-score05='''4'''\n| RD2-seed06=4\n| RD2-team06=Dallas\n| RD2-score06=1\n\n| RD2-seed07='''6'''\n| RD2-team07='''Phoenix'''\n| RD2-score07='''4'''\n| RD2-seed08=2\n| RD2-team08=Utah\n| RD2-score08=2\n\n<!-- Eastern Conference Finals -->\n| RD3-seed01='''1'''\n| RD3-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD3-score01='''4'''\n| RD3-seed02=2\n| RD3-team02=Milwaukee\n| RD3-score02=1\n\n<!-- Western Conference Finals -->\n| RD3-seed03='''1'''\n| RD3-team03='''Los Angeles'''\n| RD3-score03='''4'''\n| RD3-seed04=6\n| RD3-team04=Phoenix\n| RD3-score04=2\n\n<!-- NBA Finals -->\n| RD4-seed01='''E1'''\n| RD4-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD4-score01='''4'''\n| RD4-seed02=W1\n| RD4-team02=Los Angeles\n| RD4-score02=3\n}}\n\n==Western Conference==\nChampion: '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]'''\n\n===1st Round===\n(1) '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' vs. (8) [[Kansas City Kings]]: ''Lakers win series 3-0''\n*'''Game 1''' @ [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Forum]], Los Angeles (April 18): '''Los Angeles 116''', Kansas City 105\n*'''Game 2''' @ [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Forum]], Los Angeles (April 20): '''Los Angeles 109''', Kansas City 102\n*'''Game 3''' @ [[Kemper Arena]], Kansas City (April 22): '''Los Angeles 108''', Kansas City 102\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Regular-season series\n|-\n!Los Angeles won 5\u20130 in the regular-season series\n|-\n|\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = October 28, 1983\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1983|10280|id=KCK}}\n| team1 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' | score1 = '''117'''\n| team2 = [[Kansas City Kings]] | score2 = 107\n| place = [[Kemper Arena]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = December 8, 1983\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1983|12080|id=LAL}}\n| team1 = [[Kansas City Kings]] |score1 = 106\n| team2 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2 = '''129'''\n| place = [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], [[Inglewood, California]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = January 12, 1984\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1984|01120|id=KCK}}\n| team1 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' | score1 = '''95'''\n| team2 = [[Kansas City Kings]] | score2 = 89\n| place = [[Kemper Arena]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = March 21, 1984\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1984|03210|id=KCK}}\n| team1 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' | score1 = '''123'''\n| team2 = [[Kansas City Kings]] | score2 = 116\n| place = [[Kemper Arena]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = April 6, 1984\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1984|04060|id=LAL}}\n| team1 = [[Kansas City Kings]] |score1 = 97\n| team2 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2 = '''112'''\n| place = [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], [[Inglewood, California]]\n}}\n|}\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning five of the first six meetings.

The tournament concluded with the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Boston Celtics]] defeating the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] 4 games to 3 in the [[1984 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. [[Larry Bird]] was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]].\n\nThis was the first postseason allowing 16 teams to qualify, a format still in use.\nThe first round format was also changed from best-of-3 to best-of 5.\n\nIt was the first NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Lakers since [[1969 NBA Finals|1969]]; they met 7 times in the Finals from 1959\u201369, with Boston coming out on top each year. Going into the 1984 playoffs, the Lakers had already won 2 titles in the 1980s and the Celtics 1, making the revival of the [[Celtics\u2013Lakers rivalry]] arguably inevitable and certainly highly anticipated.\n\nTwo teams made their playoff debuts and won their first playoff series: the [[Utah Jazz]] (who joined the NBA for the [[1974\u201375 NBA season|1974\u201375 season]] as the New Orleans Jazz) and [[Dallas Mavericks]], a [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1981]] expansion team. The Jazz did not miss the playoffs again until [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004]].\n\nThe [[Detroit Pistons]] made the playoffs for the first time since [[1977 NBA Playoffs|1977]], starting a string of nine consecutive appearances that included five straight Conference Finals appearances (1987-1991), three consecutive NBA Finals appearances ([[1988 NBA Finals|1988]], [[1989 NBA Finals|1989]], and [[1990 NBA Finals|1990]]) and two NBA Championships. They did not miss the playoffs again until [[1993 NBA playoffs|1993]].\n\nThe [[New Jersey Nets]] won a playoff series for the first time in their NBA history, upsetting the defending champion [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in 5. This was also the only time the road team won every game in a five-game playoff series. The Nets would not win a playoff series again until [[2002 NBA playoffs|2002]].\n\nThis was the final postseason appearance for the [[Kansas City Kings]], as the team moved to [[Sacramento, California]] [[1985\u201386 NBA season|two seasons later]]. [[Kemper Arena]] hosted its final NBA playoff game.\n\nThe [[Kingdome]] also hosted its final NBA playoff game, as the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] moved back full-time to the [[Seattle Center Coliseum]] two years later. However, the Kingdome continued to host Sonics regular season games on occasion until {{nbay|1993|end}}.\n\nThe 1984 playoffs also involved two of the hottest games in NBA history. Game 5 of the First Round between the Knicks and Pistons was played at [[Joe Louis Arena]], as the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] was unavailable, with temperatures reaching as high as 120\u00b0. Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Celtics and Lakers at [[Boston Garden]] reached temperatures as high as 100\u00b0, as the Garden lacked air-conditioning, coupled with the sweltering outdoors conditions in Boston.\n\n==Bracket==\n{{16TeamBracket-NBA \n| RD1=First Round\n| RD2=Conference Semifinals\n| RD3=Conference Finals\n| RD4=NBA Finals\n\n<!-- Eastern Conference First Round -->\n| RD1-seed01='''1'''\n| RD1-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD1-score01='''3'''\n| RD1-seed02=8\n| RD1-team02=Washington\n| RD1-score02=1\n\n| RD1-seed03=4\n| RD1-team03=Detroit\n| RD1-score03=2\n| RD1-seed04='''5'''\n| RD1-team04='''New York'''\n| RD1-score04='''3'''\n\n| RD1-seed05=3\n| RD1-team05=Philadelphia\n| RD1-score05=2\n| RD1-seed06='''6'''\n| RD1-team06='''New Jersey'''\n| RD1-score06='''3'''\n\n| RD1-seed07='''2'''\n| RD1-team07='''Milwaukee'''\n| RD1-score07='''3'''\n| RD1-seed08=7\n| RD1-team08=Atlanta\n| RD1-score08=2\n\n<!-- Western Conference First Round -->\n| RD1-seed09='''1'''\n| RD1-team09='''Los Angeles'''\n| RD1-score09='''3'''\n| RD1-seed10=8\n| RD1-team10=Kansas City\n| RD1-score10=0\n\n| RD1-seed11='''4'''\n| RD1-team11='''Dallas'''\n| RD1-score11='''3'''\n| RD1-seed12=5\n| RD1-team12=Seattle\n| RD1-score12=2\n\n| RD1-seed13=3\n| RD1-team13=Portland\n| RD1-score13=2\n| RD1-seed14='''6'''\n| RD1-team14='''Phoenix'''\n| RD1-score14='''3'''\n\n| RD1-seed15='''2'''\n| RD1-team15='''Utah'''\n| RD1-score15='''3'''\n| RD1-seed16=7\n| RD1-team16=Denver\n| RD1-score16=2\n\n<!-- Eastern Conference Semifinals -->\n| RD2-seed01='''1'''\n| RD2-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD2-score01='''4'''\n| RD2-seed02=5\n| RD2-team02=New York\n| RD2-score02=3\n\n| RD2-seed03=6\n| RD2-team03=New Jersey\n| RD2-score03=2\n| RD2-seed04='''2'''\n| RD2-team04='''Milwaukee'''\n| RD2-score04='''4'''\n\n<!-- Western Conference Semifinals -->\n| RD2-seed05='''1'''\n| RD2-team05='''Los Angeles'''\n| RD2-score05='''4'''\n| RD2-seed06=4\n| RD2-team06=Dallas\n| RD2-score06=1\n\n| RD2-seed07='''6'''\n| RD2-team07='''Phoenix'''\n| RD2-score07='''4'''\n| RD2-seed08=2\n| RD2-team08=Utah\n| RD2-score08=2\n\n<!-- Eastern Conference Finals -->\n| RD3-seed01='''1'''\n| RD3-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD3-score01='''4'''\n| RD3-seed02=2\n| RD3-team02=Milwaukee\n| RD3-score02=1\n\n<!-- Western Conference Finals -->\n| RD3-seed03='''1'''\n| RD3-team03='''Los Angeles'''\n| RD3-score03='''4'''\n| RD3-seed04=6\n| RD3-team04=Phoenix\n| RD3-score04=2\n\n<!-- NBA Finals -->\n| RD4-seed01='''E1'''\n| RD4-team01='''Boston'''\n| RD4-score01='''4'''\n| RD4-seed02=W1\n| RD4-team02=Los Angeles\n| RD4-score02=3\n}}\n\n==Western Conference==\nChampion: '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]'''\n\n===1st Round===\n(1) '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' vs. (8) [[Kansas City Kings]]: ''Lakers win series 3-0''\n*'''Game 1''' @ [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Forum]], Los Angeles (April 18): '''Los Angeles 116''', Kansas City 105\n*'''Game 2''' @ [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Forum]], Los Angeles (April 20): '''Los Angeles 109''', Kansas City 102\n*'''Game 3''' @ [[Kemper Arena]], Kansas City (April 22): '''Los Angeles 108''', Kansas City 102\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Regular-season series\n|-\n!Los Angeles won 5\u20130 in the regular-season series\n|-\n|\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = October 28, 1983\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1983|10280|id=KCK}}\n| team1 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' | score1 = '''117'''\n| team2 = [[Kansas City Kings]] | score2 = 107\n| place = [[Kemper Arena]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = December 8, 1983\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1983|12080|id=LAL}}\n| team1 = [[Kansas City Kings]] |score1 = 106\n| team2 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2 = '''129'''\n| place = [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], [[Inglewood, California]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = January 12, 1984\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1984|01120|id=KCK}}\n| team1 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' | score1 = '''95'''\n| team2 = [[Kansas City Kings]] | score2 = 89\n| place = [[Kemper Arena]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| date = March 21, 1984\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1984|03210|id=KCK}}\n| team1 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' | score1 = '''123'''\n| team2 = [[Kansas City Kings]] | score2 = 116\n| place = [[Kemper Arena]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]\n}}\n{{basketballbox\n| bg=#fff\n| date = April 6, 1984\n| report = {{Basketball-Reference NBA Recap|1984|04060|id=LAL}}\n| team1 = [[Kansas City Kings]] |score1 = 97\n| team2 = '''[[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' |score2 = '''112'''\n| place = [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], [[Inglewood, California]]\n}}\n|}\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning five of the first six meetings.

In conjunction with her multi-platinum selling album ''[[Private Dancer]]'', the tour helped to establish Turner as a major solo artist and live performer and is often considered one of the best comebacks in music history.\n\nThe 180-date tour encompassed Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. Turner also played a show in [[Budapest]], the only show of the tour behind the [[Iron Curtain]].\n\nThe concerts received additional accolades, receiving an \"Most Creative Tour Package Award\" and \"Comeback Tour Of The Year Award\" from [[Pollstar|Pollstar Awards]].<ref>\nhttps://www.pollstarpro.com/PCIA-Static/awards1985.htm</ref>\n\n==Opening acts==\n*[[FM (British band)|FM]] <small>(Germany) (April / May 1985)</small>\n*[[Glenn Frey]] <small>(North America) (select dates)</small>\n*[[Mr. Mister]] <small>(North America) (select dates)</small>\n*Limited Warranty <small>(North America) (select dates)</small>\n*[[John Parr]] <small>(North America) (select dates)</small>\n*[[Eric Martin (singer)#415/Eric Martin Band 1978\u20131985|Eric Martin Band]] <small>(North America) (select dates)</small>\n*[[Go West (band)|Go West]] <small>(North America) (select dates)</small>\n*[[Strange Advance (band)|Strange Advance]] <small>(Canada) (select dates)</small>\n\n==Set list==\n{{hidden\n| headercss = background: #ccccff; font-size: 100%; width: 65%;\n| contentcss = text-align: left; font-size: 100%; width: 75%;\n| header = Europe\n| content =\n#\"[[Let's Pretend We're Married]]\"\n#\"[[Show Some Respect]]\"\n#\"[[I Might Have Been Queen]]\"\n#\"[[River Deep \u2013 Mountain High]]\"\n#\"[[What's Love Got to Do with It (song)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]\"\n#\"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\"\n#\"[[I Can't Stand The Rain (song)|I Can't Stand The Rain]]\"\n#\"[[Better Be Good to Me]]\"\n#\"[[Private Dancer (Tina Turner song)|Private Dancer]]\"\n#\"[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|Let's Stay Together]]\"\n#\"[[Help!

It was issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between [[Date and time notation by country|countries with different conventions]] for writing numeric dates and times.\n\nIn general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] (and potentially [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic Gregorian]]) calendar, of times based on the [[24-hour clock|24-hour timekeeping system]] (with optional [[UTC offset]]), of [[Time interval#Time-like concepts: terminology|time intervals]], and combinations thereof.<ref name=scope>ISO 8601:2004[E] section 1 Scope</ref> The standard does not assign any specific meaning to elements of the date/time to be represented; the meaning will depend on the context of its use.  In addition, dates and times to be represented cannot include words with no specified numerical meaning in the standard (e.g., names of [[Chinese calendar correspondence table|years in the Chinese calendar]]) or that do not use [[Character (computing)|characters]] (e.g., images, sounds).<ref name=scope />\n\nIn representations for interchange, dates and times are arranged so the largest temporal term (the year) is placed to the left and each successively smaller term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of [[Arabic numerals]] and certain characters (such as \"-\", \":\", \"T\", \"W\", and \"Z\") that are given specific meanings within the standard; the implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as \"January\" or \"Thursday\", are not allowed in interchange representations.\n\n==History==\nThe first edition of the ISO&nbsp;8601 standard was published as ''ISO&nbsp;8601:1988'' in 1988. It unified and replaced a number of older ISO standards on various aspects of date and time notation: [[ISO 2014]], [[ISO 2015]], [[ISO 2711]], [[ISO 3307]], and [[ISO 4031]].<ref name=doc2004>{{citation\n |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n |date=2004-12-01\n |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n |quote=Annex&nbsp;A: ...

The [[lexicographical order]] of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years or time offset. This allows dates to be naturally [[sorting|sorted]] by, for example, file systems.\n*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with [[leading zero]]s.\n*Representations can be done in one of two formats{{spaced ndash}}a basic format with a minimal number of separators or an extended format with separators added to enhance human readability.<ref name=isofaqtnd>ISO, FAQ: ''[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 Numeric representation of Dates and Time]''</ref><ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime \"Date and Time Formats\"].</ref> The standard notes that \"The basic format should be avoided in plain text.\"<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 2.3.3 basic format</ref> The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the [[hyphen]], while the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds).<!--dead link: [http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml-core/200104/pdf00005.pdf]--> For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as {{nowrap|\"2009-01-06\"}} in the extended format or simply as \"20090106\" in the basic format without ambiguity.\n*For reduced accuracy,<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision>ISO 8601 uses the word ''accuracy'', not ''precision'', in the relevant section, e.g: 2.3.7 representation with reduced accuracy.</ref> any number of values may be dropped from any of the date and time representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant.  For example, \"2004-05\" is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004.  This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.\n*If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a [[Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]] to the smallest time value in the representation.\n\n==Dates==\n{{ISOCALENDAR}}\nThe standard uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], which \"serves as an international standard for civil use.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |url=http://astro.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html\n |last=Doggett\n |first=L.

However, ISO calendar dates before the Convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on {{nowrap|1582-10-15}}. Earlier dates, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], may be used by mutual agreement of the partners exchanging information. The standard states that every date must be consecutive, so usage of the [[Julian calendar]] would be contrary to the standard (because at the switchover date, the dates would not be consecutive).\n\n===Years===\n{| class=\"list\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| YYYY\n|-\n| \u00b1<u>Y</u>YYYY\n|}\nISO 8601 prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY] to avoid the [[year 2000 problem]]. It therefore represents years from 0000 to 9999, year 0000 being equal to 1 [[Anno Domini|BC]] and all others [[AD]]. However, years prior to [[Gregorian calendar|1583]] are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead \"values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|at=section 4.1.2.1 General\n}}</ref>\n\nTo represent years before [[Year zero|0000]] or after [[Year 10,000 problem|9999]], the standard also permits the expansion of the year representation but only by prior agreement between the sender and the receiver.<ref>{{cite book |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|quote=3.5 Expansion ...

[YYYY] indicates a four-digit year, 0000 through 9999. [MM] indicates a two-digit month of the year, 01 through 12. [DD] indicates a two-digit day of that month, 01 through 31.  For example, \"5 April 1981\" may be represented as either {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}}<ref name=isofaqtnd/> in the ''extended format'' or \"19810405\" in the ''basic format''.\n\nThe standard also allows for calendar dates to be written with reduced accuracy.<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/> For example, one may write {{nowrap|\"1981-04\"}} to mean \"1981 April\". The 2000 version allowed writing {{nowrap|\"--04-05\"}} to mean \"April 5\"<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350#section-4.3.1\n |title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification\n |accessdate=2016-06-29\n |date=August 2011\n |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n |quote=Truncated representation, as specified in [ISO.8601.2000], Sections 5.2.1.3 d), e), and f), is permitted.}}</ref> but the 2004 version does not allow omitting the year when a month is present. One may simply write \"1981\" to refer to that year or \"19\" to refer to the [[century]] from 1900 to 1999 inclusive.  Although the standard allows both the {{nowrap|\"YYYY-MM-DD\"}} and YYYYMMDD formats for complete calendar date representations, if the day [DD] is omitted then only the {{nowrap|YYYY-MM}} format is allowed. By disallowing dates of the form YYYYMM, the standard avoids confusion with the [[#Truncated representations|truncated representation]] YYMMDD (still often used).\n\n===Week dates===\n{{Main|ISO week date}}\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY-Www ||''or''|| YYYYWww\n|-\n| YYYY-Www-D ||''or''|| YYYYWwwD\n|}\nWeek date representations are in the formats as shown in the adjacent box.  [YYYY] indicates the ''ISO week-numbering year'' which is slightly different from the traditional [[Gregorian calendar]] year (see below).  [Www] is the ''[[week number]]'' prefixed by the letter ''W'', from W01 through W53. [D] is the ''weekday number'', from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.\n\nThere are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:\n*the week with the year's first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),\n*the week with 4 January in it,\n*the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and\n*the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December \u2013 4 January.\n\nAs a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.\n\nThe week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.\n\nThe ''ISO week-numbering year'' starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.\n\nExamples:\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2008-12-29}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2008-12-29}}\"\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2010-01-03}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2010-01-03}}\"\n\n===Ordinal dates===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY-DDD ||''or''|| YYYYDDD\n|}\n\nAn [[ordinal date]] is a simple form for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars.  As represented above, [YYYY] indicates a year. [DDD] is the day of that year, from 001 through 365 (366 in [[leap year]]s). For example, {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}} is also {{nowrap|\"1981-095\"}}.\n\nThis format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance.  This system is sometimes referred to as \"Julian Date\", but this can cause confusion with the astronomical [[Julian day]], a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning {{nowrap|1 January 4713 BC}} Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date {{nowrap|\u22124713-11-24}} which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year 0000).\n\n==Times==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|hh:mm:ss.sss\n|''or''\n|hhmmss.sss\n|-\n| hh:mm:ss ||''or''|| hhmmss\n|-\n| hh:mm ||''or''|| hhmm\n|-\n| || hh ||\n|}\n\nISO 8601 uses the [[24-hour clock]] system.  The ''basic format'' is [hh][mm][ss] and the ''extended format'' is [hh]:[mm]:[ss].\n*[hh] refers to a zero-padded [[hour]] between 00 and 24 (where 24 is only used to denote midnight at the end of a calendar day).\n*[mm] refers to a zero-padded [[minute]] between 00 and 59.\n*[ss] refers to a zero-padded [[second]] between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to denote an added [[leap second]]).\nSo a time might appear as either \"134730\" in the ''basic format'' or \"13:47:30\" in the ''extended format''.\n\nEither the seconds, or the minutes and seconds, may be omitted from the basic or extended time formats for greater brevity but decreased accuracy; the resulting reduced accuracy time formats are:<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 4.2.2.3 Representations with reduced accuracy</ref>\n*[hh][mm] in ''basic format'' or [hh]:[mm] in ''extended format'', when seconds are omitted.\n*[hh], when both seconds and minutes are omitted.\n\n''[[Midnight]]'' is a special case and may be referred to as either \"00:00\" or \"24:00\", except in ISO 8601-1:2019 where \"24:00\" is no longer permitted. The notation \"00:00\" is used at the beginning of a calendar day and is the more frequently used. At the end of a day use \"24:00\". \"2007-04-05T24:00\" is the same instant as \"2007-04-06T00:00\" (see ''[[#Combined date and time representations|Combined date and time representations]]'' below).\n\nDecimal fractions may be added to any of the three time elements. However, a fraction may only be added to the lowest order time element in the representation. A [[decimal mark]], either a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] or a [[full stop|dot]] (without any preference as stated in resolution 10 of the 22nd General Conference CGPM in 2003,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2006/11/decimals-score-point-international-standards\n |title=NIST TechBeat 2006-11-22\n |accessdate=2017-09-27\n |date=2006-11-22\n |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]\n |quote=Decimals Score a Point on International Standards ...

Represent it as \"14:30,5\", \"1430,5\", \"14:30.5\", or \"1430.5\". There is no limit on the number of decimal places for the decimal fraction. However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the communicating parties. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the [[Significant figures|precision]] of a decimal fraction is 3, i.e., \"yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190977(v=sql.90).aspx|title=ISO 8601 Format|website=technet.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref>\n\n===Time zone designators===\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;Z\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hh:mm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hhmm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hh\n|}\n\n[[Time zone]]s in ISO 8601 are represented as local time (with the location unspecified), as [[UTC]], or as an offset from UTC.\n\nIf no UTC relation information is given with a time representation, the time is assumed to be in local time. While it ''may'' be safe to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes [[daylight saving time]]. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.\n\n====Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)====\nIf the time is in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], add a ''Z'' directly after the time without a space. ''Z'' is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. \"09:30 UTC\" is therefore represented as \"09:30Z\" or \"0930Z\". \"14:45:15 UTC\" would be \"14:45:15Z\" or \"144515Z\".\n\nThe ''Z'' suffix in the ISO 8601 time representation is sometimes referred to as \"Zulu time\" because the same letter is used to designate the [[List of military time zones|Zulu time zone]]. However the ACP 121 standard that defines the list of military time zones makes no mention of UTC and derives the \"Zulu time\" from the [[Greenwich Mean Time]]<ref name=\"ACP_121_I\">{{cite web |url=https://rnzncomms.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/acp121_i_2010.pdf |title=COMMUNICATION INSTRUCTIONS GENERAL ACP 121(I) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 2010 |website= |publisher=[[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] |access-date=2018-01-15 |quote=}}</ref> which was formerly used as the international civil time standard.

If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphen&ndash;minus should be used.  [[ASCII]] does not have a minus sign, so its hyphen&ndash;minus character (code is 45 decimal or 2D hexadecimal) would be used. If the character set has a minus sign, then that character should be used. [[Unicode]] has a minus sign, and its character code is U+2212 (2212 hexadecimal); the [[HTML entity|HTML character entity]] invocation is <code>&amp;minus;</code>.\n\nThe following times all refer to the same moment: \"18:30Z\", \"22:30+04\", \"1130&minus;0700\", and \"15:00&minus;03:30\". [[Nautical time]] zone letters are not used with the exception of Z. To calculate UTC time one has to subtract the offset from the local time, e.g. for \"15:00&minus;03:30\" do 15:00 &minus; (&minus;03:30) to get 18:30 UTC.\n\nAn offset of zero, in addition to having the special representation \"Z\", can also be stated numerically as \"+00:00\", \"+0000\", or \"+00\".  However, it is not permitted to state it numerically with a negative sign, as \"&minus;00:00\", \"&minus;0000\", or \"&minus;00\".  The section dictating sign usage (section 3.4.2 in the 2004 edition of the standard) states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value.  Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of \"-00\", with the same denotation as \"+00\" but a differing connotation.<ref>RFC 3339{{spaced ndash}}Unknown local offset convention</ref>\n\n==Combined date and time representations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| &lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;\n|}\n\nA single point in time can be represented by concatenating a complete date expression, the letter ''\"T\"'' as a delimiter, and a valid time expression. For example, {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T14:30\"}}.

NOTE: ISO 8601 defines date and time separated by \"T\". Applications using this syntax may choose, for the sake of readability, to specify a full-date and full-time separated by (say) a space character.}}</ref>\n\nIf a time zone designator is required, it follows the combined date and time. For example, {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T14:30Z\"}} or {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T12:30-02:00\"}}.\n\nEither basic or extended formats may be used, but both date and time must use the same format. The date expression may be calendar, week, or ordinal, and must use a complete representation. The time may be represented using a specified reduced accuracy format.<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/>\n\n==Durations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| PnYnMnDTnHnMnS\n|-\n| PnW\n|-\n| P&lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;\n|}\nDurations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W as shown to the right.  In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n].  Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties.  The capital letters ''P'', ''Y'', ''M'', ''W'', ''D'', ''T'', ''H'', ''M'', and ''S'' are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.\n\n*''P'' is the duration designator (for ''period'') placed at the start of the duration representation.\n**''Y'' is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.\n**''M'' is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.\n**''W'' is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.\n**''D'' is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.\n*''T'' is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.\n**''H'' is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.\n**''M'' is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.\n**''S'' is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.\n\nFor example, \"P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S\" represents a duration of \"three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds\".\n\nDate and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, \"P23DT23H\" and \"P4Y\" are both acceptable duration representations. However, at least one element must be present, thus \"P\" is not a valid representation for a duration of 0 seconds. \"PT0S\" or \"P0D\", however, are both valid and represent the same duration.\n\nTo resolve ambiguity, \"P1M\" is a one-month duration and \"PT1M\" is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used may also have a decimal fraction, as in \"P0.5Y\" to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a [[comma]] or a [[full stop]], as in \"P0,5Y\" or \"P0.5Y\".  The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their \"carry over points\" except as noted below.  Thus, \"PT36H\" could be used as well as \"P1DT12H\" for representing the same duration. But keep in mind that \"PT36H\" is not the same as \"P1DT12H\" when switching from or to [[Daylight saving time]].\n\nAlternatively, a format for duration based on combined date and time representations may be used by agreement between the communicating parties either in the basic format PYYYYMMDDThhmmss or in the extended format {{nowrap|P[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]}}.  For example, the first duration shown above would be {{nowrap|\"P0003-06-04T12:30:05\"}}.  However, individual date and time values cannot exceed their [[modular arithmetic|moduli]] (e.g. a value of 13 for the month or 25 for the hour would not be permissible).<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 4.4.3.3 Alternative format</ref>\n\nAlthough the standard describes a duration as part of time intervals, which are discussed in the next section, the duration format (or a subset thereof) is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Java 8 Class Duration|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-|website=Java Platform Standard Edition 8|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon Alexa Duration|url=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#duration|website=Amazon Developer|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref>\n\n==Time intervals==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| <start>/<end>\n|-\n| <start>/<duration>\n|-\n| <duration>/<end>\n|-\n| <duration>\n|}\nA time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section).  The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.\n\nThere are four ways to express a time interval:\n\n#Start and end, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Start and duration, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"\n#Duration and end, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Duration only, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\", with additional context information\n\nOf these, the first three require two values separated by an ''interval designator'' which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]] \"/\"). Section 4.4.2 of the standard notes that: \"In certain application areas a double hyphen is used as a separator instead of a solidus.\" The standard does not define the term \"double hyphen\", but previous versions used notations like \"2000--2002\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/iso8601.html |title=Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard |publisher=Cs.tut.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}</ref> Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer [[filename]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |title=ISO 8601 - Getting with the Times (and Dates) |date=2012-01-01| publisher=Hydrogold |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> A solidus is a [[Filename#Reserved characters and words|reserved character]] and not allowed in a filename in common operating systems.\n\nFor <start>/<end> expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals.  For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be simply shown as \"2007-12-14T13:30/15:30\", where \"/15:30\" implies \"/2007-12-14T15:30\" (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as \"2008-02-15/03-14\", where \"/03-14\" implies \"/2008-03-14\" (the same year as the start).\n\nIf greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13/15\"}} can start at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-13}} and end at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-15}}, whereas {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00\"}} includes the start and end times.\nTo explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T00:00/15T24:00\"}}.\n\n===Repeating intervals===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| Rn/<interval>\n|-\n| R/<interval>\n|}\nRepeating intervals are specified in clause \"4.5 Recurring time interval\". They are formed by adding \"R[n]/\" to the beginning of an interval expression, where ''R'' is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] means an unbounded number of repetitions. If the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\" five times starting at {{nowrap|\"2008-03-01T13:00:00Z\"}}, use {{nowrap|\"R5/2008-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"}}.\n\n==Truncated representations==\nISO 8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted. Notably, this allowed two-digit years to be used and the ambiguous formats YY-MM-DD and YYMMDD. This provision was removed in ISO 8601:2004.\n\n==Usage==\nOn the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) uses ISO 8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime Note about Date and Time Formats to W3C from Reuters]<!--should be XML Schema--></ref>\n\nISO 8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO 8601 is not always used. For example, the various [[electronic program guide]] standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The [[ID3]] audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO 8601.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure|title=ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Main Structure|last=Nilsson|first=M.|date=2000-11-01|publisher=id3.org|pages=\u00a74|accessdate=2009-09-27}}</ref>\nThe [[X.690]] encoding standard's [[GeneralizedTime]] makes use of another subset of ISO 8601.\n\n=== Commerce ===\nThe [[ISO 8601 week date]], as of 2006, appeared in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States. Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand. The format is particularly useful for quality assurance, so that production errors can be readily traced to work weeks, and products can be correctly targeted for recall.\n\n=== RFCs ===\nRFC 3339 defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in [[Internet protocol suite|Internet protocols]] and [[Internet standard|standards]]. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the [[common era]]. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted.<ref>RFC 3339, section 5.6</ref>\n\nRFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero time zone offset to be specified as \"-00:00\", which ISO 8601 forbids.  RFC 3339 intends \"-00:00\" to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred time zone, whereas the conforming \"+00:00\" or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred.  This convention regarding \"-00:00\" is derived from earlier RFCs, such as [[RFC 2822]] which uses it for timestamps in [[email]] headers.  RFC 2822 made no claim that any part of its timestamp format conforms to ISO 8601, and so was free to use this convention without conflict.\n\n=== Adoption as national standards ===\n<!-- If possible, please specify revisions and release dates as well. In order to establish some chronology, older standards can be listed as well, but only if they were related to ISO 8601 already. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Australia \n| AS ISO 8601-2007\n|-\n!

It was issued by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between [[Date and time notation by country|countries with different conventions]] for writing numeric dates and times.\n\nIn general, ISO 8601 applies to representations and formats of dates in the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] (and potentially [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic Gregorian]]) calendar, of times based on the [[24-hour clock|24-hour timekeeping system]] (with optional [[UTC offset]]), of [[Time interval#Time-like concepts: terminology|time intervals]], and combinations thereof.<ref name=scope>ISO 8601:2004[E] section 1 Scope</ref> The standard does not assign any specific meaning to elements of the date/time to be represented; the meaning will depend on the context of its use.  In addition, dates and times to be represented cannot include words with no specified numerical meaning in the standard (e.g., names of [[Chinese calendar correspondence table|years in the Chinese calendar]]) or that do not use [[Character (computing)|characters]] (e.g., images, sounds).<ref name=scope />\n\nIn representations for interchange, dates and times are arranged so the largest temporal term (the year) is placed to the left and each successively smaller term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of [[Arabic numerals]] and certain characters (such as \"-\", \":\", \"T\", \"W\", and \"Z\") that are given specific meanings within the standard; the implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as \"January\" or \"Thursday\", are not allowed in interchange representations.\n\n==History==\nThe first edition of the ISO&nbsp;8601 standard was published as ''ISO&nbsp;8601:1988'' in 1988.

The [[lexicographical order]] of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years or time offset. This allows dates to be naturally [[sorting|sorted]] by, for example, file systems.\n*Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with [[leading zero]]s.\n*Representations can be done in one of two formats{{spaced ndash}}a basic format with a minimal number of separators or an extended format with separators added to enhance human readability.<ref name=isofaqtnd>ISO, FAQ: ''[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso8601 Numeric representation of Dates and Time]''</ref><ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime \"Date and Time Formats\"].</ref> The standard notes that \"The basic format should be avoided in plain text.\"<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 2.3.3 basic format</ref> The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the [[hyphen]], while the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds).<!--dead link: [http://lists.ebxml.org/archives/ebxml-core/200104/pdf00005.pdf]--> For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as {{nowrap|\"2009-01-06\"}} in the extended format or simply as \"20090106\" in the basic format without ambiguity.\n*For reduced accuracy,<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision>ISO 8601 uses the word ''accuracy'', not ''precision'', in the relevant section, e.g: 2.3.7 representation with reduced accuracy.</ref> any number of values may be dropped from any of the date and time representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant.  For example, \"2004-05\" is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004.  This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.\n*If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a [[Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]] to the smallest time value in the representation.\n\n==Dates==\n{{ISOCALENDAR}}\nThe standard uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], which \"serves as an international standard for civil use.\"<ref>{{cite book\n |url=http://astro.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html\n |last=Doggett\n |first=L.

However, ISO calendar dates before the Convention are still compatible with the Gregorian calendar all the way back to the official introduction of the Gregorian calendar on {{nowrap|1582-10-15}}. Earlier dates, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], may be used by mutual agreement of the partners exchanging information. The standard states that every date must be consecutive, so usage of the [[Julian calendar]] would be contrary to the standard (because at the switchover date, the dates would not be consecutive).\n\n===Years===\n{| class=\"list\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| YYYY\n|-\n| \u00b1<u>Y</u>YYYY\n|}\nISO 8601 prescribes, as a minimum, a four-digit year [YYYY] to avoid the [[year 2000 problem]]. It therefore represents years from 0000 to 9999, year 0000 being equal to 1 [[Anno Domini|BC]] and all others [[AD]]. However, years prior to [[Gregorian calendar|1583]] are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead \"values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|at=section 4.1.2.1 General\n}}</ref>\n\nTo represent years before [[Year zero|0000]] or after [[Year 10,000 problem|9999]], the standard also permits the expansion of the year representation but only by prior agreement between the sender and the receiver.<ref>{{cite book |title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|quote=3.5 Expansion ...

[YYYY] indicates a four-digit year, 0000 through 9999. [MM] indicates a two-digit month of the year, 01 through 12. [DD] indicates a two-digit day of that month, 01 through 31.  For example, \"5 April 1981\" may be represented as either {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}}<ref name=isofaqtnd/> in the ''extended format'' or \"19810405\" in the ''basic format''.\n\nThe standard also allows for calendar dates to be written with reduced accuracy.<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/> For example, one may write {{nowrap|\"1981-04\"}} to mean \"1981 April\". The 2000 version allowed writing {{nowrap|\"--04-05\"}} to mean \"April 5\"<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350#section-4.3.1\n |title=RFC 6350 - vCard Format Specification\n |accessdate=2016-06-29\n |date=August 2011\n |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n |quote=Truncated representation, as specified in [ISO.8601.2000], Sections 5.2.1.3 d), e), and f), is permitted.}}</ref> but the 2004 version does not allow omitting the year when a month is present. One may simply write \"1981\" to refer to that year or \"19\" to refer to the [[century]] from 1900 to 1999 inclusive.  Although the standard allows both the {{nowrap|\"YYYY-MM-DD\"}} and YYYYMMDD formats for complete calendar date representations, if the day [DD] is omitted then only the {{nowrap|YYYY-MM}} format is allowed. By disallowing dates of the form YYYYMM, the standard avoids confusion with the [[#Truncated representations|truncated representation]] YYMMDD (still often used).\n\n===Week dates===\n{{Main|ISO week date}}\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY-Www ||''or''|| YYYYWww\n|-\n| YYYY-Www-D ||''or''|| YYYYWwwD\n|}\nWeek date representations are in the formats as shown in the adjacent box.  [YYYY] indicates the ''ISO week-numbering year'' which is slightly different from the traditional [[Gregorian calendar]] year (see below).  [Www] is the ''[[week number]]'' prefixed by the letter ''W'', from W01 through W53. [D] is the ''weekday number'', from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.\n\nThere are several mutually equivalent and compatible descriptions of week 01:\n*the week with the year's first Thursday in it (the formal ISO definition),\n*the week with 4 January in it,\n*the first week with the majority (four or more) of its days in the starting year, and\n*the week starting with the Monday in the period 29 December \u2013 4 January.\n\nAs a consequence, if 1 January is on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, it is in week 01. If 1 January is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, it is in week 52 or 53 of the previous year (there is no week 00). 28 December is always in the last week of its year.\n\nThe week number can be described by counting the Thursdays: week 12 contains the 12th Thursday of the year.\n\nThe ''ISO week-numbering year'' starts at the first day (Monday) of week 01 and ends at the Sunday before the new ISO year (hence without overlap or gap). It consists of 52 or 53 full weeks. The first ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is ending; if three, they are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  Similarly, the last ISO week of a year may have up to three days that are actually in the Gregorian calendar year that is starting; if three, they are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Thursday of each ISO week is always in the Gregorian calendar year denoted by the ISO week-numbering year.\n\nExamples:\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2008-12-29}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2008-12-29}}\"\n*{{#time: l j F Y |2010-01-03}} is written \"{{#time: o-\"W\"W-N|2010-01-03}}\"\n\n===Ordinal dates===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n| YYYY-DDD ||''or''|| YYYYDDD\n|}\n\nAn [[ordinal date]] is a simple form for occasions when the arbitrary nature of week and month definitions are more of an impediment than an aid, for instance, when comparing dates from different calendars.  As represented above, [YYYY] indicates a year. [DDD] is the day of that year, from 001 through 365 (366 in [[leap year]]s). For example, {{nowrap|\"1981-04-05\"}} is also {{nowrap|\"1981-095\"}}.\n\nThis format is used with simple hardware systems that have a need for a date system, but where including full calendar calculation software may be a significant nuisance.  This system is sometimes referred to as \"Julian Date\", but this can cause confusion with the astronomical [[Julian day]], a sequential count of the number of days since day 0 beginning {{nowrap|1 January 4713 BC}} Greenwich noon, Julian proleptic calendar (or noon on ISO date {{nowrap|\u22124713-11-24}} which uses the Gregorian proleptic calendar with a year 0000).\n\n==Times==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|hh:mm:ss.sss\n|''or''\n|hhmmss.sss\n|-\n| hh:mm:ss ||''or''|| hhmmss\n|-\n| hh:mm ||''or''|| hhmm\n|-\n| || hh ||\n|}\n\nISO 8601 uses the [[24-hour clock]] system.  The ''basic format'' is [hh][mm][ss] and the ''extended format'' is [hh]:[mm]:[ss].\n*[hh] refers to a zero-padded [[hour]] between 00 and 24 (where 24 is only used to denote midnight at the end of a calendar day).\n*[mm] refers to a zero-padded [[minute]] between 00 and 59.\n*[ss] refers to a zero-padded [[second]] between 00 and 60 (where 60 is only used to denote an added [[leap second]]).\nSo a time might appear as either \"134730\" in the ''basic format'' or \"13:47:30\" in the ''extended format''.\n\nEither the seconds, or the minutes and seconds, may be omitted from the basic or extended time formats for greater brevity but decreased accuracy; the resulting reduced accuracy time formats are:<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 4.2.2.3 Representations with reduced accuracy</ref>\n*[hh][mm] in ''basic format'' or [hh]:[mm] in ''extended format'', when seconds are omitted.\n*[hh], when both seconds and minutes are omitted.\n\n''[[Midnight]]'' is a special case and may be referred to as either \"00:00\" or \"24:00\", except in ISO 8601-1:2019 where \"24:00\" is no longer permitted. The notation \"00:00\" is used at the beginning of a calendar day and is the more frequently used. At the end of a day use \"24:00\". \"2007-04-05T24:00\" is the same instant as \"2007-04-06T00:00\" (see ''[[#Combined date and time representations|Combined date and time representations]]'' below).\n\nDecimal fractions may be added to any of the three time elements. However, a fraction may only be added to the lowest order time element in the representation. A [[decimal mark]], either a [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] or a [[full stop|dot]] (without any preference as stated in resolution 10 of the 22nd General Conference CGPM in 2003,<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2006/11/decimals-score-point-international-standards\n |title=NIST TechBeat 2006-11-22\n |accessdate=2017-09-27\n |date=2006-11-22\n |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]\n |quote=Decimals Score a Point on International Standards ...

Represent it as \"14:30,5\", \"1430,5\", \"14:30.5\", or \"1430.5\". There is no limit on the number of decimal places for the decimal fraction. However, the number of decimal places needs to be agreed to by the communicating parties. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, the [[Significant figures|precision]] of a decimal fraction is 3, i.e., \"yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss[.mmm]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190977(v=sql.90).aspx|title=ISO 8601 Format|website=technet.microsoft.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref>\n\n===Time zone designators===\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;Z\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hh:mm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hhmm\n|-\n| &lt;time&gt;\u00b1hh\n|}\n\n[[Time zone]]s in ISO 8601 are represented as local time (with the location unspecified), as [[UTC]], or as an offset from UTC.\n\nIf no UTC relation information is given with a time representation, the time is assumed to be in local time. While it ''may'' be safe to assume local time when communicating in the same time zone, it is ambiguous when used in communicating across different time zones. Even within a single geographic time zone, some local times will be ambiguous if the region observes [[daylight saving time]]. It is usually preferable to indicate a time zone (zone designator) using the standard's notation.\n\n====Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)====\nIf the time is in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], add a ''Z'' directly after the time without a space. ''Z'' is the zone designator for the zero UTC offset. \"09:30 UTC\" is therefore represented as \"09:30Z\" or \"0930Z\". \"14:45:15 UTC\" would be \"14:45:15Z\" or \"144515Z\".\n\nThe ''Z'' suffix in the ISO 8601 time representation is sometimes referred to as \"Zulu time\" because the same letter is used to designate the [[List of military time zones|Zulu time zone]]. However the ACP 121 standard that defines the list of military time zones makes no mention of UTC and derives the \"Zulu time\" from the [[Greenwich Mean Time]]<ref name=\"ACP_121_I\">{{cite web |url=https://rnzncomms.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/acp121_i_2010.pdf |title=COMMUNICATION INSTRUCTIONS GENERAL ACP 121(I) |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=October 2010 |website= |publisher=[[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] |access-date=2018-01-15 |quote=}}</ref> which was formerly used as the international civil time standard.

If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphen&ndash;minus should be used.  [[ASCII]] does not have a minus sign, so its hyphen&ndash;minus character (code is 45 decimal or 2D hexadecimal) would be used. If the character set has a minus sign, then that character should be used. [[Unicode]] has a minus sign, and its character code is U+2212 (2212 hexadecimal); the [[HTML entity|HTML character entity]] invocation is <code>&amp;minus;</code>.\n\nThe following times all refer to the same moment: \"18:30Z\", \"22:30+04\", \"1130&minus;0700\", and \"15:00&minus;03:30\". [[Nautical time]] zone letters are not used with the exception of Z. To calculate UTC time one has to subtract the offset from the local time, e.g. for \"15:00&minus;03:30\" do 15:00 &minus; (&minus;03:30) to get 18:30 UTC.\n\nAn offset of zero, in addition to having the special representation \"Z\", can also be stated numerically as \"+00:00\", \"+0000\", or \"+00\".  However, it is not permitted to state it numerically with a negative sign, as \"&minus;00:00\", \"&minus;0000\", or \"&minus;00\".  The section dictating sign usage (section 3.4.2 in the 2004 edition of the standard) states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value.  Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of \"-00\", with the same denotation as \"+00\" but a differing connotation.<ref>RFC 3339{{spaced ndash}}Unknown local offset convention</ref>\n\n==Combined date and time representations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| &lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;\n|}\n\nA single point in time can be represented by concatenating a complete date expression, the letter ''\"T\"'' as a delimiter, and a valid time expression. For example, {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T14:30\"}}. It is permitted to omit the ''\"T\"'' character by mutual agreement as in {{nowrap|\"200704051430\"}}.<ref>{{cite document\n|title=ISO 8601:2004(E)\n|date=2004-12-01\n|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n|quote=4.3.2 NOTE: By mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange, the character [T] may be omitted in applications where there is no risk of confusing a date and time of day representation with others defined in this International Standard.}}</ref>\nSeparating date and time parts with other characters such as space is not allowed in ISO 8601, but allowed in its profile RFC 3339.<ref>{{cite document\n|title=RFC 3339\n|date=2002-07-01\n|quote=5.6. NOTE: ISO 8601 defines date and time separated by \"T\". Applications using this syntax may choose, for the sake of readability, to specify a full-date and full-time separated by (say) a space character.}}</ref>\n\nIf a time zone designator is required, it follows the combined date and time. For example, {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T14:30Z\"}} or {{nowrap|\"2007-04-05T12:30-02:00\"}}.\n\nEither basic or extended formats may be used, but both date and time must use the same format. The date expression may be calendar, week, or ordinal, and must use a complete representation. The time may be represented using a specified reduced accuracy format.<ref name=AccuracyVsPrecision/>\n\n==Durations==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| PnYnMnDTnHnMnS\n|-\n| PnW\n|-\n| P&lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;\n|}\nDurations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S or P[n]W as shown to the right.  In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n].  Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties.  The capital letters ''P'', ''Y'', ''M'', ''W'', ''D'', ''T'', ''H'', ''M'', and ''S'' are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.\n\n*''P'' is the duration designator (for ''period'') placed at the start of the duration representation.\n**''Y'' is the year designator that follows the value for the number of years.\n**''M'' is the month designator that follows the value for the number of months.\n**''W'' is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.\n**''D'' is the day designator that follows the value for the number of days.\n*''T'' is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.\n**''H'' is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.\n**''M'' is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.\n**''S'' is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.\n\nFor example, \"P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S\" represents a duration of \"three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds\".\n\nDate and time elements including their designator may be omitted if their value is zero, and lower order elements may also be omitted for reduced precision. For example, \"P23DT23H\" and \"P4Y\" are both acceptable duration representations. However, at least one element must be present, thus \"P\" is not a valid representation for a duration of 0 seconds. \"PT0S\" or \"P0D\", however, are both valid and represent the same duration.\n\nTo resolve ambiguity, \"P1M\" is a one-month duration and \"PT1M\" is a one-minute duration (note the time designator, T, that precedes the time value). The smallest value used may also have a decimal fraction, as in \"P0.5Y\" to indicate half a year. This decimal fraction may be specified with either a [[comma]] or a [[full stop]], as in \"P0,5Y\" or \"P0.5Y\".  The standard does not prohibit date and time values in a duration representation from exceeding their \"carry over points\" except as noted below.  Thus, \"PT36H\" could be used as well as \"P1DT12H\" for representing the same duration. But keep in mind that \"PT36H\" is not the same as \"P1DT12H\" when switching from or to [[Daylight saving time]].\n\nAlternatively, a format for duration based on combined date and time representations may be used by agreement between the communicating parties either in the basic format PYYYYMMDDThhmmss or in the extended format {{nowrap|P[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]T[hh]:[mm]:[ss]}}.  For example, the first duration shown above would be {{nowrap|\"P0003-06-04T12:30:05\"}}.  However, individual date and time values cannot exceed their [[modular arithmetic|moduli]] (e.g. a value of 13 for the month or 25 for the hour would not be permissible).<ref>ISO 8601:2004 section 4.4.3.3 Alternative format</ref>\n\nAlthough the standard describes a duration as part of time intervals, which are discussed in the next section, the duration format (or a subset thereof) is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class.<ref>{{cite web|title=Java 8 Class Duration|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html#parse-java.lang.CharSequence-|website=Java Platform Standard Edition 8|publisher=Oracle|accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Amazon Alexa Duration|url=https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html#duration|website=Amazon Developer|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2017-10-07}}</ref>\n\n==Time intervals==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| <start>/<end>\n|-\n| <start>/<duration>\n|-\n| <duration>/<end>\n|-\n| <duration>\n|}\nA time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration (as described in the previous section).  The two time points (start and end) are expressed by either a combined date and time representation or just a date representation.\n\nThere are four ways to express a time interval:\n\n#Start and end, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Start and duration, such as \"2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"\n#Duration and end, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z\"\n#Duration only, such as \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\", with additional context information\n\nOf these, the first three require two values separated by an ''interval designator'' which is usually a solidus (more commonly referred to as a [[slash (punctuation)|forward slash]] \"/\"). Section 4.4.2 of the standard notes that: \"In certain application areas a double hyphen is used as a separator instead of a solidus.\" The standard does not define the term \"double hyphen\", but previous versions used notations like \"2000--2002\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/iso8601.html |title=Info on ISO 8601, the date and time representation standard |publisher=Cs.tut.fi |date= |accessdate=2012-08-29}}</ref> Use of a double hyphen instead of a solidus allows inclusion in computer [[filename]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hydrogold.com.au/news_2012.html#iso8601 |title=ISO 8601 - Getting with the Times (and Dates) |date=2012-01-01| publisher=Hydrogold |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> A solidus is a [[Filename#Reserved characters and words|reserved character]] and not allowed in a filename in common operating systems.\n\nFor <start>/<end> expressions, if any elements are missing from the end value, they are assumed to be the same as for the start value including the time zone. This feature of the standard allows for concise representations of time intervals.  For example, the date of a two-hour meeting including the start and finish times could be simply shown as \"2007-12-14T13:30/15:30\", where \"/15:30\" implies \"/2007-12-14T15:30\" (the same date as the start), or the beginning and end dates of a monthly billing period as \"2008-02-15/03-14\", where \"/03-14\" implies \"/2008-03-14\" (the same year as the start).\n\nIf greater precision is desirable to represent the time interval, then more time elements can be added to the representation. An interval denoted {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13/15\"}} can start at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-13}} and end at any time on {{nowrap|2007-11-15}}, whereas {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T09:00/15T17:00\"}} includes the start and end times.\nTo explicitly include all of the start and end dates, the interval would be represented as {{nowrap|\"2007-11-13T00:00/15T24:00\"}}.\n\n===Repeating intervals===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"text-align:center; width:23em\"\n|-\n| Rn/<interval>\n|-\n| R/<interval>\n|}\nRepeating intervals are specified in clause \"4.5 Recurring time interval\". They are formed by adding \"R[n]/\" to the beginning of an interval expression, where ''R'' is used as the letter itself and [n] is replaced by the number of repetitions. Leaving out the value for [n] means an unbounded number of repetitions. If the interval specifies the start (forms 1 and 2 above), then this is the start of the repeating interval. If the interval specifies the end but not the start (form 3 above), then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of \"P1Y2M10DT2H30M\" five times starting at {{nowrap|\"2008-03-01T13:00:00Z\"}}, use {{nowrap|\"R5/2008-03-01T13:00:00Z/P1Y2M10DT2H30M\"}}.\n\n==Truncated representations==\nISO 8601:2000 allowed truncation (by agreement), where leading components of a date or time are omitted. Notably, this allowed two-digit years to be used and the ambiguous formats YY-MM-DD and YYMMDD. This provision was removed in ISO 8601:2004.\n\n==Usage==\nOn the [[Internet]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) uses ISO 8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software.<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime Note about Date and Time Formats to W3C from Reuters]<!--should be XML Schema--></ref>\n\nISO 8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO 8601 is not always used. For example, the various [[electronic program guide]] standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The [[ID3]] audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO 8601.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-structure|title=ID3 tag version 2.4.0 - Main Structure|last=Nilsson|first=M.|date=2000-11-01|publisher=id3.org|pages=\u00a74|accessdate=2009-09-27}}</ref>\nThe [[X.690]] encoding standard's [[GeneralizedTime]] makes use of another subset of ISO 8601.\n\n=== Commerce ===\nThe [[ISO 8601 week date]], as of 2006, appeared in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States. Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand. The format is particularly useful for quality assurance, so that production errors can be readily traced to work weeks, and products can be correctly targeted for recall.\n\n=== RFCs ===\nRFC 3339 defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in [[Internet protocol suite|Internet protocols]] and [[Internet standard|standards]]. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the [[common era]]. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted.<ref>RFC 3339, section 5.6</ref>\n\nRFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero time zone offset to be specified as \"-00:00\", which ISO 8601 forbids.  RFC 3339 intends \"-00:00\" to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred time zone, whereas the conforming \"+00:00\" or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred.  This convention regarding \"-00:00\" is derived from earlier RFCs, such as [[RFC 2822]] which uses it for timestamps in [[email]] headers.  RFC 2822 made no claim that any part of its timestamp format conforms to ISO 8601, and so was free to use this convention without conflict.\n\n=== Adoption as national standards ===\n<!-- If possible, please specify revisions and release dates as well. In order to establish some chronology, older standards can be listed as well, but only if they were related to ISO 8601 already. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Australia \n| AS ISO 8601-2007\n|-\n!

The tour was his last outing in the 1980s.\n\n==History==\nAlthough the tour was a huge success in terms of reviews and audience numbers (most shows were sellouts), it lost money due to the high production costs incurred with transportation, only breaking even by its final leg in Japan in early 1989. Prince used a number of elaborate props on the moving, multi-tiered stage such as a [[basketball]] hoop, a [[fountain]], [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] fences and a full-scale replica of his [[Ford Thunderbird]] automobile.\n[[File:Prince LoveSexy Tour Vest (Paradise, Nevada).jpg|thumb|Costume worn by Prince during the Lovesexy Tour]]\nThe two-hour show included most songs from the ''[[Lovesexy]]'' album, alongside well-known hits and rarer material. In usual Prince fashion, many shows saw the premiere of entirely new songs, particularly \"Blues in C (If I Had a Harem)\".\n\nThematically, the show was divided into two very distinct main acts with the themes of light and dark. Act One, which ran for an hour, consisted mainly of older material from Prince's earlier albums, often strung together into medley form to ease time constraints. The show often began with \"Escape\" before segueing into \"[[Erotic City]]\" and concluded with \"Anna Stesia\". Act Two consisted largely of songs from ''[[Lovesexy]]'', plus classic hits such as \"[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]\" and towards the end of the concert, \"[[Let's Go Crazy]]\", \"[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]\", and \"[[1999 (Prince song)|1999]]\". The highlight of many shows was the piano medley in the second act, often featuring \"When 2 R in Love\", \"Venus de Milo\", \"Starfish and Coffee\", \"[[Raspberry Beret]]\", and \"Condition of the Heart\".\n\n==The band==\n* [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] \u2013 vocals, piano, guitar, whatever\n* [[Miko Weaver]] \u2013 guitar and vocals\n* [[Levi Seacer, Jr.]] \u2013 bass guitar and vocals\n* [[Doctor Fink]] \u2013 keyboards and vocals\n* [[Boni Boyer]] \u2013 keyboards, organ and vocals\n* [[Sheila E.]] \u2013 drums, percussion and vocals\n* [[Eric Leeds]] \u2013 saxophone\n* [[Atlanta Bliss]] \u2013 trumpet\n* [[Cat Glover|Cat]] \u2013 dance arrangements and vocals\n\nThis post-Revolution line-up was the same that had supported the [[Sign \u262e' the Times Tour]]. At the conclusion of the tour, the band was rearranged with the departures of Boni Boyer and Cat, along with Sheila E. New drummer [[Michael Bland]] was hired from Dr. Mambo's Combo from [[Minneapolis]], [[Rosie Gaines]] took over keyboards and backup vocal duties, and a trio of dancers known as the Game Boyz were added. The [[horn section]] was dropped altogether.\n\n[[Susannah Melvoin]], [[Wendy and Lisa]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Jill Jones]], Tony Le Mans, [[Tony! Toni!

The tour was his last outing in the 1980s.\n\n==History==\nAlthough the tour was a huge success in terms of reviews and audience numbers (most shows were sellouts), it lost money due to the high production costs incurred with transportation, only breaking even by its final leg in Japan in early 1989. Prince used a number of elaborate props on the moving, multi-tiered stage such as a [[basketball]] hoop, a [[fountain]], [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] fences and a full-scale replica of his [[Ford Thunderbird]] automobile.\n[[File:Prince LoveSexy Tour Vest (Paradise, Nevada).jpg|thumb|Costume worn by Prince during the Lovesexy Tour]]\nThe two-hour show included most songs from the ''[[Lovesexy]]'' album, alongside well-known hits and rarer material. In usual Prince fashion, many shows saw the premiere of entirely new songs, particularly \"Blues in C (If I Had a Harem)\".\n\nThematically, the show was divided into two very distinct main acts with the themes of light and dark. Act One, which ran for an hour, consisted mainly of older material from Prince's earlier albums, often strung together into medley form to ease time constraints. The show often began with \"Escape\" before segueing into \"[[Erotic City]]\" and concluded with \"Anna Stesia\". Act Two consisted largely of songs from ''[[Lovesexy]]'', plus classic hits such as \"[[Kiss (Prince song)|Kiss]]\" and towards the end of the concert, \"[[Let's Go Crazy]]\", \"[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]\", and \"[[1999 (Prince song)|1999]]\". The highlight of many shows was the piano medley in the second act, often featuring \"When 2 R in Love\", \"Venus de Milo\", \"Starfish and Coffee\", \"[[Raspberry Beret]]\", and \"Condition of the Heart\".\n\n==The band==\n* [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] \u2013 vocals, piano, guitar, whatever\n* [[Miko Weaver]] \u2013 guitar and vocals\n* [[Levi Seacer, Jr.]] \u2013 bass guitar and vocals\n* [[Doctor Fink]] \u2013 keyboards and vocals\n* [[Boni Boyer]] \u2013 keyboards, organ and vocals\n* [[Sheila E.]] \u2013 drums, percussion and vocals\n* [[Eric Leeds]] \u2013 saxophone\n* [[Atlanta Bliss]] \u2013 trumpet\n* [[Cat Glover|Cat]] \u2013 dance arrangements and vocals\n\nThis post-Revolution line-up was the same that had supported the [[Sign \u262e' the Times Tour]]. At the conclusion of the tour, the band was rearranged with the departures of Boni Boyer and Cat, along with Sheila E. New drummer [[Michael Bland]] was hired from Dr. Mambo's Combo from [[Minneapolis]], [[Rosie Gaines]] took over keyboards and backup vocal duties, and a trio of dancers known as the Game Boyz were added. The [[horn section]] was dropped altogether.\n\n[[Susannah Melvoin]], [[Wendy and Lisa]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Mavis Staples]], [[Jill Jones]], Tony Le Mans, [[Tony! Toni! Ton\u00e9!]], [[Patti LaBelle]] were guest performers at the Bloomington, Hampton, and Philadelphia concerts.\n\n==Set list==\nThe following set list is from the July 16, 1998 show in Milan, Italy.

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault [[Siege of Nicaea|captured Nicea]] in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians. The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders' is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], but in the 7th to 8th centuries, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] from the predominantly Christian Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}.</ref> In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed and a number of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the [[Aghlabids]], who attacked [[Italy]] in the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]], and the [[Principality of Catalonia]] began to battle various Muslim kingdoms for control of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], exemplified by the [[Mahdia campaign of 1087]] and battles at [[Majorca]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref>[[H. E. J. Cowdrey]] (1977), \"The Mahdia campaign of 1087\" ''[[The English Historical Review]]'' '''92''', pp.&nbsp;1\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Situation in Europe===\n\nEarly Christians used to the use of violence for communal purposes.  A Christian theology of war inevitably evolved from when [[Roman citizenship]] and Christianity  became linked. Citizens were required to fight against the Empire's enemies. Dating from the works of the 4th-century [[Christian theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] a doctrine of [[holy war]] developed. Augustine wrote that an aggressive war was sinful, but a \"[[Just war theory|just war]]\" could be rationalised if proclaimed by a legitimate authority such as a king or bishop, it was defensive or for the recovery of lands, and a it did not involve excessive violence.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012||pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in Western Europe created a warriors caste who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref> Violent acts were commonly used for dispute resolution , and the papacy attempted to mitigate it.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201331}} Historians, such as [[Carl Erdmann]], believed that the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements restricted conflict between Christians from the 10th{{nbsp}}century and the influence of these is apparent in [[Pope Urban II]]'s speeches. But later historians, such as Marcus Bull, assert that the movements' effectiveness were limited and had died out completely by the time of the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\n[[Pope Alexander II]] developed recruitment systems via oaths for military resourcing that [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] further extended across Europe. {{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} These were deployed by the Church in the Christian conflicts with Muslims during in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in [[Norman conquest of Sicily|campaign]] against the [[Emirate of Sicily]]{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=18\u201319, 289}} Gregory&nbsp;VII went further in 1074,  planning a display of military power to reinforce the principle of papal sovereignty in a holy war supporting Byzantium against the Seljuks, but was unable to build support for this.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=16}} Theologian [[Anselm of Lucca]] took the decisive step towards an authentic crusader ideology, stating that fighting for legitimate purposes could result in the remission of [[Christian views on sin|sins]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n[[File:Al_Andalus_&_Christian_Kingdoms.png|thumb|upright=|Islamic rule: Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms {{circa}}&nbsp;1000|alt=Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms circa the year 1000]]On the [[Iberian Peninsula]] there was no significant Christian polity. The Christian realms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] lacked a common identity and shared history based on tribe or ethnicity so they frequently united and divided during the 11th and 12th centuries. Although small, all developed an aristocratic military technique and in 1031 the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain created the opportunity for the territorial gains that later became known as the [[Reconquista]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=183\u2013184}} In 1063 [[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII of Aquitaine]] led a combined force of French, [[Aragon]]ese and [[Catalan]] knights to take the city of [[[[Crusade of Barbastro|Barbastro]] that had been in Muslim hands since the year 711. This had the full support of [[Pope Alexander II]], a [[Truce of God]] was declared in Catalonia and indulgances were granted to the participants. It was a holy war but differed from the First Crusade as there was no pilgrimage, no vow and no formal authorisation by the church.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=206}} Shortly before the First Crusade, Pope Urban II had encouraged the Iberian Christians to take [[Tarragona]], using much of the same symbolism and rhetoric that was later used to preach the crusade to the people of Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Italo-Normans]] were successful in seizing much of Southern Italy and Sicily from the Byzantines and North African Arabs in the decades before the First Crusade.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}}. This brought them into conflict with the Papacy leading to a campaign against them by [[Pope Leo IX]] who they deteated at [[Battle of Civitate|Civitate]], although when they invaded Muslim Sicily in 1059 they did so under a papal banner: the {{lang|la|lnvexillum sancti Petri}} or banner of St Peter.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=307}} [[Robert Guiscard]] captured the Byzantine city of [[Bari]] in 1071 and campaigned along the Eastern [[Adriatic]] coast around [[Dyrrachium]] in 1081 and 1085. {{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=46}}\n\n===Situation in the East===\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|350px|thumb|The Byzantine empire had lost control over most of [[Anatolia]] in the decade following the disastrous [[Battle of Manzikert]].]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Roman Catholic churches were in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism]] from 1054. Historians have argued that the desire to impose Roman church authority in the east may have been one of the goals of the crusade,<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}</ref> although Urban II, who launched the First Crusade, never refers to such a goal in his letters on crusading. The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan. A dramatic collapse of the empire's position on the eve of the Council of Clermont brought Byzantium to the brink of disaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=57\u201371}}</ref> By the mid-1090s, the Byzantine Empire was largely confined to Balkan Europe and the northwestern fringe of Anatolia, and faced Norman enemies in the west as well as Turks in the east.<ref name=\"treadgold\">{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=8 Graph 1}}</ref>  The reason for this was that while the defeat at Manzikert was shocking, it had limited significance and did not lead to major difficulties for the Byzantine empire, at least in the short term.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=97\u201399}}</ref>\n\nMalik-Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum]] by [[Kilij Arslan I]], and in Syria by his brother [[Tutush I]], who died in 1095. Tutush's sons [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] and [[Duqaq]] inherited [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] respectively, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other, as well as [[Kerbogha]], the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holt|1989|pp=11, 14\u201315}}.</ref>\n\nEgypt and much of Palestine were controlled by the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid Caliphate]], which was significantly smaller since the arrival of the Seljuqs. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of [[caliph]] [[al-Musta'li]] but actually controlled by [[vizier]] [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]], had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076);<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=410, 411 note 61}}.</ref> they recaptured it in 1098 from the [[Artuqids]], a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before the arrival of the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Holt|1989|pp=11\u201314}}.</ref>\n\nFrom 1092 the status quo in the Middle East disintegrated following the death of the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This was closely followed by the deaths of the Seljuk Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]]. The Islamic historian [[Carole Hillenbrand]] has described this as analogous to the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 with the phrase \"familiar political entities gave way to disorientation and disunity\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=33}} The confusion and division meant the Islamic world disregarded the world beyond; this made it vulnerable to, and surprised by, the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=41}}\n\n==Council of Clermont==\n\n{{Main|Council of Clermont}}\n\n[[File:CouncilofClermont.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, it has been argued that Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=8}}.</ref> According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of ''[[Deus vult]]!''

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\nLacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref> \n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch.

Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dieing of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders.

He expelled all of Jerusalem's Christian inhabitants, to avoid the possibility of the city falling due to treason from the inside, and he poisoned most of the wells in the area and Christians were expelled from Jerusalem before the Crusaders' arrival.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=33}} The crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before, on 7 June.

Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious candidate to establish an ecclesiastical realm the clergy contended. Raymond of Toulouse's support had waned since Arqa so Godfrey accepted the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}} The exact nature and meaning of Godfrey's title is somewhat controversial. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (\"advocate\" or \"defender\" of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term ''princeps'', or simply retained his title of ''dux'' from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\".<ref>William of Tyre, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/9.html#9 Book 9, Chapter 9].</ref> [[Robert the Monk]] is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title \"king\".<ref>Riley-Smith (1979), \"The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon\", ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' '''52''', pp. 83\u201386.</ref><ref>Murray, Alan V.

Geoffrey and Raymond marched out to meet this force on 9 August to prevent being besieged with a force of only 1,200 knights and 9,000 foot soldiers. Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond. The city remained in Muslim hands and a military threat to the nascent kingdom.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[crusader states]] after the First Crusade]]\n{{see|Crusader states|Kingdom of Jerusalem|Knights Hospitaller|Knights Templar| Crusade of 1101|Second Crusade}}\n\nThe First Crusade succeeded in establishing the \"[[crusader states]]\" of Edessa, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Tripoli in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Syria (as well as allies along the Crusaders' route, such as the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]).\n\n[[File:Crusade of 1101 v1.svg|right|200px|thumb|A map of western [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the [[Crusade of 1101]]]]\nHowever, there were many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When the success of the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=35}}</ref> Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to [[Fulcher of Chartres]], there were only a few hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=161}}.</ref> Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title [[List of kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]].\nAmong the crusaders in the [[Crusade of 1101]] were [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]], both of whom had returned home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Seljuqs]], but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Lock142\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=142\u2013144}}</ref>.\n\nBack at home in Western Europe, those who had survived to reach Jerusalem were treated as heroes. Robert of Flanders was nicknamed \"Hierosolymitanus\" (Robert ''of Jerusalem'')<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierosolymitanus Wiktionary: hierosolymitanus]</ref> thanks to his exploits. The life of Godfrey of Bouillon became legendary even within a few years of his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=379\u2013380}}.</ref> In some cases, the political situation at home was greatly affected by crusader absences. For instance, while Robert Curthose was away on crusade the throne of England had passed to his brother [[Henry I of England]] instead, and their resultant conflict led to the [[Battle of Tinchebray]] in 1106.<ref>{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the establishment of the crusader states in the east helped ease Seljuq pressure on the Byzantine Empire, which had regained some of its Anatolian territory with crusader help, and experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity in the 12th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=404\u2013405}}.</ref> The effect on the Muslim dynasties of the east was gradual but important. In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states. Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders,<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=443\u2013447}}.</ref> culminating in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recapture]] of Jerusalem under [[Saladin]] later in the century when the [[Ayyubid]]s had united the surrounding areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=616\u2013620}}.</ref>\n\nThe success of the crusade inspired the literary imagination of poets in France, who, in the 12th century, began to compose various ''[[chansons de geste]]'' celebrating the exploits of Godfrey of Bouillon and other crusaders. Some of these, such as the [[Chanson d'Antioche]], are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to the legend of the [[Knight of the Swan]]. Together, the ''chansons'' are known as the [[crusade cycle]].<ref>Edgington, Susan B., \"Albert of Aachen and the Chansons de Geste\", ''The Crusades and their Sources: Essays Presented to Bernard Hamilton'', pp. 23\u201337.</ref>\n\n==Historiographical debate==\n{{see|Historiography of the Crusades}}\n[[File:Armenian Colophon of 1099.jpg|thumb|250px|The first known mention of the Frankish conquest of Jerusalem, in an Armenian colophon written in 1099.<ref>[[Robert W.

Following the [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat]] at [[Malazgirt|Manzikert]] in 1071, Muslims had taken half of the Byzantine Empire's territory, and such strategically and religiously important cities as Antioch and Nicaea had only fallen to Muslims in the decade before the [[Council of Piacenza]].<ref name=\"treadgold\" /> Moreover, the harrowing accounts of the atrocities committed by the invaders against the Anatolian population recorded by Eastern Christian chroniclers such as [[John Skylitzes]], [[Michael Attaleiates]], [[Matthew of Edessa]], Michael the Syrian and others (summarized Vryonis 1971) align with the primary motivation of relieving the acute distress suffered by the Byzantine empire.\nIn addition, the early 11th century saw a worsening of Muslim-Christian relations in the Levant; for example, in 1009 the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been [[Destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre 1009|destroyed]] by the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]; [[Pope Sergius IV]] had supposedly already called for a military expedition in response to this.<ref>\nThe bull attributed to Sergius was considered genuine by Erdmann (1935), but its authenticity was later called into question. Aleksander Gieysztor ({{year needed|date=December 2017}}) suggested that it was a forgery dating to after the First Crusade, while Hans Martin Schaller ({{year needed|date=December 2017}}) has again argued forcefully for the document's authenticity.</ref> Even more recently, in the [[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064\u20131065]], pilgrims had continued to be harassed.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=10\u201312}}.</ref>> Therefore, the liberation of Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre is presented as the main motivation of the crusaders by contemporary historiographers more than providing military aid to the Byzantin emperor against the Seljuq onslaught.<ref name=\"Mill's History\">{{cite book|author=Charles Mills|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbc2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA504|title=The Eclectic Review|issue=13|chapter=Mill's History of the Crusades|date=June 1820}}</ref>\n\nThis situation of multiple possible causes or motivations for the crusades has led to extended debates in modern historiography. A theory proposed by [[Carl Erdmann]] (1935), known as the \"Erdmann thesis\", links the First Crusade l to the [[Gregorian Reform]], the series of reforms initiated by [[Pope Gregory VII]] during c. 1050\u201380. These reforms re-established the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], which had been [[Saeculum obscurum|much weakened]] during the 10th century, as a relevant power able to inspire and co-ordinate the crusades.<ref>Erdmann (1935), ''Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens''. Translated into English as ''The Origin of the Idea of Crusade'' by Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart in 1977.</ref> \nThe \"Erdmann thesis\" proposes that the strengthened Western Church, combined with the weakened Byzantine Empire, permitted a projection of power from west to east, with the actual conquest of Jerusalem figuring at best as a secondary, popular goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nWhile it is clear that the motivations for and causes of the First Crusade are to be sought both in the East and in the West, there has still been much debate among historiographers of the later 20th century on how the relative impact of such causes should be weighed.\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nIn a similar vein, [[Thomas Asbridge]] (2004) argues that the First Crusade was a strategic attempt to expand the power of the Western Church, and reunite the churches of Rome and Constantinople, which had been in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism since 1054]]. According to this view, the Islamic conquests were of little importance in this, as \"Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}; for Urban's personal motives, see pp.&nbsp;19\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, historians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref>\nSimilarly, [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}; for details on the Seljuq occupation of Palestine, see pp.&nbsp;410\u2013420.</ref> Indeed, drawing upon earlier writers such as Ignatius of Melitene, [[Michael the Syrian]] had recorded that the Seljuqs subjected Coele-Syria and the Palestinian coast to \"cruel destruction and pillage\".<ref>''Chronique de Michel le Syrien'', pp.&nbsp;170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas F. Madden]] represents a view almost diametrically opposed to that of Asbridge; while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform and attempts to assert papal authority, he argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n \n[[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref>\n\nIn the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. \nThe appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan\nfurther argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Commons category|First Crusade}}\n\n* [[Christian Forces of the First Crusades]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Godfrey of Bouillon]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Hugh the Great]]\n** [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|The Crusader Army of Robert Curthose]]\n* [[Second Crusade]]\n* [[Battle of Civetot]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Baldwin |first=Marshall W. |title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin |year=1969 |url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.CrusOne |isbn=978-0-299-04834-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|978-1-78093-767-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92914-8|ref=harv}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault [[Siege of Nicaea|captured Nicea]] in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians. The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders' is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], but in the 7th to 8th centuries, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] from the predominantly Christian Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}.</ref> In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed and a number of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the [[Aghlabids]], who attacked [[Italy]] in the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]], and the [[Principality of Catalonia]] began to battle various Muslim kingdoms for control of the [[Mediterranean Basin]], exemplified by the [[Mahdia campaign of 1087]] and battles at [[Majorca]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref>[[H. E. J. Cowdrey]] (1977), \"The Mahdia campaign of 1087\" ''[[The English Historical Review]]'' '''92''', pp.&nbsp;1\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Situation in Europe===\n\nEarly Christians used to the use of violence for communal purposes.  A Christian theology of war inevitably evolved from when [[Roman citizenship]] and Christianity  became linked. Citizens were required to fight against the Empire's enemies. Dating from the works of the 4th-century [[Christian theology|theologian]] [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] a doctrine of [[holy war]] developed. Augustine wrote that an aggressive war was sinful, but a \"[[Just war theory|just war]]\" could be rationalised if proclaimed by a legitimate authority such as a king or bishop, it was defensive or for the recovery of lands, and a it did not involve excessive violence.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=14\u201315}}{{sfn|Asbridge|2012||pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in Western Europe created a warriors caste who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref> Violent acts were commonly used for dispute resolution , and the papacy attempted to mitigate it.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201331}} Historians, such as [[Carl Erdmann]], believed that the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements restricted conflict between Christians from the 10th{{nbsp}}century and the influence of these is apparent in [[Pope Urban II]]'s speeches. But later historians, such as Marcus Bull, assert that the movements' effectiveness were limited and had died out completely by the time of the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\n[[Pope Alexander II]] developed recruitment systems via oaths for military resourcing that [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] further extended across Europe. {{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} These were deployed by the Church in the Christian conflicts with Muslims during in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and in [[Norman conquest of Sicily|campaign]] against the [[Emirate of Sicily]]{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=18\u201319, 289}} Gregory&nbsp;VII went further in 1074,  planning a display of military power to reinforce the principle of papal sovereignty in a holy war supporting Byzantium against the Seljuks, but was unable to build support for this.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=16}} Theologian [[Anselm of Lucca]] took the decisive step towards an authentic crusader ideology, stating that fighting for legitimate purposes could result in the remission of [[Christian views on sin|sins]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n[[File:Al Andalus & .png|thumb|upright=|Islamic rule: Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms {{circa}}&nbsp;1000|alt=Map of [[al-Andalus]] and the Iberian Christian Kingdoms circa the year 1000]]On the [[Iberian Peninsula]] there was no significant Christian polity. The Christian realms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]] lacked a common identity and shared history based on tribe or ethnicity so they frequently united and divided during the 11th and 12th centuries. Although small, all developed an aristocratic military technique and in 1031 the disintegration of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in southern Spain created the opportunity for the territorial gains that later became known as the [[Reconquista]].{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=183\u2013184}} In 1063 [[William VIII, Duke of Aquitaine|William VIII of Aquitaine]] led a combined force of French, [[Aragon]]ese and [[Catalan]] knights to take the city of [[[[Crusade of Barbastro|Barbastro]] that had been in Muslim hands since the year 711. This had the full support of [[Pope Alexander II]], a [[Truce of God]] was declared in Catalonia and indulgances were granted to the participants. It was a holy war but differed from the First Crusade as there was no pilgrimage, no vow and no formal authorisation by the church.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=206}} Shortly before the First Crusade, Pope Urban II had encouraged the Iberian Christians to take [[Tarragona]], using much of the same symbolism and rhetoric that was later used to preach the crusade to the people of Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Italo-Normans]] were successful in seizing much of Southern Italy and Sicily from the Byzantines and North African Arabs in the decades before the First Crusade.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=8}}. This brought them into conflict with the Papacy leading to a campaign against them by [[Pope Leo IX]] who they deteated at [[Battle of Civitate|Civitate]], although when they invaded Muslim Sicily in 1059 they did so under a papal banner: the {{lang|lnvexillum sancti Petri}} or banner of St Peter.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=307}} [[Robert Guiscard]] captured the Byzantine city of [[Bari]] in 1071 and campaigned along the Eastern [[Adriatic]] coast around [[Dyrrachium]] in 1081 and 1085. {{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=46}}\n\n===Situation in the East===\n{{Main|Byzantine\u2013Seljuq wars}}\n[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.png|350px|thumb|The Byzantine empire had lost control over most of [[Anatolia]] in the decade following the disastrous [[Battle of Manzikert]].]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Roman Catholic churches were in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism]] from 1054. Historians have argued that the desire to impose Roman church authority in the east may have been one of the goals of the crusade,<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}</ref> although Urban II, who launched the First Crusade, never refers to such a goal in his letters on crusading. The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan. A dramatic collapse of the empire's position on the eve of the Council of Clermont brought Byzantium to the brink of disaster.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=57\u201371}}</ref> By the mid-1090s, the Byzantine Empire was largely confined to Balkan Europe and the northwestern fringe of Anatolia, and faced Norman enemies in the west as well as Turks in the east.<ref name=\"treadgold\">{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=8 Graph 1}}</ref>  The reason for this was that while the defeat at Manzikert was shocking, it had limited significance and did not lead to major difficulties for the Byzantine empire, at least in the short term.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=97\u201399}}</ref>\n\nMalik-Shah was succeeded in the Anatolian [[Sultanate of Rum]] by [[Kilij Arslan I]], and in Syria by his brother [[Tutush I]], who died in 1095. Tutush's sons [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] and [[Duqaq]] inherited [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] respectively, further dividing Syria amongst emirs antagonistic towards each other, as well as [[Kerbogha]], the [[atabeg]] of [[Mosul]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holt|1989|pp=11, 14\u201315}}.</ref>\n\nEgypt and much of Palestine were controlled by the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid Caliphate]], which was significantly smaller since the arrival of the Seljuqs. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of [[caliph]] [[al-Musta'li]] but actually controlled by [[vizier]] [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]], had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076);<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=410, 411 note 61}}.</ref> they recaptured it in 1098 from the [[Artuqids]], a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before the arrival of the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Holt|1989|pp=11\u201314}}.</ref>\n\nFrom 1092 the status quo in the Middle East disintegrated following the death of the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]]. This was closely followed by the deaths of the Seljuk Sultan [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] and the Fatimid khalif, [[Al-Mustansir Billah]]. The Islamic historian [[Carole Hillenbrand]] has described this as analogous to the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]] in 1989 with the phrase \"familiar political entities gave way to disorientation and disunity\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1999|p=33}} The confusion and division meant the Islamic world disregarded the world beyond; this made it vulnerable to, and surprised by, the First Crusade.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=41}}\n\n==Council of Clermont==\n\n{{Main|Council of Clermont}}\n\n[[File:CouncilofClermont.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Pope Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, it has been argued that Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=8}}.</ref> According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of ''[[Deus vult]]!''

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\nLacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref> \n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch. The soldiers on the ground, armed for battle, are stopping and watching Bohemond.]]\n\nThe crusader army, meanwhile, marched on to [[Antioch]], which lay about halfway between Constantinople and Jerusalem. Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dieing of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders. Finally, at the beginning of 1099, the march restarted, leaving Bohemond behind as the first Prince of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\n===Continued march to Jerusalem===\n{{main|First Crusade: March down the Mediterranean coast}}\n[[File:Byzantium after the First crusade.PNG|thumb|300px|Route of the First Crusade through Asia]]\n\nProceeding down the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, the crusaders encountered little resistance, as local rulers preferred to make peace with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception of the abandoned [[siege of Arqa]].<ref name=\"Tyerman150\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=150}}.</ref>\n\n[[Iftikhar ad-Daula]], the Fatimid governor of Jerusalem, was aware of the arrival of the Crusaders.  He expelled all of Jerusalem's Christian inhabitants, to avoid the possibility of the city falling due to treason from the inside, and he poisoned most of the wells in the area and Christians were expelled from Jerusalem before the Crusaders' arrival.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=33}} The crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before, on 7 June. Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=153\u2013157}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Jerusalem===\n{{Main|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)}}\n\nCrusaders' arrival at Jerusalem revealed an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious candidate to establish an ecclesiastical realm the clergy contended. Raymond of Toulouse's support had waned since Arqa so Godfrey accepted the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}} The exact nature and meaning of Godfrey's title is somewhat controversial. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (\"advocate\" or \"defender\" of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term ''princeps'', or simply retained his title of ''dux'' from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\".<ref>William of Tyre, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/9.html#9 Book 9, Chapter 9].</ref> [[Robert the Monk]] is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title \"king\".<ref>Riley-Smith (1979), \"The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon\", ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' '''52''', pp. 83\u201386.</ref><ref>Murray, Alan V.

Geoffrey and Raymond marched out to meet this force on 9 August to prevent being besieged with a force of only 1,200 knights and 9,000 foot soldiers. Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond. The city remained in Muslim hands and a military threat to the nascent kingdom.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath and legacy==\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[crusader states]] after the First Crusade]]\n{{see|Crusader states|Kingdom of Jerusalem|Knights Hospitaller|Knights Templar| Crusade of 1101|Second Crusade}}\n\nThe First Crusade succeeded in establishing the \"[[crusader states]]\" of Edessa, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Tripoli in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and Syria (as well as allies along the Crusaders' route, such as the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]).\n\n[[File:Crusade of 1101 v1.svg|right|200px|thumb|A map of western [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], showing the routes taken by Christian armies during the [[Crusade of 1101]]]]\nHowever, there were many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When the success of the crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=35}}</ref> Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to [[Fulcher of Chartres]], there were only a few hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=161}}.</ref> Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title [[List of kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]].\nAmong the crusaders in the [[Crusade of 1101]] were [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois|Hugh of Vermandois]], both of whom had returned home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Seljuqs]], but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Lock142\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=142\u2013144}}</ref>.\n\nBack at home in Western Europe, those who had survived to reach Jerusalem were treated as heroes. Robert of Flanders was nicknamed \"Hierosolymitanus\" (Robert ''of Jerusalem'')<ref>[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierosolymitanus Wiktionary: hierosolymitanus]</ref> thanks to his exploits. The life of Godfrey of Bouillon became legendary even within a few years of his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=379\u2013380}}.</ref> In some cases, the political situation at home was greatly affected by crusader absences. For instance, while Robert Curthose was away on crusade the throne of England had passed to his brother [[Henry I of England]] instead, and their resultant conflict led to the [[Battle of Tinchebray]] in 1106.<ref>{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=176\u2013177}}.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the establishment of the crusader states in the east helped ease Seljuq pressure on the Byzantine Empire, which had regained some of its Anatolian territory with crusader help, and experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity in the 12th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=404\u2013405}}.</ref> The effect on the Muslim dynasties of the east was gradual but important. In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states. Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders,<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=443\u2013447}}.</ref> culminating in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recapture]] of Jerusalem under [[Saladin]] later in the century when the [[Ayyubid]]s had united the surrounding areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=616\u2013620}}.</ref>\n\nThe success of the crusade inspired the literary imagination of poets in France, who, in the 12th century, began to compose various ''[[chansons de geste]]'' celebrating the exploits of Godfrey of Bouillon and other crusaders. Some of these, such as the [[Chanson d'Antioche]], are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to the legend of the [[Knight of the Swan]]. Together, the ''chansons'' are known as the [[crusade cycle]].<ref>Edgington, Susan B., \"Albert of Aachen and the Chansons de Geste\", ''The Crusades and their Sources: Essays Presented to Bernard Hamilton'', pp. 23\u201337.</ref>\n\n==Historiographical debate==\n{{see|Historiography of the Crusades}}\n[[File:Armenian Colophon of 1099.jpg|thumb|250px|The first known mention of the Frankish conquest of Jerusalem, in an Armenian colophon written in 1099.<ref>[[Robert W.

Following the [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat]] at [[Malazgirt|Manzikert]] in 1071, Muslims had taken half of the Byzantine Empire's territory, and such strategically and religiously important cities as Antioch and Nicaea had only fallen to Muslims in the decade before the [[Council of Piacenza]].<ref name=\"treadgold\" /> Moreover, the harrowing accounts of the atrocities committed by the invaders against the Anatolian population recorded by Eastern Christian chroniclers such as [[John Skylitzes]], [[Michael Attaleiates]], [[Matthew of Edessa]], Michael the Syrian and others (summarized Vryonis 1971) align with the primary motivation of relieving the acute distress suffered by the Byzantine empire.\nIn addition, the early 11th century saw a worsening of Muslim-Christian relations in the Levant; for example, in 1009 the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been [[Destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre 1009|destroyed]] by the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]; [[Pope Sergius IV]] had supposedly already called for a military expedition in response to this.<ref>\nThe bull attributed to Sergius was considered genuine by Erdmann (1935), but its authenticity was later called into question. Aleksander Gieysztor ({{year needed|date=December 2017}}) suggested that it was a forgery dating to after the First Crusade, while Hans Martin Schaller ({{year needed|date=December 2017}}) has again argued forcefully for the document's authenticity.</ref> Even more recently, in the [[Great German Pilgrimage of 1064\u20131065]], pilgrims had continued to be harassed.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=10\u201312}}.</ref>> Therefore, the liberation of Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre is presented as the main motivation of the crusaders by contemporary historiographers more than providing military aid to the Byzantin emperor against the Seljuq onslaught.<ref name=\"Mill's History\">{{cite book|author=Charles Mills|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nbc2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA504|title=The Eclectic Review|issue=13|chapter=Mill's History of the Crusades|date=June 1820}}</ref>\n\nThis situation of multiple possible causes or motivations for the crusades has led to extended debates in modern historiography. A theory proposed by [[Carl Erdmann]] (1935), known as the \"Erdmann thesis\", links the First Crusade l to the [[Gregorian Reform]], the series of reforms initiated by [[Pope Gregory VII]] during c. 1050\u201380. These reforms re-established the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], which had been [[Saeculum obscurum|much weakened]] during the 10th century, as a relevant power able to inspire and co-ordinate the crusades.<ref>Erdmann (1935), ''Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens''. Translated into English as ''The Origin of the Idea of Crusade'' by Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart in 1977.</ref> \nThe \"Erdmann thesis\" proposes that the strengthened Western Church, combined with the weakened Byzantine Empire, permitted a projection of power from west to east, with the actual conquest of Jerusalem figuring at best as a secondary, popular goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nWhile it is clear that the motivations for and causes of the First Crusade are to be sought both in the East and in the West, there has still been much debate among historiographers of the later 20th century on how the relative impact of such causes should be weighed.\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nIn a similar vein, [[Thomas Asbridge]] (2004) argues that the First Crusade was a strategic attempt to expand the power of the Western Church, and reunite the churches of Rome and Constantinople, which had been in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism since 1054]]. According to this view, the Islamic conquests were of little importance in this, as \"Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}; for Urban's personal motives, see pp.&nbsp;19\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, historians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref>\nSimilarly, [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}; for details on the Seljuq occupation of Palestine, see pp.&nbsp;410\u2013420.</ref> Indeed, drawing upon earlier writers such as Ignatius of Melitene, [[Michael the Syrian]] had recorded that the Seljuqs subjected Coele-Syria and the Palestinian coast to \"cruel destruction and pillage\".<ref>''Chronique de Michel le Syrien'', pp.&nbsp;170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas F. Madden]] represents a view almost diametrically opposed to that of Asbridge; while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform and attempts to assert papal authority, he argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n \n[[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref>\n\nIn the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. \nThe appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire.

That year, Ewing led the Hoyas to their second Big East Tournament title in school history, and a No. 1 seed in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]].  In the tournament, the Hoyas advanced to their first Final Four since 1943, where they defeated the [[University of Louisville]] 50-46, to set up a showdown in the NCAA Final against the [[University of North Carolina]].

In his four years as a player at Georgetown, Ewing led the Hoyas to three Big East championships, three Final Fours, and the 1984 National Championship.  Prior to taking over as the program's head coach, Ewing had spent the previous thirteen years as an assistant coach in the NBA, working for four different franchises under the tutelage of coaches such as [[Jeff Van Gundy]], [[Stan Van Gundy]], and [[Steve Clifford]].\n\nIn [[2017\u201318 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|2017-2018]], Georgetown finished with a 15-15 record and 5-13 in the Big East.  The Hoyas won the first eight games of Ewing's tenure, and finished their non-conference schedule with a 10-1 record, with their only blemish coming at the hands of [[2017\u201318 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] (79-86 in overtime) at [[Capital One Arena]] in Washington, D.C.  Georgetown wound up playing a total of five overtime games during the year, but only went 1-4 in those contests.  The season ended with a 77-88 loss to [[2017\u201318 St. John's Red Storm men's basketball team|St. John's]] in the first round of the [[2018 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Tournament]].

Signature wins included an 85-73 win against No. 17 [[2018\u201319 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]], the defending national champions, and an 86-84 win at No. 16 [[2018\u201319 Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team|Marquette]] on the final day of the regular season, denying the Golden Eagles a share of the conference title. Both wins were Ewing's first wins over nationally ranked teams. At the conclusion of the conference schedule, Jesse Govan was named First Team All-Big East, James Akinjo was named Big East Freshman of the Year, and Mac McClung and Josh LeBlanc were named to the All-Big East Freshman Team.  The Hoyas lost their first game in the [[2019 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|2019 Big East Tournament]] to [[2018\u201319 Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team|Seton Hall]] 73\u201357.

In this way, these ECAC tournaments played the same role for independents that conference tournaments did for members of basketball conferences.</ref>\n| [[1975 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA First Round]]\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|-\n|  [[1975\u201376 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|1975\u201376]]\n|  John Thompson Jr.\n|  Independent\n| 21\n| 7\n| .750\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments|ECAC South Region<br/>Tournament]] Champions<ref name=\"ECAC\" group=\"note\"/>\n| [[1976 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA First Round]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| [[1976\u201377 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|1976\u201377]]\n| John Thompson Jr.\n| Independent\n|  19\n|  9\n| .679\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|  [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments|ECAC South Region<br/>Tournament]] Semifinal<ref name=\"ECAC\" group=\"note\"/>\n|  [[1977 National Invitation Tournament|NIT First Round]]\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|-\n| [[1977\u201378 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|1977\u201378]]\n| John Thompson Jr.\n| Independent\n| 23\n| 8\n| .742\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments|ECAC South-Upstate Region<br/>Tournament]] Semifinal<ref name=\"ECAC\" group=\"note\"/>\n| [[1978 National Invitation Tournament|NIT Fourth Place]]\n| \u2014\n| 20\n|-\n| [[1978\u201379 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|1978\u201379]]\n| John Thompson Jr.\n| Independent\n| 24\n| 5\n| .828\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|  \u2014\n|  [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments|ECAC South-Upstate Region<br/>Tournament]] Champions<ref name=\"ECAC\" group=\"note\"/>\n|  [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Second Round]]\n|  \u2014\n|  12\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"#d9a53d\"| [[1979\u201380 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|1979\u201380]]\n| bgcolor=\"#d9a53d\"| John Thompson Jr.\n| bgcolor=\"#d9a53d\"| [[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|Big East Conference]]<ref name=\"Big East\" group=\"note\">Georgetown was a founding member of the original [[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|Big East Conference]] of 1979-2013.

The two schools have been playing each other since 1930, but their rivalry was solidified in the 1980s as the respective programs were the leading powers during the infancy of the newly formed Big East conference. In 1980, the first season of new conference, Georgetown famously ended Syracuse's 57-game home winning streak in the final game to played at [[Manley Field House]] before moving to the [[Carrier Dome]].  After the win, Georgetown coach John Thompson declared, \"Manley Field House is officially closed\".   Weeks later, the two schools met in the inaugural [[1980 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Championship]], with Georgetown prevailing 87-81.  The teams met in four Big East Tournament Championship games during the 1980s, with Georgetown winning all four contests.\n\nThe animosity between the programs was further extended when Syracuse announced their decision to leave the Big East effective in 2013 to join the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], forcing the split of \"Catholic Seven\" and the football-playing schools.  This led to the creation of the reformed Big East Conference and the [[American Athletic Conference]].  However, Georgetown and Syracuse have continued to play each other in all but one of the years following their exit from the conference.\n\n'''Villanova University'''\n\nAs a fellow Catholic institution and conference foe, [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] has been a natural rival for the Hoyas for many years.  The two schools are arguably the most successful programs among the group of teams that currently make up the Big East Conference.  The rivalry is best known for the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|1985 NCAA Championship Game]] where No. 8-seeded Villanova shocked the highly favored and top-ranked Hoyas 66-64, preventing Georgetown from gaining back-to-back titles.\n\nAmong current Big East Conference foes, Villanova is the only school that has as many Final Four appearances as the Hoyas, and they currently rank second to Georgetown in number of Big East Tournament Championships.\n\n'''St. John's University'''\n\nHaving first played each other in 1909, [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] is one of Georgetown's oldest rivals.  The two teams played off and on since that first contest until 1965, when they began annually scheduled games, and they only intensified when both programs became founding members of the Big East Conference in 1979. The rivalry was brought to national attention during the [[1984-85 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]] when both programs were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 throughout the season and met on a total of four occasions, including the famous \"Sweater Game\" at Madison Square Garden, the [[1985 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|1985 Big East Championship]], and the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1985 Final Four]].  The Hoyas won 3 of the 4 matchups that year.\n\nThe rivalry gained renewed interest when both schools remained in the new Big East Conference following the many iterations of conference alignment.\n\n'''University of Connecticut'''<br>\nAn original member of the Big East, [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]] and Georgetown battled for conference supremacy for multiple decades, until UConn left the conference to join the American Athletic Conference in 2013.   One of the most intense periods for the rivalry was the [[1995\u201396 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|1995-1996]] season where both teams found themselves ranked in the Top 5 throughout most of the year, led by stars [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Ray Allen]] respectively.  During the regular season, Georgetown upset then ranked No. 3 UConn in Washington DC, but a few weeks later at Madison Square Garden, UConn prevailed in a classic Big East Tournament Final 75-74, on a last second shot by Allen.\n\nUConn is the only team to match Georgetown's record of 7 Big East Tournament titles and 10 Regular Season titles.  The schools have continued to play each other in their non-conference schedule, meeting twice since UConn left the Big East, splitting the series thus far.\n\n===Blue and gray===\n[[File:Georgetown Hoyas vs. American University.jpg|190px|thumb|A \"Gray Out\" at the Verizon Center \u2013 later renamed [[Capital One Arena]] \u2013 in [[Washington, D.C.]], as [[2007\u201308 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] plays [[American Eagles men's basketball|American]] on December 29, 2007.]]\nGeorgetown's official colors are blue and gray. The colors were selected in 1876 by the Georgetown College Boat Club (the original crew team) in honor of Georgetown students and alumni who wore the Union blue and Confederate gray in the Civil War.  A student committee declared blue and gray \"as appropriate colors for the Boat Club and expressive of the feeling of unity between the Northern and Southern boys of the College\", and recommended its adoption for the team.<ref>http://www.hoyabasketball.com/history/colors.htm</ref>  By the time the men's varsity basketball team was formed, the blue and gray colors were already widely adopted by the school.\n\nPresently, Georgetown is one of the few teams to wear gray as their primary home uniform color, as traditionally teams wear white uniforms at home (though the Hoyas do have a white alternate jersey that is worn on occasion).  Fans are generally encouraged to wear gray to home games, and sellouts are referred to as a \"gray out.\"\n\n===Kenner League===\nEach summer Georgetown University's [[McDonough Gymnasium]] hosts the Kenner League.  Named after one of the founders and first director of the Metropolitan Police Boys' and Girls' Club of Washington DC, the Kenner league is the only NCAA sanctioned summer league in Washington DC.  Formed in 1982, the league allows Georgetown players to continue their development in an NCAA-structured environment, and to stay within view of watchful eyes on a college campus (even if the coaches were not allowed there by NCAA rules). From its humble beginnings, the Kenner legacy continued to build throughout the 1980s, with coverage in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' beginning around 1986, then a high school bracket following soon thereafter, and ultimately the arrival of \"senior\" teams featuring a mix of former Georgetown players, visiting NBA stars, and local hoop legends.\n\nKenner continued to grow, with more fans making the trip weekly to the gymnasium for a series of weeknight and weekend games each summer. As new recruits arrived at Georgetown, following them at the Kenner League became a priority for fans.  Many fans might think Georgetown runs the Kenner League, but it does not. The league is an independent effort, whose organizers must raise money from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and team sponsors to cover the cost of officials, jerseys, and other organizational costs, and maintain NCAA certification. As summer leagues go, Kenner is among the longest running of its kind.  Since the league has been in existence, nearly 200 Georgetown players have played in the Kenner League.<ref>[http://www.hoyabasketball.com/history/kenner.htm hoyabasketball.com The Georgetown Basketball History Project: Kenner League]</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main|List of Georgetown Hoyas in the NBA and WNBA Drafts}}\nThe Hoyas have an excellent history of preparing players for the [[NBA]].

The two schools have been playing each other since 1930, but their rivalry was solidified in the 1980s as the respective programs were the leading powers during the infancy of the newly formed Big East conference. In 1980, the first season of new conference, Georgetown famously ended Syracuse's 57-game home winning streak in the final game to played at [[Manley Field House]] before moving to the [[Carrier Dome]].  After the win, Georgetown coach John Thompson declared, \"Manley Field House is officially closed\".   Weeks later, the two schools met in the inaugural [[1980 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Championship]], with Georgetown prevailing 87-81.  The teams met in four Big East Tournament Championship games during the 1980s, with Georgetown winning all four contests.\n\nThe animosity between the programs was further extended when Syracuse announced their decision to leave the Big East effective in 2013 to join the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], forcing the split of \"Catholic Seven\" and the football-playing schools.  This led to the creation of the reformed Big East Conference and the [[American Athletic Conference]].  However, Georgetown and Syracuse have continued to play each other in all but one of the years following their exit from the conference.\n\n'''Villanova University'''\n\nAs a fellow Catholic institution and conference foe, [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] has been a natural rival for the Hoyas for many years.  The two schools are arguably the most successful programs among the group of teams that currently make up the Big East Conference.  The rivalry is best known for the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|1985 NCAA Championship Game]] where No. 8-seeded Villanova shocked the highly favored and top-ranked Hoyas 66-64, preventing Georgetown from gaining back-to-back titles.\n\nAmong current Big East Conference foes, Villanova is the only school that has as many Final Four appearances as the Hoyas, and they currently rank second to Georgetown in number of Big East Tournament Championships.\n\n'''St. John's University'''\n\nHaving first played each other in 1909, [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] is one of Georgetown's oldest rivals.  The two teams played off and on since that first contest until 1965, when they began annually scheduled games, and they only intensified when both programs became founding members of the Big East Conference in 1979. The rivalry was brought to national attention during the [[1984-85 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]] when both programs were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 throughout the season and met on a total of four occasions, including the famous \"Sweater Game\" at Madison Square Garden, the [[1985 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|1985 Big East Championship]], and the [[1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1985 Final Four]].  The Hoyas won 3 of the 4 matchups that year.\n\nThe rivalry gained renewed interest when both schools remained in the new Big East Conference following the many iterations of conference alignment.\n\n'''University of Connecticut'''<br>\nAn original member of the Big East, [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]] and Georgetown battled for conference supremacy for multiple decades, until UConn left the conference to join the American Athletic Conference in 2013.   One of the most intense periods for the rivalry was the [[1995\u201396 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|1995-1996]] season where both teams found themselves ranked in the Top 5 throughout most of the year, led by stars [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Ray Allen]] respectively.  During the regular season, Georgetown upset then ranked No. 3 UConn in Washington DC, but a few weeks later at Madison Square Garden, UConn prevailed in a classic Big East Tournament Final 75-74, on a last second shot by Allen.\n\nUConn is the only team to match Georgetown's record of 7 Big East Tournament titles and 10 Regular Season titles.  The schools have continued to play each other in their non-conference schedule, meeting twice since UConn left the Big East, splitting the series thus far.\n\n===Blue and gray===\n[[File:Georgetown Hoyas vs. American University.jpg|190px|thumb|A \"Gray Out\" at the Verizon Center \u2013 later renamed [[Capital One Arena]] \u2013 in [[Washington, D.C.]], as [[2007\u201308 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] plays [[American Eagles men's basketball|American]] on December 29, 2007.]]\nGeorgetown's official colors are blue and gray. The colors were selected in 1876 by the Georgetown College Boat Club (the original crew team) in honor of Georgetown students and alumni who wore the Union blue and Confederate gray in the Civil War.  A student committee declared blue and gray \"as appropriate colors for the Boat Club and expressive of the feeling of unity between the Northern and Southern boys of the College\", and recommended its adoption for the team.<ref>http://www.hoyabasketball.com/history/colors.htm</ref>  By the time the men's varsity basketball team was formed, the blue and gray colors were already widely adopted by the school.\n\nPresently, Georgetown is one of the few teams to wear gray as their primary home uniform color, as traditionally teams wear white uniforms at home (though the Hoyas do have a white alternate jersey that is worn on occasion).  Fans are generally encouraged to wear gray to home games, and sellouts are referred to as a \"gray out.\"\n\n===Kenner League===\nEach summer Georgetown University's [[McDonough Gymnasium]] hosts the Kenner League.  Named after one of the founders and first director of the Metropolitan Police Boys' and Girls' Club of Washington DC, the Kenner league is the only NCAA sanctioned summer league in Washington DC.  Formed in 1982, the league allows Georgetown players to continue their development in an NCAA-structured environment, and to stay within view of watchful eyes on a college campus (even if the coaches were not allowed there by NCAA rules). From its humble beginnings, the Kenner legacy continued to build throughout the 1980s, with coverage in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' beginning around 1986, then a high school bracket following soon thereafter, and ultimately the arrival of \"senior\" teams featuring a mix of former Georgetown players, visiting NBA stars, and local hoop legends.\n\nKenner continued to grow, with more fans making the trip weekly to the gymnasium for a series of weeknight and weekend games each summer. As new recruits arrived at Georgetown, following them at the Kenner League became a priority for fans.  Many fans might think Georgetown runs the Kenner League, but it does not. The league is an independent effort, whose organizers must raise money from [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and team sponsors to cover the cost of officials, jerseys, and other organizational costs, and maintain NCAA certification. As summer leagues go, Kenner is among the longest running of its kind.  Since the league has been in existence, nearly 200 Georgetown players have played in the Kenner League.<ref>[http://www.hoyabasketball.com/history/kenner.htm hoyabasketball.com The Georgetown Basketball History Project: Kenner League]</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{main|List of Georgetown Hoyas in the NBA and WNBA Drafts}}\nThe Hoyas have an excellent history of preparing players for the [[NBA]].

[[Henry Hyde]], who led Georgetown to its first national final, was elected a member of Congress from Illinois and Chairman of House Judiciary Committee. He received the nation's highest civilian honor, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom|Medal of Freedom]]. [[William Shea]], who played in the 1920s, was the New York attorney who brought the [[New York Mets]] to the city.
