Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.\n\n\"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.\" [[Susan B. Anthony]] said \"I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.\"\n\nThe modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.<ref>\"Equality for Women in the Olympics.\" Feminist Majority Foundation. Web.

Thus [[netball]] was developed out of [[basketball]] and [[softball]] out of [[baseball]].\n\nIn response to the lack of support for women's international sport the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Sportive F\u00e9minine Internationale]] was founded in France by [[Alice Milliat]].

Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.\n<gallery caption=\"Women's sports in history\">\nFile:Bronze figure of a running girl, Greek, about 520-500 BC, Found at Prizren, Serbia, Winning at the ancient Games, British Museum (7667206370).jpg|A [[Spartan]] woman running.

The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sports in Society|last=Coakley|first=Jay|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=New York|page=238}}</ref> This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.<ref name=\"Greenburg_1997\" /> In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the \"three-part test\".\n\n# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are \"substantially proportionate\" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.\n# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).\n# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.\n\n====== Room for improvement ======\nAlthough schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, a 1999 study by Sigelman and Wahlbeck found that many schools are \"nowhere near compliance\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigelman|first=Lee|last2=Wahlbeck|first2=Paul|date=1999|title=Gender Proportionality in Intercollegiate Athletics: The Mathematics of Title IX Compliance|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=80|issue=3|pages=518\u2013538|jstor=42863927}}</ref> Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irons|first=Alicia|date=Spring 2006|title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX|url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf|journal=Major Themes in Economics|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information|title=Title IX Information|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011, 4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title IX laws.<ref name=\"auto\">Wong, A.

There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the \"new women\" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.<ref>M.

In 2013, Swedish striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned  $16.7 million a year playing for Paris Saint-German, whereas Lotta Schellin who played for Lyon in France only earned $239,720. The wage gap is also evident among coaches. The difference in pay is evident in how male athletes and female athletes are able to spend their time between games.

Research that has examined why this is the case suggested this can be attributed to three particular factors that govern sports newswork: the male-dominated sports newsroom, ingrained assumptions about readership, and the systematic, repetitive nature of sports news.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sherwood|first=Merryn|last2=Osborne|first2=Angela|last3=Nicholson|first3=Matthew|last4=Sherry|first4=Emma|date=December 2017|title=Newswork, News Values, and Audience Considerations: Factors That Facilitate Media Coverage of Women's Sports|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=5|issue=6|pages=647\u2013668|doi=10.1177/2167479516645535|issn=2167-4795}}</ref> In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular sports commentary shows.<ref>{{cite web |title=When it comes to women in sports, TV news tunes out |url=https://news.usc.edu/82382/when-it-comes-to-women-in-sports-tv-news-tunes-out/}}</ref> Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories.

In the late 1900s Women's Sports started to gain popularity in the media because of their talent in the Olympics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An Imperceptible Difference: Visual and Textual Constructions of Femininity in Sport Illustrated and Sports Illustrated for Women |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid=b1aa5c2a-a43c-40c6-97e5-7d193c12cfdd%40sdc-v-sessmgr01}}</ref> In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.\n\nWhen researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. A recent study showed that in July, -The NBA summer league receives more coverage and attention than a regular season game in the WNBA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://niemanreports.org/articles/covering-womens-sports/|title=7 Ways to Improve Coverage of Women\u2019s Sports|website=Nieman Reports|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.<ref>\"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports.\" LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/</ref> The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.<ref>Holmes, Tracy. \"After Homophobia Let's Tackle Prejudice Against Women's Sports.\" ABC.

In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage. The lengths of these articles were 25\u201327% shorter than the length of men's articles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.la84.org/coverage-of-womens-sports-in-four-daily-newspapers/ |title=Coverage of Women's Sports in Four Daily Newspapers \u2013 LA84 Foundation |author= |date= |work=LA84.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref> There was an international frenzy in 2012 when the first woman that represented Saudi Arabia in the 2012 Olympics competed in track.

Despite this jump in viewership of women's soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women's professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men's league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women's Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons. The dearth of coverage of women's sports is evidenced by the low number of segments (i.e., stories) in our sample. Of the 934 local network affiliate news segments (over 12 hr of broadcasts), 880 were on men's sports (or approximately 11\u00bd hr), 22 segments (or nearly 18 min) were on gender-neutral sports (e.g., a horse race, coverage of the Los Angeles [LA] marathon, and a recreational sports event), and only 32 segments (about 23 min) featured women's sports. SportsCenter's numbers were similar. Of the 405 total SportsCenter segments in our sample (nearly 14 hr), 376 covered men's sports (slightly over 13 hr), 16 segments were on gender-neutral sports (just over 20 min), and only 13 segments featured women's sports (approximately 17 min).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooky|first=Cheryl|last2=Messner|first2=Michael A.|last3=Musto|first3=Michela|date=September 2015|title=\"It's Dude Time!\": A Quarter Century of Excluding Women's Sports in Televised News and Highlight Shows|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=261\u2013287|doi=10.1177/2167479515588761|issn=2167-4795}}</ref>\n\nA recent article from the Wall Street Journal states \u201cfrom 2016 to 2018, women's games generated about $50.8 million in revenue compared with $49.9 million for the men, according to U.S. soccer's audited financial statements<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bachman |first1=Rachel |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Games Outearned Men's Games |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-womens-soccer-games-out-earned-mens-games-11560765600. |website=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\u201d (Bachman, 2019). These numbers contrasts the idea that women's sports are not entertaining enough for the viewer or typical fan by $1.9 million. This idea stems from the male dominated sports perspective, which constantly undermines the perception of quality, effort, and potential that women's soccer exhibits. However, we can see through the caliber of women's soccer displayed most recently within the Women's FIFA World Cup of 2019 that it was on par if not better than the level of play of their male counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The U.S. Women's National Team scored 13 goals against Thailand in their opening match, the most goals scored in any World Cup match in history. Media outlets though may remain concerned that increased coverage of women's sport will lead to a reduction in audience draw and advertising revenue. \n\nAmy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. \"Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females.\" She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. \"The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements.\"<ref>\"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting\" ''Science Daily''.

Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.<ref name=\"Cooky, C. 2012\">Cooky, C., & Lavoi, N.

A study has shown that ESPN, which began airing women NCAA tournament in 2003, aired eleven women tournament segments in comparison to one-hundred men's tournament segments.<ref name=\"Cooky, C. 2012\"/> ESPN and other sports outlets are airing more female-oriented sporting events; however the length of the segments are very small. This representative data is showcases a main part of the minimal interaction the media has with women athletes. Media coverage of women sports in the United States has further justified the divisional hierarchy faced by women athletes in terms of popularity and coverage. Scholarly studies (Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013) also show that when women athletes were given the option to pick a photo of a picture that would increase respect for their sport, they picked an on-the-court competency picture. However, when women athletes were told to pick a picture that would increase interest in their sport, 47% picked a picture that sexualized the women athlete.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kane | first1 = M.

Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.\n\n\"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.\" [[Susan B. Anthony]] said \"I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.\"\n\nThe modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.<ref>\"Equality for Women in the Olympics.\" Feminist Majority Foundation. Web.

Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.\n<gallery caption=\"Women's sports in history\">\nFile:Bronze figure of a running girl, Greek, about 520-500 BC, Found at Prizren, Serbia, Winning at the ancient Games, British Museum (7667206370).jpg|A [[Spartan]] woman running.

The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sports in Society|last=Coakley|first=Jay|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=New York|page=238}}</ref> This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.<ref name=\"Greenburg_1997\" /> In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the \"three-part test\".\n\n# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are \"substantially proportionate\" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.\n# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).\n# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.\n\n====== Room for improvement ======\nAlthough schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, a 1999 study by Sigelman and Wahlbeck found that many schools are \"nowhere near compliance\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigelman|first=Lee|last2=Wahlbeck|first2=Paul|date=1999|title=Gender Proportionality in Intercollegiate Athletics: The Mathematics of Title IX Compliance|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=80|issue=3|pages=518\u2013538|jstor=42863927}}</ref> Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irons|first=Alicia|date=Spring 2006|title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX|url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf|journal=Major Themes in Economics|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information|title=Title IX Information|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011, 4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title IX laws.<ref name=\"auto\">Wong, A.

There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the \"new women\" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.<ref>M.

The same study revealed that Women's handball is covered and followed as equally if not more than the men's team. In contrast to international handball coverage, the Norwegian coverage of Men's and Women's handball are discussed in the media using the same or similar verbiage. While they are especially noticeable in handball, equality and opportunity in Norwegian sports is not limited to the handball. Many top-female athletes from a number of sports have come from Norway.

Sweden is recognized as being a feminist country, however the wage gap is significant between male and female athletes. In 2013, Swedish striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned  $16.7 million a year playing for Paris Saint-German, whereas Lotta Schellin who played for Lyon in France only earned $239,720. The wage gap is also evident among coaches. The difference in pay is evident in how male athletes and female athletes are able to spend their time between games.

In the late 1900s Women's Sports started to gain popularity in the media because of their talent in the Olympics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An Imperceptible Difference: Visual and Textual Constructions of Femininity in Sport Illustrated and Sports Illustrated for Women |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid=b1aa5c2a-a43c-40c6-97e5-7d193c12cfdd%40sdc-v-sessmgr01}}</ref> In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.\n\nWhen researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. A recent study showed that in July, -The NBA summer league receives more coverage and attention than a regular season game in the WNBA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://niemanreports.org/articles/covering-womens-sports/|title=7 Ways to Improve Coverage of Women\u2019s Sports|website=Nieman Reports|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.<ref>\"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports.\" LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/</ref> The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.<ref>Holmes, Tracy. \"After Homophobia Let's Tackle Prejudice Against Women's Sports.\" ABC.

In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage. The lengths of these articles were 25\u201327% shorter than the length of men's articles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.la84.org/coverage-of-womens-sports-in-four-daily-newspapers/ |title=Coverage of Women's Sports in Four Daily Newspapers \u2013 LA84 Foundation |author= |date= |work=LA84.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref> There was an international frenzy in 2012 when the first woman that represented Saudi Arabia in the 2012 Olympics competed in track. That was the most women's sports coverage that there had been in several years.Women played 90 minutes of football, 80 minutes of rugby, 18 holes of golf and ran the same distance in a marathon as men.

Despite this jump in viewership of women's soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women's professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men's league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women's Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons. The dearth of coverage of women's sports is evidenced by the low number of segments (i.e., stories) in our sample. Of the 934 local network affiliate news segments (over 12 hr of broadcasts), 880 were on men's sports (or approximately 11\u00bd hr), 22 segments (or nearly 18 min) were on gender-neutral sports (e.g., a horse race, coverage of the Los Angeles [LA] marathon, and a recreational sports event), and only 32 segments (about 23 min) featured women's sports. SportsCenter's numbers were similar. Of the 405 total SportsCenter segments in our sample (nearly 14 hr), 376 covered men's sports (slightly over 13 hr), 16 segments were on gender-neutral sports (just over 20 min), and only 13 segments featured women's sports (approximately 17 min).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooky|first=Cheryl|last2=Messner|first2=Michael A.|last3=Musto|first3=Michela|date=September 2015|title=\"It's Dude Time!\": A Quarter Century of Excluding Women's Sports in Televised News and Highlight Shows|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=261\u2013287|doi=10.1177/2167479515588761|issn=2167-4795}}</ref>\n\nA recent article from the Wall Street Journal states \u201cfrom 2016 to 2018, women's games generated about $50.8 million in revenue compared with $49.9 million for the men, according to U.S. soccer's audited financial statements<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bachman |first1=Rachel |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Games Outearned Men's Games |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-womens-soccer-games-out-earned-mens-games-11560765600. |website=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\u201d (Bachman, 2019). These numbers contrasts the idea that women's sports are not entertaining enough for the viewer or typical fan by $1.9 million. This idea stems from the male dominated sports perspective, which constantly undermines the perception of quality, effort, and potential that women's soccer exhibits. However, we can see through the caliber of women's soccer displayed most recently within the Women's FIFA World Cup of 2019 that it was on par if not better than the level of play of their male counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The U.S. Women's National Team scored 13 goals against Thailand in their opening match, the most goals scored in any World Cup match in history. Media outlets though may remain concerned that increased coverage of women's sport will lead to a reduction in audience draw and advertising revenue. \n\nAmy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. \"Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females.\" She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. \"The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements.\"<ref>\"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting\" ''Science Daily''.

Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.<ref name=\"Cooky, C. 2012\">Cooky, C., & Lavoi, N.

A study has shown that ESPN, which began airing women NCAA tournament in 2003, aired eleven women tournament segments in comparison to one-hundred men's tournament segments.<ref name=\"Cooky, C. 2012\"/> ESPN and other sports outlets are airing more female-oriented sporting events; however the length of the segments are very small. This representative data is showcases a main part of the minimal interaction the media has with women athletes. Media coverage of women sports in the United States has further justified the divisional hierarchy faced by women athletes in terms of popularity and coverage. Scholarly studies (Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013) also show that when women athletes were given the option to pick a photo of a picture that would increase respect for their sport, they picked an on-the-court competency picture.

This required extensive construction activities within the narrow confines of the pressure hull which was time-consuming and dangerous. Modular construction was implemented in an effort to overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a ''Virginia''-class submarine.<ref name=Holmander>{{cite news |first1=John D. |last1=Holmander |first2=Thomas |last2=Plante |title=The Four-Module Build Plan: The Second Decade of Virginia-class Construction Gets Better |journal=Undersea Warfare |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/build_plan.html |publisher=US Navy |date=Winter 2011 |issue=43 |access-date=4 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924120328/http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/build_plan.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Johnson |first1=David C., RDML (sel.) |first2=George M. |last2=Drakeley |first3=George M. |last3=Smith |title=Engineering the Solution: Virginia-Class Submarine Cost Reduction |conference=Engineering the Total Ship (ETS) 2008 |url=https://www.navalengineers.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/2008%20Proceedings%20Documents/ETS%202008/VA%20Class%20ASNE%20Paper%20FINAL.pdf |location=Falls Church, Virginia |publisher=American Society of Naval Engineers |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203084604/https://www.navalengineers.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/2008%20Proceedings%20Documents/ETS%202008/VA%20Class%20ASNE%20Paper%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Block II ===\n[[File:US Navy 080621-N-8467N-001 Pre-commissioning Unit New Hampshire (SSN 778) sits moored to the pier at General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard moments before her christening ceremony commenced.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''[[USS New Hampshire (SSN-778)|New Hampshire]]'', the first of the Block II vessels]]\n\nBlock II involved 6 boats; there were built in four sections rather than ten sections, saving about $300 million per boat.

Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified is the need to integrate with off-board systems so future ''Virginia'' boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the [[Pennsylvania State University]] could allow a torpedo to hit a target {{convert|200|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase.

This required extensive construction activities within the narrow confines of the pressure hull which was time-consuming and dangerous. Modular construction was implemented in an effort to overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a ''Virginia''-class submarine.<ref name=Holmander>{{cite news |first1=John D. |last1=Holmander |first2=Thomas |last2=Plante |title=The Four-Module Build Plan: The Second Decade of Virginia-class Construction Gets Better |journal=Undersea Warfare |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/build_plan.html |publisher=US Navy |date=Winter 2011 |issue=43 |access-date=4 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924120328/http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_43/build_plan.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Johnson |first1=David C., RDML (sel.) |first2=George M. |last2=Drakeley |first3=George M. |last3=Smith |title=Engineering the Solution: Virginia-Class Submarine Cost Reduction |conference=Engineering the Total Ship (ETS) 2008 |url=https://www.navalengineers.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/2008%20Proceedings%20Documents/ETS%202008/VA%20Class%20ASNE%20Paper%20FINAL.pdf |location=Falls Church, Virginia |publisher=American Society of Naval Engineers |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=21 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203084604/https://www.navalengineers.org/SiteCollectionDocuments/2008%20Proceedings%20Documents/ETS%202008/VA%20Class%20ASNE%20Paper%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=3 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Block II ===\n[[File:US Navy 080621-N-8467N-001 Pre-commissioning Unit New Hampshire (SSN 778) sits moored to the pier at General Dynamics Electric Boat shipyard moments before her christening ceremony commenced.jpg|thumb|left|USS ''[[USS New Hampshire (SSN-778)|New Hampshire]]'', the first of the Block II vessels]]\n\nBlock II involved 6 boats; there were built in four sections rather than ten sections, saving about $300 million per boat.

Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified is the need to integrate with off-board systems so future ''Virginia'' boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the [[Pennsylvania State University]] could allow a torpedo to hit a target {{convert|200|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase. Targeting information might also come from another platform like a patrol aircraft or an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) launched from the submarine.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Majumdar |title=Navy Starting Work on New SSN(X) Nuclear Attack Submarine |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/10/23/navy-starting-work-new-ssnx-nuclear-attack-submarine |work=USNI News |publisher=U.S. Naval Institute |date=23 October 2014 |access-date=4 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524013021/http://news.usni.org/2014/10/23/navy-starting-work-new-ssnx-nuclear-attack-submarine |archive-date=24 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Researchers have identified a quieter advanced propulsion system and the ability to control multiple [[unmanned underwater vehicle]]s (UUVs) at once as key SSN(X) components.
