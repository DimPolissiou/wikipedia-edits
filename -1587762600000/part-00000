While PzP has been a vocal advocate for Montenegro's [[NATO]] membership, it takes a cautiously supportive attitude towards the country's EU integrations, opposing the European Union's further federalisation and frequently criticising the Brussels bureaucracy. In recent years, the Movement for Changes has increasingly employed a [[populist]] discourse, frequently depicting the Montenegrin society as fundamentally divided between ordinary citizens and a corrupt [[partocracy]]. The party, like its NGO predecessor, advocates as part a reform agenda change in the \"undemocratic regime of the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]]\" the party that has ruled Montenegro as the dominant partner in every coalition government since the end of communism, and the \"dethroning\" of multiple-term Prime-Minister and President [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]].\n\nIn recent years, PzP have been significantly changed its public appearance, with frequent [[right-wing populist]], [[eurosceptic]], [[anti-immigration]], [[islamophobic]] and [[homophobic]] public statements of their high-ranked members. The party leader Medojevi\u0107 publicly endorsed [[Donald Trump]]'s candidacy in the 2016 election, as well as political actions of Italian far-right politician [[Matteo Salvini]] during the [[migrant crisis]].\n\n==History==\n\nIn the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum]], PzP remained neutral and did not campaign for either option, their choice being an outcome without the Movement's involvement. Although prominent members of the party supported an independent Montenegrin state, they refused to join the Bloc for an Independent Montenegro, led by the DPS. After the referendum, they stated that they did so out of opposition to \u0110ukanovi\u0107's rule, which they see as corrupt and undemocratic. This is, however, a matter of controversy, as the Movement has maintained close ties with the [[Together for Change]] Serbian-unionist bloc. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nIn the [[2006 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2006 parliamentary election]], the party ran for the first time, winning 11 of 81 seats. It became a vocal opposition party and forged links with the [[Serb People's Party (Montenegro)|Serb People's Party]] and the [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] in an attempt to unify the country's political opposition.\n\nThe party put forward amendments as part of the drafting process for the new [[Constitution of Montenegro]], including the suggestion of official language status for the [[Serbian language]] alongside the existing proposal to declare [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] the state language. The proposal was adopted by the ruling coalition, and PzP gave its support for the required two-thirds super-majority to adopt the Constitution. This support damaged its ties with other opposition parties to some extent. The presence of senior officials of Movement for Changes at protests against Montenegrin [[International recognition of Kosovo|recognition of Kosovo]], in turn, alienated some [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanian]] supporters of the Movement.\n\nThe party saw a fall in support at the [[2009 Montenegrin parliamentary election|2009 parliamentary election]], falling from 11 seats to 5.\n\nThe Movement for Changes leader, Neboj\u0161a Medojevi\u0107, was a candidate in the [[2008 Montenegrin presidential election|2008 presidential election]].

Iridium metal is employed when high corrosion resistance at high temperatures is needed, as in high-performance [[spark plug]]s, [[crucible]]s for recrystallization of semiconductors at high temperatures, and electrodes for the production of chlorine in the [[chloralkali process]].

He found it had a density of around {{val|21.8|u=g/cm3}} and noted the metal is nearly immalleable and very hard. The first melting in appreciable quantity was done by [[Henri Sainte-Claire Deville]] and [[Jules Henri Debray]] in 1860. They required burning more than 300&nbsp;liters of pure {{chem|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2}} gas for each kilogram of iridium.<ref name=\"hunt\" />\n\nThese extreme difficulties in melting the metal limited the possibilities for handling iridium. [[John Isaac Hawkins]] was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for fountain pen nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, [[John Holland (pen maker)|John Holland]] and [[William Lofland Dudley]] were able to melt iridium by adding [[phosphorus]] and patented the process in the United States; British company [[Johnson Matthey]] later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium at a number of [[World's fair|World Fairs]].<ref name=\"hunt\" /> The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in [[thermocouple]]s was made by Otto Feussner in 1933.

Vasilkivskiy the action \"On Vasilkivskiy ways: a look through the ages\" was organized. The purpose of the action was to reproduce after 100 years the sights of the church and folk art, characteristic landscapes created in the time this master. For this purpose, it has been investigated S.I. Vasilkivskiy \"geography\" trips as works that are in the collection of the Kharkov Art Museum, and in the pre-war documents that recorded the lost works of the artist (about 700).\n\nUnder the editorship of B.V. Grinyov was compiled reference book \"The signatures and monograms of artists of Ukraine\", which has been reprinted three times. The reference book contains a brief biographical information on contemporary Ukrainian artists and samples of their signatures.
