The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.<ref name=\":0\">Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17</ref> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired many [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen

large, circular dining hall with a high domed ceiling in which they ate meals communally.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} There were also numerous classrooms, where the scholars were expected to at least occasionally teach students.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} Ptolemy II Philadelphus is said to have had a keen interest in zoology, so it has been speculated that the Mouseion may have even had a zoo for exotic animals.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} According to classical scholar [[Lionel Casson]], the idea was that if the scholars were completely freed from all the burdens of everyday life they would be able to devote more time to research and intellectual pursuits.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=34}} Strabo called the group of scholars who lived at the Mouseion a [[:wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|synodos}}, \"community\").{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} One likely apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's son.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nThe first recorded head librarian was [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] (lived {{circa}} 325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}\n\n[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|According to legend, the Syracusan inventor [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw]], a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}]]\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n[[File:Eratosthenes_measure_of_Earth_circumference.svg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration showing a portion of the globe

soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003}} As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to

brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170\u2013{{circa}} 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Dionysius Thrax wrote the [[The Art of Grammar|first book on Greek grammar]], a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the first century BC by [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] ({{circa}} 100\u2013{{circa}} 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}\n\n=== Burning by Julius Caesar ===\n[[File:C\u00e9sar

It seems, as shown above, that both of the Alexandrian libraries were destroyed by the end of the fourth century, and there is no mention of any library surviving at Alexandria in the Christian literature of the centuries following that date. It is also suspicious that Omar is recorded to have made the same remark about books found by the Arab during their conquest of Iran.\"}}\n\n== Collection ==\nIt is not possible to determine the collection's size in any era with certainty. [[Papyrus]] scrolls constituted the collection, and although [[codex|codices]] were used after 300 BC, the Alexandrian Library is never documented as having switched to [[parchment]], perhaps because of its strong links to the papyrus trade. (The Library of Alexandria in fact was indirectly causal in the creation of writing on parchment\u2014due to the library's critical need for papyrus, little was exported and thus an alternate source of copy material became essential.)<ref>Murray, S.A. (2009).  ''The Library: An illustrated history''. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p. 14</ref>\n\nA single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls, and this division into self-contained \"books\" was a major aspect of editorial work. King [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (309\u2013246 BC) is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library.<ref>Tarn, W.W. (1928). \"Ptolemy II\".

At its height, the library was said to possess nearly half a million scrolls, and, although historians debate the precise number, the highest estimates claim 400,000 scrolls while the most conservative estimates are as low as 40,000,{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis|2015|p=20}} which is still an enormous collection that required vast storage space.<ref name=Murray>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|year=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|isbn=978-1-60239-706-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/libraryillustrat0000murr}}</ref>\n\nAs a research institution, the library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics, astronomy, physics, natural sciences and other subjects. Its empirical standards were applied in one of the first and certainly strongest homes for serious [[textual criticism]]. As the same text often existed in several different versions, comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their veracity.

The Library was part of a larger research institution called the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]], which was dedicated to the [[Muse]]s, the nine goddesses of the arts.<ref name=\":0\">Murray, S. A., (2009). The library: An illustrated history. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, p.17</ref> The idea of a universal library in Alexandria may have been proposed by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], an exiled Athenian statesman living in Alexandria, to [[Ptolemy I Soter]], who may have established plans for the Library, but the Library itself was probably not built until the reign of his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. The Library quickly acquired many [[papyrus]] [[scroll]]s, due largely to the Ptolemaic kings' aggressive and well-funded policies for procuring texts. It is unknown precisely how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, but estimates range from 40,000 to 400,000 at its height.\n\nAlexandria came to be regarded as the capital of knowledge and learning, in part because of the Great Library.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The library : an illustrated history|last=Murray|first=Stuart|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|isbn=978-1-61608-453-0|location=New York, NY|pages= 17|oclc=277203534}}</ref> Many important and influential scholars worked at the Library during the third and second centuries BC, including, among many others: [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]], who worked towards standardizing the texts of the [[Homeric poems]]; [[Callimachus]], who wrote the ''[[Pinakes]]'', sometimes considered to be the world's first [[library catalogue]]; [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], who composed the epic poem the ''[[Argonautica]]''; [[Eratosthenes of Cyrene]], who calculated the [[circumference of the earth]] within a few hundred kilometers of accuracy; [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], who invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]] and was the first to divide poetic texts into lines; and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]], who produced the definitive texts of the Homeric poems as well as extensive commentaries on them. During the reign of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], a daughter library was established in the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]], a temple to the Greco-Egyptian god [[Serapis]].\n\nDespite the widespread modern belief that the Library of Alexandria was burned once and cataclysmically destroyed, the Library actually declined gradually over the course of several centuries, starting with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC during the reign of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], which resulted in Aristarchus of Samothrace, the head librarian, resigning from his position and exiling himself to [[Cyprus]]. Many other scholars, including [[Dionysius Thrax]] and [[Apollodorus of Athens]], fled to other cities, where they continued teaching and conducting scholarship. The Library, or part of its collection, was accidentally burned by [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's Civil War|his civil war]] in 48 BC, but it is unclear how much was actually destroyed and it seems to have either survived or been rebuilt shortly thereafter; the geographer [[Strabo]] mentions having visited the Mouseion in around 20 BC and the prodigious scholarly output of [[Didymus Chalcenterus]] in Alexandria from this period indicates that he had access to at least some of the Library's resources.\n\nThe Library dwindled during the Roman Period, due to lack of funding and support. Its membership appears to have ceased by the 260s AD. Between 270 and 275 AD, the city of Alexandria saw a rebellion and an imperial counterattack that probably destroyed whatever remained of the Library, if it still existed at that time. The daughter library of the Serapeum may have survived after the main Library's destruction. The Serapeum was vandalized and demolished in 391 AD under a decree issued by [[Coptic Christian]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria]], but it does not seem to have housed books at the time and was mainly used as a gathering place for [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers following the teachings of [[Iamblichus]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{multiple image|align=right\n|image1=Ptolemy I Soter

libraries existed in both Greece and in the ancient Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=13}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The earliest recorded archive of written materials comes from the ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Uruk]] in around 3400 BC, when writing had only just begun to develop.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} Scholarly curation of literary texts began in around 2500 BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}} The later kingdoms and empires of the ancient Near East had long traditions of book collecting.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} The ancient [[Hittites]] and [[Assyria]]ns had massive archives containing records written in many different languages.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} The most famous library of the ancient Near East was the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] in [[Nineveh]], founded in the seventh century BC by the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]] (ruled 668\u2013{{circa}} 627 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=11}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}} A large library also existed in [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] ({{circa}} 605\u2013{{circa}} 562 BC).{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}} In Greece, the Athenian tyrant [[Peisistratos]] was said to have founded the first major public library in the sixth century BC.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1}} It was out of this mixed heritage of both Greek and Near Eastern book collections that the idea for the Library of Alexandria was born.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}\n\nThe Macedonian kings who succeeded [[Alexander the Great]] as rulers of the Near East wanted to promote Hellenistic culture and learning throughout the known world.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2\u20133}} Historian [[Roy MacLeod]] calls this \"a programme of [[cultural imperialism]]\".{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}} These rulers, therefore, had a vested interest to collect and compile information from both the Greeks and from the far more ancient kingdoms of the Near East.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=2\u20133}} Libraries enhanced a city's prestige, attracted scholars, and provided practical assistance in matters of ruling and governing the kingdom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=341}} Eventually, for these reasons, every major Hellenistic urban center would have a royal library.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=340}} The Library of Alexandria, however, was unprecedented due to the scope and scale of the Ptolemies' ambitions;{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=3}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|pages=340\u2013341}} unlike their predecessors and contemporaries, the Ptolemies wanted to produce a repository of all

''Letter of Aristeas'' claims that the Library was founded during the reign of [[Ptolemy I Soter]] ({{circa}} 323\u2013{{circa}} 283 BC) and that it was initially organized by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], a student of [[Aristotle]] who had been exiled from Athens and taken refuge in Alexandria within the Ptolemaic court.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=2}}<ref>''Letter of

instead created under the reign of Ptolemy I's son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (283\u2013246 BC).{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}\n\nModern scholars agree that, while it is possible that Ptolemy I may have laid the groundwork for the Library, it probably did not come into being as a physical institution until the reign of Ptolemy II.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|page=343}} By that time, Demetrius of Phalerum had fallen out of favor with the Ptolemaic court and could not, therefore, have had any role in establishing the Library as an institution.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343\u2013344}} Stephen V. Tracy, however, argues that it is highly probable that Demetrius played an important role in collecting at least some of the earliest texts that would later become part of the Library's collection.{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=343\u2013344}} In around 295 BC or thereabouts, Demetrius may have acquired early texts of the writings of Aristotle and [[Theophrastus]], which he would have been uniquely positioned to do, since he was a distinguished member of the [[Peripatetic school]].{{sfn|Tracy|2000|pages=344\u2013345}}\n\nThe Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) as part of the [[Musaeum|Mouseion]].{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis|2015|p=19}}{{efn|\"Mouseion\" means \"House of Muses\", whence the term \"museum\".<ref>Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03bd] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912160936/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 |date=12 September 2007 }} at [[Liddell & Scott]].</ref>}} Its main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,<ref name=\"Lindberg1980\">{{cite book|author=David C.

[[:wikt:\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2]] ({{lang|grc-Latn|synodos}}, \"community\").{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}} As early as 283 BC, they may have numbered between thirty and fifty learned men.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}\n\n=== Early scholarship ===\nThe Library of Alexandria was not affiliated with any particular philosophical school and, consequently, scholars who studied there had considerable academic freedom.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} They were, however, subject to the authority of the king.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} A probably apocryphal story is told of a poet named [[Sotades]] who wrote an obscene epigram making fun of Ptolemy II for marrying his sister [[Arsinoe II]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Ptolemy II is said to have jailed him and, after he escaped, sealed him in a lead jar and dropped him into the sea.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} As a religious center, the Mouseion was directed by a priest of the Muses known as an ''epistates'', who was appointed by the king in the same manner as the priests who managed the various [[Egyptian temples]].{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=3\u20134}} The Library itself was directed by a scholar who served as [[:Category:Librarians of Alexandria|head librarian]], as well as tutor to the king's son.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=4}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nThe first recorded head librarian was [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] (lived {{circa}} 325\u2013{{circa}} 270 BC).{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's main work was devoted to the establishment of canonical texts for the Homeric poems and the early Greek lyric poets.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Most of what is known about him comes from later commentaries that mention his preferred readings of particular passages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Zenodotus is known to have written a glossary of rare and unusual words, which was organized in [[alphabetical order]], making him the first person known to have employed alphabetical order as a method of organization.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Since the collection at the Library of Alexandria seems to have been organized in alphabetical order by the first letter of the author's name from very early, Casson concludes that it is highly probable that Zenodotus was the one who organized it in this way.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} Zenodotus's system of alphabetization, however, only used the first letter of the word{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}} and it was not until the second century AD that anyone is known to have applied the same method of alphabetization to the remaining letters of the word.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=37}}\n\nMeanwhile, the scholar and poet [[Callimachus]] compiled the ''[[Pinakes]]'', a 120-book catalogue of various authors and all their known works.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} The ''Pinakes'' has not survived, but enough references to it and fragments of it have survived to allow scholars to reconstruct its basic structure.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The ''Pinakes'' was divided into multiple sections, each containing entries for writers of a particular genre of literature.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} The most basic division was between writers of poetry and prose, with each section divided into smaller subsections.{{sfn|Casson|2001|pages=39\u201340}} Each section listed authors in alphabetical order.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Each entry included the author's name, father's name, place of birth, and other brief biographical information, sometimes including nicknames by which that author was known, followed by a complete list of all that author's known works.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} The entries for prolific authors such as [[Aeschylus]], [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Theophrastus]] must have been extremely long, spanning multiple columns of text.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=40}} Although Callimachus did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he never held the position of head librarian there.{{sfn|Staikos|2000|page=66}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}} Callimachus's pupil [[Hermippus of Smyrna]] wrote biographies, [[Philostephanus of Cyrene]] studied geography, and [[Istros the Callimachean|Istros]] (who may have also been from Cyrene) studied Attic antiquities.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} In addition to the Great Library, many other smaller libraries also began to spring up all around the city of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=5}}\n\n[[File:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|According to legend, the Syracusan inventor [[Archimedes]] invented the [[Archimedes' screw]], a pump for transporting water, while studying at the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}]]\n\nAfter Zenodotus either died or retired, Ptolemy II Philadelphus appointed [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] (lived {{circa}} 295\u2013{{circa}} 215 BC), a native of Alexandria and a student of Callimachus, as the second head librarian of the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Philadelphus also appointed Apollonius of Rhodes as the tutor to his son, the future [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]].{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=109}} Apollonius of Rhodes is best known as the author of the ''[[Argonautica]]'', an epic poem about the voyages of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], which has survived to the present in its complete form.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} The ''Argonautica'' displays Apollonius's vast knowledge of history and literature and makes allusions to a vast array of events and texts, while simultaneously imitating the style of the Homeric poems.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}} Some fragments of his scholarly writings have also survived, but he is generally more famous today as a poet than as a scholar.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}\n\nAccording to legend, during the librarianship of Apollonius, the mathematician and inventor [[Archimedes]] (lived {{circa}}\u2009287 \u2013{{circa}}\u2009212 BC) came to visit the Library of Alexandria.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} During his time in Egypt, Archimedes is said to have observed the rise and fall of the [[Nile]], leading him to invent the [[Archimedes' screw]], which can be used to transport water from low-lying bodies into irrigation ditches.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}} Archimedes later returned to Syracuse, where he continued making new inventions.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=6}}\n\nAccording to two late and largely unreliable biographies, Apollonius was forced to resign from his position as head librarian and moved to the island of Rhodes (after which he takes his name) on account of the hostile reception he received in Alexandria to the first draft of his ''Argonautica''.{{sfn|Montana|2015|pages=109\u2013110}} It is more likely that Apollonius's resignation was on account of Ptolemy III Euergetes's ascension to the throne in 246 BC.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=110}}\n\n=== Later scholarship and expansion ===\n[[File:Eratosthenes_measure_of_Earth_circumference.svg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration showing a portion of the globe

This detail arises from the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.{{sfn|Trumble|MacIntyre Marshall|2003}} As the Library expanded, it ran out of space to

history.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} During this phase of the Library's history, [[literary criticism]] reached its peak{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=118}} and came to dominate the Library's scholarly output.{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|pages=7\u20138}} Aristophanes of Byzantium edited poetic texts and introduced the division of poems into separate lines on the page, since they had previously been written out just like prose.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 93}} He also invented the system of [[Greek diacritics]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5, 92\u201393}}{{sfn|MacLeod|2000|page=7}} wrote important works on [[lexicography]],{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and introduced a series of signs for textual criticism.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=93}} He wrote introductions to many plays, some of which have survived in partially rewritten forms.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} The fifth head librarian was an obscure individual named Apollonius, who is known by the epithet {{lang-grc-gre|\u1f41 \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2}} (\"the classifier of

forms.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=129}}\n\nDuring the early second century BC, several scholars at the Library of Alexandria studied works on medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} Zeuxis the Empiricist is credited with having written commentaries on the Hippocratic Corpus{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} and he actively worked to procure medical writings for the Library's collection.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} A scholar named Ptolemy Epithetes wrote a treatise on wounds in the Homeric poems, a subject straddling the line between traditional philology and medicine.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=117}} However, it was also during the early second century BC that the political power of Ptolemaic Egypt began to decline.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} After the [[Battle of Raphia]] in 217 BC, Ptolemaic power became increasingly unstable.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} There were uprisings among segments of the Egyptian population and, in the first half of the second century BC, connection with [[Upper Egypt]] became largely disrupted.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Ptolemaic rulers also began to emphasize the Egyptian aspect of their nation over the Greek aspect.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}} Consequently, many Greek scholars began to leave Alexandria for safer countries with more generous patronages.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=173}}\n\n[[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] (lived {{circa}} 216\u2013{{circa}} 145 BC) was the sixth head librarian.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} He earned a reputation as the greatest of all ancient scholars and produced not only texts of classic poems and works of prose, but full ''[[hypomnema]]ta'', or long, free-standing commentaries, on them.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} These commentaries would typically cite a passage of a classical text, explain its meaning, define any unusual words used in it, and comment on whether the words in the passage were really those used by the original author or if they were later interpolations added by scribes.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} He made many contributions to a variety of studies, but particularly the study of the Homeric poems,{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} and his editorial opinions are widely quoted by ancient authors as authoritative.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} A portion of one of Aristarchus's commentaries on the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] has survived in a papyrus fragment.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=43}} In 145 BC, however, Aristarchus became caught up in a dynastic struggle in which he supported [[Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator]] as the ruler of Egypt.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}} Ptolemy VII was murdered and succeeded by [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon]], who immediately set about punishing all those who had supported his predecessor, forcing Aristarchus to flee Egypt and take refuge on the island of [[Cyprus]], where he died shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Montana|2015|page=130}}{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=5}} Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria, forcing them to disperse across the Eastern

brought about a shift in the history of Hellenistic scholarship.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} The scholars who had studied at the Library of Alexandria and their students continued to conduct research and write treatises, but most of them no longer did so in association with the Library.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} A [[diaspora]] of Alexandrian scholarship occurred, in which scholars dispersed first throughout the eastern Mediterranean and later throughout the western Mediterranean as well.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|pages=5\u20136}} Aristarchus's student [[Dionysius Thrax]] ({{circa}} 170\u2013{{circa}} 90 BC) established a school on the Greek island of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Dionysius Thrax wrote the [[The Art of Grammar|first book on Greek grammar]], a succinct guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} This book remained the primary grammar textbook for Greek schoolboys until as late as the twelfth century AD.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} The Romans based their grammatical writings on it, and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=45}} Another one of Aristarchus's pupils, [[Apollodorus of Athens]] ({{circa}} 180\u2013{{circa}} 110 BC), went to Alexandria's greatest rival, Pergamum, where he taught and conducted research.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} This diaspora prompted the historian Menecles of Barce to sarcastically comment that Alexandria had become the teacher of all Greeks and barbarians alike.{{sfn|Meyboom|1995|page=373}}\n\nMeanwhile, in Alexandria, from the middle of the second century BC onwards, Ptolemaic rule in Egypt grew less stable than it had been previously.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Confronted with growing social unrest and other major political and economic problems, the later Ptolemies did not devote as much attention towards the Library and the Mouseion as their predecessors had.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} The status of both the Library and the head librarian diminished.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Several of the later Ptolemies used the position of head librarian as a mere political plum to reward their most devoted supporters.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Ptolemy VIII appointed a man named Cydas, one of his palace guards, as head librarian{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} and [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros|Ptolemy IX Soter II]] (ruled 88\u201381 BC) is said to have given the position to a political supporter.{{sfn|Casson|2001|page=47}} Eventually, the position of head librarian lost so much of its former prestige that even contemporary authors ceased to take interest in recording the terms of office for individual head librarians.{{sfn|Watts|2008|page=149}}\n\nA shift in Greek scholarship at large occurred around the beginning of the first century BC.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}} By this time, all major classical poetic texts had finally been standardized and extensive commentaries had already been produced on the writings of all the major literary authors of the [[Greek Classical Era]].{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Consequently, there was little original work left for scholars to do with these texts.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Many scholars began producing syntheses and reworkings of the commentaries of the Alexandrian scholars of previous centuries, at the expense of their own originalities.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}{{efn|This shift paralleled a similar, concurrent trend in philosophy, in which many philosophers were beginning to synthesize the views of earlier philosophers rather than coming up with original ideas of their own.{{sfn|Fox|1986|page=351}}}} Other scholars branched out and began writing commentaries on the poetic works of postclassical authors, including Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Apollonius of Rhodes.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}} Meanwhile, Alexandrian scholarship was probably introduced to [[Rome]] in the first century BC by [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] ({{circa}} 100\u2013{{circa}} 25 BC), a student of Dionysius Thrax.{{sfn|Dickey|2007|page=6}}\n\n=== Burning by Julius Caesar ===\n[[File:C\u00e9sar

The series of seven notebooks was rough-drafted by Marx, chiefly for purposes of self-clarification, during the winter of 1857\u20138. Left aside by Marx in 1858, it remained unpublished until 1939.<ref>https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4356-marx-was-a-fully-automated-luxury-communist</ref>\n\n==Contents==\nThe ''Grundrisse'' is very wide-ranging in subject matter and covers all six sections of Marx's economics (of which only one, the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'', ever reached a final form). It is often described as the rough draft of ''Das Kapital'', although there is considerable disagreement about the exact relationship between the two texts, particularly around the issue of [[methodology]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nDue to its breadth and its incorporation of themes from Marx's earlier writings, the ''Grundrisse'' is central to Marx's body of work. Its subject matter includes [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]], [[relations of production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]], [[Trade|exchange]], [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], [[Value (economics)|value]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]], [[capitalism]], the rise of [[technology]] and [[automation]], pre-capitalist forms of social organization, and the preconditions for a [[Communism|communist]] revolution. Scholars have noted major differences between Marx's earlier writings, such as ''[[The German Ideology]]'' and ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', and the late ones, ''Das Kapital'' and ''Grundrisse'',<ref>[[Ellen Meiksins Wood|Wood, Ellen Meiksins]] (2002) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FZPyKjVguVoC The Origins of Capitalism: A Longer View]'' London: Verso p.35</ref> suggesting that Marx's views evolved, though the main themes remained the same.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAs Martin Nicolaus and others have argued, the ''Grundrisse'' is crucial for understanding Marx's mature analysis of capitalism, even though, historically, it has been far less influential in the development of the various strands of [[Marxist theory]] than earlier texts such as the ''Communist Manifesto'', the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'', and ''The German Ideology''.

The series of seven notebooks was rough-drafted by Marx, chiefly for purposes of self-clarification, during the winter of 1857\u20138. Left aside by Marx in 1858, it remained unpublished until 1939.<ref>https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4356-marx-was-a-fully-automated-luxury-communist</ref>\n\n==Contents==\nThe ''Grundrisse'' is very wide-ranging in subject matter and covers all six sections of Marx's economics (of which only one, the first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'', ever reached a final form). It is often described as the rough draft of ''Das Kapital'', although there is considerable disagreement about the exact relationship between the two texts, particularly around the issue of [[methodology]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nDue to its breadth and its incorporation of themes from Marx's earlier writings, the ''Grundrisse'' is central to Marx's body of work. Its subject matter includes [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]], [[relations of production]], [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]], [[Trade|exchange]], [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], [[Value (economics)|value]], [[Labour (economics)|labor]], [[capitalism]], the rise of [[technology]] and [[automation]], pre-capitalist forms of social organization, and the preconditions for a [[Communism|communist]] revolution. Scholars have noted major differences between Marx's earlier writings, such as ''[[The German Ideology]]'' and ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', and the late ones, ''Das Kapital'' and ''Grundrisse'',<ref>[[Ellen Meiksins Wood|Wood, Ellen Meiksins]] (2002) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FZPyKjVguVoC The Origins of Capitalism: A Longer View]'' London: Verso p.35</ref> suggesting that Marx's views evolved, though the main themes remained the same.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nAs Martin Nicolaus and others have argued, the ''Grundrisse'' is crucial for understanding Marx's mature analysis of capitalism, even though, historically, it has been far less influential in the development of the various strands of [[Marxist theory]] than earlier texts such as the ''Communist Manifesto'', the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'', and ''The German Ideology''.  Towards the end of his life, Marx, according to Nicolaus, viewed the latter \u201cwith a scepticism bordering on rejection.\u201d  The ''Grundrisse'', on the other hand, was one of the few texts which Marx spoke of \u201cwith a tone of achievement and a sense of accomplishment.\u201d<ref>Nicolaus, Martin. \"The Unknown Marx,\" ''New Left Review'' I/48, March\u2013April 1968</ref> If this is true, possibly the main reason is that the more substantive first part of ''The German Ideology'' was largely written by [[Friedrich Engels]] while the subsequent parts, satirizing the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] apostasies and word-mongering of Left-[[Hegelian]] philosophers, were written by Marx himself.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nFrench philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] believed that Marx's thought had been misunderstood and underestimated.
