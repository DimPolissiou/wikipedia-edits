It took place from April 9, 1940, until June 10, 1940. The Allied campaign did not succeed, and it resulted in the fleeing of King [[Haakon VII]] along with the remainder of the royal family to [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn April, the United Kingdom and France came to Norway's aid with an expeditionary force. Despite moderate success in the northern parts of Norway, the Allies were eventually compelled to withdraw by Germany's [[Battle of France|invasion of France]] in May, and the Norwegian government sought [[Government in exile|exile]] in London. The campaign ended with the occupation of Norway by Germany, and the continued fighting by [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|exiled Norwegian forces]] from abroad. The 62 days of fighting made Norway the nation that withstood a German land invasion for the second longest period of time, after the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Outbreak of the Second World War===\nBritain and France had signed military assistance treaties with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and two days after the German [[Invasion of Poland]] (on 1 September 1939), both declared war against [[Nazi Germany]]. However, neither country mounted significant offensive operations and for several months no major engagements occurred in what became known as the [[Phoney War]] or \"Twilight War\". [[Winston Churchill]] in particular wished to move the war into a more active phase, in contrast to Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].<ref name=lunde3>Lunde 2009, p. 3</ref>\n\nDuring this time both sides wished to open secondary fronts. For the Allies, in particular the French, this was based on a desire to avoid repeating the [[trench warfare]] of the [[First World War]], which had occurred along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Franco-German border]].<ref name=lunde3/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, the Norwegian government had mobilized parts of the [[Norwegian Army]] and all but two of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]'s warships. The [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] were also called up to protect Norwegian neutrality from violations by the warring countries. The first such violations were the sinkings in Norwegian territorial waters of several British ships by German [[U-boat]]s. In the following months aircraft from all the belligerents violated Norwegian neutrality.<ref name=vakt>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars |last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=n\u00f8ytralitetsvakt|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=313 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately after the outbreak of war, the British began pressuring the Norwegian government to provide the United Kingdom with the services of the Norwegian merchant navy, themselves being in dire need of shipping in order to oppose the Nazi regime. Following protracted negotiations between 25 September and 20 November 1939, the Norwegians agreed to charter 150 [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]], as well as other ships with a tonnage of 450,000 gross tons. The Norwegian government's concern for the country's supply lines played an important role in persuading them to accept the agreement.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Atle|last=Thowsen |authorlink=Atle Thowsen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=tonnasjeavtalen med Storbritannia|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=422|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\n===Value of Norway===\nNorway, although neutral, was considered strategically important for both sides of the war for several reasons. First was the importance of the iron ore that came through the port of [[Narvik]], from which large quantities of [[Swedish iron ore during World War II|iron ore from Sweden]] (on which Germany depended), were exported; this route was especially important during the winter months when much of the [[Baltic Sea]] was frozen over.<ref>Shirer 1990, p. 673-674</ref> Narvik became of greater significance to the British when it became apparent that Operation [[Operation Catherine|''Catherine'']], a plan to gain control of the Baltic Sea, would not be realized.<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 1\u201312</ref> [[Grand Admiral|''Gro\u00dfadmiral'']] [[Erich Raeder]] had pointed out several times in 1939 the potential danger to Germany of Britain seizing the initiative and launching its own invasion in Scandinavia \u2013 if the powerful Royal Navy had bases at [[Bergen]], Narvik and [[Trondheim]], the [[North Sea]] would be virtually closed to Germany, and the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' would be at risk even in the Baltic.\n\nControlling Norway would also be a strategic asset in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].

By early 1940 their [[6th Division (Norway)|6th Division]] in [[Finnmark]] and [[Troms]] fielded 9,500 troops to defend against Soviet attack, positioned mostly in the eastern regions of Finnmark.

With the [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] on 12 March 1940, the Finland-related Allied plans were dropped. The abandonment of the planned landings put immense French pressure on Neville Chamberlain's British government, and eventually led to the Allies laying mines off the Norwegian coast on 8 April.<ref name=planer /><ref name=finland />\n\n===Vidkun Quisling and initial German investigation===\nIt was originally thought by the German High Command that having Norway remain neutral was in its interest.

When ''Altmark'' began the return journey to Germany she carried 299 prisoners taken from the Allied ships sunk by ''Admiral Graf Spee''.<ref name=altmark/> ''Altmark'' entered Norwegian territorial waters near the [[Trondheimsfjord]], flying the Imperial Service Flag (''Reichsdienstflagge''). A Norwegian naval escort was provided as ''Altmark'' proceeded southwards, hugging the Norwegian coastline. As ''Altmark'' was nearing Bergen harbour on 14 February, the Norwegian naval authorities demanded to inspect the German ship. Even though international law did not ban the transfer of prisoners of war through neutral waters, the German captain refused the inspection. This led the naval commander in Bergen, Admiral [[Carsten Tank-Nielsen]], to deny ''Altmark'' access to the restricted-access war harbour. Tank-Nielsen was however overruled by his superior, Commanding Admiral [[Henry Diesen]], and ''Altmark'' was escorted through the harbour. According to Norwegian neutrality regulations, government ships operated by the warring countries were not allowed to enter a number of strategically important Norwegian ports. This violation of the regulations was allowed because Admiral Diesen feared that the British would intercept ''Altmark'' if she was forced to sail closer to the edge of Norwegian territorial waters.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nOn 16 February, ''Altmark'' was spotted by three British aircraft. The discovery of the ship's location led the Royal Navy to send one light cruiser and five destroyers patrolling nearby to the area. Under the attack of two British destroyers (HMS [[HMS Ivanhoe (D16)|''Ivanhoe'']] and [[HMS Intrepid (D10)|''Intrepid'']]), ''Altmark'' fled into the J\u00f8ssingfjord. At the time ''Altmark'' was escorted by the Norwegian torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Skarv|1906|2}}. She was joined later in the fjord by the torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Kjell||2}} and the patrol boat ''Firern''. As ''Cossack'' entered the fjord at 22:20 local time, the Norwegian vessels did not intervene when the British boarded ''Altmark'' in the late hours of 16 February. The boarding action led to the freeing of 299 Allied prisoners of war held on the German ship. The boarding party killed seven Germans in the process.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nFollowing the incident, the Germans sent strong protests to the Norwegian government. The Norwegians also sent protests to the British government. While Norwegian, Swedish and American experts in international law described the British action as a violation of Norwegian neutrality, the United Kingdom declared that the incident was at the most a technical violation that had been morally justified.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nThe ''Altmark'' incident led to the Germans speeding up their planning for an invasion of Norway. On 21 February, General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]] was placed in charge of planning the invasion and in command of the land-based forces. The official approval for the invasion and occupation of [[Denmark]] and Norway was signed by Hitler on 1 March.<ref name=grove/><ref name=krono/><ref name=altmark/>\n\n==Initial plans==\n\n===Allied plans===\nWith the end of the [[Winter War]], the Allies determined that any occupation of Norway or Sweden would likely do more harm than good, possibly driving the neutral countries into an alliance with Germany. However, the new French prime minister, [[Paul Reynaud]], took a more aggressive stance than his predecessor and wanted some form of action taken against Germany.<ref name=planer/> Churchill was a strong agitator for action in Scandinavia, because he wanted to cut Germany off from Sweden and push the Scandinavian countries to side with the United Kingdom. This initially involved a 1939 plan to penetrate the Baltic with a naval force. This was soon changed to a plan involving the mining of Norwegian waters to stop iron ore shipments from Narvik and provoke Germany into attacking Norway, where it could be defeated by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 11\u201314</ref>\n\nIt was agreed to utilize Churchill's naval mining plan, [[Operation Wilfred]], designed to remove the sanctuary of the Leads and force transport ships into international waters where the Royal Navy could engage and destroy them. Accompanying this would be [[Plan R 4]], an operation where, upon almost certain German counteraction to Operation Wilfred, the Allies would then proceed to occupy Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, and [[Stavanger]]. The planners hoped that the operation would not provoke the Norwegians to resist the Allies with armed force.<ref>Lunde 2009, p. 34</ref>\n\nThe Allies disagreed over the additional [[Operation Royal Marine]], where mines would also be placed in the [[Rhine River]]. While the British supported this operation, the French were against it, since they also depended on the Rhine and feared German reprisals on French soil. Because of this delay, Operation Wilfred, originally scheduled for 5 April, was delayed until 8 April when the British agreed to perform the Norwegian operations separately from those on the continent.<ref name=planer/>\n\n===German plans===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2006-0529-501, Nikolaus v. Falkenhorst.jpg|thumb|General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]] planned and led the German invasion and conquest of Norway.]]\n\n{{Main|Operation Weser\u00fcbung}}\n\nAlready in low-priority planning for considerable time, Operation Weser\u00fcbung{{#tag:ref|Operation Weser\u00fcbung, as part of common military [[disinformation]] procedure, was codenamed after the [[Weser River]] in Germany, while ''\u00dcbung'' means \"exercise\" in German.|group=note}} found a new sense of urgency after the ''Altmark'' incident.<ref name=grove/> The goals of the invasion were to secure the port of Narvik and the Leads for ore transport, and to control the country to prevent collaboration with the Allies. It was to be presented as an armed protection of Norway's neutrality.\n\nOne subject debated by German strategists was the occupation of Denmark. Denmark was considered vital because its location facilitated greater air and naval control of the area. While some wanted to simply pressure Denmark to acquiesce, it was eventually determined that it would be safer for the operation if Denmark were captured by force.\n\nAnother matter that caused additional reworking of the plan was ''Fall Gelb'', the proposed invasion of northern France and the [[Low Countries]], which would require the bulk of German forces. Because some forces were needed for both invasions, ''Weser\u00fcbung'' could not occur at the same time as Gelb, and because the nights were shortening as spring approached, which were vital cover for the naval forces, it therefore had to be sooner. Eventually, on 2 April, the Germans set 9 April as the day of the invasion (''Wesertag''), and 04:15 (Norwegian time) as the hour of the landings (''Weserzeit'').<ref name=krono/>\n\nIn Norway, the plan called for the capture of six primary targets by [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] landings: [[Oslo]], [[Kristiansand]], [[Egersund]], Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik. Additionally, supporting ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroops) were to capture other key locations such as airfields at [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu]] outside of Oslo and Sola outside of Stavanger. The plan was designed to quickly overwhelm the Norwegian defenders and occupy these vital areas before any form of organized resistance could be mounted. The following forces were thus organized:\n* ''Gruppe 1'': Ten destroyers transporting 2,000 ''[[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]]'' troops commanded by General [[Eduard Dietl]] to Narvik<ref name=narvik>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Berit|last=N\u00f8kleby|authorlink=Berit N\u00f8kleby|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Narvik|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=284\u2013285|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n* ''Gruppe 2'': The [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} and four destroyers to Trondheim\n* ''Gruppe 3'': The [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6nigsberg||2}}, with several smaller support vessels to Bergen\n* ''Gruppe 4'': The light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}} and several smaller support vessels to Kristiansand\n* ''Gruppe 5'': The heavy cruisers {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}} and several smaller support vessels to Oslo\n* ''Gruppe 6'': Four minesweepers to Egersund\n\nAdditionally, the [[battleship]]s {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} would escort ''Gruppe 1'' and ''Gruppe 2'' as they travelled together, and there would also be several echelons of transports carrying additional troops, fuel and equipment.\n\nAgainst Denmark, two motorized brigades would capture bridges and troops; paratroops would capture Aalborg airfield in the north; and heavy fighters of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' would destroy the Danish aircraft on the ground. While there were also several naval task groups organized for this invasion, none of them contained any large ships. Unescorted [[troopship]]s would transport in soldiers to capture the Danish High Command in [[Copenhagen]].\n\nThe Germans hoped they could avoid armed confrontation with the native populations in both countries, and German troops were instructed to fire only if fired upon.\n\n==Opposing forces==\n{{Main|Norwegian Campaign order of battle}}\n\n===German===\nThe German forces used in the campaign were some 100,000 troops in seven divisions and one ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'' battalion, as well as [[panzer]] and artillery units.

''Renown''{{'}}s force was soon caught in a heavy snowstorm, and {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}, one of the destroyer escorts, had to drop out of formation to search for a man swept overboard. The weather aided the Germans, providing a screen for their forces, and in the early morning they sent out ''Gruppe 1'' and ''Gruppe 2'', who had the largest distance to travel.\n\nAlthough the weather did make reconnaissance difficult, the two German groups were discovered {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Lindesnes|the Naze]] (the southernmost part of Norway) slightly after 08:00 by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) patrols and reported as one cruiser and six destroyers. A trailing squad of bombers sent out to attack the German ships found them {{convert|125|km|mi|abbr=on}} farther north than they had been before. No damage was done during the attack, but the German group's strength was reassessed as being one battlecruiser,{{#tag:ref|At the time, the Royal Navy classified the {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s as battlecruisers.|group=note}} two cruisers and ten destroyers. Because of a strict enforcement of [[radio silence]], the bombers were not able to report this until 17:30.\n\nOn learning of the German movement, the [[Admiralty]] came to the conclusion that the Germans were attempting to break the blockade that the Allies had placed on Germany and use their fleet to disrupt Atlantic [[trade route]]s. Admiral Sir [[Charles Forbes (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Forbes]], [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British [[Home Fleet]], was notified of this and set out to intercept them at 20:15.\n\nWith both sides unaware of the magnitude of the situation, they proceeded as planned. ''Renown'' arrived at the Vestfjord late that night and maintained position near the entrance while the minelaying destroyers proceeded to their task. Meanwhile, the Germans launched the remainder of their invasion force. The first direct contact between the two sides occurred the next morning without either side's intention.\n\n''Glowworm'', on her way to rejoin ''Renown'', happened to come up behind {{ship|German destroyer|Z11 Bernd von Arnim||2}} and then {{ship|German destroyer|Z18 Hans L\u00fcdemann||2}} in the heavy fog around 08:00 on 8 April. Immediately a skirmish broke out and the German destroyers fled, signalling for help. The request was soon answered by ''Admiral Hipper'', which quickly crippled ''Glowworm''. During the action, ''Glowworm'' rammed ''Admiral Hipper''.<ref name=grove/> Significant damage was done to ''Admiral Hipper''{{'}}s starboard side, and ''Glowworm'' was destroyed by a close range salvo immediately afterwards. During the fight ''Glowworm'' had broken radio silence and informed the Admiralty of her situation. She was not able to complete her transmission though, and all the Admiralty knew was that ''Glowworm'' had been confronted by a large German ship, shots were fired, and contact with the destroyer could not be re-established. In response, the Admiralty ordered ''Renown'' and her single destroyer escort (the other two had gone to friendly ports for fuel), to abandon her post at the Vestfjord and head to ''Glowworm''{{'}}s last known location. At 10:45, the remaining eight destroyers of the minelaying force were ordered to join them as well.\n\nOn the morning of 8 April, the Polish submarine {{ORP|Orze\u0142|1938|6}} confronted and sank the clandestine German troop transport ship {{MS|Rio de Janeiro|1914|2}} off the southern Norwegian port of [[Lillesand]].<ref name=rio>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Fran\u00e7ois|last=Kersaudy|authorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Kersaudy|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Rio de Janeiro|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=357|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Discovered amongst the wreckage were uniformed German soldiers and various military supplies. Though ''Orze\u0142'' reported the incident to the Admiralty, they were too concerned by the situation with ''Glowworm'' and the presumed German breakout to give it much thought and did not pass the information on. Many of the German soldiers from the wreck were rescued by Norwegian fishing boats and the destroyer {{HNoMS|Odin|1939|2}}. On interrogation the survivors disclosed that they were assigned to protect Bergen from the Allies. This information was passed on to Oslo where the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] ignored the sinking due to being distracted by the British mining operations off the Norwegian coast.<ref name=rio/>\n\nAt 14:00, the Admiralty received word that aerial reconnaissance had located a group of German ships a considerable distance west-northwest of Trondheim, bearing west. This reinforced the notion that the Germans were indeed intending a breakout, and the Home Fleet changed direction from northeast to northwest to again try to intercept. Additionally, Churchill cancelled Plan R 4 and ordered the four cruisers carrying the soldiers and their supplies to disembark their cargo and join the Home Fleet. In fact, the German ships, ''Gruppe 2'', were only performing delaying circling manoeuvres in order to approach their destination of Trondheim at the designated time.\n\nThat night, after learning of numerous sightings of German ships south of Norway, Charles Forbes began to doubt the validity of the breakout idea, and he ordered the Home Fleet to head south to the [[Skagerrak]]. He also ordered {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}}, along with another cruiser and a few destroyers, to head north and join ''Renown''.\n\nAt 23:00, as Forbes was just learning of the incident with ''Orze\u0142'', ''Gruppe 5'' was confronted by the Norwegian patrol vessel {{HNoMS|Pol III||2}} at the entrance to the [[Oslofjord]]. ''Pol III'' quickly sent an alarm to the coastal batteries on Rau\u00f8y (Rau\u00f8y island) and opened fire on the [[German torpedo boats of World War II|torpedo boat]] {{ship|German torpedo boat|Albatros||2}} with her single gun shortly before colliding with it. ''Albatros'' and two of her companions responded with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire, killing the Norwegian captain and setting ''Pol III'' on fire. ''Gruppe 5'' continued into the Oslofjord and cleared the outer batteries without incident. Several of the smaller German ships then broke off in order to capture the bypassed fortifications along with [[Horten]].\n\nThis activity did not go unnoticed, and soon reports had reached Oslo, leading to a midnight session of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norwegian cabinet]]. At this meeting, the cabinet issued orders for the mobilization of four of the six field brigades of the Norwegian Army. The members of the cabinet failed to understand that the partial mobilization they had ordered would, according to the regulations in place, be carried out in secret and without public declaration. Troops would be issued their mobilization orders by post. The only member of the cabinet with in-depth knowledge of the mobilization system, defence minister [[Birger Ljungberg]], failed to explain the procedure to his colleagues. He would later be heavily criticized for this oversight, which led to unnecessary delays in the Norwegian mobilization. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Ljungberg had dismissed repeated demands for a total and immediate mobilization, made by the chief of the general staff, [[Rasmus Hatledal]]. Hatledal had approached Ljungberg on 5, 6 and 8 April, asking the defence minister to request the cabinet to issue orders for mobilization. The issue had been discussed in the evening of 8 April, after the Commanding General, [[Kristian Laake]], had joined the calls for a mobilization. At that time the mobilization had been limited to two field battalions in [[\u00d8stfold]], further delaying the larger-scale call-up of troops. When Laake's call for mobilization was finally accepted at some time between 03:30 to 04:00 on 9 April, the Commanding General assumed, like defence minister Ljungberg, that the cabinet knew that they were issuing a partial and silent mobilization. The poor communication between the Norwegian armed forces and the civilian authorities caused much confusion in the early days of the German invasion.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars|last=Borgersrud|authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Ljungberg, Birger |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=250|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=mob>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Arnfinn|last=Moland|authorlink=Arnfinn Moland|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=mobiliseringen i 1940|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=274\u2013275|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lars|last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=stille mobilisering|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=399\u2013400|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAt about this time, further north, ''Renown'' was heading back to Vestfjord after reaching ''Glowworm''{{'}}s last known location and not finding anything.

''Renown'' engaged the two battleships off the [[Lofoten|Lofoten Archipelago]], and during [[Action off Lofoten|the short battle]] ''Renown'' scored several hits on the German vessels, forcing them to flee north.

With ''Renown'' and her escorts earlier diverted to investigate the ''Glowworm'' incident, no British ships stood in their way, and they entered the area unopposed. By the time they had reached the inner area near Narvik, most of the destroyers had peeled off from the main formation to capture the outer batteries of the Ofotfjord, leaving only three to contend with the two old Norwegian [[coastal defence ship]]s standing guard in Narvik harbour, {{HNoMS|Eidsvold||2}} and {{HNoMS|Norge||2}}. Although antiquated, the two coastal defence ships were quite capable of taking on the much more lightly armed and armoured destroyers. After a quick parley with the captain of ''Eidsvold'', [[Odd Isaachsen Willoch]], the German ships opened fire pre-emptively on the coastal defence ship, sinking her after hitting her with three torpedoes. ''Norge'' entered into the fray shortly after and began to fire on the destroyers, but her marksmen were inexperienced and she did not hit the Germans ships before being sunk by a salvo of torpedoes from the German destroyers.\n\nFollowing the sinking of ''Eidsvold'' and ''Norge'', the commander of Narvik, [[Konrad Sundlo]], surrendered the land forces in the town without a fight.<ref name=narvik/>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-757-0038N-11A, Norwegen, Schwerer Kreuzer.jpg|thumb|upright|The German cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' landing troops in Trondheim]]\nAt Trondheim, ''Gruppe 2'' also faced only minor resistance to their landings.

She carried much of the administrative personnel intended both for the occupation of Norway and also for the headquarters of the army division assigned to seize Oslo. The cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, also damaged in the attack and believing ''Bl\u00fccher'' had entered a minefield, withdrew with ''Gruppe 5'', 19&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) south to [[Son, Norway|Sonsbukten]] where she unloaded her troops. This distance delayed the arrival of the main German invasion force for Oslo by over 24 hours, though the Norwegian capital would still be captured less than 12 hours after the loss of ''Bl\u00fccher'' by troops flown into [[Fornebu Airport]] near the city.<ref name=blucher/>\n[[File:German soldiers in Oslo 9 April 1940.jpg|thumb|left|German soldiers marching through Oslo on the first day of the invasion]]\nThe delay induced by the Norwegian forces gave time for the royal family, Parliament, [[Flight of the Norwegian National Treasury|and with them the national treasury]], to flee the capital and continue the fighting against the invasion force.<ref name=grove/><ref name=blucher/>\n\nFornebu Airport was originally supposed to be secured by paratroops an hour before the first troops were flown in, but the initial force became lost in the fog and did not arrive.

The Norwegian Army Air Service's [[Jagevingen]] fighter flight based on Fornebu Airport resisted with their [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane fighters until ammunition ran out and then flew off to whatever secondary airfields were available. The ground personnel of the Fighter Wing soon ran out of ammunition for their anti-aircraft machine guns as well; in the general confusion and focus on readying the fighters for action, no one had the presence of mind or the time to issue small-arms ammunition for the personal weapons of the ground personnel. Resistance at Fornebu Airport came to an end, with the Germans' only loss being a single Ju 52.<ref>Dildy, Doug.

In order to secure the Skagerrak strait between Norway and Denmark, the air bases in Denmark had to be seized. The domination of this strait would prevent the Royal Navy from interfering with the main supply lines of the invasion forces. In this respect, the occupation of Denmark was considered to be vital. The capture of [[Aalborg Airport]] was considered particularly important in this respect.<ref name=tyskbomb>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lars|last=Borgersrud|authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=bombing, tysk|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=50|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nThe German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' crossed the Danish border around 05:15 on 9 April. In a coordinated operation, German troops disembarked at the docks of [[Langelinie]] in the Danish capital, [[Copenhagen]], and began occupying the city. German paratroops also captured Aalborg Airport. Simultaneously, an ultimatum was presented by the German ambassador to King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]]. The Danish army was small, ill-prepared and used obsolete equipment, but resisted in several parts of the country; most importantly, the Royal Guards located at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen, and forces in the vicinity of [[Haderslev]] in [[South Jutland County|South Jutland]]. By 06:00, the small [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish Air Force]] had been taken out and 28 German [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers were threatening to drop their bombs over Copenhagen. King Christian, having consulted with Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]], Foreign Minister [[P. Munch]] and the commanders of the army and the navy, decided to capitulate, believing that further resistance would only result in a useless loss of Danish lives. By 08:43 Denmark had capitulated.<ref>Dildy 2007, pp. 34\u201336</ref> The Danish public was taken completely by surprise by the occupation, and was instructed by the government to cooperate with the German authorities.

Not willing to disperse too thinly due to the unknown location of the two German battleships, the Home Fleet chose to focus on nearby Bergen and dispatched an attack force. RAF reconnaissance soon reported stronger opposition than anticipated, and this, along with the possibility that the Germans might be controlling the shore defences, caused them to recall the force and instead use the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} to launch torpedo bombers at the enemy ships. The attack never commenced though, as Luftwaffe bombers launched an assault of their own against the Home Fleet first. This attack sank the destroyer {{HMS|Gurkha|F20|6}} and then forced the Home Fleet to withdraw north when their anti-aircraft measures proved ineffective. This German [[air superiority]] in the area led the British to decide that all southern regions had to be left to submarines and the RAF, while surface vessels would concentrate on the north.<ref name=grove/>\n\nIn addition to the German landings in south and central Norway, the Admiralty was also informed via press reports that a single German destroyer was in Narvik. In response to this, they ordered the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, mostly consisting of ships previously serving as escort destroyers for Operation Wilfred, to engage. This flotilla, under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Bernard Warburton-Lee]], had already detached from {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} during her pursuit of {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, being ordered to guard the entrance to the Vestfjord. At 16:00 on 9 April, the flotilla sent an officer ashore at [[Tran\u00f8y]] {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Narvik and learned from the locals that the German force was 4\u20136 destroyers and a submarine. Warburton-Lee sent these findings back to the Admiralty, concluding with his intention to attack the next day at \"dawn, high water\", which would give him the element of surprise and protection against any mines. This decision was approved by the Admiralty in a telegram that night.\n\n====First Battle of Narvik====\nThough ten German destroyers had originally taken Narvik, only five remained in the harbor, with three others moving North and the remaining two going west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_narvik_first.html|title=First battle of Narvik, 10 April 1940|publisher=|date=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> Early the following morning, Warburton-Lee led his flagship, {{HMS|Hardy|H87|6}}, and four other destroyers into the Ofotfjord. At 04:30, he arrived at Narvik harbor and entered along with {{HMS|Hunter|H35|6}} and {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}, leaving {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|6}} and {{HMS|Hostile|H55|6}} to guard the entrance and watch the shore batteries. The fog and snow were extremely heavy, allowing Warburton-Lee's force to approach undetected. When they arrived at the harbour itself they found five German destroyers and opened fire, starting the [[Battles of Narvik|First Battle of Narvik]]. Warburton-Lee's ships made three passes on the enemy ships, being joined after the first by ''Hotspur'' and ''Hostile'', and sank two of the destroyers, disabled one more, and sank six tankers and supply ships. The German commander, Commodore [[Friedrich Bonte]], lost his life when his flagship {{ship|German destroyer|Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp||2}} was sunk.\n\nHowever, Captain Warburton-Lee would make a fatal error when he decided to attack the German destroyers one last time. The German destroyers from the North and West converged on the British Fleet at 06:00, while the British were preparing for the final attack. ''Hardy'' was severely damaged and beached, and Warburton-Lee was killed. ''Hunter'' and ''Hotspur'' were both critically damaged, and ''Hotspur'' ran into the sinking ''Hunter''. ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' meanwhile had raced ahead, but turned about and came back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''. The German destroyers were low on fuel and ammunition, allowing ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' to come back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1038-06, Kiel, Schwerer Kreuzer \"L\u00fctzow\".jpg|thumb|{{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} in [[Kiel]] after being torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|2}} on her way back from Norway]]\n\n====Second Battle of Narvik====\nShortly after the First Battle of Narvik, two more German ships were sunk by British forces. During the night of 9/10 April, the submarine {{HMS|Truant|N68|6}} intercepted and sank the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}} shortly after she had left Kristiansand. On 10 April, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] made a long-range attack from their base at [[RNAS Hatston]] (also called HMS ''Sparrowhawk'') in the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] against German warships in Bergen harbour. The attack sank the disabled German light cruiser ''K\u00f6nigsberg'';\n\nOn 10 April, ''Furious'' and the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} joined the Home Fleet, and another air attack was made against Trondheim hoping to sink ''Admiral Hipper''. ''Admiral Hipper'', however, had already managed to escape through the watch set up outside of the port and was on her way back to Germany when the attack was launched; none of the remaining German destroyers or support ships were hit in the assault. Better luck was had in the south when {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|6}} severely damaged the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} at midnight on 11 April, putting the German ship out of commission for a year.\n\nWith it becoming more evident the German fleet had slipped out of Norwegian waters, the Home Fleet continued north to Narvik in the hope of catching the remaining destroyers. En route the ships suffered further harassment from German bombers, forcing them to divert to the west away from the shoreline. By 12 April, they were in range of Narvik and an aerial attack on Narvik from ''Furious'' was attempted, but the results were disappointing. It was instead decided to send in the battleship ''Warspite'' and a powerful escort force, to be commanded by Whitworth.\n\n[[File:UK-NWE-Norway-2.jpg|300px|thumb|The British-German naval battles at Narvik on 10 and 13 April]]\nOn the morning of 13 April, Whitworth's force entered the Vestfjord using ''Warspite''{{'}}s scouting aircraft to guide the way. Aside from locating two of the German destroyers, the scouting aircraft also sank an enemy submarine, the first such occurrence. ''Warspite''{{'}}s destroyers travelled {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in advance of the battleship and were the first to engage their German counterparts which had come to meet them, thus starting the [[Battles of Narvik|Second Battle of Narvik]]. Though neither side inflicted notable damage, the German ships were running low on ammunition and were gradually pushed back to the harbour. By that afternoon, most attempted to flee up the [[Rombaksfjord]], the only exception being {{ship|German destroyer|Z19 Hermann K\u00fcnne||2}} which beached herself as she made for the Herjangsfjord and was destroyed by {{HMS|Eskimo|F75|6}}. Four British destroyers continued to chase the German ships up through the Rombaksfjord, ''Eskimo'' was soon damaged by the waiting opposition. However, the German situation was hopeless, having run out of fuel and ammunition, and by the time the remaining British ships arrived, the German crews had abandoned and scuttled their ships. By 18:30 the British ships were making their way out of the now cleared fjord.\n\n==Norwegian situation==\nThe German invasions for the most part achieved their goal of simultaneous assault and caught the Norwegian forces off guard, a situation not aided by the Norwegian government's order for only a partial mobilization. Not all was lost for the Allies though, as the repulsion of the German ''Gruppe 5'' in the Oslofjord gave a few additional hours of time which the Norwegians used to evacuate the Royal family and the Norwegian Government to [[Hamar]]. With the government now fugitive, [[Vidkun Quisling]] used the opportunity to take control of a radio broadcasting station and announce a coup, with himself as the new [[Prime Minister of Norway]]. Quisling's coup and his list of new ministers was announced at 19:32. The Quisling coup government remained in place until 15 April, when the [[Administrative Council (Norway)|Administrative Council]] was appointed by the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] to deal with the civilian administration of the occupied areas of Norway, and Quisling resigned.<ref name=krono/><ref name=admin>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Hans Fredrik |last=Dahl |authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl | encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Administrasjonsr\u00e5det |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=14\u201315 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Haakon7Small.jpg|thumb|left|The German forces attempted to kill or capture the 67-year-old King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]].

His first task was to secure the Oslofjord area, then to use the [[196th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|196th]] and [[163rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|163rd Infantry Divisions]] to establish contact with the forces at Trondheim.\n\n==Ground campaign==\nWhen the nature of the German invasion became apparent to the British military, it began to make preparations for a counter-attack. Dissension amongst the various branches was strong though, as the [[British Army]], after conferring with Otto Ruge, wanted to assault Trondheim in Central Norway while Churchill insisted on reclaiming Narvik. It was decided to send troops to both locations as a compromise. Admiral [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork and Orrery|Lord Cork]] was in overall command of the Allied operations.<ref>Dildy 2007, p. 17</ref>\n\n===Campaign in eastern Norway===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26353, Norwegen, Kampf um ein brennendes Dorf.jpg|thumb|German infantry attacking through a burning Norwegian village]]\nAfter the appointment of Ruge as Commanding General on 10 April, the Norwegian strategy was to fight delaying actions against the Germans advancing northwards from Oslo to link up with the invasion forces at Trondheim. The main aim of the Norwegian effort in [[eastern Norway]] was to give the Allies enough time to recapture Trondheim, and start a counter-offensive against the German main force in the Oslo area. The region surrounding the Oslofjord was defended by the [[1st Division (Norway)|1st Division]], commanded by Major General [[Carl Johan Erichsen]]. The rest of the region was covered by the [[2nd Division (Norway)|2nd Division]], commanded by Major General [[Jacob Hvinden Haug]]. Having been prevented from mobilizing in an orderly fashion by the German invasion, improvised Norwegian units were sent into action against the Germans. Several of the units facing the German advance were led by officers especially selected by Ruge to replace commanders who had failed to show sufficient initiative and aggression in the early days of the campaign. The German offensive aimed at linking up their forces in Oslo and Trondheim began on 14 April, with an advance north from Oslo towards the [[Gudbrandsdalen]] and [[\u00d8sterdalen]] valleys. [[H\u00f8nefoss]] was the first town to fall to the advancing German forces. North of H\u00f8nefoss the Germans began meeting Norwegian resistance, first delaying actions and later units fighting organized defensive actions. During intense fighting with heavy casualties on both sides, troops of the Norwegian Infantry Regiment 6 blunted the German advance at the village of [[Haugsbygd]] on 15 April. The Germans only broke through the Norwegian lines at Haugsbygd the next day after employing panzers for the first time in Norway.

The same day that the 1st Division began crossing into Sweden, the two battalions of Infantry Regiment no. 3 at [[Heistadmoen|Heistadmoen Army Camp]] in [[Kongsberg]] capitulated. The [[3rd Division (Norway)|3rd Division]], commanded by Major General [[Einar Liljedahl]] and tasked with defending [[southern Norway]], surrendered to the Germans in [[Setesdal]] on 15 April, having seen no action up to that point. Some 2,000 soldiers marched into captivity in the Setesdal capitulation. With the abandonment on 20 April of the Franco-British plans for recapturing the central Norwegian city of Trondheim, Ruge's strategy became practically infeasible.<ref name=forsvar/><ref name=Ruge/><ref name=skodvin54>Skodvin 1991, p. 54</ref>\n\nWith the calling off of the Allied plans for recapturing Trondheim, British forces which had been [[\u00c5ndalsnes landings|landed at \u00c5ndalsnes]] moved into eastern Norway. By 20 April three British half-battalions had moved as far south as [[F\u00e5berg]], near the town of [[Lillehammer]].<ref name=skodvin56/> The main British units deployed to eastern Norway in April 1940 were the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorials]] of the [[148th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|148th Infantry Brigade]] and the regular [[15th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|15th Infantry Brigade]].<ref>Derry 1952, pp. 97\u201398, 113, 115</ref> In a series of battles with Norwegian and British forces over the next weeks the Germans pushed northwards from Oslo, their main effort through the [[Gudbrandsdal]] valley.

In the [[Battle for Kvam]] on 25 and 26 April, the British managed to delay the German advance for two days of heavy fighting.

Some 2,000 German soldiers occupied Bergen and captured the Norwegian arms depots there. The small Norwegian infantry forces in Bergen retreated eastwards, blowing up two railway bridges and sections of road after them. Despite the loss of the cities, the regional commander, General [[William Steffens]], ordered a total mobilization. During mid-April the 6,000-strong Norwegian [[4th Division (Norway)|4th Division]], responsible for the defence of [[western Norway]], was mobilized around the town of [[Voss]] in [[Hordaland]].

Following the German invasion General Fleischer assumed the position of commander-in-chief of all Norwegian forces in northern Norway.

The naval forces in the area were led by [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork]] who had been ordered to rid the area of the Germans as soon as possible. In contrast, the commander of the ground forces, Major-General [[Pierse Joseph Mackesy|Pierse Mackesy]], was ordered not to land his forces in any area strongly held by the Germans and to avoid damaging populated areas. The two met on 15 April to determine the best course of action. Lord Cork argued for an immediate assault on Narvik and Mackesy countered that such a move would lead to heavy casualties for his attacking troops. Cork eventually conceded to Mackesy's viewpoint.\n\nMackesy's force was originally codenamed ''Avonforce'', later ''Rupertforce''.<ref>Sandvik 1965I, pp. 204\u2013206</ref><ref>Sandvik 1965II, p. 354</ref> The force consisted of the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]], led by Brigadier [[William Fraser (British Army officer)|William Fraser]], and French and Polish units led by Brigadier [[Antoine B\u00e9thouart]].<ref name=dildy29/> The main force began landing at [[Harstad]], a port town on the island of [[Hinn\u00f8ya]], on 14 April.

The 1,028-ship strong Nortraship was established on 22 April at a government meeting at [[Stugufl\u00e5ten]] in [[Romsdal]]. The Nortraship fleet consisted of some 85% of the pre-war Norwegian merchant fleet, the remaining 15% having been in Norway when the Germans invaded and been unable to escape. The Nortraship vessels were crewed by 27,000 sailors. In total 43 free Norwegian ships were sunk during the Norwegian Campaign, while another 29 were interned by the neutral Swedes.<ref name=krono/><ref name=handelsfl>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Atle |last=Thowsen |authorlink=Atle Thowsen | encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=handelsfl\u00e5ten |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=157 |language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Guri |last=Hjeltnes |authorlink=Guri Hjeltnes | encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=sj\u00f8folkene |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=380\u2013381 |language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref name=\"Skodvin 1991, p. 86\">Skodvin 1991, p. 86</ref> Nortraship gave the Norwegian government-in-exile economic independence and a basis for continued resistance from abroad.<ref name=\"Skodvin 1991, p. 86\"/>\n\nThe Allies achieved a partial success at Narvik.

After the fall of Norway, Scotland (especially the fleet bases at Scapa Flow and [[Rosyth]]) were seen as much more vulnerable to a diversionary assault by air- and sea-borne troops. German commerce raiders used Norway as a staging base to reach the North Atlantic. After Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941, air bases in Norway were also used to interdict the Allied [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] there, inflicting painful losses to shipping.<ref name=grove/>\n\n==In fiction==\n* The 1942 film ''[[They Raid by Night]]'' is set in Norway just after the campaign.\n* The 1942 film ''[[The Day Will Dawn]]'' is largely set in Norway just before and just after the invasion.\n* The invasion and the following occupation are depicted in the [[John Steinbeck]] novel ''[[The Moon Is Down]]'', although neither Germany nor Norway are referred to by name.\n* [[Foyle's War#Paul Milner|Paul Milner]], a major character in the television crime drama series ''[[Foyle's War]]'' that takes place in wartime Britain, served in the Norwegian Campaign and injured his leg there.\n* The adventure novel ''Biggles Defies the Swastika'' by [[W.

It took place from April 9, 1940, until June 10, 1940. The Allied campaign did not succeed, and it resulted in the fleeing of King [[Haakon VII]] along with the remainder of the royal family to [[Great Britain]].\n\nIn April, the United Kingdom and France came to Norway's aid with an expeditionary force. Despite moderate success in the northern parts of Norway, the Allies were eventually compelled to withdraw by Germany's [[Battle of France|invasion of France]] in May, and the Norwegian government sought [[Government in exile|exile]] in London. The campaign ended with the occupation of Norway by Germany, and the continued fighting by [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|exiled Norwegian forces]] from abroad. The 62 days of fighting made Norway the nation that withstood a German land invasion for the second longest period of time, after the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Outbreak of the Second World War===\nBritain and France had signed military assistance treaties with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and two days after the German [[Invasion of Poland]] (on 1 September 1939), both declared war against [[Nazi Germany]]. However, neither country mounted significant offensive operations and for several months no major engagements occurred in what became known as the [[Phoney War]] or \"Twilight War\". [[Winston Churchill]] in particular wished to move the war into a more active phase, in contrast to Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].<ref name=lunde3>Lunde 2009, p. 3</ref>\n\nDuring this time both sides wished to open secondary fronts. For the Allies, in particular the French, this was based on a desire to avoid repeating the [[trench warfare]] of the [[First World War]], which had occurred along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Franco-German border]].<ref name=lunde3/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, the Norwegian government had mobilized parts of the [[Norwegian Army]] and all but two of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]'s warships. The [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] were also called up to protect Norwegian neutrality from violations by the warring countries. The first such violations were the sinkings in Norwegian territorial waters of several British ships by German [[U-boat]]s. In the following months aircraft from all the belligerents violated Norwegian neutrality.<ref name=vakt>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars |last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=n\u00f8ytralitetsvakt|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=313 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately after the outbreak of war, the British began pressuring the Norwegian government to provide the United Kingdom with the services of the Norwegian merchant navy, themselves being in dire need of shipping in order to oppose the Nazi regime.

When ''Altmark'' began the return journey to Germany she carried 299 prisoners taken from the Allied ships sunk by ''Admiral Graf Spee''.<ref name=altmark/> ''Altmark'' entered Norwegian territorial waters near the [[Trondheimsfjord]], flying the Imperial Service Flag (''Reichsdienstflagge''). A Norwegian naval escort was provided as ''Altmark'' proceeded southwards, hugging the Norwegian coastline. As ''Altmark'' was nearing Bergen harbour on 14 February, the Norwegian naval authorities demanded to inspect the German ship. Even though international law did not ban the transfer of prisoners of war through neutral waters, the German captain refused the inspection. This led the naval commander in Bergen, Admiral [[Carsten Tank-Nielsen]], to deny ''Altmark'' access to the restricted-access war harbour. Tank-Nielsen was however overruled by his superior, Commanding Admiral [[Henry Diesen]], and ''Altmark'' was escorted through the harbour. According to Norwegian neutrality regulations, government ships operated by the warring countries were not allowed to enter a number of strategically important Norwegian ports. This violation of the regulations was allowed because Admiral Diesen feared that the British would intercept ''Altmark'' if she was forced to sail closer to the edge of Norwegian territorial waters.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nOn 16 February, ''Altmark'' was spotted by three British aircraft. The discovery of the ship's location led the Royal Navy to send one light cruiser and five destroyers patrolling nearby to the area. Under the attack of two British destroyers (HMS [[HMS Ivanhoe (D16)|''Ivanhoe'']] and [[HMS Intrepid (D10)|''Intrepid'']]), ''Altmark'' fled into the J\u00f8ssingfjord. At the time ''Altmark'' was escorted by the Norwegian torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Skarv|1906|2}}. She was joined later in the fjord by the torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Kjell||2}} and the patrol boat ''Firern''. As ''Cossack'' entered the fjord at 22:20 local time, the Norwegian vessels did not intervene when the British boarded ''Altmark'' in the late hours of 16 February. The boarding action led to the freeing of 299 Allied prisoners of war held on the German ship. The boarding party killed seven Germans in the process.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nFollowing the incident, the Germans sent strong protests to the Norwegian government. The Norwegians also sent protests to the British government. While Norwegian, Swedish and American experts in international law described the British action as a violation of Norwegian neutrality, the United Kingdom declared that the incident was at the most a technical violation that had been morally justified.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nThe ''Altmark'' incident led to the Germans speeding up their planning for an invasion of Norway. On 21 February, General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]] was placed in charge of planning the invasion and in command of the land-based forces. The official approval for the invasion and occupation of [[Denmark]] and Norway was signed by Hitler on 1 March.<ref name=grove/><ref name=krono/><ref name=altmark/>\n\n==Initial plans==\n\n===Allied plans===\nWith the end of the [[Winter War]], the Allies determined that any occupation of Norway or Sweden would likely do more harm than good, possibly driving the neutral countries into an alliance with Germany. However, the new French prime minister, [[Paul Reynaud]], took a more aggressive stance than his predecessor and wanted some form of action taken against Germany.<ref name=planer/> Churchill was a strong agitator for action in Scandinavia, because he wanted to cut Germany off from Sweden and push the Scandinavian countries to side with the United Kingdom. This initially involved a 1939 plan to penetrate the Baltic with a naval force. This was soon changed to a plan involving the mining of Norwegian waters to stop iron ore shipments from Narvik and provoke Germany into attacking Norway, where it could be defeated by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 11\u201314</ref>\n\nIt was agreed to utilize Churchill's naval mining plan, [[Operation Wilfred]], designed to remove the sanctuary of the Leads and force transport ships into international waters where the Royal Navy could engage and destroy them. Accompanying this would be [[Plan R 4]], an operation where, upon almost certain German counteraction to Operation Wilfred, the Allies would then proceed to occupy Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, and [[Stavanger]]. The planners hoped that the operation would not provoke the Norwegians to resist the Allies with armed force.<ref>Lunde 2009, p. 34</ref>\n\nThe Allies disagreed over the additional [[Operation Royal Marine]], where mines would also be placed in the [[Rhine River]]. While the British supported this operation, the French were against it, since they also depended on the Rhine and feared German reprisals on French soil. Because of this delay, Operation Wilfred, originally scheduled for 5 April, was delayed until 8 April when the British agreed to perform the Norwegian operations separately from those on the continent.<ref name=planer/>\n\n===German plans===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2006-0529-501, Nikolaus v.

It was to be presented as an armed protection of Norway's neutrality.\n\nOne subject debated by German strategists was the occupation of Denmark. Denmark was considered vital because its location facilitated greater air and naval control of the area. While some wanted to simply pressure Denmark to acquiesce, it was eventually determined that it would be safer for the operation if Denmark were captured by force.\n\nAnother matter that caused additional reworking of the plan was ''Fall Gelb'', the proposed invasion of northern France and the [[Low Countries]], which would require the bulk of German forces. Because some forces were needed for both invasions, ''Weser\u00fcbung'' could not occur at the same time as Gelb, and because the nights were shortening as spring approached, which were vital cover for the naval forces, it therefore had to be sooner. Eventually, on 2 April, the Germans set 9 April as the day of the invasion (''Wesertag''), and 04:15 (Norwegian time) as the hour of the landings (''Weserzeit'').<ref name=krono/>\n\nIn Norway, the plan called for the capture of six primary targets by [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] landings: [[Oslo]], [[Kristiansand]], [[Egersund]], Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik. Additionally, supporting ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroops) were to capture other key locations such as airfields at [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu]] outside of Oslo and Sola outside of Stavanger. The plan was designed to quickly overwhelm the Norwegian defenders and occupy these vital areas before any form of organized resistance could be mounted.

''Renown''{{'}}s force was soon caught in a heavy snowstorm, and {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}, one of the destroyer escorts, had to drop out of formation to search for a man swept overboard. The weather aided the Germans, providing a screen for their forces, and in the early morning they sent out ''Gruppe 1'' and ''Gruppe 2'', who had the largest distance to travel.\n\nAlthough the weather did make reconnaissance difficult, the two German groups were discovered {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Lindesnes|the Naze]] (the southernmost part of Norway) slightly after 08:00 by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) patrols and reported as one cruiser and six destroyers.

On interrogation the survivors disclosed that they were assigned to protect Bergen from the Allies. This information was passed on to Oslo where the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] ignored the sinking due to being distracted by the British mining operations off the Norwegian coast.<ref name=rio/>\n\nAt 14:00, the Admiralty received word that aerial reconnaissance had located a group of German ships a considerable distance west-northwest of Trondheim, bearing west. This reinforced the notion that the Germans were indeed intending a breakout, and the Home Fleet changed direction from northeast to northwest to again try to intercept. Additionally, Churchill cancelled Plan R 4 and ordered the four cruisers carrying the soldiers and their supplies to disembark their cargo and join the Home Fleet. In fact, the German ships, ''Gruppe 2'', were only performing delaying circling manoeuvres in order to approach their destination of Trondheim at the designated time.\n\nThat night, after learning of numerous sightings of German ships south of Norway, Charles Forbes began to doubt the validity of the breakout idea, and he ordered the Home Fleet to head south to the [[Skagerrak]]. He also ordered {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}}, along with another cruiser and a few destroyers, to head north and join ''Renown''.\n\nAt 23:00, as Forbes was just learning of the incident with ''Orze\u0142'', ''Gruppe 5'' was confronted by the Norwegian patrol vessel {{HNoMS|Pol III||2}} at the entrance to the [[Oslofjord]]. ''Pol III'' quickly sent an alarm to the coastal batteries on Rau\u00f8y (Rau\u00f8y island) and opened fire on the [[German torpedo boats of World War II|torpedo boat]] {{ship|German torpedo boat|Albatros||2}} with her single gun shortly before colliding with it. ''Albatros'' and two of her companions responded with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire, killing the Norwegian captain and setting ''Pol III'' on fire. ''Gruppe 5'' continued into the Oslofjord and cleared the outer batteries without incident. Several of the smaller German ships then broke off in order to capture the bypassed fortifications along with [[Horten]].\n\nThis activity did not go unnoticed, and soon reports had reached Oslo, leading to a midnight session of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norwegian cabinet]]. At this meeting, the cabinet issued orders for the mobilization of four of the six field brigades of the Norwegian Army. The members of the cabinet failed to understand that the partial mobilization they had ordered would, according to the regulations in place, be carried out in secret and without public declaration. Troops would be issued their mobilization orders by post. The only member of the cabinet with in-depth knowledge of the mobilization system, defence minister [[Birger Ljungberg]], failed to explain the procedure to his colleagues. He would later be heavily criticized for this oversight, which led to unnecessary delays in the Norwegian mobilization. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Ljungberg had dismissed repeated demands for a total and immediate mobilization, made by the chief of the general staff, [[Rasmus Hatledal]]. Hatledal had approached Ljungberg on 5, 6 and 8 April, asking the defence minister to request the cabinet to issue orders for mobilization. The issue had been discussed in the evening of 8 April, after the Commanding General, [[Kristian Laake]], had joined the calls for a mobilization. At that time the mobilization had been limited to two field battalions in [[\u00d8stfold]], further delaying the larger-scale call-up of troops. When Laake's call for mobilization was finally accepted at some time between 03:30 to 04:00 on 9 April, the Commanding General assumed, like defence minister Ljungberg, that the cabinet knew that they were issuing a partial and silent mobilization. The poor communication between the Norwegian armed forces and the civilian authorities caused much confusion in the early days of the German invasion.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars|last=Borgersrud|authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Ljungberg, Birger |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=250|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=mob>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Arnfinn|last=Moland|authorlink=Arnfinn Moland|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=mobiliseringen i 1940|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=274\u2013275|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lars|last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=stille mobilisering|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=399\u2013400|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAt about this time, further north, ''Renown'' was heading back to Vestfjord after reaching ''Glowworm''{{'}}s last known location and not finding anything.

''Renown'' engaged the two battleships off the [[Lofoten|Lofoten Archipelago]], and during [[Action off Lofoten|the short battle]] ''Renown'' scored several hits on the German vessels, forcing them to flee north.

With ''Renown'' and her escorts earlier diverted to investigate the ''Glowworm'' incident, no British ships stood in their way, and they entered the area unopposed. By the time they had reached the inner area near Narvik, most of the destroyers had peeled off from the main formation to capture the outer batteries of the Ofotfjord, leaving only three to contend with the two old Norwegian [[coastal defence ship]]s standing guard in Narvik harbour, {{HNoMS|Eidsvold||2}} and {{HNoMS|Norge||2}}. Although antiquated, the two coastal defence ships were quite capable of taking on the much more lightly armed and armoured destroyers. After a quick parley with the captain of ''Eidsvold'', [[Odd Isaachsen Willoch]], the German ships opened fire pre-emptively on the coastal defence ship, sinking her after hitting her with three torpedoes. ''Norge'' entered into the fray shortly after and began to fire on the destroyers, but her marksmen were inexperienced and she did not hit the Germans ships before being sunk by a salvo of torpedoes from the German destroyers.\n\nFollowing the sinking of ''Eidsvold'' and ''Norge'', the commander of Narvik, [[Konrad Sundlo]], surrendered the land forces in the town without a fight.<ref name=narvik/>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-757-0038N-11A, Norwegen, Schwerer Kreuzer.jpg|thumb|upright|The German cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' landing troops in Trondheim]]\nAt Trondheim, ''Gruppe 2'' also faced only minor resistance to their landings.

She carried much of the administrative personnel intended both for the occupation of Norway and also for the headquarters of the army division assigned to seize Oslo. The cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, also damaged in the attack and believing ''Bl\u00fccher'' had entered a minefield, withdrew with ''Gruppe 5'', 19&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) south to [[Son, Norway|Sonsbukten]] where she unloaded her troops. This distance delayed the arrival of the main German invasion force for Oslo by over 24 hours, though the Norwegian capital would still be captured less than 12 hours after the loss of ''Bl\u00fccher'' by troops flown into [[Fornebu Airport]] near the city.<ref name=blucher/>\n[[File:Germans in Oslo 9 April 1940.jpg|thumb|left|German soldiers marching through Oslo on the first day of the invasion]]\nThe delay induced by the Norwegian forces gave time for the royal family, Parliament, [[Flight of the Norwegian National Treasury|and with them the national treasury]], to flee the capital and continue the fighting against the invasion force.<ref name=grove/><ref name=blucher/>\n\nFornebu Airport was originally supposed to be secured by paratroops an hour before the first troops were flown in, but the initial force became lost in the fog and did not arrive. Regardless, the airfield was not heavily defended and the German soldiers who did arrive captured it promptly. The Norwegian Army Air Service's [[Jagevingen]] fighter flight based on Fornebu Airport resisted with their [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane fighters until ammunition ran out and then flew off to whatever secondary airfields were available. The ground personnel of the Fighter Wing soon ran out of ammunition for their anti-aircraft machine guns as well; in the general confusion and focus on readying the fighters for action, no one had the presence of mind or the time to issue small-arms ammunition for the personal weapons of the ground personnel. Resistance at Fornebu Airport came to an end, with the Germans' only loss being a single Ju 52.<ref>Dildy, Doug.

In order to secure the Skagerrak strait between Norway and Denmark, the air bases in Denmark had to be seized. The domination of this strait would prevent the Royal Navy from interfering with the main supply lines of the invasion forces. In this respect, the occupation of Denmark was considered to be vital. The capture of [[Aalborg Airport]] was considered particularly important in this respect.<ref name=tyskbomb>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lars|last=Borgersrud|authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=bombing, tysk|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=50|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nThe German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' crossed the Danish border around 05:15 on 9 April. In a coordinated operation, German troops disembarked at the docks of [[Langelinie]] in the Danish capital, [[Copenhagen]], and began occupying the city. German paratroops also captured Aalborg Airport. Simultaneously, an ultimatum was presented by the German ambassador to King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]]. The Danish army was small, ill-prepared and used obsolete equipment, but resisted in several parts of the country; most importantly, the Royal Guards located at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen, and forces in the vicinity of [[Haderslev]] in [[South Jutland County|South Jutland]]. By 06:00, the small [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish Air Force]] had been taken out and 28 German [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers were threatening to drop their bombs over Copenhagen. King Christian, having consulted with Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]], Foreign Minister [[P. Munch]] and the commanders of the army and the navy, decided to capitulate, believing that further resistance would only result in a useless loss of Danish lives. By 08:43 Denmark had capitulated.<ref>Dildy 2007, pp. 34\u201336</ref> The Danish public was taken completely by surprise by the occupation, and was instructed by the government to cooperate with the German authorities.

Not willing to disperse too thinly due to the unknown location of the two German battleships, the Home Fleet chose to focus on nearby Bergen and dispatched an attack force. RAF reconnaissance soon reported stronger opposition than anticipated, and this, along with the possibility that the Germans might be controlling the shore defences, caused them to recall the force and instead use the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} to launch torpedo bombers at the enemy ships. The attack never commenced though, as Luftwaffe bombers launched an assault of their own against the Home Fleet first. This attack sank the destroyer {{HMS|Gurkha|F20|6}} and then forced the Home Fleet to withdraw north when their anti-aircraft measures proved ineffective. This German [[air superiority]] in the area led the British to decide that all southern regions had to be left to submarines and the RAF, while surface vessels would concentrate on the north.<ref name=grove/>\n\nIn addition to the German landings in south and central Norway, the Admiralty was also informed via press reports that a single German destroyer was in Narvik. In response to this, they ordered the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, mostly consisting of ships previously serving as escort destroyers for Operation Wilfred, to engage. This flotilla, under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Bernard Warburton-Lee]], had already detached from {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} during her pursuit of {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, being ordered to guard the entrance to the Vestfjord. At 16:00 on 9 April, the flotilla sent an officer ashore at [[Tran\u00f8y]] {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Narvik and learned from the locals that the German force was 4\u20136 destroyers and a submarine. Warburton-Lee sent these findings back to the Admiralty, concluding with his intention to attack the next day at \"dawn, high water\", which would give him the element of surprise and protection against any mines. This decision was approved by the Admiralty in a telegram that night.\n\n====First Battle of Narvik====\nThough ten German destroyers had originally taken Narvik, only five remained in the harbor, with three others moving North and the remaining two going west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_narvik_first.html|title=First battle of Narvik, 10 April 1940|publisher=|date=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> Early the following morning, Warburton-Lee led his flagship, {{HMS|Hardy|H87|6}}, and four other destroyers into the Ofotfjord. At 04:30, he arrived at Narvik harbor and entered along with {{HMS|Hunter|H35|6}} and {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}, leaving {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|6}} and {{HMS|Hostile|H55|6}} to guard the entrance and watch the shore batteries. The fog and snow were extremely heavy, allowing Warburton-Lee's force to approach undetected. When they arrived at the harbour itself they found five German destroyers and opened fire, starting the [[Battles of Narvik|First Battle of Narvik]]. Warburton-Lee's ships made three passes on the enemy ships, being joined after the first by ''Hotspur'' and ''Hostile'', and sank two of the destroyers, disabled one more, and sank six tankers and supply ships. The German commander, Commodore [[Friedrich Bonte]], lost his life when his flagship {{ship|German destroyer|Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp||2}} was sunk.\n\nHowever, Captain Warburton-Lee would make a fatal error when he decided to attack the German destroyers one last time. The German destroyers from the North and West converged on the British Fleet at 06:00, while the British were preparing for the final attack. ''Hardy'' was severely damaged and beached, and Warburton-Lee was killed. ''Hunter'' and ''Hotspur'' were both critically damaged, and ''Hotspur'' ran into the sinking ''Hunter''. ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' meanwhile had raced ahead, but turned about and came back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''. The German destroyers were low on fuel and ammunition, allowing ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' to come back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1038-06, Kiel, Schwerer Kreuzer \"L\u00fctzow\".jpg|thumb|{{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} in [[Kiel]] after being torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|2}} on her way back from Norway]]\n\n====Second Battle of Narvik====\nShortly after the First Battle of Narvik, two more German ships were sunk by British forces. During the night of 9/10 April, the submarine {{HMS|Truant|N68|6}} intercepted and sank the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}} shortly after she had left Kristiansand. On 10 April, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] made a long-range attack from their base at [[RNAS Hatston]] (also called HMS ''Sparrowhawk'') in the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] against German warships in Bergen harbour. The attack sank the disabled German light cruiser ''K\u00f6nigsberg'';\n\nOn 10 April, ''Furious'' and the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} joined the Home Fleet, and another air attack was made against Trondheim hoping to sink ''Admiral Hipper''. ''Admiral Hipper'', however, had already managed to escape through the watch set up outside of the port and was on her way back to Germany when the attack was launched; none of the remaining German destroyers or support ships were hit in the assault. Better luck was had in the south when {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|6}} severely damaged the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} at midnight on 11 April, putting the German ship out of commission for a year.\n\nWith it becoming more evident the German fleet had slipped out of Norwegian waters, the Home Fleet continued north to Narvik in the hope of catching the remaining destroyers. En route the ships suffered further harassment from German bombers, forcing them to divert to the west away from the shoreline. By 12 April, they were in range of Narvik and an aerial attack on Narvik from ''Furious'' was attempted, but the results were disappointing. It was instead decided to send in the battleship ''Warspite'' and a powerful escort force, to be commanded by Whitworth.\n\n[[File:UK-NWE-Norway-2.jpg|300px|thumb|The British-German naval battles at Narvik on 10 and 13 April]]\nOn the morning of 13 April, Whitworth's force entered the Vestfjord using ''Warspite''{{'}}s scouting aircraft to guide the way. Aside from locating two of the German destroyers, the scouting aircraft also sank an enemy submarine, the first such occurrence. ''Warspite''{{'}}s destroyers travelled {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in advance of the battleship and were the first to engage their German counterparts which had come to meet them, thus starting the [[Battles of Narvik|Second Battle of Narvik]]. Though neither side inflicted notable damage, the German ships were running low on ammunition and were gradually pushed back to the harbour. By that afternoon, most attempted to flee up the [[Rombaksfjord]], the only exception being {{ship|German destroyer|Z19 Hermann K\u00fcnne||2}} which beached herself as she made for the Herjangsfjord and was destroyed by {{HMS|Eskimo|F75|6}}. Four British destroyers continued to chase the German ships up through the Rombaksfjord, ''Eskimo'' was soon damaged by the waiting opposition. However, the German situation was hopeless, having run out of fuel and ammunition, and by the time the remaining British ships arrived, the German crews had abandoned and scuttled their ships. By 18:30 the British ships were making their way out of the now cleared fjord.\n\n==Norwegian situation==\nThe German invasions for the most part achieved their goal of simultaneous assault and caught the Norwegian forces off guard, a situation not aided by the Norwegian government's order for only a partial mobilization. Not all was lost for the Allies though, as the repulsion of the German ''Gruppe 5'' in the Oslofjord gave a few additional hours of time which the Norwegians used to evacuate the Royal family and the Norwegian Government to [[Hamar]]. With the government now fugitive, [[Vidkun Quisling]] used the opportunity to take control of a radio broadcasting station and announce a coup, with himself as the new [[Prime Minister of Norway]]. Quisling's coup and his list of new ministers was announced at 19:32. The Quisling coup government remained in place until 15 April, when the [[Administrative Council (Norway)|Administrative Council]] was appointed by the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] to deal with the civilian administration of the occupied areas of Norway, and Quisling resigned.<ref name=krono/><ref name=admin>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Hans Fredrik |last=Dahl |authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl | encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Administrasjonsr\u00e5det |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=14\u201315 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Haakon7Small.jpg|thumb|left|The German forces attempted to kill or capture the 67-year-old King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]].

His first task was to secure the Oslofjord area, then to use the [[196th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|196th]] and [[163rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|163rd Infantry Divisions]] to establish contact with the forces at Trondheim.\n\n==Ground campaign==\nWhen the nature of the German invasion became apparent to the British military, it began to make preparations for a counter-attack. Dissension amongst the various branches was strong though, as the [[British Army]], after conferring with Otto Ruge, wanted to assault Trondheim in Central Norway while Churchill insisted on reclaiming Narvik. It was decided to send troops to both locations as a compromise. Admiral [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork and Orrery|Lord Cork]] was in overall command of the Allied operations.<ref>Dildy 2007, p. 17</ref>\n\n===Campaign in eastern Norway===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26353, Norwegen, Kampf um ein brennendes Dorf.jpg|thumb|German infantry attacking through a burning Norwegian village]]\nAfter the appointment of Ruge as Commanding General on 10 April, the Norwegian strategy was to fight delaying actions against the Germans advancing northwards from Oslo to link up with the invasion forces at Trondheim. The main aim of the Norwegian effort in [[eastern Norway]] was to give the Allies enough time to recapture Trondheim, and start a counter-offensive against the German main force in the Oslo area. The region surrounding the Oslofjord was defended by the [[1st Division (Norway)|1st Division]], commanded by Major General [[Carl Johan Erichsen]]. The rest of the region was covered by the [[2nd Division (Norway)|2nd Division]], commanded by Major General [[Jacob Hvinden Haug]]. Having been prevented from mobilizing in an orderly fashion by the German invasion, improvised Norwegian units were sent into action against the Germans. Several of the units facing the German advance were led by officers especially selected by Ruge to replace commanders who had failed to show sufficient initiative and aggression in the early days of the campaign. The German offensive aimed at linking up their forces in Oslo and Trondheim began on 14 April, with an advance north from Oslo towards the [[Gudbrandsdalen]] and [[\u00d8sterdalen]] valleys. [[H\u00f8nefoss]] was the first town to fall to the advancing German forces. North of H\u00f8nefoss the Germans began meeting Norwegian resistance, first delaying actions and later units fighting organized defensive actions. During intense fighting with heavy casualties on both sides, troops of the Norwegian Infantry Regiment 6 blunted the German advance at the village of [[Haugsbygd]] on 15 April. The Germans only broke through the Norwegian lines at Haugsbygd the next day after employing panzers for the first time in Norway.

Some 2,000 soldiers marched into captivity in the Setesdal capitulation. With the abandonment on 20 April of the Franco-British plans for recapturing the central Norwegian city of Trondheim, Ruge's strategy became practically infeasible.<ref name=forsvar/><ref name=Ruge/><ref name=skodvin54>Skodvin 1991, p. 54</ref>\n\nWith the calling off of the Allied plans for recapturing Trondheim, British forces which had been [[\u00c5ndalsnes landings|landed at \u00c5ndalsnes]] moved into eastern Norway. By 20 April three British half-battalions had moved as far south as [[F\u00e5berg]], near the town of [[Lillehammer]].<ref name=skodvin56/> The main British units deployed to eastern Norway in April 1940 were the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorials]] of the [[148th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|148th Infantry Brigade]] and the regular [[15th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|15th Infantry Brigade]].<ref>Derry 1952, pp. 97\u201398, 113, 115</ref> In a series of battles with Norwegian and British forces over the next weeks the Germans pushed northwards from Oslo, their main effort through the [[Gudbrandsdal]] valley.

In the [[Battle for Kvam]] on 25 and 26 April, the British managed to delay the German advance for two days of heavy fighting.

[[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]]s proved particularly effective in demoralizing Norwegian troops opposing the advance. The Norwegian forces' almost complete lack of anti-aircraft weapons allowed the German aircraft to operate with near impunity.<ref name=tyskbomb/> Likewise, when German panzers were employed the Norwegians had no regular countermeasures.<ref name=derry102/> The British [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] fighter squadron set up base on the frozen lake [[Lesjaskogsvatnet]] on 24 April to challenge German air supremacy, but many of the squadron's aircraft were destroyed by German bombing on 25 April.

At the same time the Germans moved to secure the areas surrounding Kristiansand.

Some 2,000 German soldiers occupied Bergen and captured the Norwegian arms depots there. The small Norwegian infantry forces in Bergen retreated eastwards, blowing up two railway bridges and sections of road after them. Despite the loss of the cities, the regional commander, General [[William Steffens]], ordered a total mobilization. During mid-April the 6,000-strong Norwegian [[4th Division (Norway)|4th Division]], responsible for the defence of [[western Norway]], was mobilized around the town of [[Voss]] in [[Hordaland]].

Following the German invasion General Fleischer assumed the position of commander-in-chief of all Norwegian forces in northern Norway. The Norwegian counter-offensive against the Germans at Narvik was hampered by Fleischer's decision to retain significant forces in Eastern Finnmark to guard against a possible Soviet attack in the far north.<ref name=fleischer/>\n\nAlong with the Allied landings at \u00c5ndalsnes and Namsos, aimed against Trondheim, further forces were deployed to the north of Norway and assigned the task of recapturing Narvik. Like the campaign in the south, the Narvik expedition faced numerous obstacles.\n\nOne of the first problems faced by the Allies was that the command was not unified, or even truly organized. The naval forces in the area were led by [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork]] who had been ordered to rid the area of the Germans as soon as possible. In contrast, the commander of the ground forces, Major-General [[Pierse Joseph Mackesy|Pierse Mackesy]], was ordered not to land his forces in any area strongly held by the Germans and to avoid damaging populated areas. The two met on 15 April to determine the best course of action. Lord Cork argued for an immediate assault on Narvik and Mackesy countered that such a move would lead to heavy casualties for his attacking troops. Cork eventually conceded to Mackesy's viewpoint.\n\nMackesy's force was originally codenamed ''Avonforce'', later ''Rupertforce''.<ref>Sandvik 1965I, pp. 204\u2013206</ref><ref>Sandvik 1965II, p. 354</ref> The force consisted of the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]], led by Brigadier [[William Fraser (British Army officer)|William Fraser]], and French and Polish units led by Brigadier [[Antoine B\u00e9thouart]].<ref name=dildy29/> The main force began landing at [[Harstad]], a port town on the island of [[Hinn\u00f8ya]], on 14 April.

In all 118 warships had been under Norwegian command at one time or another during the war years.<ref name=forsvar/><ref name=marinen/>\n\nNorwegian squadrons flew with the [[RAF Fighter Command|RAF Fighter]] and [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal]] Commands. The Norwegian-manned [[No. 331 Squadron RAF|331 Squadron]] and [[No. 332 Squadron RAF|332 Squadron]] operated Hawker Hurricane and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter aircraft. The naval [[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330 Squadron]] and [[No. 333 Squadron RAF|333 Squadron]] flew [[Northrop N-3PB]] patrol bombers, [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] and [[Short Sunderland]] flying boats and [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighter bombers. Individual Norwegians flew with British air units. In November 1944 the Royal Norwegian Naval Air Service and the Norwegian Army Air Service, having been under a unified command since March 1941, were amalgamated to form the RNoAF. At the end of the war some 2,700 personnel served in the RNoAF.<ref name=forsvar/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars |last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=flyv\u00e5penet |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=109\u2013111 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>\n\nA c. 4,000 strong Norwegian Army was also re-established in [[Scotland]]. However, with the exception of a small number of special forces, it saw little action for the rest of the war. A reinforced company from the Scotland-based Norwegian Army participated in the liberation of Finnmark during the winter of 1944\u201345. Finnmark and the northern parts of Troms county had been forcibly evacuated by the Germans in a scorched earth operation following the [[Petsamo\u2013Kirkenes Offensive]] by the [[Red Army]] against occupied Finnmark in October 1944. The offensive had captured the north-eastern town of [[Kirkenes]] from the occupying German forces. After the arrival of the 300 troops from Scotland, further troops were moved in from Sweden and mobilized locally. At the end of the war, the Norwegian forces in Finnmark totalled 3,000.

After the fall of Norway, Scotland (especially the fleet bases at Scapa Flow and [[Rosyth]]) were seen as much more vulnerable to a diversionary assault by air- and sea-borne troops. German commerce raiders used Norway as a staging base to reach the North Atlantic.

Having worked in more than 50 countries all over the world during my 35-year career, I have found that people, wherever they are, are not that much different. What they have in common that they all react to the incentives that they are exposed to, political, economic, religious, etc. For example, if I say that Iranians don\u2019t plan very well, but are masters at improvisation, is that a best or worst characteristic? It all depends on the circumstances and I don\u2019t think it is helpful to contribute to the proliferation of stereotypes of people. Just take them as they are and work with that and you will be surprised to learn that what is considered \u2018best and worst\u2019 was based on lack of understanding and empathy.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><br />\n\n== Publications ==\nFloor's books on Iran could be categorized into energy related publications, Persian Gulf, art, social history, economic history, political history, and medical history.

When asked about his most favorite book in a 2017 interview during a visit to Iran, he mentions, \"I have no idea what my best book is and have never given this a thought. In fact, I like all my books for the simple reason that I usually write about a subject that I don\u2019t know much or anything about. My books are first and foremost written for myself, because they are the result of my attempt to find out what I can learn about a subject that may just be a term to me. I have written books that initially I intended to be an article, because when I begin my research and start writing I have no pre-set ideas where I want to end up.

When asked about Iran and Iranians, he mentions, \"I don\u2019t think of people, any people, in having best and worst characteristics. Having worked in more than 50 countries all over the world during my 35-year career, I have found that people, wherever they are, are not that much different. What they have in common that they all react to the incentives that they are exposed to, political, economic, religious, etc. For example, if I say that Iranians don\u2019t plan very well, but are masters at improvisation, is that a best or worst characteristic? It all depends on the circumstances and I don\u2019t think it is helpful to contribute to the proliferation of stereotypes of people. Just take them as they are and work with that and you will be surprised to learn that what is considered \u2018best and worst\u2019 was based on lack of understanding and empathy.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><br />\n\n== Publications ==\nFloor's books on Iran could be categorized into energy related publications, Persian Gulf, art, social history, economic history, political history, and medical history.

Dr. Floor has published more than 50 odd books. When asked about his most favorite book in a 2017 interview during a visit to Iran, he mentions, \"I have no idea what my best book is and have never given this a thought. In fact, I like all my books for the simple reason that I usually write about a subject that I don\u2019t know much or anything about. My books are first and foremost written for myself, because they are the result of my attempt to find out what I can learn about a subject that may just be a term to me. I have written books that initially I intended to be an article, because when I begin my research and start writing I have no pre-set ideas where I want to end up.

There was a wide range of recreational and sporting facilities in addition which provided ample opportunity for amusement during a voyage.\n\nAlthough closely similar to her sister ship and predecessor the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], ''Titanic'' featured additional first-class staterooms, augmented public rooms, and myriad minor improvements to enhance her luxury and comfort.\n\n[[File:Titanic cutaway diagram.png|thumb|''Titanic'' cutaway diagram]]\n\n== Location ==\nThe bulk of first-class facilities and accommodation was located on the upper decks within the superstructure of the ''Titanic'', where the vibrations and noise of the engines were at their lowest. The entirety of A-Deck was devoted to first-class recreational space and accommodation, along with most of B and C Decks. First-class facilities were located on every level down to F-Deck, which means that first-class passengers enjoyed the most space by far of any of the three classes on the ship.\n\n== Accommodation ==\n[[File:Titanic's B 59 stateroom.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'''s B 59 stateroom]]\nThe ''Titanic'' and her sister ''Olympic'' offered the finest and most luxurious first-class accommodations to be found on any contemporary ocean liner. The cheapest first-class fare could be had for \u00a323 ({{Inflation|UK|23|1912|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-2}}), without meals.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=42}}</ref> A suite could range in price from \u00a3400 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|400|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) to \u00a3870 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|870|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) for a \"Deluxe\" Parlor Suite at the height of the travelling season.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n=== Decor & Range ===\nThe \"special staterooms\" on B and C-Decks were richly appointed in 11 different period styles, including [[Adam style|Adam]], [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]], [[Louis Quinze|XV]], and [[Louis XVI style|XVI]], [[Empire style|French Empire]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]].<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 85.</ref> Some styles, like Adam or Louis XVI, had different variations used in certain staterooms which incorporated elements from other periods, bringing the total of different designs to 19 including the 11 base styles.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59</ref> In addition, there were two custom Harland and Wolff designs known as \"Bedroom A\" and \"Bedroom B\" which were used in a total of 43 bedrooms between B and C Decks. These were period-inspired but modernized and considered equal in quality to the 11 stringent period styles. Bedroom A was the plainer of the two, featuring fielded wood panels painted white, resting on a 3-foot high carved oak [[Dado (architecture)|dado]], and furnished with a brass or wooden bedstead. Bedroom B was known as the \"French cabin\" because it was Louis XV-inspired, featuring varnished oak panelling and [[Cabriolet (furniture)|Cabriolet]] furniture.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59-60</ref>\n\nIn the \"special staterooms\", there was a wide range of finely carved panelling, veneers, and marquetry made from exotic imported woods like [[Mahogany]], [[Sycamore]], [[Walnut]], [[Oak]] and [[Satinwood]]. Such was the attention to historic detail that every piece of furniture, light fixture, upholstery, and woodwork was recreated with an obsessive care for accuracy by designers and master craftsmen at Harland and Wolff. There were a small number of outside contractors hired to fit out select rooms or provide furnishings. The Dutch firm of H.P. Mutters & Zoon, for instance, fitted out twelve of the \"special staterooms\" according to the chosen period styles, supplying everything from the panelling and doors down to the sofa pillows, [[Down feather|down]] bed quilts, and wastepaper baskets.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 67-75</ref>\n\nFirst-class accommodation occupied almost the entirety of B and C Decks, but also large sections forward on A, D and E-Decks; a handful of first-class cabins were located on the boat deck between the forward grand staircase and officer's quarters.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/b-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : B Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On E-Deck staterooms and cabins were interchangeable between First and Second-Class, meaning sections could be prioritized for either one of the classes in the event of overbooking or high demand.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/e-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : E Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> Only the starboard side of E-Deck belonged to First/Second-Class, the whole of the Port side contained Third-Class and Crew cabins. The first-class corridors were in general very spartan in appearance, but the B and C Deck passageways which accessed the very finest staterooms were more impressive. These featured white-painted 'Venesta' panels (a durable type of [[plywood]]), pilasters, archways over the stateroom entrances, and a decorative [[frieze]] supported by gilt brackets running along the top of the walls which concealed the ventilation ducts and electrical wiring underneath.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\">Beveridge 2008 p. 264</ref> There were no handrails, no carpet runners, and lighting was provided by [[ormolu]] and cut-glass ceiling fixtures. On B Deck the two parallel corridors were enclosed by swinging [[baize]]-upholstered doors with [[louver]] panels, which muffled the sound coming from the stairwells and busy public rooms.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\"/>\n\nThe space which had been given over to an encircling B-Deck promenade on the ''Olympic'' was converted to additional large staterooms on ''Titanic'', the finest on board. Many of these staterooms had private entrances, separate servants' quarters, adjoining doors, and en-suite bathrooms; they could be booked in groups to accommodate families and servants. In all there were almost 330 first-class rooms, 100 of which were single-berth.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\">Description from ''International Marine Engineering'', July 1911. Tibballs, Geoff,\"The Mammoth Book of the Titanic.\" Carroll & Graf: 2002; 21.</ref>\n\nThe type of first-class stateroom that predominated was a single- or double-berth stateroom which contained a dressing table, horsehair sofa, wardrobe, and marble-topped washstand with basin. Double berth cabins had \"tipped\" washbasins on shelves that could be folded back into the cabinet to save room.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 101.</ref> Many also had additional bunks suspended over the main bed that could be folded against the wall.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Staterooms increased in size thereafter with double beds, built-in wardrobes, and comfortable seating areas. Single berth state rooms, like those on A-Deck, were decorated more modestly than the lavish period suites on B and C-Decks. Above most beds was an electrical outlet with a call button that could summon a steward, a reading lamp and a wire-mesh basket for storing small items. Although the ''Titanic'' was centrally heated, all first-class cabins contained [[electric heaters]] to provide additional warmth and passengers could get electric bed warmers on request to a steward.<ref>Hutchings, David F.; de Kerbrech, Richard P. (2011). RMS Titanic 1909\u201312 (Olympic Class): Owners' Workshop Manual. 74.</ref>\n\n=== Facilities ===\nAs was standard at the time, the bulk of first-class bathroom facilities were shared. Communal lavatories with illuminated signage could be found along the passageways divided by gender. A passenger could take a bath by notifying a steward, who would draw the bath based on availability. Because of the need to conserve limited fresh water supplies, baths were supplied with sea water; only the attached showers of the private bathrooms utilised fresh water.<ref>\"Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 13-14.</ref> ''Titanic'' had an impressive ratio of private bathrooms to passengers, more than any other ship in 1912. Virtually all of the suites on B and C Decks featured en-suite bathrooms.\n\nAlthough bed linen was changed daily, there was no laundry aboard because of limited fresh-water supplies. Passengers could get their clothes pressed and shoes polished on request, for a small fee.<ref>\"Boots & Shoes\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 29.</ref> Morning tea and pastries were served to passengers in their staterooms, but there was no room service in the modern sense \u2013 passengers had to go to the dining room to be served full breakfasts and other meals.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. 882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic, Scholastic Press, 1998; 31.</ref>\n\n=== The Parlour Suites ===\n[[File:B-58.jpg|thumb|Stateroom B-58 from the B-Deck Parlour Suite]]\nThe most splendid first-class accommodation on both the ''Titanic'' and the ''Olympic'' were the four parlour suites, two each on B and C Decks, just aft of the forward grand staircase landings. The two on B-Deck were advertised as \"Deluxe\" Parlour Suites, or Promenade Suites, because they each contained a 50&nbsp;ft. (15.24 M.) private promenade deck. The promenade deck connected to the first-class gangway entrances immediately forward, enabling the copious amounts of luggage usually carried by the ''Titanic's'' richest passengers to be loaded directly into their suites. The Parlour Suites each comprised two large bedrooms, two walk-in wardrobes, a private bathroom, lavatory, and a spacious sitting room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 57.</ref> The sitting rooms were lavish rooms that allowed for receiving small parties of guests. Each featured a faux fireplace, large card table, plush sofas and chairs, sideboards, and writing desks.\n\nThe two private promenade decks were unique to the ''Titanic'', decorated in half-timber [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]] panelling, wicker deck chairs, sofas, tables and potted plants. The deck chairs were cane, made by Dryad of Leicester.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The chairman of the [[White Star Line]], [[J. Bruce Ismay]], occupied the port-side \"Deluxe\" Suite on the ''Titanic'', while the starboard suite was occupied by the American millionaire Mrs. [[Charlotte Drake Cardeza]], her son, and entourage.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss''. 2001; 108-9.</ref>\n\n=== Condition in the Wreck ===\nThere has been relatively little exploration of the first-class staterooms on ''Titanic'' since her discovery. Only the staterooms in the bow section forward of the [[Grand Staircase of the Titanic|grand staircase]] survive in an appreciable condition. Because the cabins were all framed in pine and [[teak]], many of the walls between staterooms have deteriorated, leaving a warren of tangled electrical wiring, deep [[silt]] and wreckage treacherous to [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]]. James Cameron's 2001 ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' expedition focused on the cabins of some of the most famous ''Titanic'' passengers, including [[Henry S. Harper]], [[Molly Brown]] and [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Russell]]. Outstanding images of the marble [[Adam style|Adam]]-style fireplace in Bruce Ismay's Deluxe Suite sitting room and the gilded [[Louis Quinze]] fireplace of Mrs. Cardeza's sitting room were produced.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 108-9.</ref> Ismay's Private Promenade was also discovered, with the remnants of the distinctive half-timber panelling seen for the first time since the sinking.\n\nThe more common remains that delineate staterooms include desks and other hardwood furniture, collapsed bunks, silver-plated lamps, doors, brass bed frames, and even upright cabinets with their contents still in place on the shelves. In the debris field are strewn hundreds of items from first-class staterooms that poured out of the ship during the break-up.\n\n== Sporting facilities ==\n[[File:Gym.jpg|thumb|The gymnasium]]\nThe ''Titanic'' featured numerous sporting and relaxation facilities including:\n*A gymnasium including a punch bag, a rowing machine, exercise bikes, Stationary bicycles, two electric camels, and an electric horse.\n*[[Turkish bath]]s, [[electric bath]]s, and [[steam room]]\n*Private massage room\n*[[Swimming pool]]\n*[[Squash (sport)|Squash court]]\n*[[Barber]]\n\n=== Gymnasium ===\nThe 1st-Class Gymnasium was just aft of the forward grand staircase along the Starboard side of the Boat Deck. It was a brightly lit room with white-painted oak panelling and tile floors. Along the wall opposite the entrance was a carved oak installation with an illustrated cutaway of an [[Olympic-class ocean liner]] and a map depicting the travel routes of the [[White Star Line]] throughout the world. The room was equipped with state-of-the-art exercise equipment manufactured in [[Wiesbaden]], including two electric camels, an electric horse, a [[rowing machine]], punching bag, a weightlifting machine and mechanical bicycles.<ref>{{harvsp|Susan Wels|1997|p=34}}</ref>\n\nThere was a permanent \"Physical Educator\" on staff named T.W. McCawley who assisted passengers in using the devices. The gymnasium was open during the following hours and, like other recreational facilities aboard the ''Titanic'', segregated by gender and age:\n\n* 9:00&nbsp;am \u2013 12:00&nbsp;pm for Ladies Only\n* 1:00\u20133:00&nbsp;pm for Children Only\n* 2:00\u20136:00&nbsp;pm for Gentlemen Only\n\nThe roof of the deck house which enclosed the Gymnasium has long since collapsed and the room itself is sinking into the deck below.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Nonetheless the wood panelling that lined the walls is recognizable and so are some of the exercise machines.\n\n=== Turkish baths ===\n[[File:Cool Room of the Turkish Baths, RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|Cool Room in the Turkish Baths on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nAlong the Starboard side of F-Deck was a spa complex for first-class passengers known as the Turkish Baths. Besides the ''Titanic'', only the White Star liners [[RMS Adriatic|RMS ''Adriatic'']] (1906) and the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] (1911) featured Turkish Baths on board.<ref>Shifrin, Malcolm (2015). \"Chapter 23: The Turkish bath at sea\". Victorian Turkish Baths. Historic England. {{ISBN|978-1-84802-230-0}}.</ref>\nThere was a Temperate Room, Cool Room, Hot Room, Steam Room, [[electric bath]] and two Shampoo Rooms where massage was performed.\n\nThe Baths were segregated by sex, available to women between 9:00&nbsp;a.m. and 12:00&nbsp;p.m., and to men between 2:00&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. There was a charge of 4 shillings (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=4}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $1, per person for admission.<ref>\"Turkish Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean and the United States.' March 1910, 3rd Edition; pg. 14.</ref>\n\nThe Cool Room was the central feature of the Turkish Baths, decorated in a mix of Moorish/Arabic styles to evoke a Turkish [[Turkish bath|hamam]]. The walls were adorned with glossy blue-green tiles, richly carved teak, and bronze lamps. Against one wall was a marble drinking fountain. The ceiling was deeply recessed and painted a deep crimson, with gilded beams and hanging lanterns, supported by pillars encased in teak.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=40}}</ref> Unlike the ''Olympic'', the Titanic's cooling room did not have an exterior wall but still included \"fake\" portholes concealed by a carved Cairo curtain.  The doorways were adorned with gilded semi-domes to lend an exotic effect. Throughout the room were teak folding chairs, Damascus tables and cushioned chaise lounges for relaxation. There were also small curtained cubicles for changing.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nThe Cool Room was rediscovered in 2005 during a filming expedition for [[James Cameron]]'s documentary ''Last Mysteries of the Titanic'', in a remarkable state of preservation.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD0FNG7xvfw|title=Titanic Turkish Baths|website=YouTube|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> The room would have flooded early in the sinking and its location deep within the ship insulated it from damage when the bow hit the sea bed. It is largely protected from the destructive [[microbes]] and sea creatures which consume more exposed parts of the ship; because of this the woodwork is in good condition, even the delicate recliners and framework for the dressing rooms survive in recognizable condition.\n\n=== Swimming Pool ===\n[[File:Swimming pool of the Titanic.jpg|thumb|Swimming pool of the ''Olympic'']]\nAcross the corridor from the Turkish Baths was a heated swimming pool measuring an impressive 30&nbsp;ft. long X 14&nbsp;ft. wide and 7&nbsp;ft. deep. Water depth was 5&nbsp;ft. 4 in. at the deep end and 4&nbsp;ft. 6 in. at the shallow end.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\">{{harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413}}</ref> Heated salt water from a tank and cold sea water were pumped into the pool once the ship was out to sea. The room offered 13 changing cubicles and 2 shower stalls for convenience. The floors were tiled in blue and white linoleum, and a marble stair with teak footholds descended into the pool. The pool cost 1 shilling (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=1}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.25 to use but was open to men free of charge between 6 and 8&nbsp;a.m., for early morning exercise.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\nThe ''Olympic'' featured two [[springboard|diving boards]] which proved to be a safety hazard for divers, so they were not installed on ''Titanic''. When the ship was moving the amount of water which sloshed back and forth could make the diving-end deceptively shallow.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\" />\n\nThe entrance to the Swimming Pool is blocked by a closed watertight door along the bulkhead.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\">{{harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3}}</ref> It is presumably in good condition like the neighbouring Turkish Baths, given the slow flooding which occurred in this part of the ship and the resilient materials used in the pool's construction.\n\n=== Squash Court ===\nThe ''Titanic'' featured a Squash/Racquet Court in the bow, deep within the ship on G-Deck. It measured 30&nbsp;ft. long X 20&nbsp;ft. wide and, like the Gymnasium, had its own instructor on staff, Mr. Frederick Wright. There was an accompanying Spectator's Gallery on F-Deck overlooking the court. It could be entered only by a separate staircase starting on D-Deck, from where a passenger would descend the three decks past the viewing platform to G-Deck. The charge to play was 2 shillings (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=2}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.50, for half an hour.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\n=== Barber Shop ===\nA small barber shop was located just off the aft grand staircase on C-Deck, open between 7:00&nbsp;a.m. and 7:00&nbsp;p.m. There was a barber permanently on staff who offered shampooing, shaving, and hairdressing services for 1 shilling (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=1}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.25 each.<ref>\"Barber\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

The ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' were the first [[United Kingdom|British]] ships to feature restaurants separate from their main dining saloons. This was in imitation of the [[C\u00e9sar Ritz|Ritz]] restaurant first featured on board the [[Hamburg-Amerika]] liner [[USS America (ID-3006)|SS ''Amerika'']] in 1905, which had proven to be enormously popular.<ref>{{harvsp|Rick Archibald & Robert Ballard|2004|p=35}}</ref>\nThe restaurant could accommodate 137 diners at a time.<ref name=\"harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|37\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|37}}</ref> On the ''Olympic'' the room was sandwiched between the Second-Class promenades on either side, making it smaller than the version on ''Titanic'', whose restaurant extended to the port side of the ship and whose starboard-side promenade deck was converted to the Caf\u00e9 Parisien.\n\nThe restaurant was the preferred alternative to the main dining saloon and gave passengers the option of enjoying lavish French ''haute cuisine'' at an additional cost. A passenger could choose to eat exclusively in the restaurant for the duration of the voyage and receive a \u00a33-\u00a35 rebate on his/her ticket at the time of booking.<ref name=\"harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|37\" />  Unlike the main dining saloon, the restaurant gave passengers the freedom to eat whenever they liked (between 8&nbsp;am and 11&nbsp;pm).<ref name=\"Beveridge_282\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=282}}</ref> The restaurant was not managed by the [[White Star Line]]; Luigi Gatti ran it as a concession and his staff were not part of the regular [[Crew of the RMS Titanic|crew]].<ref name=\"Beveridge_286\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=286}}</ref>\n\nThe restaurant was one of the most luxurious rooms on the ship, decorated in the [[Neoclassicism#Architecture and the decorative arts|Louis XVI style]], with exquisitely carved French walnut panelling trimmed in gilt-brass accents.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349146/Louis-XVI-style|title=Louis XVI style|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> Fluted columns interspersed throughout the room were carved with gilded ribbons and the plaster ceilings were delicately molded with flower and ribbon motifs. Mirrors were installed within the panelling imitating windows and the room was divided into bays along either side with oval mirrors inset.

Measuring 1,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in area, it was the largest room on board any ship in 1912, and accommodated up to 554 passengers.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 32.</ref> The ship's designers had originally planned to build an extravagant two-storey dining saloon topped by a dome for the ''Titanic'' and her sisters, like those on the rival [[Cunard]] liners ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' and ''[[RMS Mauretania (1906)|Mauretania]]''. This was vetoed early in the design stages in favour of a lavish single deck saloon which nonetheless greatly exceeded its Cunard rivals in terms of space.\n\nThe dining saloon was decorated in wooden panelling carved in the [[Jacobean style]] and painted in glossy white enamel. There were two aisles the length of the room which created a large central dining area delineated by pillars. At both the aft and forward end of this central area were two elaborately carved oak buffet stations that contrasted warmly with the otherwise entirely white room. On either side of the central seating area the room was divided into alcoves by partition walls with arched windows. In total, there were 115 tables, set for two to twelve people.<ref name=\"Beveridge_365\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=365}}</ref> Children were allowed to eat here with their parents, as long as the dining saloon was not fully booked.<ref name=\"Beveridge_177\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Titanic''{{'}}s dining saloon featured red and blue linoleum tiles. The furniture was made of oak and chairs upholstered in dark green leather, unusual in the fact that they were not swivel chairs bolted to the floor (a standard feature in other first-class dining saloons of the time). The rooms' portholes were elegantly concealed by rectangular 5&nbsp;ft. tall leaded-glass windows, giving passengers the impression that they were eating onshore instead of at sea. For even more atmosphere, the windows were lit from behind during the evening meals.<ref name=\"Beveridge_361\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=361}}</ref> The dining saloon's meals were prepared in the galley next door, which also serviced the [[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|second-class dining saloon]], located further aft on D Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_367\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=367}}</ref>\n\nOn the ''Titanic'' a seating chart for diners was drafted that remained in place the length of the voyage, though passengers could make special seating requests with the Purser at the beginning of the voyage. The dining saloon was open between 8 and 10&nbsp;am for breakfast, 1 and 2:30&nbsp;pm for lunch, and 6 and 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner.<ref>\"Meals\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

A [[bugle]] call to the tune of \"[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]\" was sounded half an hour in advance of lunch or dinner by the ship's bugler, Peter W. Fletcher, so that passengers could dress, before a second call signalling the start of the meal.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=116}}</ref> On Sundays, beginning at 11:00&nbsp;am, the dining saloon was also used for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] service, which was conducted by the captain or, in his absence, by a minister travelling in first class.

Located mid-ship, most of the room has collapsed \u2013 the aft end was severed during the break-up of the ship, allowing its contents to spill out. The very forward part survives and is accessible from the reception room, the partition wall having deteriorated. Several of the rectangular leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'' along with much of the wooden panelling, the gilded brass light fixtures, and the cast iron supports for the tables.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 81.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the ''Titanic's'' dining room chairs were recovered by the ''[[Mackay Bennett]]'' as wreckage in the weeks after the sinking, as is attested in photographs. Several of the bronze grilles from the swinging doors in the dining saloon have been identified in the debris field, along with innumerable pieces of silverware, china, and glassware from the dining saloon service.\n\n=== Verandah Caf\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Verandah Caf\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The ''Olympic''{{'}}s Verandah Caf\u00e9]]\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 (also known as the Palm Court, or the Verandah and Palm Court) was divided into two rooms, located on both sides of the second-class staircase, on A Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=254}}</ref> Reminiscent of an outdoor sidewalk caf\u00e9, its rooms were brightly lit by large windows and double sliding doors that opened onto the aft end of the first-class Promenade Deck. The caf\u00e9 was elegantly furnished with wicker tables and chairs, spread out across a checkerboard tiled floor in light brown and beige.<ref name=\"Beveridge_248\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=248}}</ref> Various outdoor plants filled the rooms, including potted [[Kentia]] palms and ivy-covered trellises. It offered commanding views of the ocean but was fully enclosed so that it could be enjoyed in all types of weather, unlike the open-air caf\u00e9s on the {{RMS|Lusitania|3=2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}. First-class passengers could enjoy a selection of refreshments in the caf\u00e9.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\" />\n\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 had both smoking and non-smoking sections. The smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side, was accessible from the first-class smoking room. The non-smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side, was closed to traffic from the smoking room and on occasion used as a play area by mothers and children. To note, no such official area existed on board.<ref>.{{harvsp|E. E. O'Donnel|1998|p=64}}</ref> Contrary to the ''Titanic's'', the ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]''{{'}}s non-smoking section was frequently deserted.<ref name=\"Beveridge_250\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=250}}</ref>\n\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 was similar in style on both the ''Olympic'' and the ''Titanic''.

In keeping with social conventions of the time, the room was exclusive to men.<!--<ref name=\"Brewster, Coulter_29\" />--> In order to recreate the same atmosphere of a gentlemen's club, the room was decorated with dark [[mahogany]] panelling inlaid with [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and richly carved. Numerous large [[stained-glass]] windows were installed in pedimented niches within the panelling, illuminated from behind.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=245}}</ref> Like the lounge, the ceilings and windows were raised above the level of the Boat Deck for increased height and the room was flanked by alcoves with bay windows, also in stained-glass.\n\nThe floor was laid with blue and red linoleum tiles and the plaster ceiling was moulded with plaster medallions. In the centre of the far-back wall was a Norman Wilkinson painting, ''Plymouth Harbor'', which hung over a coal-burning fireplace in white marble. This was the only real fireplace on board: the others were installed with electric heaters.<ref name=BB245>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=252}}</ref> Square tables with raised edges (to prevent drink spillage in rough weather) dotted the room, surrounded by round club chairs upholstered in leather, of an unknown colour (probably green or burgundy).<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=246}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the fireplace was a revolving door which led to the Verandah Caf\u00e9. The room was U-shaped because the ventilation shaft from the Turbine Engine Room occupied the forward end. This area also included bathrooms.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=249}}</ref>\n\nThe Smoking Room was the preferred spot of gamblers who crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Professional card sharps also travelled on board under aliases, and the purser could do nothing but warn passengers about these swindlers, since passengers played at their own risk. At least four professional players travelled on board the ''Titanic''.<ref>{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=115}}</ref> Cigars and drinks could be made available upon request of the passengers, and were provided by the stewards of the adjacent bar.<ref name=\"Beveridge_248\" /> The bar stopped serving at 11:30&nbsp;pm and the Smoking Room itself closed at midnight.<ref>\"Smoke Room\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

No pictures of the ''Titanic's'' Smoking Room are known, only those of the ''Olympic''. Certain artifacts which once decorated the room have been recovered from the debris field, including two of the gilt-bronze chandeliers, and portions of the red and blue linoleum floor tiles.<ref>Wels, Susan.

It occupied a large space mid-ship on A-Deck, offering views onto the Promenade Deck and the ocean beyond. Intricately carved English oak panelling with intermittent motifs of musical instruments were the dominant feature of the room.<ref>Wels, Susan. ''Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner'', Time Life Books: 1997; pp. 68-9.</ref> Bronze sconces and large rounded mirrors were installed throughout. A 49-light opaque glass and ormolu [[Electrolier]] with crystal embellishment occupied the central recess of the ceiling, which was itself elaborately molded with instrumental motifs. Adjoining the open seating area were cosy alcoves with inset mirrors and tall bay windows of [[lead glass|leaded]] and [[stained glass]].\n\nThe lounge had an impressive height of 12&nbsp;ft. 3 in., enabled by raising the ceiling above the level of the Boat-Deck.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 38.</ref> Groups of tables and chairs, sofas, and armchairs upholstered in plush velvet with green and gold floral patterns were scattered throughout. At the centre of the forward wall was a gracefully carved grey marble decorative fireplace (it contained only an electric heater). A replica statue of the [[Diana of Versailles]] stood on the mantelpiece, with a large mirror above.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/artemis-versailles.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Artemis of Versailles|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> At the opposite end the wall curved and contained a wide mahogany bookcase which functioned as a lending library for first-class passengers. They could choose from a permanent collection of classics and the latest releases, which were freshly stocked on every voyage.<ref>\"Lounge\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; p. 12-13.</ref>\n\nOpen daily between 8&nbsp;am and 11&nbsp;pm, the room was used primarily for socializing and the taking of tea, coffee and light refreshment before and after dinner, serviced by a small connecting bar. It was a largely female domain but available to both sexes; because of its size it was also convenient for holding concerts and other first-class events, as is attested on the ''Olympic''.\n\n==== Artifacts from the lounge ====\nThe ''Titanic''{{'}}s lounge was destroyed when the ship broke apart, being located in an area where the midsection decks collapsed upon impact with the ocean floor. Several pieces of wreckage from the lounge have been identified in the debris field surrounding the wreck, including the [[Artemis]] statue, bronze sconces, and portions of the window frames.<ref>Dr Robert D.

They were installed after being purchased at auction when the ''Olympic'' was scrapped in 1935.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'' WellFleet Press: 1997; 46-47.</ref> This room gives the best approximation of how the lounge appeared on the ''Olympic'' and thereby the ''Titanic''.

The room was on the port side of the long corridor which connected the grand staircase to the lounge and was generally a female domain, though men could also use the room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 59.</ref> It was divided into two zones with a spacious main area and a smaller seating alcove off to the right separated by a porticoed doorway with [[oeil-de-boeuf]] windows. Like the lounge, the room was raised above the Boat Deck, allowing for 11&nbsp;ft. high windows and an enhanced feeling of spaciousness.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref>\n\nDecorated in a refined Georgian decorative order and painted white, the room featured delicate plaster work combined with sleek panelling, fluted columns, and a white marble fireplace. Potted palms on tall stands were placed in the corners of the room, while shaded sconces and beaded crystal chandeliers provided soft lighting. Comfortable silk-upholstered settees and chairs in shades of yellow and blue were grouped around tables and writing desks for convenience. The windows were lined with pink silk curtains and looked out onto the Promenade Deck, allowing ample sunlight to flood the room. The popularity of this space had proved disappointing aboard the ''Olympic'', and Thomas Andrews had plans to convert part of the room on the ''Titanic'' into further passenger quarters.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 40.</ref>\n\n=== Reception room ===\n[[File:Titanic-first-class-reception-room2.jpg|thumb|First-class reception on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nThe first-class dining saloon on D-Deck was preceded by a large reception room, measuring {{convert|460|m2|sqft|abbr=on|0}}, located at the foot of the forward grand staircase and encompassing the entire width of the ship. An ornate candelabra rested on the middle railing at the base of the staircase, the light oak colour of which contrasted warmly with the white-painted reception room.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=360}}</ref> The Reception area would have been the first impression of the ''Titanic'' for many first-class passengers entering through the two semi-enclosed entry vestibules on either side of the staircase. Around the corner from the reception room, forward of the staircase, was the set of three first-class elevators which ran the length of the stairwell.\n\n[[File:RMS Olympic Reception Room.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' reception room looking towards the Dining Saloon]]\nThe reception room was decorated in richly carved mahogany [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]]-style panelling painted a glossy white. Furnished with comfortable wicker chairs and Chesterfields upholstered in green damask silk, the room would have been conspicuously light and airy because of the beautifully illuminated leaded-glass windows which ran along either side of the room.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 54.</ref> These were lit naturally during the day through portholes concealed behind the windows and electrically in the evening. In contrast to the linoleum floors on the ''Olympic'', the ''Titanic''{{'}}s reception room was covered with plush [[Axminster carpet]]ing and there were potted palms in built-in holders in the corners of the alcoves.<ref name=BB355>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=355}}</ref> An imposing [[Aubusson tapestry]], ''La Chasse du duc de Guise'',<ref>{{harvsp|Philippe Masson|1998|p=30}}</ref> hung in front of the staircase. On the wall close to the tapestry were letters indicating the name of the deck.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=358}}</ref>\n\nIt was recorded on the inaugural voyage of the ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]'', whose reception hall was slightly smaller, that the room quickly filled up after dinner.<ref name=BB355 /> On the starboard side, there was an area reserved for a [[quintet]] and it held a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] [[Piano|grand piano]].<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=132}}</ref> The ''Titanic's'' reception room was enlarged in contrast to her sister ship through a reconfiguration of the two entry vestibules, reducing their size and adding broad arched entrances opening onto the foyer in front of the elevators.\n\nThe reception room was open to passengers before and after meals. Here, the orchestra played from 4 to 5&nbsp;pm while tea was served, then after dinner, from 8 to 9:15&nbsp;pm. Stewards served liquor and cigars until 11&nbsp;pm, at which time the hall closed. Generally, there were many spectators in the Room while the orchestra played.\n\n==== Entrance vestibules ====\nThe ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic'' both featured duplicate entrance vestibules on their port and starboard sides within the D-Deck reception rooms. There were sets of double gangway doors within the hull, screened by wrought-iron grilles.<ref>{{harvsp|Lynch & Marschall| 2001| p=78}}</ref> The vestibules were partially enclosed areas in the same white Jacobean-style panelling, and each contained a large sideboard for storing china. One set of French doors led into the reception room, but there was also a broad, arched entryway leading to the elevators. Separate corridors led off of the vestibules to the first-class staterooms in the forward part of D-Deck.\n\nThe ''Titanic's'' vestibules differed from those on the ''Olympic'' \u2013 they were reduced in size to make the reception room larger and they eliminated the communicating corridor between the two sides in order to enlarge the elevator foyers. The ''Olympic'' vestibules contained Third-Class staircases that led down to E-Deck, which were eliminated on ''Titanic'', and the elaborate wrought-iron grilles which covered the gangway doors were unique to ''Titanic''.\n\nIt was reported that during the sinking [[Charles Lightoller|2nd Officer Lightoller]] ordered crew members to open the port side gangway doors on D-Deck for loading more passengers into the lifeboats nearer to sea level.<ref>{{harvsp|Don Lynch & Ken Marschall|1997|p=108}}</ref> The 1986 expedition confirmed that one of the port-side doors was wide open and the inner doors pulled back.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" /> This would have significantly increased the ''Titanic's'' flooding if the crew neglected to close doors.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nSince its first exploration by [[James Cameron]] in 1995, the reception room has become one of the best-documented rooms inside the wreck of the ''Titanic''. It is accessed fairly easily via [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] from the forward stairwell, though there is a deep layer of silt and hanging [[rusticles]] which obscure large parts of the room. The ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' exploration in 2001 discovered that the ''Titanic's'' reception room differed in several minor details from the ''Olympic'': there were more support pillars, the decorative grilles of the elevator entrances were different, and there was a completely unknown wrought iron grill door in the front of the D-Deck gangway entrance.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, ''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Most of the exquisite leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'', along with much of the mahogany panelling, built-in plant holders, light fixtures, and carved framework surrounding the steel support pillars of the room. Small amounts of the original white lead paint survive in the carved creases of the woodwork, and several of the swinging doors with their bronze grilles still hang in the entrance vestibule doorways.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" />\n\n=== Promenade and Boat Decks ===\n[[File:RMS Olympic promenade deck.jpg|thumb|Promenade Deck on the RMS ''Olympic''. The entrance to the aft grand staircase is in the foreground.]]\n\nThe Promenade Deck encircled the whole of A-Deck and together with the middle part of the Boat Deck constituted the outdoor space for first-class passengers to enjoy the sea air and take exercise. Grand first-class public rooms with their large bay windows, like the smoking room and lounge, characterise the aft end of the Promenade. The forward end is distinguished by the stateroom windows which lined the walls along either side, with their heavy bronze frames and etched glass panes.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 58.</ref> Parts of this deck were as wide as 30&nbsp;ft. and sheltered alcoves at points along the deck were used to store the dozens of folded teak deckchairs which passengers could rent during the voyage.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\" />\n\nThe aft end of the Promenade was a large open air space flanked by two large cargo [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. This part of the deck was installed with wooden slatted wrought iron benches from where passengers could enjoy views of the stern and the sea. [[Francis Browne]] took several photos of this area on the ''Titanic'', including a famous one of 6 year old [[Polar the Titanic Bear|Douglas Spedden]] spinning a top with his father.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 66.</ref>  A key distinguishing feature between the ''Titanic'' and her sister ship is the ''Titanic'''s enclosed forward Promenade Deck, which was installed as protection against the elements and to reinforce a part of the ship prone to heavy vibration. Both had proven to be issues on board the ''Olympic.''<ref>Matsen, Brad. \"Titanic's Last Secrets: The Further Adventures of Shadow Divers John Chatterton & Richie Kohler\" Hachette: 2008; 132.</ref>\n\nDeck chairs and steamer rugs could be rented at the Purser's Office for 4 shillings/1 dollar each, which applied for the entire voyage. Stewards would bring broth and hot drinks for passengers to enjoy if requested.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 31.</ref> Oftentimes a passenger could spend the entire day relaxing and reading in his/her deck chair. The Promenade Deck was popular for playing games like [[shuffleboard]], deck quoits, [[dominoes]], and [[chess]], which could be obtained from the Quartermaster.\n\nThe middle part of the Boat Deck also served as a 200&nbsp;ft. long open-air promenade for first-class passengers between the officer's promenade at the forward end and the second-class promenade further aft. The gymnasium was located on the starboard side and the raised roof of the lounge, 82&nbsp;ft. above the waterline, functioned as a large sun deck where deckchairs could be set up.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., ''The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.'' Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref> This part of the deck was occupied by only four of the ''Titanic's'' 20 lifeboats, which were swung out to the side of the ship at the beginning of the voyage to leave the decks totally uncluttered for the first class.\n\nThe deck chairs from ''Titanic'', 614 in all between the first- and second-class areas, have become some of the most recognisable artefacts from the liner. Chief Baker [[Charles Joughin]] described throwing dozens overboard from the Promenade Deck during the sinking to be used as flotation devices; passing ships in the weeks after the sinking encountered islands of floating debris including deck chairs. About 10 of ''Titanic's'' deck chairs are known today, including one in the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia and one in the [[Museum of the City of New York]].<ref name=\"usatoday2\">{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-07/titanic-rearrange-deck-chairs/54084648/1|title=Titanic deck chairs' sad symbolism lives on|website=USATODAY.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\"artnet\">{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/deck-chair-titanic-museum-new-york-614054|title=See Deck Chair Salvaged from the &#039;Titanic&#039; &#124; artnet News|website=news.artnet.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/arts/design/one-titanic-survivor-goes-on-view-a-deck-chair.html?_r=0|title=One Titanic Survivor Goes on View: A Deck Chair|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Grand staircase ===\n{{Further|Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic}}\n[[File:Grand staircase.jpg|thumb|The grand staircase on board the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nThe grand staircase was one of the most impressive features on board the ''Titanic'' and the centre of first-class activity. The main stairwell was located in the forward part of the ship and began on the Boat Deck, extending six flights down to E-Deck. B and D Decks contained entry foyers on either side where first-class passengers would embark and disembark, the D-Deck entryway leading directly into the reception room. Each level was constructed in solid [[English oak]] with sweeping curves and the surrounding spaces panelled in the sleek neoclassical [[English Baroque|William and Mary]] style. The balustrades displayed distinctive wrought iron grilles with ormolu swags in the style of [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]].<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic,'' Carlton Press: 1997; pp. 36-7</ref> The A-Deck level was undoubtedly the most spectacular and is the most recognisable due to its frequent depiction in film.\n\nThe staircase was crowned by an extravagant [[wrought iron]] and glass dome with a large chandelier at the centre. This dome was installed on the roof of the boat deck and provided natural light to the stairwell before being artificially lit at night from behind. On the central landing of the A-Deck staircase was an exquisitely carved clock with allegorical figures on either side, known as ''Honour and Glory crowning Time.''<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic: An Illustrated History,'' Wellfleet Press: 2005; pp. 52-3</ref> At the foot of the staircase, on the newel post of the middle balustrade, was a bronze cherub holding an electric torch. B and C Decks probably had smaller replicas of these cherubs at either corner of the staircases, and contained landscape oil paintings as the focal points of their landings instead of the unique clock on A-Deck.\n\nFrom the grand staircase a passenger could access almost all of the facilities available in first class, level by level:\n\n* The Boat Deck level gave access to the outside promenade space, sun deck, the lifeboats, and the adjoining Gymnasium. The A-Deck level accessed first-class accommodation at the forward part of the ship and the grand public rooms located further aft via a long corridor. Entry vestibules opened onto the encircling Promenade Deck from the stairway.\n* B and C Decks connected to the main corridors containing the bulk of first-class accommodation, including the extravagant 'Millionaire's Suites' located immediately off the B-Deck level staircase. On the Starboard side of the C-Deck staircase was the Purser's Office, where passengers stored their jewellery and other valuable belongings during the voyage.\n* On D-Deck the staircase opened directly onto the reception room and adjoining Dining Saloon. Instead of a cherub, the central post of the staircase contained an impressive gilt candelabra with electric lights.<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\" /> Behind the staircases were installed the three first-class elevators which ran between E and A Decks.\n* On E-Deck the staircase narrowed and lost the sweeping curve of the upper flights; a modest single flight terminated on F-Deck, where the Turkish Baths and Swimming Pool could be reached.\n\n== Aft grand staircase ==\n[[File:RMS Olympic aft grand staircase.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' Aft grand staircase]]\nThere was in fact a second grand staircase located further aft in the ship, between the third and fourth funnels. It was in the same style as the forward grand staircase with an illuminated dome at the centre, but it was smaller and only installed between A, B, and C Decks. A simple clock graced the main landing in contrast to the ornate \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" clock in the forward Staircase. One could access the Smoking Room immediately off the A-Deck level, and the lounge via a long companionway with revolving doors on the port side.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/a-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : A Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On the ''Titanic'' there were two additional stateroom suites installed on either side of the A-Deck staircase, one of which was occupied by [[Thomas Andrews]], the ship's builder.\n\nThe whole of the B-Deck foyer was used as a reception area for patrons of the \u00c1 La Carte Restaurant and Caf\u00e9 Parisien, specially designed in the [[Georgian style|Georgian]] style and painted white like the main reception room on D-Deck. There was a recess for coat storage and comfortable [[rattan]] seating was arranged in groups throughout the room. This was in contrast to the B-Deck foyer of ''Olympic'', where there was no restaurant reception room and the foyer space was much smaller because of additional cabins and storage rooms.\n\nThis staircase was located just aft of where the ''Titanic'' broke apart during the sinking and was totally destroyed. It is assumed to be the source of much of the woodwork recovered as wreckage after the sinking.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|Second and Third-Class facilities on the RMS Titanic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n  | last1 = Archibald\n  | first1 = Rick\n  | last2 = Ballard\n  | first2 = Robert\n  | year = 2005\n  | title =The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 978-1-59223-424-0\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Beveridge\n  | first1 = Bruce\n  | year = 2009\n  | title = The Ship Magnificent, Volume Two: Interior Design & Fitting\n  | publisher = The History Press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7524-4626-4\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Chirnside\n  | first1 = Mark\n  | year = 2004\n  | title = The Olympic-class ships : \" Olympic \", \" Titanic \", \" Britannic \"\n  | publisher = Tempus\n  | isbn = 0-7524-2868-3\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 2003\n  | title = Ghosts of the Abyss\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 0-306-81223-1\n  | ref = harv\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/ghostsofabyssjou0000lync\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 1997\n  | title = Titanic: An Illustrated History\n  | publisher = Wellfleet press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7858-1972-1\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Marschall\n | first1 = Ken\n | year = 2001\n | title = James Cameron's Titanic Expedition: What We Saw on and Inside the Wreck\n | publisher = marconigraph.com\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = O'Donnel\n  | first1 = E.

In contrast to her French and German competitors, whose interiors were extravagantly decorated and heavily adorned, the ''Titanic'' emphasized comfort and subdued elegance more in the style of a British country manor or luxury hotel.<ref>{{harvsp|Robert Ballard|2005|p=77}}</ref> ''Titanic's'' enormous size enabled her to feature unusually large rooms, all equipped with the latest technologies for comfort, hygiene, and convenience. Staterooms and public spaces recreated historic styles with a painstaking attention to detail and accuracy. There was a wide range of recreational and sporting facilities in addition which provided ample opportunity for amusement during a voyage.\n\nAlthough closely similar to her sister ship and predecessor the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']], ''Titanic'' featured additional first-class staterooms, augmented public rooms, and myriad minor improvements to enhance her luxury and comfort.\n\n[[File:Titanic cutaway diagram.png|thumb|''Titanic'' cutaway diagram]]\n\n== Location ==\nThe bulk of first-class facilities and accommodation was located on the upper decks within the superstructure of the ''Titanic'', where the vibrations and noise of the engines were at their lowest. The entirety of A-Deck was devoted to first-class recreational space and accommodation, along with most of B and C Decks. First-class facilities were located on every level down to F-Deck, which means that first-class passengers enjoyed the most space by far of any of the three classes on the ship.\n\n== Accommodation ==\n[[File:Titanic's B 59 stateroom.jpg|thumb|''Titanic'''s B 59 stateroom]]\nThe ''Titanic'' and her sister ''Olympic'' offered the finest and most luxurious first-class accommodations to be found on any contemporary ocean liner. The cheapest first-class fare could be had for \u00a323 ({{Inflation|UK|23|1912|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=-2}}), without meals.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=42}}</ref> A suite could range in price from \u00a3400 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|400|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) to \u00a3870 (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|870|1912|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) for a \"Deluxe\" Parlor Suite at the height of the travelling season.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n=== Decor & Range ===\nThe \"special staterooms\" on B and C-Decks were richly appointed in 11 different period styles, including [[Adam style|Adam]], [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]], [[Louis Quinze|XV]], and [[Louis XVI style|XVI]], [[Empire style|French Empire]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]], [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]].<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 85.</ref> Some styles, like Adam or Louis XVI, had different variations used in certain staterooms which incorporated elements from other periods, bringing the total of different designs to 19 including the 11 base styles.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59</ref> In addition, there were two custom Harland and Wolff designs known as \"Bedroom A\" and \"Bedroom B\" which were used in a total of 43 bedrooms between B and C Decks. These were period-inspired but modernized and considered equal in quality to the 11 stringent period styles. Bedroom A was the plainer of the two, featuring fielded wood panels painted white, resting on a 3-foot high carved oak [[Dado (architecture)|dado]], and furnished with a brass or wooden bedstead. Bedroom B was known as the \"French cabin\" because it was Louis XV-inspired, featuring varnished oak panelling and [[Cabriolet (furniture)|Cabriolet]] furniture.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 59-60</ref>\n\nIn the \"special staterooms\", there was a wide range of finely carved panelling, veneers, and marquetry made from exotic imported woods like [[Mahogany]], [[Sycamore]], [[Walnut]], [[Oak]] and [[Satinwood]]. Such was the attention to historic detail that every piece of furniture, light fixture, upholstery, and woodwork was recreated with an obsessive care for accuracy by designers and master craftsmen at Harland and Wolff. There were a small number of outside contractors hired to fit out select rooms or provide furnishings. The Dutch firm of H.P. Mutters & Zoon, for instance, fitted out twelve of the \"special staterooms\" according to the chosen period styles, supplying everything from the panelling and doors down to the sofa pillows, [[Down feather|down]] bed quilts, and wastepaper baskets.<ref>Beveridge 2008 p. 67-75</ref>\n\nFirst-class accommodation occupied almost the entirety of B and C Decks, but also large sections forward on A, D and E-Decks; a handful of first-class cabins were located on the boat deck between the forward grand staircase and officer's quarters.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/b-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : B Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On E-Deck staterooms and cabins were interchangeable between First and Second-Class, meaning sections could be prioritized for either one of the classes in the event of overbooking or high demand.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/e-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : E Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> Only the starboard side of E-Deck belonged to First/Second-Class, the whole of the Port side contained Third-Class and Crew cabins. The first-class corridors were in general very spartan in appearance, but the B and C Deck passageways which accessed the very finest staterooms were more impressive. These featured white-painted 'Venesta' panels (a durable type of [[plywood]]), pilasters, archways over the stateroom entrances, and a decorative [[frieze]] supported by gilt brackets running along the top of the walls which concealed the ventilation ducts and electrical wiring underneath.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\">Beveridge 2008 p. 264</ref> There were no handrails, no carpet runners, and lighting was provided by [[ormolu]] and cut-glass ceiling fixtures. On B Deck the two parallel corridors were enclosed by swinging [[baize]]-upholstered doors with [[louver]] panels, which muffled the sound coming from the stairwells and busy public rooms.<ref name=\"Beveridge 2008 p. 264\"/>\n\nThe space which had been given over to an encircling B-Deck promenade on the ''Olympic'' was converted to additional large staterooms on ''Titanic'', the finest on board. Many of these staterooms had private entrances, separate servants' quarters, adjoining doors, and en-suite bathrooms; they could be booked in groups to accommodate families and servants. In all there were almost 330 first-class rooms, 100 of which were single-berth.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\">Description from ''International Marine Engineering'', July 1911. Tibballs, Geoff,\"The Mammoth Book of the Titanic.\" Carroll & Graf: 2002; 21.</ref>\n\nThe type of first-class stateroom that predominated was a single- or double-berth stateroom which contained a dressing table, horsehair sofa, wardrobe, and marble-topped washstand with basin. Double berth cabins had \"tipped\" washbasins on shelves that could be folded back into the cabinet to save room.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 101.</ref> Many also had additional bunks suspended over the main bed that could be folded against the wall.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Staterooms increased in size thereafter with double beds, built-in wardrobes, and comfortable seating areas. Single berth state rooms, like those on A-Deck, were decorated more modestly than the lavish period suites on B and C-Decks. Above most beds was an electrical outlet with a call button that could summon a steward, a reading lamp and a wire-mesh basket for storing small items. Although the ''Titanic'' was centrally heated, all first-class cabins contained [[electric heaters]] to provide additional warmth and passengers could get electric bed warmers on request to a steward.<ref>Hutchings, David F.; de Kerbrech, Richard P. (2011). RMS Titanic 1909\u201312 (Olympic Class): Owners' Workshop Manual. 74.</ref>\n\n=== Facilities ===\nAs was standard at the time, the bulk of first-class bathroom facilities were shared. Communal lavatories with illuminated signage could be found along the passageways divided by gender. A passenger could take a bath by notifying a steward, who would draw the bath based on availability. Because of the need to conserve limited fresh water supplies, baths were supplied with sea water; only the attached showers of the private bathrooms utilised fresh water.<ref>\"Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 13-14.</ref> ''Titanic'' had an impressive ratio of private bathrooms to passengers, more than any other ship in 1912. Virtually all of the suites on B and C Decks featured en-suite bathrooms.\n\nAlthough bed linen was changed daily, there was no laundry aboard because of limited fresh-water supplies. Passengers could get their clothes pressed and shoes polished on request, for a small fee.<ref>\"Boots & Shoes\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean Ports and the United States. March 1910, 3rd Issue; 29.</ref> Morning tea and pastries were served to passengers in their staterooms, but there was no room service in the modern sense \u2013 passengers had to go to the dining room to be served full breakfasts and other meals.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. 882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic, Scholastic Press, 1998; 31.</ref>\n\n=== The Parlour Suites ===\n[[File:B-58.jpg|thumb|Stateroom B-58 from the B-Deck Parlour Suite]]\nThe most splendid first-class accommodation on both the ''Titanic'' and the ''Olympic'' were the four parlour suites, two each on B and C Decks, just aft of the forward grand staircase landings. The two on B-Deck were advertised as \"Deluxe\" Parlour Suites, or Promenade Suites, because they each contained a 50&nbsp;ft. (15.24 M.) private promenade deck. The promenade deck connected to the first-class gangway entrances immediately forward, enabling the copious amounts of luggage usually carried by the ''Titanic's'' richest passengers to be loaded directly into their suites. The Parlour Suites each comprised two large bedrooms, two walk-in wardrobes, a private bathroom, lavatory, and a spacious sitting room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 57.</ref> The sitting rooms were lavish rooms that allowed for receiving small parties of guests. Each featured a faux fireplace, large card table, plush sofas and chairs, sideboards, and writing desks.\n\nThe two private promenade decks were unique to the ''Titanic'', decorated in half-timber [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]] panelling, wicker deck chairs, sofas, tables and potted plants. The deck chairs were cane, made by Dryad of Leicester.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The chairman of the [[White Star Line]], [[J. Bruce Ismay]], occupied the port-side \"Deluxe\" Suite on the ''Titanic'', while the starboard suite was occupied by the American millionaire Mrs. [[Charlotte Drake Cardeza]], her son, and entourage.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss''. 2001; 108-9.</ref>\n\n=== Condition in the Wreck ===\nThere has been relatively little exploration of the first-class staterooms on ''Titanic'' since her discovery. Only the staterooms in the bow section forward of the [[Grand Staircase of the Titanic|grand staircase]] survive in an appreciable condition. Because the cabins were all framed in pine and [[teak]], many of the walls between staterooms have deteriorated, leaving a warren of tangled electrical wiring, deep [[silt]] and wreckage treacherous to [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROVs]]. James Cameron's 2001 ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' expedition focused on the cabins of some of the most famous ''Titanic'' passengers, including [[Henry S. Harper]], [[Molly Brown]] and [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Russell]]. Outstanding images of the marble [[Adam style|Adam]]-style fireplace in Bruce Ismay's Deluxe Suite sitting room and the gilded [[Louis Quinze]] fireplace of Mrs. Cardeza's sitting room were produced.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 108-9.</ref> Ismay's Private Promenade was also discovered, with the remnants of the distinctive half-timber panelling seen for the first time since the sinking.\n\nThe more common remains that delineate staterooms include desks and other hardwood furniture, collapsed bunks, silver-plated lamps, doors, brass bed frames, and even upright cabinets with their contents still in place on the shelves. In the debris field are strewn hundreds of items from first-class staterooms that poured out of the ship during the break-up.\n\n== Sporting facilities ==\n[[File:Gym.jpg|thumb|The gymnasium]]\nThe ''Titanic'' featured numerous sporting and relaxation facilities including:\n*A gymnasium including a punch bag, a rowing machine, exercise bikes, Stationary bicycles, two electric camels, and an electric horse.\n*[[Turkish bath]]s, [[electric bath]]s, and [[steam room]]\n*Private massage room\n*[[Swimming pool]]\n*[[Squash (sport)|Squash court]]\n*[[Barber]]\n\n=== Gymnasium ===\nThe 1st-Class Gymnasium was just aft of the forward grand staircase along the Starboard side of the Boat Deck. It was a brightly lit room with white-painted oak panelling and tile floors. Along the wall opposite the entrance was a carved oak installation with an illustrated cutaway of an [[Olympic-class ocean liner]] and a map depicting the travel routes of the [[White Star Line]] throughout the world. The room was equipped with state-of-the-art exercise equipment manufactured in [[Wiesbaden]], including two electric camels, an electric horse, a [[rowing machine]], punching bag, a weightlifting machine and mechanical bicycles.<ref>{{harvsp|Susan Wels|1997|p=34}}</ref>\n\nThere was a permanent \"Physical Educator\" on staff named T.W. McCawley who assisted passengers in using the devices. The gymnasium was open during the following hours and, like other recreational facilities aboard the ''Titanic'', segregated by gender and age:\n\n* 9:00&nbsp;am \u2013 12:00&nbsp;pm for Ladies Only\n* 1:00\u20133:00&nbsp;pm for Children Only\n* 2:00\u20136:00&nbsp;pm for Gentlemen Only\n\nThe roof of the deck house which enclosed the Gymnasium has long since collapsed and the room itself is sinking into the deck below.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken,''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Nonetheless the wood panelling that lined the walls is recognizable and so are some of the exercise machines.\n\n=== Turkish baths ===\n[[File:Cool Room of the Turkish Baths, RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|Cool Room in the Turkish Baths on the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nAlong the Starboard side of F-Deck was a spa complex for first-class passengers known as the Turkish Baths. Besides the ''Titanic'', only the White Star liners [[RMS Adriatic|RMS ''Adriatic'']] (1906) and the [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']] (1911) featured Turkish Baths on board.<ref>Shifrin, Malcolm (2015). \"Chapter 23: The Turkish bath at sea\". Victorian Turkish Baths. Historic England. {{ISBN|978-1-84802-230-0}}.</ref>\nThere was a Temperate Room, Cool Room, Hot Room, Steam Room, [[electric bath]] and two Shampoo Rooms where massage was performed.\n\nThe Baths were segregated by sex, available to women between 9:00&nbsp;a.m. and 12:00&nbsp;p.m., and to men between 2:00&nbsp;p.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m. There was a charge of 4 shillings (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=4}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $1, per person for admission.<ref>\"Turkish Baths\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada. Mediterranean and the United States.' March 1910, 3rd Edition; pg. 14.</ref>\n\nThe Cool Room was the central feature of the Turkish Baths, decorated in a mix of Moorish/Arabic styles to evoke a Turkish [[Turkish bath|hamam]]. The walls were adorned with glossy blue-green tiles, richly carved teak, and bronze lamps. Against one wall was a marble drinking fountain. The ceiling was deeply recessed and painted a deep crimson, with gilded beams and hanging lanterns, supported by pillars encased in teak.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">{{harvsp|Geoff Tibballs|1997|p=40}}</ref> Unlike the ''Olympic'', the Titanic's cooling room did not have an exterior wall but still included \"fake\" portholes concealed by a carved Cairo curtain.  The doorways were adorned with gilded semi-domes to lend an exotic effect. Throughout the room were teak folding chairs, Damascus tables and cushioned chaise lounges for relaxation. There were also small curtained cubicles for changing.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nThe Cool Room was rediscovered in 2005 during a filming expedition for [[James Cameron]]'s documentary ''Last Mysteries of the Titanic'', in a remarkable state of preservation.<ref name=\"youtube\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD0FNG7xvfw|title=Titanic Turkish Baths|website=YouTube|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> The room would have flooded early in the sinking and its location deep within the ship insulated it from damage when the bow hit the sea bed. It is largely protected from the destructive [[microbes]] and sea creatures which consume more exposed parts of the ship; because of this the woodwork is in good condition, even the delicate recliners and framework for the dressing rooms survive in recognizable condition.\n\n=== Swimming Pool ===\n[[File:Swimming pool of the Titanic.jpg|thumb|Swimming pool of the ''Olympic'']]\nAcross the corridor from the Turkish Baths was a heated swimming pool measuring an impressive 30&nbsp;ft. long X 14&nbsp;ft. wide and 7&nbsp;ft. deep. Water depth was 5&nbsp;ft. 4 in. at the deep end and 4&nbsp;ft. 6 in. at the shallow end.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\">{{harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413}}</ref> Heated salt water from a tank and cold sea water were pumped into the pool once the ship was out to sea. The room offered 13 changing cubicles and 2 shower stalls for convenience. The floors were tiled in blue and white linoleum, and a marble stair with teak footholds descended into the pool. The pool cost 1 shilling (\u00a3{{Inflation|UK|{{\u00a3sd|s=1}}|1912|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation/year|UK}}) or $0.25 to use but was open to men free of charge between 6 and 8&nbsp;a.m., for early morning exercise.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\nThe ''Olympic'' featured two [[springboard|diving boards]] which proved to be a safety hazard for divers, so they were not installed on ''Titanic''. When the ship was moving the amount of water which sloshed back and forth could make the diving-end deceptively shallow.<ref name=\"harvsp|Beveridge|2009|p=413\" />\n\nThe entrance to the Swimming Pool is blocked by a closed watertight door along the bulkhead.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\">{{harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3}}</ref> It is presumably in good condition like the neighbouring Turkish Baths, given the slow flooding which occurred in this part of the ship and the resilient materials used in the pool's construction.\n\n=== Squash Court ===\nThe ''Titanic'' featured a Squash/Racquet Court in the bow, deep within the ship on G-Deck. It measured 30&nbsp;ft. long X 20&nbsp;ft. wide and, like the Gymnasium, had its own instructor on staff, Mr. Frederick Wright. There was an accompanying Spectator's Gallery on F-Deck overlooking the court. It could be entered only by a separate staircase starting on D-Deck, from where a passenger would descend the three decks past the viewing platform to G-Deck.

Measuring 1,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> in area, it was the largest room on board any ship in 1912, and accommodated up to 554 passengers.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 32.</ref> The ship's designers had originally planned to build an extravagant two-storey dining saloon topped by a dome for the ''Titanic'' and her sisters, like those on the rival [[Cunard]] liners ''[[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' and ''[[RMS Mauretania (1906)|Mauretania]]''. This was vetoed early in the design stages in favour of a lavish single deck saloon which nonetheless greatly exceeded its Cunard rivals in terms of space.\n\nThe dining saloon was decorated in wooden panelling carved in the [[Jacobean style]] and painted in glossy white enamel. There were two aisles the length of the room which created a large central dining area delineated by pillars. At both the aft and forward end of this central area were two elaborately carved oak buffet stations that contrasted warmly with the otherwise entirely white room. On either side of the central seating area the room was divided into alcoves by partition walls with arched windows. In total, there were 115 tables, set for two to twelve people.<ref name=\"Beveridge_365\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=365}}</ref> Children were allowed to eat here with their parents, as long as the dining saloon was not fully booked.<ref name=\"Beveridge_177\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Titanic''{{'}}s dining saloon featured red and blue linoleum tiles. The furniture was made of oak and chairs upholstered in dark green leather, unusual in the fact that they were not swivel chairs bolted to the floor (a standard feature in other first-class dining saloons of the time). The rooms' portholes were elegantly concealed by rectangular 5&nbsp;ft. tall leaded-glass windows, giving passengers the impression that they were eating onshore instead of at sea. For even more atmosphere, the windows were lit from behind during the evening meals.<ref name=\"Beveridge_361\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=361}}</ref> The dining saloon's meals were prepared in the galley next door, which also serviced the [[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|second-class dining saloon]], located further aft on D Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_367\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=367}}</ref>\n\nOn the ''Titanic'' a seating chart for diners was drafted that remained in place the length of the voyage, though passengers could make special seating requests with the Purser at the beginning of the voyage. The dining saloon was open between 8 and 10&nbsp;am for breakfast, 1 and 2:30&nbsp;pm for lunch, and 6 and 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner.<ref>\"Meals\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

A [[bugle]] call to the tune of \"[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]\" was sounded half an hour in advance of lunch or dinner by the ship's bugler, Peter W. Fletcher, so that passengers could dress, before a second call signalling the start of the meal.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=116}}</ref> On Sundays, beginning at 11:00&nbsp;am, the dining saloon was also used for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]] service, which was conducted by the captain or, in his absence, by a minister travelling in first class.

Located mid-ship, most of the room has collapsed \u2013 the aft end was severed during the break-up of the ship, allowing its contents to spill out. The very forward part survives and is accessible from the reception room, the partition wall having deteriorated. Several of the rectangular leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'' along with much of the wooden panelling, the gilded brass light fixtures, and the cast iron supports for the tables.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, Ghosts of the Abyss. 2001; 81.</ref>\n\nSeveral of the ''Titanic's'' dining room chairs were recovered by the ''[[Mackay Bennett]]'' as wreckage in the weeks after the sinking, as is attested in photographs. Several of the bronze grilles from the swinging doors in the dining saloon have been identified in the debris field, along with innumerable pieces of silverware, china, and glassware from the dining saloon service.\n\n=== Verandah Caf\u00e9 ===\n[[File:Veranda caf\u00e9 on RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|The ''Olympic''{{'}}s Verandah Caf\u00e9]]\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 (also known as the Palm Court, or the Verandah and Palm Court) was divided into two rooms, located on both sides of the second-class staircase, on A Deck.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\">{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=254}}</ref> Reminiscent of an outdoor sidewalk caf\u00e9, its rooms were brightly lit by large windows and double sliding doors that opened onto the aft end of the first-class Promenade Deck.

It offered commanding views of the ocean but was fully enclosed so that it could be enjoyed in all types of weather, unlike the open-air caf\u00e9s on the {{RMS|Lusitania|3=2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}. First-class passengers could enjoy a selection of refreshments in the caf\u00e9.<ref name=\"Beveridge_254\" />\n\nThe Verandah Caf\u00e9 had both smoking and non-smoking sections. The smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|port]] side, was accessible from the first-class smoking room. The non-smoking section, located on the [[Port and starboard|starboard]] side, was closed to traffic from the smoking room and on occasion used as a play area by mothers and children. To note, no such official area existed on board.<ref>.{{harvsp|E. E.

In keeping with social conventions of the time, the room was exclusive to men.<!--<ref name=\"Brewster, Coulter_29\" />--> In order to recreate the same atmosphere of a gentlemen's club, the room was decorated with dark [[mahogany]] panelling inlaid with [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and richly carved. Numerous large [[stained-glass]] windows were installed in pedimented niches within the panelling, illuminated from behind.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=245}}</ref> Like the lounge, the ceilings and windows were raised above the level of the Boat Deck for increased height and the room was flanked by alcoves with bay windows, also in stained-glass.\n\nThe floor was laid with blue and red linoleum tiles and the plaster ceiling was moulded with plaster medallions. In the centre of the far-back wall was a Norman Wilkinson painting, ''Plymouth Harbor'', which hung over a coal-burning fireplace in white marble. This was the only real fireplace on board: the others were installed with electric heaters.<ref name=BB245>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=252}}</ref> Square tables with raised edges (to prevent drink spillage in rough weather) dotted the room, surrounded by round club chairs upholstered in leather, of an unknown colour (probably green or burgundy).<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=246}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the fireplace was a revolving door which led to the Verandah Caf\u00e9. The room was U-shaped because the ventilation shaft from the Turbine Engine Room occupied the forward end. This area also included bathrooms.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=249}}</ref>\n\nThe Smoking Room was the preferred spot of gamblers who crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Professional card sharps also travelled on board under aliases, and the purser could do nothing but warn passengers about these swindlers, since passengers played at their own risk. At least four professional players travelled on board the ''Titanic''.<ref>{{harvsp|G\u00e9rard Piouffre|2009|p=115}}</ref> Cigars and drinks could be made available upon request of the passengers, and were provided by the stewards of the adjacent bar.<ref name=\"Beveridge_248\" /> The bar stopped serving at 11:30&nbsp;pm and the Smoking Room itself closed at midnight.<ref>\"Smoke Room\" 'Notes for First Class Passengers On Board the Steamers of the White Star Line in the Services Between Great Britain and the United States and Canada.

It occupied a large space mid-ship on A-Deck, offering views onto the Promenade Deck and the ocean beyond. Intricately carved English oak panelling with intermittent motifs of musical instruments were the dominant feature of the room.<ref>Wels, Susan. ''Titanic: Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner'', Time Life Books: 1997; pp. 68-9.</ref> Bronze sconces and large rounded mirrors were installed throughout. A 49-light opaque glass and ormolu [[Electrolier]] with crystal embellishment occupied the central recess of the ceiling, which was itself elaborately molded with instrumental motifs. Adjoining the open seating area were cosy alcoves with inset mirrors and tall bay windows of [[lead glass|leaded]] and [[stained glass]].\n\nThe lounge had an impressive height of 12&nbsp;ft. 3 in., enabled by raising the ceiling above the level of the Boat-Deck.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 38.</ref> Groups of tables and chairs, sofas, and armchairs upholstered in plush velvet with green and gold floral patterns were scattered throughout. At the centre of the forward wall was a gracefully carved grey marble decorative fireplace (it contained only an electric heater). A replica statue of the [[Diana of Versailles]] stood on the mantelpiece, with a large mirror above.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/artemis-versailles.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Artemis of Versailles|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> At the opposite end the wall curved and contained a wide mahogany bookcase which functioned as a lending library for first-class passengers.

It was a largely female domain but available to both sexes; because of its size it was also convenient for holding concerts and other first-class events, as is attested on the ''Olympic''.\n\n==== Artifacts from the lounge ====\nThe ''Titanic''{{'}}s lounge was destroyed when the ship broke apart, being located in an area where the midsection decks collapsed upon impact with the ocean floor. Several pieces of wreckage from the lounge have been identified in the debris field surrounding the wreck, including the [[Artemis]] statue, bronze sconces, and portions of the window frames.<ref>Dr Robert D.

The room was on the port side of the long corridor which connected the grand staircase to the lounge and was generally a female domain, though men could also use the room.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic \u2013 An Illustrated History'', Wellfleet Press: 1997; 59.</ref> It was divided into two zones with a spacious main area and a smaller seating alcove off to the right separated by a porticoed doorway with [[oeil-de-boeuf]] windows. Like the lounge, the room was raised above the Boat Deck, allowing for 11&nbsp;ft. high windows and an enhanced feeling of spaciousness.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref>\n\nDecorated in a refined Georgian decorative order and painted white, the room featured delicate plaster work combined with sleek panelling, fluted columns, and a white marble fireplace. Potted palms on tall stands were placed in the corners of the room, while shaded sconces and beaded crystal chandeliers provided soft lighting. Comfortable silk-upholstered settees and chairs in shades of yellow and blue were grouped around tables and writing desks for convenience. The windows were lined with pink silk curtains and looked out onto the Promenade Deck, allowing ample sunlight to flood the room. The popularity of this space had proved disappointing aboard the ''Olympic'', and Thomas Andrews had plans to convert part of the room on the ''Titanic'' into further passenger quarters.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken.

Around the corner from the reception room, forward of the staircase, was the set of three first-class elevators which ran the length of the stairwell.\n\n[[File:RMS Olympic Reception Room.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' reception room looking towards the Dining Saloon]]\nThe reception room was decorated in richly carved mahogany [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]]-style panelling painted a glossy white. Furnished with comfortable wicker chairs and Chesterfields upholstered in green damask silk, the room would have been conspicuously light and airy because of the beautifully illuminated leaded-glass windows which ran along either side of the room.<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic'' Carlton Press: 1997; pg. 54.</ref> These were lit naturally during the day through portholes concealed behind the windows and electrically in the evening. In contrast to the linoleum floors on the ''Olympic'', the ''Titanic''{{'}}s reception room was covered with plush [[Axminster carpet]]ing and there were potted palms in built-in holders in the corners of the alcoves.<ref name=BB355>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=355}}</ref> An imposing [[Aubusson tapestry]], ''La Chasse du duc de Guise'',<ref>{{harvsp|Philippe Masson|1998|p=30}}</ref> hung in front of the staircase. On the wall close to the tapestry were letters indicating the name of the deck.<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=358}}</ref>\n\nIt was recorded on the inaugural voyage of the ''[[RMS Olympic|Olympic]]'', whose reception hall was slightly smaller, that the room quickly filled up after dinner.<ref name=BB355 /> On the starboard side, there was an area reserved for a [[quintet]] and it held a [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] [[Piano|grand piano]].<ref>{{harvsp|Bruce Beveridge|2009|p=132}}</ref> The ''Titanic's'' reception room was enlarged in contrast to her sister ship through a reconfiguration of the two entry vestibules, reducing their size and adding broad arched entrances opening onto the foyer in front of the elevators.\n\nThe reception room was open to passengers before and after meals. Here, the orchestra played from 4 to 5&nbsp;pm while tea was served, then after dinner, from 8 to 9:15&nbsp;pm. Stewards served liquor and cigars until 11&nbsp;pm, at which time the hall closed. Generally, there were many spectators in the Room while the orchestra played.\n\n==== Entrance vestibules ====\nThe ''Titanic'' and ''Olympic'' both featured duplicate entrance vestibules on their port and starboard sides within the D-Deck reception rooms. There were sets of double gangway doors within the hull, screened by wrought-iron grilles.<ref>{{harvsp|Lynch & Marschall| 2001| p=78}}</ref> The vestibules were partially enclosed areas in the same white Jacobean-style panelling, and each contained a large sideboard for storing china. One set of French doors led into the reception room, but there was also a broad, arched entryway leading to the elevators. Separate corridors led off of the vestibules to the first-class staterooms in the forward part of D-Deck.\n\nThe ''Titanic's'' vestibules differed from those on the ''Olympic'' \u2013 they were reduced in size to make the reception room larger and they eliminated the communicating corridor between the two sides in order to enlarge the elevator foyers. The ''Olympic'' vestibules contained Third-Class staircases that led down to E-Deck, which were eliminated on ''Titanic'', and the elaborate wrought-iron grilles which covered the gangway doors were unique to ''Titanic''.\n\nIt was reported that during the sinking [[Charles Lightoller|2nd Officer Lightoller]] ordered crew members to open the port side gangway doors on D-Deck for loading more passengers into the lifeboats nearer to sea level.<ref>{{harvsp|Don Lynch & Ken Marschall|1997|p=108}}</ref> The 1986 expedition confirmed that one of the port-side doors was wide open and the inner doors pulled back.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" /> This would have significantly increased the ''Titanic's'' flooding if the crew neglected to close doors.\n\n==== Condition in Wreck ====\nSince its first exploration by [[James Cameron]] in 1995, the reception room has become one of the best-documented rooms inside the wreck of the ''Titanic''. It is accessed fairly easily via [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] from the forward stairwell, though there is a deep layer of silt and hanging [[rusticles]] which obscure large parts of the room. The ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' exploration in 2001 discovered that the ''Titanic's'' reception room differed in several minor details from the ''Olympic'': there were more support pillars, the decorative grilles of the elevator entrances were different, and there was a completely unknown wrought iron grill door in the front of the D-Deck gangway entrance.<ref>Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken, ''Ghosts of the Abyss.'' 2001; 58.</ref> Most of the exquisite leaded-glass windows remain ''in situ'', along with much of the mahogany panelling, built-in plant holders, light fixtures, and carved framework surrounding the steel support pillars of the room. Small amounts of the original white lead paint survive in the carved creases of the woodwork, and several of the swinging doors with their bronze grilles still hang in the entrance vestibule doorways.<ref name=\"harvsp|Ken Marschall|2001|p=3\" />\n\n=== Promenade and Boat Decks ===\n[[File:RMS Olympic promenade deck.jpg|thumb|Promenade Deck on the RMS ''Olympic''. The entrance to the aft grand staircase is in the foreground.]]\n\nThe Promenade Deck encircled the whole of A-Deck and together with the middle part of the Boat Deck constituted the outdoor space for first-class passengers to enjoy the sea air and take exercise. Grand first-class public rooms with their large bay windows, like the smoking room and lounge, characterise the aft end of the Promenade. The forward end is distinguished by the stateroom windows which lined the walls along either side, with their heavy bronze frames and etched glass panes.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 58.</ref> Parts of this deck were as wide as 30&nbsp;ft. and sheltered alcoves at points along the deck were used to store the dozens of folded teak deckchairs which passengers could rent during the voyage.<ref name=\"International Marine Engineering 1911\" />\n\nThe aft end of the Promenade was a large open air space flanked by two large cargo [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. This part of the deck was installed with wooden slatted wrought iron benches from where passengers could enjoy views of the stern and the sea. [[Francis Browne]] took several photos of this area on the ''Titanic'', including a famous one of 6 year old [[Polar the Titanic Bear|Douglas Spedden]] spinning a top with his father.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., \"The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.\" Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 66.</ref>  A key distinguishing feature between the ''Titanic'' and her sister ship is the ''Titanic'''s enclosed forward Promenade Deck, which was installed as protection against the elements and to reinforce a part of the ship prone to heavy vibration. Both had proven to be issues on board the ''Olympic.''<ref>Matsen, Brad. \"Titanic's Last Secrets: The Further Adventures of Shadow Divers John Chatterton & Richie Kohler\" Hachette: 2008; 132.</ref>\n\nDeck chairs and steamer rugs could be rented at the Purser's Office for 4 shillings/1 dollar each, which applied for the entire voyage. Stewards would bring broth and hot drinks for passengers to enjoy if requested.<ref>Brewster, Hugh & Coulter, Laurie. ''882 1/2 Answers to Your Questions About The Titanic'', Scholastic Press, 1998; 31.</ref> Oftentimes a passenger could spend the entire day relaxing and reading in his/her deck chair. The Promenade Deck was popular for playing games like [[shuffleboard]], deck quoits, [[dominoes]], and [[chess]], which could be obtained from the Quartermaster.\n\nThe middle part of the Boat Deck also served as a 200&nbsp;ft. long open-air promenade for first-class passengers between the officer's promenade at the forward end and the second-class promenade further aft. The gymnasium was located on the starboard side and the raised roof of the lounge, 82&nbsp;ft. above the waterline, functioned as a large sun deck where deckchairs could be set up.<ref>O'Donnell, E.E., ''The Last Days of the Titanic: Photographs and Mementos of the Tragic Maiden Voyage.'' Robert Rinehart Publishers: 1997; 84-5.</ref> This part of the deck was occupied by only four of the ''Titanic's'' 20 lifeboats, which were swung out to the side of the ship at the beginning of the voyage to leave the decks totally uncluttered for the first class.\n\nThe deck chairs from ''Titanic'', 614 in all between the first- and second-class areas, have become some of the most recognisable artefacts from the liner. Chief Baker [[Charles Joughin]] described throwing dozens overboard from the Promenade Deck during the sinking to be used as flotation devices; passing ships in the weeks after the sinking encountered islands of floating debris including deck chairs. About 10 of ''Titanic's'' deck chairs are known today, including one in the [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] in Halifax, Nova Scotia and one in the [[Museum of the City of New York]].<ref name=\"usatoday2\">{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-04-07/titanic-rearrange-deck-chairs/54084648/1|title=Titanic deck chairs' sad symbolism lives on|website=USATODAY.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\"artnet\">{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/deck-chair-titanic-museum-new-york-614054|title=See Deck Chair Salvaged from the &#039;Titanic&#039; &#124; artnet News|website=news.artnet.com|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/arts/design/one-titanic-survivor-goes-on-view-a-deck-chair.html?_r=0|title=One Titanic Survivor Goes on View: A Deck Chair|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Grand staircase ===\n{{Further|Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic}}\n[[File:Grand staircase.jpg|thumb|The grand staircase on board the RMS ''Olympic'']]\nThe grand staircase was one of the most impressive features on board the ''Titanic'' and the centre of first-class activity. The main stairwell was located in the forward part of the ship and began on the Boat Deck, extending six flights down to E-Deck. B and D Decks contained entry foyers on either side where first-class passengers would embark and disembark, the D-Deck entryway leading directly into the reception room. Each level was constructed in solid [[English oak]] with sweeping curves and the surrounding spaces panelled in the sleek neoclassical [[English Baroque|William and Mary]] style. The balustrades displayed distinctive wrought iron grilles with ormolu swags in the style of [[Louis XIV Style|Louis XIV]].<ref>Tibballs, Geoff. ''The Titanic,'' Carlton Press: 1997; pp. 36-7</ref> The A-Deck level was undoubtedly the most spectacular and is the most recognisable due to its frequent depiction in film.\n\nThe staircase was crowned by an extravagant [[wrought iron]] and glass dome with a large chandelier at the centre. This dome was installed on the roof of the boat deck and provided natural light to the stairwell before being artificially lit at night from behind. On the central landing of the A-Deck staircase was an exquisitely carved clock with allegorical figures on either side, known as ''Honour and Glory crowning Time.''<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\">Lynch, Don & Marschall, Ken. ''Titanic: An Illustrated History,'' Wellfleet Press: 2005; pp. 52-3</ref> At the foot of the staircase, on the newel post of the middle balustrade, was a bronze cherub holding an electric torch. B and C Decks probably had smaller replicas of these cherubs at either corner of the staircases, and contained landscape oil paintings as the focal points of their landings instead of the unique clock on A-Deck.\n\nFrom the grand staircase a passenger could access almost all of the facilities available in first class, level by level:\n\n* The Boat Deck level gave access to the outside promenade space, sun deck, the lifeboats, and the adjoining Gymnasium. The A-Deck level accessed first-class accommodation at the forward part of the ship and the grand public rooms located further aft via a long corridor. Entry vestibules opened onto the encircling Promenade Deck from the stairway.\n* B and C Decks connected to the main corridors containing the bulk of first-class accommodation, including the extravagant 'Millionaire's Suites' located immediately off the B-Deck level staircase. On the Starboard side of the C-Deck staircase was the Purser's Office, where passengers stored their jewellery and other valuable belongings during the voyage.\n* On D-Deck the staircase opened directly onto the reception room and adjoining Dining Saloon. Instead of a cherub, the central post of the staircase contained an impressive gilt candelabra with electric lights.<ref name=\"Lynch, Don pp. 52-3\" /> Behind the staircases were installed the three first-class elevators which ran between E and A Decks.\n* On E-Deck the staircase narrowed and lost the sweeping curve of the upper flights; a modest single flight terminated on F-Deck, where the Turkish Baths and Swimming Pool could be reached.\n\n== Aft grand staircase ==\n[[File:RMS Olympic aft grand staircase.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Olympic'' Aft grand staircase]]\nThere was in fact a second grand staircase located further aft in the ship, between the third and fourth funnels. It was in the same style as the forward grand staircase with an illuminated dome at the centre, but it was smaller and only installed between A, B, and C Decks. A simple clock graced the main landing in contrast to the ornate \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" clock in the forward Staircase. One could access the Smoking Room immediately off the A-Deck level, and the lounge via a long companionway with revolving doors on the port side.<ref name=\"encyclopedia-titanica4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-deckplans/a-deck.html|website=encyclopedia-titanica.org|title=Titanic Deckplans : A Deck|accessdate=2017-09-06}}</ref> On the ''Titanic'' there were two additional stateroom suites installed on either side of the A-Deck staircase, one of which was occupied by [[Thomas Andrews]], the ship's builder.\n\nThe whole of the B-Deck foyer was used as a reception area for patrons of the \u00c1 La Carte Restaurant and Caf\u00e9 Parisien, specially designed in the [[Georgian style|Georgian]] style and painted white like the main reception room on D-Deck. There was a recess for coat storage and comfortable [[rattan]] seating was arranged in groups throughout the room. This was in contrast to the B-Deck foyer of ''Olympic'', where there was no restaurant reception room and the foyer space was much smaller because of additional cabins and storage rooms.\n\nThis staircase was located just aft of where the ''Titanic'' broke apart during the sinking and was totally destroyed. It is assumed to be the source of much of the woodwork recovered as wreckage after the sinking.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Second and Third-Class Facilities on the RMS Titanic|Second and Third-Class facilities on the RMS Titanic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book\n  | last1 = Archibald\n  | first1 = Rick\n  | last2 = Ballard\n  | first2 = Robert\n  | year = 2005\n  | title =The Lost Ships of Robert Ballard\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 978-1-59223-424-0\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Beveridge\n  | first1 = Bruce\n  | year = 2009\n  | title = The Ship Magnificent, Volume Two: Interior Design & Fitting\n  | publisher = The History Press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7524-4626-4\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Chirnside\n  | first1 = Mark\n  | year = 2004\n  | title = The Olympic-class ships : \" Olympic \", \" Titanic \", \" Britannic \"\n  | publisher = Tempus\n  | isbn = 0-7524-2868-3\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 2003\n  | title = Ghosts of the Abyss\n  | publisher = Madison Press Books\n  | isbn = 0-306-81223-1\n  | ref = harv\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/ghostsofabyssjou0000lync\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = Lynch\n  | first1 = Don\n  | last2 = Marschall\n  | first2 = Ken\n  | year = 1997\n  | title = Titanic: An Illustrated History\n  | publisher = Wellfleet press\n  | isbn = 978-0-7858-1972-1\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Marschall\n | first1 = Ken\n | year = 2001\n | title = James Cameron's Titanic Expedition: What We Saw on and Inside the Wreck\n | publisher = marconigraph.com\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last1 = O'Donnel\n  | first1 = E.

The curve had a [[Slow zone#Speed restrictions in the United Kingdom|maximum permitted speed]] of {{convert|30|mph|kph}}, but the express had been travelling at more than {{convert|70|mph|kph}}.  The train was completely [[derail]]ed, and smashed into a [[milk train]] and a light engine, killing 28 people.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe accident occurred at the same time as a short cut of the rival [[Great Western Railway]] was opening, and it was claimed that the driver of the crashed train was trying to show that his railway was capable of competitive speeds.  It was also rumoured that passengers \u2013 mostly rich [[New York City|New Yorkers]] travelling to London from the transatlantic port at Plymouth \u2013 had bribed the driver to run the train as fast as possible, but there was not any evidence of this, and if anything the train had lost time earlier.  Conversely, it was stated that drivers often ran through Salisbury very fast on these trains to \"get a run\" at the following hill.  The engine was a new [[LSWR L12 class]] 4-4-0 with a higher [[centre of gravity]] than the earlier [[LSWR T9 class|T9 class]].  The most likely cause of the accident is that the driver simply did not realise the level of risk he was running, particularly as this was the first occasion on which he had taken a non-stopping train through Salisbury.

The curve had a [[Slow zone#Speed restrictions in the United Kingdom|maximum permitted speed]] of {{convert|30|mph|kph}}, but the express had been travelling at more than {{convert|70|mph|kph}}.  The train was completely [[derail]]ed, and smashed into a [[milk train]] and a light engine, killing 28 people.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe accident occurred at the same time as a short cut of the rival [[Great Western Railway]] was opening, and it was claimed that the driver of the crashed train was trying to show that his railway was capable of competitive speeds.  It was also rumoured that passengers \u2013 mostly rich [[New York City|New Yorkers]] travelling to London from the transatlantic port at Plymouth \u2013 had bribed the driver to run the train as fast as possible, but there was not any evidence of this, and if anything the train had lost time earlier.  Conversely, it was stated that drivers often ran through Salisbury very fast on these trains to \"get a run\" at the following hill.  The engine was a new [[LSWR L12 class]] 4-4-0 with a higher [[centre of gravity]] than the earlier [[LSWR T9 class|T9 class]].  The most likely cause of the accident is that the driver simply did not realise the level of risk he was running, particularly as this was the first occasion on which he had taken a non-stopping train through Salisbury.  Also, [[steam locomotives]] at this time, and for half a century afterwards, were not fitted with [[speedometer]]s.\n\nAs a result of the crash, all trains were required to stop at Salisbury station from that point onwards (the boat train at the time had no passenger stops from Plymouth to London Waterloo, although locomotives were changed at [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]]).<ref>{{cite book |title=British Railway Disasters |publisher=Ian Allan Ltd. |year=1996}}</ref> The speed limit on the curve east of Salisbury was also reduced to 15&nbsp;mph, a limit still in effect today.\n\nThere is a memorial tablet to the 28 dead (including the driver, two firemen and the guard) in Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nThe accident was the second in a series of three derailments due to excessive speed at night in a 16-month period. The others were at [[Grantham rail accident|Grantham]] 1906 and [[Shrewsbury rail accident|Shrewsbury]] 1907.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Covid 19 new cases and deaths China showing Hubei lockdown.png|thumb|325px|Semi-log graph of new cases and deaths in China during Covid-19 epidemic showing the lockdown and lifting]]\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
