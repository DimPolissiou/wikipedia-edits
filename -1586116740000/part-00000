And to understand this will help the veterinarian of the zoo \"Ace Ventura\" Marina Miheenko.\n\nAn [[infectious disease]] is caused by the presence of [[pathogenic organism]]s such as [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], or [[parasite]]s (either [[animal]]ian or [[protozoa]]n).  Most of these diseases can spread from cat to cat via airborne pathogens or through direct or indirect contact, while others require a [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]] such as a tick or mosquito.

Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements, [[tremor]]s and generally [[motor skills|uncoordinated motion]].  The animal often falls down and has trouble [[walking]].  Tremors increase when the animal is excited and subside when at ease.\n* A [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcer]] is an inflammatory condition of the [[cornea]] involving loss of its outer layer.

The term feline urologic syndrome is an older term which is still sometimes used for this condition. It is a common disease in adult cats, though it can strike in young cats too. It may present as any of a variety of urinary tract problems, and can lead to a complete blockage of the urinary system, which if left untreated is fatal.\n* [[Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion]]\n* [[Feline spongiform encephalopathy]]\n* Intestinal Bowel Disease causes frequent vomiting and weight loss in cats. Similar to Crohn's disease in humans, a cat's intestinal antibodies view food as the enemy and attack nutritional absorption as well as the cat's own organs and intestinal fluids. A daily immunosuppressant (such as prednisolone) is required, as well as changes to the diet that include canned foods with single-source proteins and limited ingredients. Most felines with IBD also have several food allergies, including red meat proteins, fish oils, and gluten, which must be addressed in tandem with the disease. Regular vomiting in a cat is not normal.  Undiagnosed or poorly-treated IBD can lead to death through malnutrition even in a cat that is eating regularly.\n* [[Polyneuropathy in dogs and cats|Polyneuropathy]]\n* [[Pyometra]]\n* [[Unicornuate uterus|Uterine unicornis]] a condition in which the female cat is missing a uterine horn.  A rare discovery by [[veterinarians]], the condition can be detected by [[x-ray]] or [[ultrasound]] prior to [[spaying]] if the patient has a family history of the medical condition.  There is no known scientific study to prove that uterine unicornis is a hereditary [[genetic disorder]].  In some cases, the patient may also be missing a [[kidney]] on the same side as its missing uterine horn.  This phenomenon is also called unilateral [[renal agenesis]].\n\n=== Zoonosis ===\nResearchers at the [[University of Cornell]] Feline Health Center believe that \"most zoonotic diseases pose minimal threat\" to humans.  However some humans are particularly at risk.  These are people \"with immature or weakened immune systems\" (infants, the elderly, people undergoing cancer therapy, and individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).\n\nSome common and '''preventable''' forms of zoonosis <ref>[http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/Health_Information/brochure_zoonoticdisease.cfm Zoonotic Disease: What Can I Catch From My Cat?]</ref> are as follows:\n\n* [[Toxoplasmosis]]\n* [[Giardia]]\n* [[Cat-scratch disease]]\n* [[Rabies]]\n* [[Ringworm]]\n\n== Preventive medicine ==\n\n=== Vaccinations ===\n{{main|Feline vaccination}}\nVaccinations are an important preventive animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for cats varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless of any of these factors, it is usually highly recommended that cats be vaccinated against ''rabies'', ''feline herpesvirus 1'' (FHV-1), ''feline calicivirus'' (FCV), and ''feline panleukopenia virus'' (FPV).  The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the cat.\n\n=== Detection of diseases ===\nFeline diseases such as [[FeLV]], [[FIV]], and feline [[heartworm]] can be detected during a routine visit to a veterinarian.  A variety of tests exist that can detect feline illnesses, and with early detection most diseases can be managed effectively.\n\n=== Parasite medication ===\nOnce-a-month topical products or ingestable pills are the most commonly used products to kill and prevent future parasite infestations.\n\n== Diet and nutrition ==\n{{Further|Cat food}}\n{{See also|Pet food}}\nVeterinarians commonly recommend commercial [[cat food]]s that are formulated to address the specific nutritional requirements of cats, although an increasing number of owners are opting for home-prepared cooked or [[raw feeding|raw diets]].\n\nAlthough cats are [[obligate carnivore]]s, [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] cat food are preferred by owners uncomfortable with feeding animal products to their pets. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] has come out against vegetarian cat and dog food for health reasons. Cats require high levels of taurine in their diet. Taurine is an organic acid found in animal tissues. It is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the large intestine. Taurine has many  biological roles, such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidation, membrane stabilization, and modulation of calcium signaling. It is essential for cardiovascular function in cats, as well as the development and function of skeletal muscle, the retinas, and the central nervous system. Although meat protein can be substituted with vegetable proteins, vegetable proteins do not provide a sufficiency of the specific amino acids which are vital for a cat's body to function.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120722134952/http://www.azcentral.com/ent/pop/articles/0518vegpets18-CR.html Vegetarian dogs and cats: Kibble doesn't cut it anymore<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.the-cat-guide.com/nutrition-for-cats.html Nutrition for Cats<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nCats can be selective eaters. Although it is extremely rare for a cat to deliberately starve itself to the point of injury, in obese cats, the sudden loss of weight can cause a fatal condition called [[Feline Hepatic Lipidosis|feline hepatic lipidosis]], a liver dysfunction which causes pathological loss of appetite and reinforces the starvation, which can lead to death within as little as 48 hours.\n\n[[Pica (disorder)|Pica]] is a condition in which animals chew or eat unusual things such as fabric, plastic or wool. In cats, this can be fatal or require surgical removal if a large amount of foreign material is ingested (for example, an entire sock). It tends to occur more often in Burmese, Oriental, and Siamese breeds.\n\n=== Food allergy ===\n{{Main|Allergies in cats}}\n[[Food allergy]] is a non-seasonal disease with skin and/or gastrointestinal disorders. The main complaint is [[pruritus]]. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. There is no breed, sex or age predilection, although some breeds are commonly affected. Before the onset of clinical signs, the animals have been fed the offending food components for at least two years, although some animals are less than a year old. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases ([[atopy]] / flea-allergic [[dermatitis]]). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with an [[elimination diet]]. [[Challenge\u2013dechallenge\u2013rechallenge]] is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Verlinden| first = A.|author2=Hesta, M.|author3=Millet, S.|author4=Janssens, G.P.| year = 2006| title = Food Allergy in Dogs and Cats: A Review| journal = [[Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition]] | volume = 46| issue = 3| pages = 259\u2013273\n| doi = 10.1080/10408390591001117 | pmid = 16527756\n}}</ref> Cats with food allergies may present with red, hairless, and scabby skin.

Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements, [[tremor]]s and generally [[motor skills|uncoordinated motion]].  The animal often falls down and has trouble [[walking]].  Tremors increase when the animal is excited and subside when at ease.\n* A [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcer]] is an inflammatory condition of the [[cornea]] involving loss of its outer layer.  It is very common in [[dog]]s and is sometimes seen in [[cat]]s.\n* [[Diabetes in cats|Diabetes]]\n* [[Feline hyperaldosteronism]]\n*[[Feline hyperthyroidism]] \n* [[Epilepsy in animals|Epilepsy]] is characterized by recurrent unprovoked [[seizure]]s.

The term feline urologic syndrome is an older term which is still sometimes used for this condition. It is a common disease in adult cats, though it can strike in young cats too. It may present as any of a variety of urinary tract problems, and can lead to a complete blockage of the urinary system, which if left untreated is fatal.\n* [[Feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion]]\n* [[Feline spongiform encephalopathy]]\n* Intestinal Bowel Disease causes frequent vomiting and weight loss in cats. Similar to Crohn's disease in humans, a cat's intestinal antibodies view food as the enemy and attack nutritional absorption as well as the cat's own organs and intestinal fluids. A daily immunosuppressant (such as prednisolone) is required, as well as changes to the diet that include canned foods with single-source proteins and limited ingredients. Most felines with IBD also have several food allergies, including red meat proteins, fish oils, and gluten, which must be addressed in tandem with the disease. Regular vomiting in a cat is not normal.  Undiagnosed or poorly-treated IBD can lead to death through malnutrition even in a cat that is eating regularly.\n* [[Polyneuropathy in dogs and cats|Polyneuropathy]]\n* [[Pyometra]]\n* [[Unicornuate uterus|Uterine unicornis]] a condition in which the female cat is missing a uterine horn.  A rare discovery by [[veterinarians]], the condition can be detected by [[x-ray]] or [[ultrasound]] prior to [[spaying]] if the patient has a family history of the medical condition.  There is no known scientific study to prove that uterine unicornis is a hereditary [[genetic disorder]].  In some cases, the patient may also be missing a [[kidney]] on the same side as its missing uterine horn.  This phenomenon is also called unilateral [[renal agenesis]].\n\n=== Zoonosis ===\nResearchers at the [[University of Cornell]] Feline Health Center believe that \"most zoonotic diseases pose minimal threat\" to humans.  However some humans are particularly at risk.  These are people \"with immature or weakened immune systems\" (infants, the elderly, people undergoing cancer therapy, and individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).\n\nSome common and '''preventable''' forms of zoonosis <ref>[http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/Health_Information/brochure_zoonoticdisease.cfm Zoonotic Disease: What Can I Catch From My Cat?]</ref> are as follows:\n\n* [[Toxoplasmosis]]\n* [[Giardia]]\n* [[Cat-scratch disease]]\n* [[Rabies]]\n* [[Ringworm]]\n\n== Preventive medicine ==\n\n=== Vaccinations ===\n{{main|Feline vaccination}}\nVaccinations are an important preventive animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for cats varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless of any of these factors, it is usually highly recommended that cats be vaccinated against ''rabies'', ''feline herpesvirus 1'' (FHV-1), ''feline calicivirus'' (FCV), and ''feline panleukopenia virus'' (FPV).  The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the cat.\n\n=== Detection of diseases ===\nFeline diseases such as [[FeLV]], [[FIV]], and feline [[heartworm]] can be detected during a routine visit to a veterinarian.  A variety of tests exist that can detect feline illnesses, and with early detection most diseases can be managed effectively.\n\n=== Parasite medication ===\nOnce-a-month topical products or ingestable pills are the most commonly used products to kill and prevent future parasite infestations.\n\n== Diet and nutrition ==\n{{Further|Cat food}}\n{{See also|Pet food}}\nVeterinarians commonly recommend commercial [[cat food]]s that are formulated to address the specific nutritional requirements of cats, although an increasing number of owners are opting for home-prepared cooked or [[raw feeding|raw diets]].\n\nAlthough cats are [[obligate carnivore]]s, [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] cat food are preferred by owners uncomfortable with feeding animal products to their pets. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] has come out against vegetarian cat and dog food for health reasons. Cats require high levels of taurine in their diet. Taurine is an organic acid found in animal tissues. It is a major constituent of bile and can be found in the large intestine. Taurine has many  biological roles, such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidation, membrane stabilization, and modulation of calcium signaling. It is essential for cardiovascular function in cats, as well as the development and function of skeletal muscle, the retinas, and the central nervous system. Although meat protein can be substituted with vegetable proteins, vegetable proteins do not provide a sufficiency of the specific amino acids which are vital for a cat's body to function.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120722134952/http://www.azcentral.com/ent/pop/articles/0518vegpets18-CR.html Vegetarian dogs and cats: Kibble doesn't cut it anymore<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.the-cat-guide.com/nutrition-for-cats.html Nutrition for Cats<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nCats can be selective eaters. Although it is extremely rare for a cat to deliberately starve itself to the point of injury, in obese cats, the sudden loss of weight can cause a fatal condition called [[Feline Hepatic Lipidosis|feline hepatic lipidosis]], a liver dysfunction which causes pathological loss of appetite and reinforces the starvation, which can lead to death within as little as 48 hours.\n\n[[Pica (disorder)|Pica]] is a condition in which animals chew or eat unusual things such as fabric, plastic or wool. In cats, this can be fatal or require surgical removal if a large amount of foreign material is ingested (for example, an entire sock). It tends to occur more often in Burmese, Oriental, and Siamese breeds.\n\n=== Food allergy ===\n{{Main|Allergies in cats}}\n[[Food allergy]] is a non-seasonal disease with skin and/or gastrointestinal disorders. The main complaint is [[pruritus]]. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. There is no breed, sex or age predilection, although some breeds are commonly affected. Before the onset of clinical signs, the animals have been fed the offending food components for at least two years, although some animals are less than a year old. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases ([[atopy]] / flea-allergic [[dermatitis]]). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with an [[elimination diet]]. [[Challenge\u2013dechallenge\u2013rechallenge]] is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).<ref>{{cite journal | last = Verlinden| first = A.|author2=Hesta, M.|author3=Millet, S.|author4=Janssens, G.P.| year = 2006| title = Food Allergy in Dogs and Cats: A Review| journal = [[Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition]] | volume = 46| issue = 3| pages = 259\u2013273\n| doi = 10.1080/10408390591001117 | pmid = 16527756\n}}</ref> Cats with food allergies may present with red, hairless, and scabby skin.

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]].

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points.

A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in [[Beijing]] who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

{"title_page": "Time formatting and storage bugs", "text_new": "{{short description|Software errors affecting times and dates}}\nIn [[computer science]], '''time formatting and storage bugs''' are a class of [[software bug]]s which may cause [[system time|time and date]] calculation or display to be improperly handled. These are most commonly manifestations of [[arithmetic overflow]], but can also be the result of other issues. The most well-known consequence of bugs of this type is the [[Y2K problem]], but many other milestone dates or times exist that have caused or will cause problems depending on various programming deficiencies.\n\n== Year 1970 ==\nDuring the 1960s, some computer programs were written using just a single digit for the year, so that 0\u20139 represented the years 1960\u20131969. It was especially easy to write programs in the [[COBOL]] language with this limitation. The problem was identified and corrected before 1970. No consequences due to this problem are known to have occurred. The fix generally was to expand the year to just two digits, owing to limitations of the storage media common in that era, tab cards and magnetic tape.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Year 1975 ==\nOn 4 January 1975, the 12-bit field that had been used for dates in the [[PDP-10|Decsystem 10]] operating systems overflowed. There were numerous problems and crashes related to this bug while an alternative format was developed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Austein|first1=Rob|title=DATE-86, or The Ghost of Tinkles Past|url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/4.45.html|website=The Risks Digest|publisher=ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Year 1977 ==\nThe [[PDP-8]]'s [[OS/8]] operating system used \n* 4 bits for the month\n* 5 bits for the date therein\n* 3 bits for the year.<ref>1970 - 1977</ref><ref>\"OS/8 can only store dates for an 8 year period...\" {{cite web\n|url=http://www.pdp8online.com/pdp8cgi/os8_html?act=dir%3Bfn=linctape-images/os8l/ps-8-system-25.linc%3Bsort=ext\n|title=Directory of linctape-images/os8l/ps-8-system-25.linc}}</ref>\n\nThis was recognized when [[Commercial Operating System (COS)|COS-310]] was developed, and dates were recorded differently.<ref>\"COS-310, DEC's commercial operating system for the PDP-8, supported ... but with a new text file format.

COS did not have this limitation -->\n\n== Year 1989 ==\nSome mainframe programs were written to encode dates as the number of days since a 'zero date' of 1 January 1900, storing them as signed 16-bit binary integers. On 18 September 1989, these programs began to fail, the date being exactly 32,768 (2<sup>15</sup>) days since the zero date. Values on and after this day do not fit into a signed 16-bit integer, but overflow and return negative values.\n\n== Year 1997 ==\nThe [[Domain/OS]] clock, which is based on the number of 4-microsecond units that has occurred since 1 January 1980, rolled past 47 bits on 2 November 1997, rendering unpatched systems unusable.<ref>[http://jim.rees.org/apollo-archive/date-bug Latest News on the Date Bug]</ref>\n\n== Year 1999 ==\nIn the last few months before the year 2000, two other date-related milestones occurred that received less publicity than the then-impending Y2K problem.\n\n=== First GPS rollover ===\n{{main|GPS Week Number Rollover}}\n{{See also|GPS#Timekeeping}}\nGPS dates are expressed as a week number and a day-of-week number, with the week number transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] value.

This was dubbed by some in the media as the \"Y2K+10\" or \"Y2.01k\" problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com.au/News/163864,bank-of-queensland-hit-by-y201k-glitch.aspx|title=Bank of Queensland hit by \"Y2.01k\" glitch|date= 4 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe main source of problems was confusion between hexadecimal number encoding and [[binary-coded decimal|BCD]] encodings of numbers. The numbers 0 through 9 are encoded in both hexadecimal and [[binary-coded decimal|BCD]] as 00{{sub|16}} through 09{{sub|16}}. But the decimal number 10 is encoded in hexadecimal as 0A{{sub|16}} and in BCD as 10{{sub|16}}. Thus a BCD 10{{sub|16}} interpreted as a hexadecimal encoding erroneously represents the decimal number 16.\n\nFor example, the [[SMS]] protocol uses BCD encoding for dates, so some mobile phone software incorrectly reported dates of messages as 2016 instead of 2010. [[Windows Mobile]] was the first software reported to have been affected by this glitch; in some cases WM6 changed the date of any incoming SMS message sent after 1 January 2010 from the year 2010 to 2016.<ref name=wm6>{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10425455-56.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0#addcomm|title= Windows Mobile glitch dates 2010 texts 2016|date=5 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"cellphone2010\">{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062|title=Windows Mobile phones suffer Y2K+10 bug|date=4 January 2010|access-date=3 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061135/http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/windows-mobile-phones-suffer-y2k-10-bug-661062|archive-date=23 October 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther systems affected include [[EFTPOS]] terminals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/30308/53/|title=Bank of Queensland vs Y2K \u2013 an update|date=4 January 2010|access-date=3 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108210918/http://www.itwire.com/content/view/30308/53/|archive-date=8 January 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the [[PlayStation 3]] (except the Slim model).<ref name=\"PS3-1\">{{cite web|url= https://gizmodo.com/5482365/error-8001050f-takes-down-playstation-network|title=Error: 8001050F Takes Down PlayStation Network}}</ref>\n\nThe most important such glitch occurred in Germany, where upwards of 20 million bank cards became unusable, and with Citibank Belgium, whose digipass customer identification chips stopped working.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/info/monde/europe/297916/bug-de-l-an-2010-en-allemagne-plus-de-20-millions-de-cartes-bancaires-inutilisables|title=2010 Bug in Germany|date=6 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Year 2011 ==\n{{main|Y1C Problem}}\n[[Taiwan]] officially uses the [[Minguo calendar]], which considers the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year 1912 to be its year 1.

As years in Japan are traditionally referred to by [[Japanese era name|era name]]s that correspond to the reign of each emperor, this resulted in a new era name, [[Reiwa]] (\u4ee4\u548c), following Naruhito's accession to the throne the following day. Because the previous emperor, [[Hirohito]], died in 1989 and Akihito's reign mostly corresponded with the rise in the use of computers, most software had not been tested to ensure correct behavior on an era change. Furthermore, testing was complicated by the fact that the new era name was not revealed until April 1, 2019. Therefore, errors were expected from software that did not anticipate a new era.\n\n=== Classic Mac OS ===\nThe control panel in Classic Mac OS versions 6, 7, and 8 only allows the date to be set as high as December 31, 2019, although the system is able to continue to advance time beyond that date.<ref>{{cite web |title=Technical Note TN1049 Approaching the Millennium: The Mac and the Year 2000 |url=http://www.fenestrated.net/~macman/mirrors/Apple%20Technotes%20(As%20of%202002)/tn/tn1049.html |accessdate=20 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Vintage Mac 2020 fixes|url=http://www.mactcp.net/macos2020.html|accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Year 2020 ==\n''[[WWE 2K20]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order]]'' would both crash on January 1, 2020, when the year rolled over.

The workaround is to use the year 1996 in lieu of 2080 as a compatible leap year to display the correct day of the week, date and month on the main screen.\n\nSystems storing the year as a two-digit value 00..99 internally only (like many RTCs) may rollover from 2079-12-31 to the IBM PC and DOS [[epoch of 1980-01-01]].\n\n== {{anchor|Year 2099}}Year 2100 ==\n{{See also|Leap year bug}}\n\n[[DOS]] and [[Windows]] file date [[API function|API]] and conversion functions (such as [[INT 21h]]/AH=2Ah) officially support dates up to 2099-12-31 only (even though the underlying [[FAT filesystem]] would theoretically support dates up to 2107). Hence, DOS-based operating systems as well as applications that convert other formats to the FAT/DOS format, may show unexpected behavior starting 2100-01-01.\n\nAnother problem will emerge at the end of 2100-02-28, since 2100 is not a [[leap year]], whereas many common implementations of the leap year algorithm are incomplete or simplified, and thus will erroneously assume it to be a leap year. This would cause the date to incorrectly roll over from 2100-02-28 to 2100-02-29, instead of directly to 2100-03-01.\n\n== {{anchor|Year 2106}}Year 2106 ==\n\nMany existing file formats, communications protocols, and application interfaces employ a variant of the [[Unix]] {{code|time_t}} date format, storing the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (midnight UTC, 1 January 1970) as an ''unsigned'' 32-bit binary integer. This value will roll over on 7 February 2106.

The [[FAT file last modification date|last modification date stamp]] (and with [[DELWATCH]] 2.0+ also the [[FAT file deletion date|file deletion date stamp]], and since [[MS-DOS 7.0|DOS 7.0]]+ optionally also the [[FAT file access date|last access date stamp]] and [[FAT file creation date|creation date stamp]]), are stored in the [[FAT directory entry|directory entry]] with the year represented as an unsigned seven bit number (0\u2013127), relative to 1980, and thereby unable to indicate any dates in the year 2108 and beyond. The [[API function]]s defined to retrieve these dates officially only support dates up to 2099-12-31.\nThis will also affect the [[Zip (file format)|Zip archive file format]], as it uses FAT file modification timestamps internally.\n\n== {{anchor|Year 2137}}Year 2137 ==\n{{main|GPS Week Number Rollover}}\n{{See also|GPS#Timekeeping}}\nGPS dates are expressed as a week number and a day-of-week number, with the week number initially using a ten-[[bit]] value and modernised GPS navigation messages using a 13-bit field.

In describing the travels of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], keeper of the [[Holy Grail]], the author says that most residents of the Middle East were pagans until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true [[prophet]] sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.<ref>Lacy, Norris J. (Ed.) (December 1, 1992).

It is said that Muslims are easily converted to Christianity because their beliefs are already so similar in many ways, and that they believe that only the Christian revelation will last until the end of the world. The moral behaviour of Muslims at the time is shown as superior to that of Christians, and as a standing reproach to Christian society.<ref name=\"travel\">[http://www.romanization.com/books/mandeville/chap15.html The Travels of Sir John Mandeville], CHAPTER XV.</ref>\n\nDepictions of Muhammad in the form of [[picaresque novel]]  began to appear from the 13th century onward, such as in Alexandre du Pont's ''Roman de Mahom'', the translation of the Mi'raj, the ''Escala de Mahoma'' (\u201cThe Ladder of Muhammad\u201d) by the court physician of Alfonso X of Castile and Le\u00f3n and his son.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nMedieval European literature often referred to Muslims as \"[[infidel]]s\" or \"pagans\", in sobriquets such as the ''paynim foe''. These depictions such as those in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' represent Muslims worshiping Muhammad (spelt e.g. 'Mahom' and 'Mahumet') as a god, and depict them worshiping various deities in the form of \"[[cult image|idols]]\", ranging from [[Abaddon|Apollyon]] to [[Lucifer]], but ascribing to them a chief deity known as \"[[Termagant]]\".<ref name=\"meyer2\">Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). \"[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]\".

These depictions such as those in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' represent Muslims worshiping Muhammad (spelt e.g. 'Mahom' and 'Mahumet') as a god, and depict them worshiping various deities in the form of \"[[cult image|idols]]\", ranging from [[Abaddon|Apollyon]] to [[Lucifer]], but ascribing to them a chief deity known as \"[[Termagant]]\".<ref name=\"meyer2\">Kenneth Meyer Setton (July 1, 1992). \"[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0871692015&id=hk4LAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage Western Hostility to Islam and Prophecies of Turkish Doom]\".

The city is famous for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products.\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugowli]] where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised [[Landour]] and [[Mussoorie]] in 1827\u20131828.\n\n[[File:Capt john.jpg|thumb|Capt John War memorial maintained by army at Dehradun]]\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited. He spent his last few days here before passing away in Delhi in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2012/may/270512-How-Nehru-spent-his-last-four-days.htm|title=How Nehru spent his last four days|publisher=Mid-day.com|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> Another leader from the independence movement, [[Rash Behari Bose]], who was one of the key organisers of the [[Ghadar conspiracy]] and, later, the [[Indian National Army]] was based in Dehradun in his early days before he was forced to move to Japan in 1915 to continue the freedom struggle.\n\nPost independence Dehradun and other parts of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] and [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] were merged with [[United Provinces (1937-1950)|United Provinces]] which was later renamed the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital.\n\n===Afghan Connection===\nDehradun's Afghan connection dated back to the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], after which the Afghan Emir [[Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)]] was exiled by the British to Dehra Dun.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/Tracing-Doons-Afghan-connect/articleshow/47835111.cms|title=Tracing Doon's Afghan connect - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref> He stayed in Mussoorie for over 6 years. The Balahissar ward under the Mussoorie municipality has been named after the palace of Dost Mohammad.

Just like his grandfather, he choose Doon valley as his abode. Yakoob became the first Afghan to formally settle in Dehradun. The present Mangla Devi Inter College, was once the Kabul Palace where Yakoob spent a few years of his life. The extended family and servants of the King were also relocated to Dehradun<ref>''Malalai Joan of Arc of Afghanistan and the Victors of Maiwand: The Second Anglo-Afghan War 1878-1882''https://books.google.com/books?id=9ZsuDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT184&dq=afghanistan+dehradun&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjAnsnu0ufZAhWP2VMKHZDeCFgQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=afghanistan%20dehradun&f=false</ref>\n\nThe Afghan royal family maintained a presence in Dehra Dun. It was the birthplace of the second to last [[King of Afghanistan]], [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]]. Two quaint palaces \u2014 the Kabul Place in Dehradun and Balahissar Palace in Mussoorie \u2014 stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan.

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats.

The city is famous for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products.\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]].

There are autorickshaws which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city centre is easily recognised by the [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with six functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including [[Stephen Alter]], [[Nayantara Sahgal]], [[Allan Sealy]], [[Ruskin Bond]] and also to country singer [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]].\n\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower.

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats. Hemp is grown in great quantities in this region, so its yarn is frequently used as lining.\n\nThere are fairs ([[mela]]s) throughout the year.

It was not until 1845, however, that the official name of Marion was sanctioned as the county seat by the state legislature. The name of Marion came from [[Francis Marion|Brigadier General Francis Marion]], the [[American Revolutionary War]] hero, known as the \"Swamp Fox\" and the man upon whom the movie [[The Patriot (2000 film)|''The Patriot'']] was based. Marion was also home to Sgt. Daniel Kanipe, one of only two survivors of the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]]. An historical marker was placed in front of his former home in 2011. The nearby [[Lake James]] is a local tourist attraction, and has been the backdrop for movies such as [[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|''The Last of the Mohicans'']] and [[The Hunt for Red October (film)|''The Hunt for Red October'']].\n\nAnother famous house in Marion is the [[Joseph McDowell House]], built in 1787 by the county's namesake, [[Joseph \"Pleasant Gardens\" McDowell|Joseph McDowell]]. McDowell played a large role in the [[Battle of Cowpens]] when he helped defeat the British in January 1781. McDowell went on to serve as a member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention in 1788 and was a member of the 3rd United States Congress. Restoration plans are underway to preserve this historic house and ensure that it remains a vital part of Marion's history. In 2010, the Joseph McDowell Greenway opened to the public along the [[Catawba River]], and will soon link the two most historic homes in McDowell County, the [[Joseph McDowell House]] and the [[Carson House (Marion, North Carolina)|Carson House]].\n\n'''The Big Fire'''\n\nUntil the late 19th century, Main Street was a collection of mostly wooden huts, houses, and buildings. On Sunday morning, November 25, 1894 a fire sprang up in an old building known as the \"Ark\" located behind the Courthouse. The fire spread to Main Street and rushed down the street at an incredible pace. The wooden buildings were quickly consumed by the enormous inferno. The few brick buildings on Main Street were also gutted, and because there was no public water supply, bucket brigades were hurriedly formed to halt the advance of the fire. It was not enough, however, and most of Main Street was burned to the ground. Showing the resiliency possessed by the citizens, the city came together and took on the rebuilding process, making Marion larger and stronger than before. Today, downtown Marion is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n'''Depression Era & Labor Conflict'''\n\nOn Oct. 2, 1929, the McDowell County sheriff and several deputies faced a group of workers outside the fence in front of the Marion Manufacturing Company, whose 600 employees had been on strike for four months. A gunfight quickly ensued between the two groups. Sheriff Oscar Adkins would later swear in court that the strikers opened fire first, although no weapons were ever found on any of the strikers. 36 strikers were shot, six mortally, during the confrontation.  [[Sinclair Lewis]] wrote a syndicated newspaper report entitled \"Cheap and Contented Labor: The Picture of the Southern Mill Town.\"  He concluded: \"The workers, especially in Marion, have become discouraged.  They are hungry, tired, bewildered.  They are sick of being shot down.  Unless the whole country encourages them [financially], they will crawl back into the slavery I have sought to picture here.\"  However, since the [[Great Depression]] was in the immediate future, little such help would arrive.\n\n'''Historic District'''\n\nEleven structures make up the [[Main Street Historic District (Marion, North Carolina)|Main Street Historic District]] in the downtown area, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1991. Four churches, [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Marion, North Carolina)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] (1882), First Baptist (1914), [[First Presbyterian Church (Marion, North Carolina)|First Presbyterian]] (1923), and [[St. Matthew's Lutheran Church]] (1935); two former hotels, the Eagle Hotel, which survived the 1894 fire, and the Hotel Marianna (1910); a bank on Main Street built in 1903; the [[McDowell County Courthouse (Marion, North Carolina)|McDowell County Courthouse]], which was constructed in 1928; the Marion Depot (1867), which is the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line; the Public Library (1937), which was originally built as a post office; and the Marion Community Building, built in 1937.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | author = Sybil Argintar Bowers| title =Main Street Historic District| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =August 1990 | url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/MC0009.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}</ref><ref name = nrhpinv1>{{Cite web | author = Sybil Argintar Bowers| title =Main Street Historic District (Additional documentation)| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = September 1994 | url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/MC0009ad.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}</ref> Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the [[Depot Historic District (Marion, North Carolina)|Depot Historic District]], Carson House, [[Carson\u2013Young House]], and [[Lone Beech]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110805.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2011-08-05|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 7/25/11 through 7/29/11|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\nDowntown Marion has benefited from recent revitalization, and many new shops, restaurants, and taprooms have opened up along Main Street in recent years.\n\n'''Marion Today'''\n\nMarion currently stands as a small congenial town at the edge of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], \"Where Main Street Meets the Mountains.\" Just off [[Interstate 40 in North Carolina|Interstate 40]], Marion is located approximately 35 miles east of [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] and 20 miles west of [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]].\n\nMarion was named \"North Carolina Small Town of the Year\" for 2018 from the N.C. Rural Center. The Small Town of the Year Award recognizes a town or small city \u201cthat embraces citizen engagement, values diversity, and fosters strong partnerships.\u201d <ref name=\"GR15\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcdowellnews.com/news/marion-is-small-town-of-the-year-for/article_ef2dbd42-e9c8-11e8-a32f-0ba27f2bfffb.html|accessdate=2018-12-05|title=Marion is Small Town of the Year for 2018|date=2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nMarion serves as a gateway from Interstate 40 to many nearby attractions and recreation activities in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].  A contemporary rest area located on the [[U.S. Route 221 in North Carolina|US 221]] bypass west of Marion serves as a welcome center for visitors to the area.  The rest area and visitor center is staffed with travel counselors during daylight hours.  In addition to providing visitor information, it also has picnic facilities and vending machines on the premises.\n\nThe [[Marion Marauders]], a [[Tar Heel League]] baseball club, were a favorite local attraction in the 1940s and 1950s, and were the home team of star pitcher [[Kelly Jack Swift]], who in 1953 became the last minor league pitcher to ever win 30 games in a season, going 30\u20137 with a 2.54 ERA. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' published an article about Swift and his accomplishment in its October 17, 2011 edition.\n\nThe [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina Tar Heels]] basketball coach and 2007 [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] was born and spent a part of his childhood in Marion. On July 18, 2011, the town held a ceremony to dedicate a [[Carolina blue]] historical marker downtown in front of City Hall, listing Marion as the birthplace of [[Roy Williams (coach)|Coach Williams]], as well as his many awards and accomplishments.\n\nMarion continues to be a community that values athletics, especially the \"Fightin' Titans\" of [[McDowell High School (Marion, North Carolina)|McDowell High]], whose girls' basketball team won the 1992 North Carolina 4A State Championship.\n\n==Attractions==\n\n[[Image:Carsonhouse.jpg|thumb|right|The Carson House, built in 1793]]\n\nThere are three parks in Marion operated by the city, the main one being downtown beside the Community Building. In 2010, the City opened the [[Joseph McDowell House|Joseph McDowell Historical Catawba Greenway]].  Named in honor of the county's namesake, [[Joseph \"Pleasant Gardens\" McDowell|Colonel Joseph McDowell]], the greenway follows the flow of the [[Catawba River]].  Benches, picnic tables, fitness stations, fishing piers, and a canoe launch are scattered throughout the three mile trail. Access points are located at Highway 70 between Highway 221/226 By-Pass and Roby Conley Road as well as a parking lot at the opposite end behind the [[Joseph McDowell House]]. Historic homes such as the [[Carson House (Marion, North Carolina)|Carson House]] and the [[Joseph McDowell House]] have kept the history of Marion alive for decades, and are open weekdays to the public (the latter currently receiving restoration). In downtown Marion, the restored Marion Depot, the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line, hosts a number of community events each month, and is available for rental to individuals and groups for meetings, receptions, parties, and other functions. [[Lake James]] provides fishing, camping, and recreation for [[McDowell County, North Carolina|McDowell]] and [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke]] Counties and is just minutes from Marion. [[Lake Tahoma]], [[Linville Caverns]], [[Linville Falls]], Catawba Falls and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] are also very close to town, and exhibit the diverse scenery of Western North Carolina. There are also several golf courses outside of town, as well as two waterparks and numerous campgrounds.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Richard Erwin]], former United States federal judge and politician who was the first African American to be elected to statewide office in North Carolina\n*[[Gus Greenlee]], [[Negro Leagues]] baseball owner and an African-American businessman\n*[[Greg Holland]], MLB pitcher and member of the [[Kansas City Royals]] 2015 World Series Championship team<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hollagr01.shtml.

It was not until 1845, however, that the official name of Marion was sanctioned as the county seat by the state legislature. The name of Marion came from [[Francis Marion|Brigadier General Francis Marion]], the [[American Revolutionary War]] hero, known as the \"Swamp Fox\" and the man upon whom the movie [[The Patriot (2000 film)|''The Patriot'']] was based. Marion was also home to Sgt. Daniel Kanipe, one of only two survivors of the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]]. An historical marker was placed in front of his former home in 2011. The nearby [[Lake James]] is a local tourist attraction, and has been the backdrop for movies such as [[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|''The Last of the Mohicans'']] and [[The Hunt for Red October (film)|''The Hunt for Red October'']].\n\nAnother famous house in Marion is the [[Joseph McDowell House]], built in 1787 by the county's namesake, [[Joseph \"Pleasant Gardens\" McDowell|Joseph McDowell]]. McDowell played a large role in the [[Battle of Cowpens]] when he helped defeat the British in January 1781. McDowell went on to serve as a member of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention in 1788 and was a member of the 3rd United States Congress. Restoration plans are underway to preserve this historic house and ensure that it remains a vital part of Marion's history. In 2010, the Joseph McDowell Greenway opened to the public along the [[Catawba River]], and will soon link the two most historic homes in McDowell County, the [[Joseph McDowell House]] and the [[Carson House (Marion, North Carolina)|Carson House]].\n\n'''The Big Fire'''\n\nUntil the late 19th century, Main Street was a collection of mostly wooden huts, houses, and buildings. On Sunday morning, November 25, 1894 a fire sprang up in an old building known as the \"Ark\" located behind the Courthouse. The fire spread to Main Street and rushed down the street at an incredible pace. The wooden buildings were quickly consumed by the enormous inferno. The few brick buildings on Main Street were also gutted, and because there was no public water supply, bucket brigades were hurriedly formed to halt the advance of the fire. It was not enough, however, and most of Main Street was burned to the ground. Showing the resiliency possessed by the citizens, the city came together and took on the rebuilding process, making Marion larger and stronger than before. Today, downtown Marion is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\n'''Depression Era & Labor Conflict'''\n\nOn Oct. 2, 1929, the McDowell County sheriff and several deputies faced a group of workers outside the fence in front of the Marion Manufacturing Company, whose 600 employees had been on strike for four months. A gunfight quickly ensued between the two groups. Sheriff Oscar Adkins would later swear in court that the strikers opened fire first, although no weapons were ever found on any of the strikers. 36 strikers were shot, six mortally, during the confrontation.  [[Sinclair Lewis]] wrote a syndicated newspaper report entitled \"Cheap and Contented Labor: The Picture of the Southern Mill Town.\"  He concluded: \"The workers, especially in Marion, have become discouraged.  They are hungry, tired, bewildered.  They are sick of being shot down.  Unless the whole country encourages them [financially], they will crawl back into the slavery I have sought to picture here.\"  However, since the [[Great Depression]] was in the immediate future, little such help would arrive.\n\n'''Historic District'''\n\nEleven structures make up the [[Main Street Historic District (Marion, North Carolina)|Main Street Historic District]] in the downtown area, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1991. Four churches, [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Marion, North Carolina)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] (1882), First Baptist (1914), [[First Presbyterian Church (Marion, North Carolina)|First Presbyterian]] (1923), and [[St. Matthew's Lutheran Church]] (1935); two former hotels, the Eagle Hotel, which survived the 1894 fire, and the Hotel Marianna (1910); a bank on Main Street built in 1903; the [[McDowell County Courthouse (Marion, North Carolina)|McDowell County Courthouse]], which was constructed in 1928; the Marion Depot (1867), which is the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line; the Public Library (1937), which was originally built as a post office; and the Marion Community Building, built in 1937.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | author = Sybil Argintar Bowers| title =Main Street Historic District| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =August 1990 | url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/MC0009.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}</ref><ref name = nrhpinv1>{{Cite web | author = Sybil Argintar Bowers| title =Main Street Historic District (Additional documentation)| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = September 1994 | url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/MC0009ad.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}</ref> Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the [[Depot Historic District (Marion, North Carolina)|Depot Historic District]], Carson House, [[Carson\u2013Young House]], and [[Lone Beech]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref><ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20110805.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2011-08-05|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 7/25/11 through 7/29/11|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\nDowntown Marion has benefited from recent revitalization, and many new shops, restaurants, and taprooms have opened up along Main Street in recent years.\n\n'''Marion Today'''\n\nMarion currently stands as a small congenial town at the edge of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], \"Where Main Street Meets the Mountains.\" Just off [[Interstate 40 in North Carolina|Interstate 40]], Marion is located approximately 35 miles east of [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] and 20 miles west of [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]].\n\nMarion was named \"North Carolina Small Town of the Year\" for 2018 from the N.C. Rural Center. The Small Town of the Year Award recognizes a town or small city \u201cthat embraces citizen engagement, values diversity, and fosters strong partnerships.\u201d <ref name=\"GR15\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcdowellnews.com/news/marion-is-small-town-of-the-year-for/article_ef2dbd42-e9c8-11e8-a32f-0ba27f2bfffb.html|accessdate=2018-12-05|title=Marion is Small Town of the Year for 2018|date=2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nMarion serves as a gateway from Interstate 40 to many nearby attractions and recreation activities in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].  A contemporary rest area located on the [[U.S. Route 221 in North Carolina|US 221]] bypass west of Marion serves as a welcome center for visitors to the area.  The rest area and visitor center is staffed with travel counselors during daylight hours.  In addition to providing visitor information, it also has picnic facilities and vending machines on the premises.\n\nThe [[Marion Marauders]], a [[Tar Heel League]] baseball club, were a favorite local attraction in the 1940s and 1950s, and were the home team of star pitcher [[Kelly Jack Swift]], who in 1953 became the last minor league pitcher to ever win 30 games in a season, going 30-7 with a 2.54 ERA. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' published an article about Swift and his accomplishment in its October 17, 2011 edition.\n\nThe [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina Tar Heels]] basketball coach and 2007 [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] was born and spent a part of his childhood in Marion. On July 18, 2011, the town held a ceremony to dedicate a [[Carolina blue]] historical marker downtown in front of City Hall, listing Marion as the birthplace of [[Roy Williams (coach)|Coach Williams]], as well as his many awards and accomplishments.\n\nMarion continues to be a community that values athletics, especially the \"Fightin' Titans\" of [[McDowell High School (Marion, North Carolina)|McDowell High]], whose girls' basketball team won the 1992 North Carolina 4A State Championship.\n\n==Attractions==\n\n[[Image:Carsonhouse.jpg|thumb|right|The Carson House, built in 1793]]\n\nThere are three parks in Marion operated by the city, the main one being downtown beside the Community Building. In 2010, the City opened the [[Joseph McDowell House|Joseph McDowell Historical Catawba Greenway]].  Named in honor of the county's namesake, [[Joseph \"Pleasant Gardens\" McDowell|Colonel Joseph McDowell]], the greenway follows the flow of the [[Catawba River]].  Benches, picnic tables, fitness stations, fishing piers, and a canoe launch are scattered throughout the three mile trail. Access points are located at Highway 70 between Highway 221/226 By-Pass and Roby Conley Road as well as a parking lot at the opposite end behind the [[Joseph McDowell House]]. Historic homes such as the [[Carson House (Marion, North Carolina)|Carson House]] and the [[Joseph McDowell House]] have kept the history of Marion alive for decades, and are open weekdays to the public (the latter currently receiving restoration). In downtown Marion, the restored Marion Depot, the oldest surviving depot on the Western Rail Line, hosts a number of community events each month, and is available for rental to individuals and groups for meetings, receptions, parties, and other functions. [[Lake James]] provides fishing, camping, and recreation for [[McDowell County, North Carolina|McDowell]] and [[Burke County, North Carolina|Burke]] Counties and is just minutes from Marion. [[Lake Tahoma]], [[Linville Caverns]], [[Linville Falls]], Catawba Falls and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] are also very close to town, and exhibit the diverse scenery of Western North Carolina. There are also several golf courses outside of town, as well as two waterparks and numerous campgrounds.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Richard Erwin]], former United States federal judge and politician who was the first African American to be elected to statewide office in North Carolina\n*[[Gus Greenlee]], [[Negro Leagues]] baseball owner and an African-American businessman\n*[[Greg Holland]], MLB pitcher and member of the [[Kansas City Royals]] 2015 World Series Championship team<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hollagr01.shtml.
