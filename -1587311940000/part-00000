Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

She is from [[Hitoyoshi]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] and her birthday is August 11.<ref>\u300e\u5b9d\u585a\u304a\u3068\u3081 2017\u5e74\u5ea6\u7248\u300f Takarazuka Creative Arts,2017\uff0cp7.{{ISBN|978-4-86649-004-5}}</ref>\n\nNotable roles of Todoroki include: Ravic ([[Arch of Triumph (novel)|Arch of Triumph]]), Rhett Butler ([[Gone with the Wind (novel)#Adaptations|Gone with the Wind]]), [[Abraham Lincoln]] (For The People) and [[Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]] (Che Guevara). \n\nHer nicknames are Tom and Ishi.\n\n==Troupe history==\n\n*Moon Troupe: 1985\u20131988\n*Snow Troupe: 1988\u20132002\n*Supreme Member: 2002\u2013present\n<ref>[https://kageki.hankyu.co.jp/star/todoroki_yu.html Yu Todoroki] Takarazuka Revue Official Site</ref>\n\n==General information==\n\nCurrently referred to as \"Top of the Tops\" in the Revue, she is considered to be one of the greatest Takarazuka actresses in this generation and has many fans. When Hitomi Tsukikage, her second top star partner in Snow Troupe, resigned from the company, she considered resigning as well since she had reached the height of her career in the company. However, Yachiyo Kasugano, Todoroki's teacher (member of the theater since 1929; with the company until her death in 2012), persuaded her to stay and she became the second top star in the company's history to resign from top star status but remain in the company ([[Yuri Haruna]] is the first case). In 2003, also upon the invitation of Yachiyo Kasugano, she became a member of the directors of the company, the youngest ever to serve the board of directors in the company's history.\n\nTodoroki Yu's ability to portray men in a realistic fashion, as opposed to the \"ideal man\" approach otokoyaku usually take, has been the key to her success. This manliness is also the reason, why even off-stage Todoroki's gender has caused some confusion. [[Michael Kunze]] and his wife, the dog of a fellow actress, as well as some French men reportedly perceived Todoroki Yu as male.\n\nDebuting in Moon Troupe in 1985, her career began blossoming when she was transferred to Snow Troupe in 1988. Like her juniors who went on to become top stars, such as [[Y\u014dka Wao]] and [[Jun Sena]], she was a solid \"second man\" to [[Fubuki Takane]], her top star superior. Upon the resignation of Takane, she rose to the top of her career on the Takarazuka stage. Currently as a member of Senka (Superior Members), she sometimes makes special appearances in the Grand Theater performances of other troupes. She also stars in smaller-theater productions with other troupes.\n\nShe was the third top star to be partnered with legendary top musumeyaku [[Mari Hanafusa]], but their time together was short due to the formation of the Cosmos Troupe in 1998, when both [[Mari Hanafusa|Hanafusa]] and Todoroki's \"second man\" [[Y\u014dka Wao]] were transferred to the new troupe.\n\nAfter a year without any performances at the Grand Theater, she joined Cosmos Troupe (Top Stars: [[Y\u016bga Yamato]] and [[Hana Hizuki]]) for the musical ''Dawn Wind'', based on the life of [[Jiro Shirasu]], started in February 2008. This was the first time she had appeared in a Cosmos production since the troupe's establishment in 1998 and made her one of the few actresses who has participated the productions of all five troupes within the company.\n\nOver the years Todoroki Yu's acting on stage has received quite a lot of praise and earned her a series of awards.

When Hitomi Tsukikage, her second top star partner in Snow Troupe, resigned from the company, she considered resigning as well since she had reached the height of her career in the company. However, Yachiyo Kasugano, Todoroki's teacher (member of the theater since 1929; with the company until her death in 2012), persuaded her to stay and she became the second top star in the company's history to resign from top star status but remain in the company ([[Yuri Haruna]] is the first case). In 2003, also upon the invitation of Yachiyo Kasugano, she became a member of the directors of the company, the youngest ever to serve the board of directors in the company's history.\n\nTodoroki Yu's ability to portray men in a realistic fashion, as opposed to the \"ideal man\" approach otokoyaku usually take, has been the key to her success. This manliness is also the reason, why even off-stage Todoroki's gender has caused some confusion. [[Michael Kunze]] and his wife, the dog of a fellow actress, as well as some French men reportedly perceived Todoroki Yu as male.\n\nDebuting in Moon Troupe in 1985, her career began blossoming when she was transferred to Snow Troupe in 1988. Like her juniors who went on to become top stars, such as [[Y\u014dka Wao]] and [[Jun Sena]], she was a solid \"second man\" to [[Fubuki Takane]], her top star superior. Upon the resignation of Takane, she rose to the top of her career on the Takarazuka stage. Currently as a member of Senka (Superior Members), she sometimes makes special appearances in the Grand Theater performances of other troupes. She also stars in smaller-theater productions with other troupes.\n\nShe was the third top star to be partnered with legendary top musumeyaku [[Mari Hanafusa]], but their time together was short due to the formation of the Cosmos Troupe in 1998, when both [[Mari Hanafusa|Hanafusa]] and Todoroki's \"second man\" [[Y\u014dka Wao]] were transferred to the new troupe.\n\nAfter a year without any performances at the Grand Theater, she joined Cosmos Troupe (Top Stars: [[Y\u016bga Yamato]] and [[Hana Hizuki]]) for the musical ''Dawn Wind'', based on the life of [[Jiro Shirasu]], started in February 2008. This was the first time she had appeared in a Cosmos production since the troupe's establishment in 1998 and made her one of the few actresses who has participated the productions of all five troupes within the company.\n\nOver the years Todoroki Yu's acting on stage has received quite a lot of praise and earned her a series of awards. Furthermore, the Cuban embassy commended her portrayal of [[Ernesto Guevara]] in the musical ''Che Guevara''. <ref>[https://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/yomimono/takarazuka/kiji/20190713s000413D5029000c.html News Article] Sponichi Annex Newspaper</ref>\n\nShe enjoys painting and has held exhibitions for her works 6 times.\n\nTodoroki Yu has held two concerts so far.

However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]], as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the [[Iberian lynx]] and the [[Spanish imperial eagle]]. It is known as an [[invasive species]] because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and has caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. [[Rabbits in Australia|Feral European rabbits in Australia]] have had a devastating impact, due in part to the lack of natural predators there.\n\nThe European rabbit is well known for digging networks of [[burrow]]s, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related [[hare]]s (''Lepus'' spp.), rabbits are [[altricial]], the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist [[Ronald Lockley]], who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in [[Orielton, Pembrokeshire]]. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book ''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', which is credited by [[Richard Adams]] as having played a key role in his gaining \"a knowledge of rabbits and their ways\" that informed his novel ''[[Watership Down]]''. The other group was the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in [[Australia]], where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of myxomatosis, and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood.\n\n==Naming and etymology==\nBecause of its non-British origin, the species does not have native names in [[English language|English]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], with the usual terms \"cony\" and \"rabbit\" being foreign [[loanword]]s. \"Rabbit\" is also pronounced as ''rabbidge'', ''rabbert'' ([[North Devon]]) and ''rappit'' ([[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]). More archaic pronunciations include ''rabbette'' (15th-16th centuries), ''rabet'' (15th-17th centuries), ''rabbet'' (16th-18th centuries), ''rabatte'' (16th century), ''rabytt'' (17th century) and ''rabit'' (18th century). The [[root word]] is the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] ''rabett'', which was once commonly used in [[Li\u00e8ge]]. ''Rabett'' itself is derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''robbe'', with the addition of the [[suffix]] ''-ett''.<ref name=\"b177\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"cony\" or \"coney\" predates \"rabbit\", and first occurred during the 13th century to refer to the animal's pelt. Later, \"cony\" referred to the adult animal, while \"rabbit\" referred to the young. The root of \"cony\" is the [[old French]] ''connil'' or ''counil'', of which the [[Norman French|Norman]] plural was ''coniz'', and later ''conis''. Its forerunner is the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, from which the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''cuniculus'' is derived. The origin of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 itself is unclear: [[Claudius Aelianus|\u00c6lian]], who lived during the 3rd century, linked the word to the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''unchi'', while [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varo]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] connected it to ''cuneus'', which refers to a wedge, thus making reference to the animal's digging ability.<ref name=\"b177\"/>\n\nThe species' dwelling place is termed a warren or cony-garth. \"Warren\" comes from the Old English ''wareine'', itself derived from the Old French ''warenne'', ''varenne'', or ''garenne''. The root word is the [[Low Latin]] ''warenna'', which originally signified a preserve in general, only to be later used to refer specifically to an enclosure set apart for rabbits and hares.<ref name=\"hart51\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> \"Cony-garth\" derives from the [[Middle English]] ''conygerthe'', which may be a [[compound word|compound]] of ''connynge''+''erthe'' (cony+earth).

L. Dudzinski (1972). \"Aggressive and Protective Behaviour of Adult Rabbits ''Oryctolagus cuniculus'' (L.) Towards Rabbits.\" ''Behaviour'' 43: 97-120.</ref> The size of the species' [[home range]] varies according to habitat, food, shelter, cover from predators, and breeding sites, though it is generally small, encompassing about 0.3-0.7 [[hectare]]s. Except during times of low rabbit density and abundance of high-quality food, male ranges tend to be larger than those held by females. The European rabbit rarely strays far from its burrow: when feeding on cultivated fields, it typically only moves 25 metres away from its burrow, and rarely 50 metres. It may however move as far as 500 metres after an abrupt change in environment, such as a [[harvest]]. This behaviour may be an anti-predator adaptation, as rabbits in areas where predators are under rigorous control may move three times further from their burrows than those in areas without predator management.<ref name=\"h206-207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\nThe European rabbit is a gregarious animal, which lives in stable social groups centred around females sharing access to one or more burrow systems. However, social structures tend to be looser in areas where burrow construction is relatively easy. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance hierarchies]] exist in parallel for both bucks and does. Among bucks, status is determined through access to does, with dominant bucks siring the majority of the colony's offspring. The dominant does have priority access to the best nesting sites, with competition over such sites often leading to serious injury or death. Subordinate does, particularly in large colonies, typically resort to using single-entrance breeding spots far from the main warren, thus making themselves vulnerable to [[Red fox|fox]] or [[European badger|badger]] predation.<ref name=\"h206-207\"/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:The Rabbit (1898) 'Maternal instinct'.png|thumb|''Maternal Instinct'' (c.1898), [[George Edward Lodge|G. E. Lodge]].]]\nIn the European rabbit's [[mating system]], dominant bucks exhibit [[polygyny]], whereas lower-status individuals (both bucks and does) often form [[monogamy|monogamous]] breeding relationships<!-- the second part of the sentence can trivially be deduced by the fact that mammals produce approximately equal number of offsprings in both genders -->. Rabbits signal their readiness to copulate by marking other animals and inanimate objects with an odoriferous substance secreted though a chin gland, in a process known as \"chinning\".<ref>Gonzalez-Mariscal, G., M. E. Albonetti, et al. (1997). \"Transitory inhibition of scent marking by copulation in male and female rabbits.\" ''Animal Behavior'' 53:323-333.</ref> Though male European rabbits may sometimes be amicable with one another, fierce fights can erupt among bucks during the [[breeding season]],<ref name=\"l97\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=97}}</ref> typically January to August. A succession of litters (usually 3-7 kittens each) are produced, but in overpopulated areas, pregnant does may lose all their [[embryo]]s through intrauterine resorption.<ref name=\"h207-209\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=207\u2013209}}</ref> Shortly before giving birth, the doe will construct a separate burrow known as a \"stop\" or \"stab\", generally in an open field away from the main warren. These breeding burrows are typically a few feet long and are lined with grass and moss as well as fur plucked from the doe's belly. The breeding burrow protects the kittens from adult bucks as well as from predators.<ref name=\"b214\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=214}}</ref>\n\nThe [[gestation period]] of the European rabbit is 30 days,<ref name=\"b210\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=210\u2013212}}</ref> with the [[sex ratio]] of male to female kittens tending to be 1:1. Greater maternal investment over male offspring may result in higher [[birth weight]]s for bucks.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/> Kittens born to the dominant buck and doe&mdash;who enjoy better nesting and feeding grounds&mdash;tend to grow larger and stronger and to become more dominant than kittens born to subordinate rabbits.<ref name=\"l100\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=100}}</ref> It is not uncommon for European rabbits to mate again immediately after giving birth, with some specimens having been observed to nurse previous young whilst pregnant.<ref name=\"b210\"/>\n\nFemale European rabbits nurse their kittens once a night, for only a few minutes. After suckling is complete, the doe seals the entrance to the stop with soil and vegetation. In its native Iberian and southern French range, European rabbit kittens have a [[growth rate (biology)|growth rate]] of {{convert|5|g|oz}} per day, though such kittens in non-native ranges may grow {{convert|10|g|oz}} per day. Weight at birth is {{convert|30|-|35|g|oz}} and increases to {{convert|150|-|200|g|oz}} by 21\u201325 days, during the [[weaning]] period.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/> European rabbit kittens are born blind, deaf, and nearly naked. The ears do not gain the power of motion until 10 days of age, and can be erected after 13. The eyes open 11 days after birth.<ref name=\"b210\"/> At 18 days, the kittens begin to leave the burrow. [[Sexual maturity]] in bucks is attained at four months, while does can begin to breed at three to five months.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/>\n\n===Burrowing behaviour===\n[[File:20150202Hockenheim6.jpg|thumb|right|Entrances to a rabbit warren]]\nThe European rabbit's burrows occur mostly on slopes and banks, where [[drainage]] is more efficient. The burrow entrances are typically 10\u201350&nbsp;cm in diameter,<ref name=\"h202\"/> and are easily recognisable by the bare earth at their mouths. Vegetation growth is prevented by the constant passing and repassing of the resident rabbits. Big burrows are complex excavations which may descend to depths of several feet. They are not constructed on any specified plan, and appear to be enlarged or improved as a result of the promiscuous activity of several generations. Digging is done by pulling the soil backwards with the forefeet and throwing it between the hind legs, which scatter the material with kicking motions. While most burrows are dug from the outside, some warrens feature holes dug from the inside which act as emergency exits when escaping from predators below ground. These holes usually descend perpendicularly to 3\u20134 feet, and their mouths lack the bare earth characteristic of burrow entrances. While kittens sleep in chambers lined with grass and fur, adults sleep on the bare earth, likely in order to prevent [[damp]], with warmth being secured by [[huddling]].<ref name=\"b202\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=202\u2013205}}</ref> Although both sexes dig, does do so more skillfully, and for longer periods.<ref name=\"l58\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=58}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\nThe European rabbit is usually a silent animal, though it has at least two vocalisations. The most well known is a high treble scream or squeal.<ref name=\"l23\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=23}}</ref> This distress call has been likened to the cry of a piglet.<ref name=\"b227\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=227}}</ref> This sound is uttered when in extreme distress, such as being caught by a predator or trap.<ref name=\"l23\"/> During the spring, bucks express contentment by emitting grunting sounds when approaching other rabbits. These grunts are similar to shrill [[hiccup]]s, and are emitted with the mouth closed. Aggression is expressed with a low growl.<ref name=\"b227\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Habitat===\nThe European rabbit's ideal habitat consists of short grasslands with secure refuge (such as burrows, boulders, hedgerows, scrub and woodland) near feeding areas. It may dwell up to [[treeline]], as long as the land is well drained and shelter is available. The size and distribution of its burrow systems depend on the type of [[soil]] present: in areas with loose soil, it selects sites with supporting structures, such as tree roots or shrubs in order to prevent burrow collapse. Warrens tend to be larger and have more interconnected tunnels in areas with [[chalk]] than those in sand. In large coniferous plantations, the species only occurs on peripheral areas and along fire breaks and rides.<ref name=\"h206\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:European Rabbit, Lake District, UK - August 2011.jpg|thumb|right|European rabbit [[grazing]], [[Lake District]], [[UK]].]]\nThe European rabbit eats a wide variety of [[Herbs|herbage]], especially [[grass]]es, favouring the young, succulent leaves and shoots of the most nutritious species, particularly [[fescue]]s. In mixed cultivated areas, [[winter wheat]] is preferred over [[maize]] and [[dicotyledon]]s. During the summer period, the European rabbit feeds on the shortest, and therefore less nutritious grass swards, thus indicating that grazing grounds are selected through anti-predator considerations rather than maximising food intake. In times of scarcity, the rabbit increases its food intake, selecting the parts of the plant with the highest [[nitrogen]] content.<ref name=\"h207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=207}}</ref> Hungry rabbits in winter may resort to eating [[tree bark]]. [[Blackberry|Blackberries]] are also eaten, and captive-bred European rabbits have been fed on [[fodder]] consisting of [[furze]] and [[acorn]]s, which can lead to considerable weight gain.<ref name=\"b225\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=225}}</ref> The European rabbit is a less fussy eater than the brown hare: when eating [[root vegetable]]s, the rabbit eats them whole, while the hare tends to leave the peel.<ref name=\"hart6\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=6}}</ref> Depending on the body's fat and protein reserves, the species can survive without food in winter for about 2\u20138 days.<ref name=\"h207\"/> Although [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], cases are known of rabbits eating [[snail]]s.<ref name=\"b225\"/>\n\nLike other leporids, the European rabbit produces soft, mucus-covered faecal pellets, which are ingested directly from the [[anus]].<ref name=\"h207\"/> The soft pellets are produced posterior to the [[Large intestine|colon]] in the [[hind-gut]] soon after the excretion of hard pellets and the stomach begins to fill with newly-grazed food. The soft pellets are filled with [[protein]]-rich [[bacteria]], and pass down to the rectum in glossy clusters. The rabbit swallows them whole, without perforating the enveloping membrane.<ref name=\"l104\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref>\n\n===Predators===\n[[File:Stoat killing a rabbit.jpg|thumb|European rabbit attacked by a [[stoat]], [[Northumberland]], UK.]]\nThe European rabbit is prey to many different predatory species. [[Red fox|Fox]]es, [[dingo]]es, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[lynx]]es, [[wolverine]]s and [[dog]]s kill both adult and young rabbits by stalking and surprising them in the open. However, relatively few rabbits are caught this way, as rabbits can quickly rush back to cover with a burst of speed. Further, evidence from a study in Spain suggests they may avoid areas where the recent [[Feces|scat]] of predators which have eaten rabbit is detected.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Acta Ethologica|date=18 July 2018|pages=163\u2013168|title=European rabbits recognise conspecifics in their predators' diets|volume=21|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s10211-018-0295-6|last1=Prada|first1=Laura M.|last2=Guerrero-Casado|first2=Jos\u00e9|last3=Tortosa|first3=Francisco S.}}</ref> Both foxes and [[European badger|badger]]s will dig out kittens from shallow burrows, with the latter predators being too slow to catch adult rabbits.

In Helsinki region freed pet rabbits are considered pests.]]\nRecent research has shown that all European rabbits carry common genetic markers and descend from one of two maternal lines. These lines originated between 12,000 and 6.5 million years ago when glaciers isolated two herds; one on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the other in [[Southern France]]. It can be surmised that humans began hunting rabbits as a food source, but further research needs to be done to verify this. Little comprehensive evidence of the relationship of humans with European rabbits is documented until the medieval period.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Rabbit Domestication -- Western Europe |url= http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015632/http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |archivedate=2011-07-11}}</ref>\n\nHumans' relationship with the European rabbit was first recorded by the Phoenicians prior to 1000 [[Before Christ|BC]], when they termed the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'' (literally, the land of the [[hyraxes]]). This phrase closely resembles related [[modern Hebrew]]: ''I'' (\u05d0\u05d9) meaning island and ''shafan'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05df) meaning hyrax, plural ''shfan\u00edm'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd). Phoenicians called the local rabbits 'hyraxes' because rabbits resemble hyraxes in some ways, and hyraxes are native to [[Phoenicia]], unlike rabbits. Hyraxes, like rabbits, are not rodents. One theory states that the Romans converted the phrase ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'', with influence from the Greek ''Spania'', to its Latin form, ''[[Hispania]]'', which evolved in all the Iberian languages: into Castilian ''Espa\u00f1a'', Portuguese ''Espanha'', Catalan ''Espanya'' (English \"Spain\"), and such other variations in modern languages. The precise meaning of ''shafan'' remains unclear, but the balance of opinion appears to indicate that the hyrax is indeed the intended meaning.<ref name=\"shafan\">{{cite web |title=The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax, chapter 6 |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nLike the Phoenicians, neither the later [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] nor [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] colonizers had a specific name for the rabbit, because the species is not native to [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] (though it is present there nowadays). They commonly called it \"small hare\" and \"small digging hare\", in contrast to the [[European hare]], which is larger and doesn't make burrows. [[Catullus]] used the name ''cuniculus'' (a latinization of the [[Iberian culture|Iberian]] word ''kiniklos''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studylib.es/doc/5811443/origen-ib%C3%A9rico-del-conejo.|title=ORIGEN IB\u00c9RICO DEL CONEJO.|website=studylib.es}}</ref> and the etymological origin of the Castilian name ''conejo'', Portuguese ''coelho'' and Catalan ''conill'',<ref>Corominas, Joan & Jos\u00e9 A.

The first known mention of the rabbit as an invasive species (and possibly the first documented instance of an invasive species ever) was made in regard to the introduction of the rabbit to the [[Balearic Islands]] after the [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus|Roman conquest]] of the 1st century BCE. According to both [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], the multiplying rabbits caused famines by destroying crop yields and even collapsed trees and houses with their burrowing. The inhabitants petitioned [[Augustus]] for help, who sent troops to curb the rabbit population with the help of [[ferret]]s.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOther locations where the European rabbit was introduced include: [[Great Britain]] (by the Romans following their invasion in AD 43<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4439339.stm|title=Norfolk - Remains of Roman rabbit uncovered|work=BBC News|date=2005-04-13}}</ref>); the Hawaiian Islands of [[Laysan Island]] (in 1903) and [[Lisianski Island]]; Oceania's [[Macquarie Island]]; Washington state's [[Smith Island (Washington)|Smith Island]] and [[San Juan Island]] (around 1900 and later spreading to the other San Juan Islands); several islands off the coast of [[Southern Africa]] (including [[Robben Island]]); as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n[[File:Wild rabbit in grass.jpg|thumb|A feral rabbit on a farm in [[Victoria (Australia)]]]]\nTwenty-four specimens of the European rabbit were [[Rabbits in Australia|introduced to Australia]] in 1859 by estate owner [[Thomas Austin]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Their descendants multiplied and spread throughout the country thanks to the lack of natural predators, a conducive habitat (provided by widespread farming), and the mild Australian winters that allowed year-round breeding. Australia's native equivalent, the [[bilby]], was quickly pushed out by the invasive rabbit. (The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection.) Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense \"[[rabbit-proof fence]]\" to halt the westward expansion of the infestation. The European rabbit, however, can not only jump very high but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, the intentional introduction of a virus, ''[[Myxomatosis|Myxomatosis cuniiculi]]'', provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s necessary for the spread of the disease were not present. Myxomatosis can also infect pet rabbits (the same species). Today's remaining feral rabbits in Australia are largely immune to myxomatosis. A second deadly rabbit virus, [[rabbit hemorrhagic disease]] (RHD), has been cleared in Australia as a [[biological control]] agent and has already killed millions of the European rabbits there. RHD was also introduced&mdash;illegally&mdash; in New Zealand.\n[[File:Okunojima-rabbit.JPG|thumb|right|Feral rabbits on the island of [[\u014ckunoshima]]. A non-native species, rabbits were introduced to the island following [[World War II]] as part of the development of a park. The rabbits established a self-sustaining population on \u014ckunoshima in the latter half of the 20th century.]]\n\n===Domesticated rabbits===\n{{main|Domestic rabbit}}\nThe only rabbit to be widely [[domesticated]] is the European rabbit, which has been extensively domesticated for food or as a [[pet]]. It was first widely kept in [[ancient Rome]], where fetal rabbits were known as ''[[laurices]]'' and considered a delicacy, and has been refined into a [[List of rabbit breeds|wide variety of breeds]] during and since the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nDomesticated rabbits have mostly been bred to be much larger than wild rabbits, though [[selective breeding]] has produced a range sizes from \"dwarf\" to \"giant\", which are kept as food animals and pets across the world. They have as much color variation among themselves as other livestock and pet animals. Their fur is prized for its softness; today, [[Angora rabbits]] are raised for their long, soft fur, which is often spun into yarn. Other breeds are raised for the fur industry, particularly the [[Rex rabbit|Rex]], which has a smooth, [[velvet]]-like coat and comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes.\n\n===Conservation status===\n{{anchor|Status|reason=This subsection's name was changed from \"Status\" to \"Conservation status\" on 29 March 2018}} \nThough the European rabbit thrives in many of the locations where it was introduced, in its native Iberia, populations are dwindling.

However, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases [[myxomatosis]] and [[rabbit calicivirus]], as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the [[Iberian lynx]] and the [[Spanish imperial eagle]]. It is known as an [[invasive species]] because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of Antarctica, and has caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. [[Rabbits in Australia|Feral European rabbits in Australia]] have had a devastating impact, due in part to the lack of natural predators there.\n\nThe European rabbit is well known for digging networks of [[burrow]]s, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related [[hare]]s (''Lepus'' spp.), rabbits are [[altricial]], the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into wild rabbit behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist [[Ronald Lockley]], who maintained a number of large enclosures for wild rabbit colonies, with observation facilities, in [[Orielton, Pembrokeshire]]. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book ''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', which is credited by [[Richard Adams]] as having played a key role in his gaining \"a knowledge of rabbits and their ways\" that informed his novel ''[[Watership Down]]''. The other group was the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in [[Australia]], where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of myxomatosis, and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood.\n\n==Naming and etymology==\nBecause of its non-British origin, the species does not have native names in [[English language|English]] or [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], with the usual terms \"cony\" and \"rabbit\" being foreign [[loanword]]s. \"Rabbit\" is also pronounced as ''rabbidge'', ''rabbert'' ([[North Devon]]) and ''rappit'' ([[Cheshire]] and [[Lancashire]]). More archaic pronunciations include ''rabbette'' (15th-16th centuries), ''rabet'' (15th-17th centuries), ''rabbet'' (16th-18th centuries), ''rabatte'' (16th century), ''rabytt'' (17th century) and ''rabit'' (18th century). The [[root word]] is the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] ''rabett'', which was once commonly used in [[Li\u00e8ge]]. ''Rabett'' itself is derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''robbe'', with the addition of the [[suffix]] ''-ett''.<ref name=\"b177\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=177\u2013179}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"cony\" or \"coney\" predates \"rabbit\", and first occurred during the 13th century to refer to the animal's pelt. Later, \"cony\" referred to the adult animal, while \"rabbit\" referred to the young. The root of \"cony\" is the [[old French]] ''connil'' or ''counil'', of which the [[Norman French|Norman]] plural was ''coniz'', and later ''conis''. Its forerunner is the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, from which the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''cuniculus'' is derived. The origin of \u03ba\u03cd\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 itself is unclear: [[Claudius Aelianus|\u00c6lian]], who lived during the 3rd century, linked the word to the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''unchi'', while [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varo]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] connected it to ''cuneus'', which refers to a wedge, thus making reference to the animal's digging ability.<ref name=\"b177\"/>\n\nThe species' dwelling place is termed a warren or cony-garth. \"Warren\" comes from the Old English ''wareine'', itself derived from the Old French ''warenne'', ''varenne'', or ''garenne''. The root word is the [[Low Latin]] ''warenna'', which originally signified a preserve in general, only to be later used to refer specifically to an enclosure set apart for rabbits and hares.<ref name=\"hart51\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=51\u201352}}</ref> \"Cony-garth\" derives from the [[Middle English]] ''conygerthe'', which may be a [[compound word|compound]] of ''connynge''+''erthe'' (cony+earth). The term stems from the Old French ''conniniere'' or ''coninyere'', and later ''conilliere''. The root word is the Low Latin ''cunicularia'', the feminine form of the [[adjective]] ''cunicularius'', which pertains to the rabbit.<ref name=\"b177\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:History of British Mammals - Lepus vs Oryctolagus.png|150 px|thumb|Skulls of [[European hare|brown hare]] (top), [[mountain hare]] (middle) and European rabbit (bottom).]]\nThough originally assigned to the [[genus]] ''[[Lepus]]'', the European rabbit was consigned to its own genus in 1874, on account of its [[altricial]] young, burrowing habits, and numerous skeletal characters.<ref name=\"h203\"/> The European rabbit is superficially similar to the [[North America]]n [[Cottontail rabbit|cottontail]]s, as both ''Oryctolagus'' and ''Sylvilagus'' are born blind and naked, have white flesh, and little [[sexual dimorphism]].

L. Dudzinski (1972). \"Aggressive and Protective Behaviour of Adult Rabbits ''Oryctolagus cuniculus'' (L.) Towards Rabbits.\" ''Behaviour'' 43: 97-120.</ref> The size of the species' [[home range]] varies according to habitat, food, shelter, cover from predators, and breeding sites, though it is generally small, encompassing about 0.3-0.7 [[hectare]]s. Except during times of low rabbit density and abundance of high-quality food, male ranges tend to be larger than those held by females. The European rabbit rarely strays far from its burrow: when feeding on cultivated fields, it typically only moves 25 metres away from its burrow, and rarely 50 metres. It may however move as far as 500 metres after an abrupt change in environment, such as a [[harvest]]. This behaviour may be an anti-predator adaptation, as rabbits in areas where predators are under rigorous control may move three times further from their burrows than those in areas without predator management.<ref name=\"h206-207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\nThe European rabbit is a gregarious animal, which lives in stable social groups centred around females sharing access to one or more burrow systems. However, social structures tend to be looser in areas where burrow construction is relatively easy. [[Dominance hierarchy|Dominance hierarchies]] exist in parallel for both bucks and does. Among bucks, status is determined through access to does, with dominant bucks siring the majority of the colony's offspring. The dominant does have priority access to the best nesting sites, with competition over such sites often leading to serious injury or death. Subordinate does, particularly in large colonies, typically resort to using single-entrance breeding spots far from the main warren, thus making themselves vulnerable to [[Red fox|fox]] or [[European badger|badger]] predation.<ref name=\"h206-207\"/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:The Rabbit (1898) 'Maternal instinct'.png|thumb|''Maternal Instinct'' (c.1898), [[George Edward Lodge|G.

Rabbits signal their readiness to copulate by marking other animals and inanimate objects with an odoriferous substance secreted though a chin gland, in a process known as \"chinning\".<ref>Gonzalez-Mariscal, G., M. E. Albonetti, et al. (1997). \"Transitory inhibition of scent marking by copulation in male and female rabbits.\" ''Animal Behavior'' 53:323-333.</ref> Though male European rabbits may sometimes be amicable with one another, fierce fights can erupt among bucks during the [[breeding season]],<ref name=\"l97\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=97}}</ref> typically January to August.

After suckling is complete, the doe seals the entrance to the stop with soil and vegetation. In its native Iberian and southern French range, European rabbit kittens have a [[growth rate (biology)|growth rate]] of {{convert|5|g|oz}} per day, though such kittens in non-native ranges may grow {{convert|10|g|oz}} per day. Weight at birth is {{convert|30|-|35|g|oz}} and increases to {{convert|150|-|200|g|oz}} by 21\u201325 days, during the [[weaning]] period.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/> European rabbit kittens are born blind, deaf, and nearly naked. The ears do not gain the power of motion until 10 days of age, and can be erected after 13. The eyes open 11 days after birth.<ref name=\"b210\"/> At 18 days, the kittens begin to leave the burrow. [[Sexual maturity]] in bucks is attained at four months, while does can begin to breed at three to five months.<ref name=\"h207-209\"/>\n\n===Burrowing behaviour===\n[[File:20150202Hockenheim6.jpg|thumb|right|Entrances to a rabbit warren]]\nThe European rabbit's burrows occur mostly on slopes and banks, where [[drainage]] is more efficient. The burrow entrances are typically 10\u201350&nbsp;cm in diameter,<ref name=\"h202\"/> and are easily recognisable by the bare earth at their mouths. Vegetation growth is prevented by the constant passing and repassing of the resident rabbits. Big burrows are complex excavations which may descend to depths of several feet. They are not constructed on any specified plan, and appear to be enlarged or improved as a result of the promiscuous activity of several generations. Digging is done by pulling the soil backwards with the forefeet and throwing it between the hind legs, which scatter the material with kicking motions. While most burrows are dug from the outside, some warrens feature holes dug from the inside which act as emergency exits when escaping from predators below ground. These holes usually descend perpendicularly to 3\u20134 feet, and their mouths lack the bare earth characteristic of burrow entrances. While kittens sleep in chambers lined with grass and fur, adults sleep on the bare earth, likely in order to prevent [[damp]], with warmth being secured by [[huddling]].<ref name=\"b202\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=202\u2013205}}</ref> Although both sexes dig, does do so more skillfully, and for longer periods.<ref name=\"l58\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=58}}</ref>\n\n===Communication===\nThe European rabbit is usually a silent animal, though it has at least two vocalisations. The most well known is a high treble scream or squeal.<ref name=\"l23\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=23}}</ref> This distress call has been likened to the cry of a piglet.<ref name=\"b227\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=227}}</ref> This sound is uttered when in extreme distress, such as being caught by a predator or trap.<ref name=\"l23\"/> During the spring, bucks express contentment by emitting grunting sounds when approaching other rabbits. These grunts are similar to shrill [[hiccup]]s, and are emitted with the mouth closed. Aggression is expressed with a low growl.<ref name=\"b227\"/>\n\n==Ecology==\n===Habitat===\nThe European rabbit's ideal habitat consists of short grasslands with secure refuge (such as burrows, boulders, hedgerows, scrub and woodland) near feeding areas. It may dwell up to [[treeline]], as long as the land is well drained and shelter is available. The size and distribution of its burrow systems depend on the type of [[soil]] present: in areas with loose soil, it selects sites with supporting structures, such as tree roots or shrubs in order to prevent burrow collapse. Warrens tend to be larger and have more interconnected tunnels in areas with [[chalk]] than those in sand. In large coniferous plantations, the species only occurs on peripheral areas and along fire breaks and rides.<ref name=\"h206\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=206}}</ref>\n\n===Diet===\n[[File:European Rabbit, Lake District, UK - August 2011.jpg|thumb|right|European rabbit [[grazing]], [[Lake District]], [[UK]].]]\nThe European rabbit eats a wide variety of [[Herbs|herbage]], especially [[grass]]es, favouring the young, succulent leaves and shoots of the most nutritious species, particularly [[fescue]]s. In mixed cultivated areas, [[winter wheat]] is preferred over [[maize]] and [[dicotyledon]]s. During the summer period, the European rabbit feeds on the shortest, and therefore less nutritious grass swards, thus indicating that grazing grounds are selected through anti-predator considerations rather than maximising food intake. In times of scarcity, the rabbit increases its food intake, selecting the parts of the plant with the highest [[nitrogen]] content.<ref name=\"h207\">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=207}}</ref> Hungry rabbits in winter may resort to eating [[tree bark]]. [[Blackberry|Blackberries]] are also eaten, and captive-bred European rabbits have been fed on [[fodder]] consisting of [[furze]] and [[acorn]]s, which can lead to considerable weight gain.<ref name=\"b225\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=225}}</ref> The European rabbit is a less fussy eater than the brown hare: when eating [[root vegetable]]s, the rabbit eats them whole, while the hare tends to leave the peel.<ref name=\"hart6\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=6}}</ref> Depending on the body's fat and protein reserves, the species can survive without food in winter for about 2\u20138 days.<ref name=\"h207\"/> Although [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], cases are known of rabbits eating [[snail]]s.<ref name=\"b225\"/>\n\nLike other leporids, the European rabbit produces soft, mucus-covered faecal pellets, which are ingested directly from the [[anus]].<ref name=\"h207\"/> The soft pellets are produced posterior to the [[Large intestine|colon]] in the [[hind-gut]] soon after the excretion of hard pellets and the stomach begins to fill with newly-grazed food. The soft pellets are filled with [[protein]]-rich [[bacteria]], and pass down to the rectum in glossy clusters. The rabbit swallows them whole, without perforating the enveloping membrane.<ref name=\"l104\">{{Harvnb|Lockley|1976|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref>\n\n===Predators===\n[[File:Stoat killing a rabbit.jpg|thumb|European rabbit attacked by a [[stoat]], [[Northumberland]], UK.]]\nThe European rabbit is prey to many different predatory species. [[Red fox|Fox]]es, [[dingo]]es, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[lynx]]es, [[wolverine]]s and [[dog]]s kill both adult and young rabbits by stalking and surprising them in the open. However, relatively few rabbits are caught this way, as rabbits can quickly rush back to cover with a burst of speed. Further, evidence from a study in Spain suggests they may avoid areas where the recent [[Feces|scat]] of predators which have eaten rabbit is detected.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Acta Ethologica|date=18 July 2018|pages=163\u2013168|title=European rabbits recognise conspecifics in their predators' diets|volume=21|issue=3|doi=10.1007/s10211-018-0295-6|last1=Prada|first1=Laura M.|last2=Guerrero-Casado|first2=Jos\u00e9|last3=Tortosa|first3=Francisco S.}}</ref> Both foxes and [[European badger|badger]]s will dig out kittens from shallow burrows, with the latter predators being too slow to catch adult rabbits.

Does can be fiercely protective of their kittens, having been observed to chase away large cats and [[mustelid]]s, including [[ferret]]s, [[stoat]]s and [[Least weasel|weasel]]s. However, rabbits typically run from mustelids, and may fear them innately. Cases are known of rabbits becoming paralysed with fear and dying when pursued by stoats or weasels, even when rescued unharmed.<ref name=\"l139\"/> It is known that the European rabbit comprises 85% of the [[European polecat|polecat]]'s diet, and its availability is important to the success of breeding female [[American mink|mink]].<ref name=\"h204\"/> [[Brown rat]]s can be a serious threat to kittens, as they will reside in rabbit burrows during the summer, and attack them in groups.<ref name=\"hart39\">{{Harvnb|Harting|1898|pp=39}}</ref><ref name=\"b212\">{{Harvnb|Barrett-Hamilton|Hinton|Wilson|1910|pp=212}}</ref> Although many [[birds of prey]] are capable of killing rabbits, few are strong enough to carry them.

In Helsinki region freed pet rabbits are considered pests.]]\nRecent research has shown that all European rabbits carry common genetic markers and descend from one of two maternal lines. These lines originated between 12,000 and 6.5 million years ago when glaciers isolated two herds; one on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the other in [[Southern France]]. It can be surmised that humans began hunting rabbits as a food source, but further research needs to be done to verify this. Little comprehensive evidence of the relationship of humans with European rabbits is documented until the medieval period.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Rabbit Domestication -- Western Europe |url= http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711015632/http://www.for-get-me-notrabbitry.com/1/post/2010/12/great-article-on-the-history-of-the-rabbit.html |archivedate=2011-07-11}}</ref>\n\nHumans' relationship with the European rabbit was first recorded by the Phoenicians prior to 1000 [[Before Christ|BC]], when they termed the [[Iberian Peninsula]] ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'' (literally, the land of the [[hyraxes]]). This phrase closely resembles related [[modern Hebrew]]: ''I'' (\u05d0\u05d9) meaning island and ''shafan'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05df) meaning hyrax, plural ''shfan\u00edm'' (\u05e9\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd). Phoenicians called the local rabbits 'hyraxes' because rabbits resemble hyraxes in some ways, and hyraxes are native to [[Phoenicia]], unlike rabbits. Hyraxes, like rabbits, are not rodents. One theory states that the Romans converted the phrase ''i-Shaphan-\u00edm'', with influence from the Greek ''Spania'', to its Latin form, ''[[Hispania]]'', which evolved in all the Iberian languages: into Castilian ''Espa\u00f1a'', Portuguese ''Espanha'', Catalan ''Espanya'' (English \"Spain\"), and such other variations in modern languages. The precise meaning of ''shafan'' remains unclear, but the balance of opinion appears to indicate that the hyrax is indeed the intended meaning.<ref name=\"shafan\">{{cite web |title=The Camel, the Hare and the Hyrax, chapter 6 |url=http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616192614/http://www.zootorah.com/hyrax/hyrax.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nLike the Phoenicians, neither the later [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] nor [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] colonizers had a specific name for the rabbit, because the species is not native to [[Greece]] and [[Italy]] (though it is present there nowadays). They commonly called it \"small hare\" and \"small digging hare\", in contrast to the [[European hare]], which is larger and doesn't make burrows. [[Catullus]] used the name ''cuniculus'' (a latinization of the [[Iberian culture|Iberian]] word ''kiniklos''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studylib.es/doc/5811443/origen-ib%C3%A9rico-del-conejo.|title=ORIGEN IB\u00c9RICO DEL CONEJO.|website=studylib.es}}</ref> and the etymological origin of the Castilian name ''conejo'', Portuguese ''coelho'' and Catalan ''conill'',<ref>Corominas, Joan & Jos\u00e9 A.

Rabbits are an example of an animal that can be treated as a food, a pet, or a pest by different members of the same culture. In some urban areas, infestations of feral European rabbits (descended from pets) have become a problem. [[Helsinki]], for example, host to one of the northernmost populations of the species, had an estimated 2,500 European rabbits at the end of 2006, doubling to 5,000 by autumn 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kemppainen |first=Jouni K. |date=October 2007 |title=Kanit keskuudessamme (''The rabbits among us'') |journal=[[Suomen Kuvalehti]]| pages=76\u201383| language=Finnish}}</ref> In Iceland, populations of ''O. cuniculus'' are found in urban [[Reykjavik]] as well as in the [[Vestmannaeyjar]] archipelago. In Finland, the introduced European rabbit vies with the native lagomorphs: the [[European hare]] and the [[mountain hare]].\n\n===As an invasive species===\n[[Image:MyxoRabbit.JPG|left|thumb|A European rabbit afflicted with [[myxomatosis]]]]\nThe European rabbit has been introduced as an [[exotic species]] into several environments, often with harmful results to vegetation and local wildlife, making it an [[invasive species]]. The first known mention of the rabbit as an invasive species (and possibly the first documented instance of an invasive species ever) was made in regard to the introduction of the rabbit to the [[Balearic Islands]] after the [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus|Roman conquest]] of the 1st century BCE. According to both [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], the multiplying rabbits caused famines by destroying crop yields and even collapsed trees and houses with their burrowing. The inhabitants petitioned [[Augustus]] for help, who sent troops to curb the rabbit population with the help of [[ferret]]s.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nOther locations where the European rabbit was introduced include: [[Great Britain]] (by the Romans following their invasion in AD 43<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/norfolk/4439339.stm|title=Norfolk - Remains of Roman rabbit uncovered|work=BBC News|date=2005-04-13}}</ref>); the Hawaiian Islands of [[Laysan Island]] (in 1903) and [[Lisianski Island]]; Oceania's [[Macquarie Island]]; Washington state's [[Smith Island (Washington)|Smith Island]] and [[San Juan Island]] (around 1900 and later spreading to the other San Juan Islands); several islands off the coast of [[Southern Africa]] (including [[Robben Island]]); as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n[[File:Wild rabbit in grass.jpg|thumb|A feral rabbit on a farm in [[Victoria (Australia)]]]]\nTwenty-four specimens of the European rabbit were [[Rabbits in Australia|introduced to Australia]] in 1859 by estate owner [[Thomas Austin]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Their descendants multiplied and spread throughout the country thanks to the lack of natural predators, a conducive habitat (provided by widespread farming), and the mild Australian winters that allowed year-round breeding. Australia's native equivalent, the [[bilby]], was quickly pushed out by the invasive rabbit. (The bilbies are endangered, but are now making a comeback due to government protection.) Between 1901 and 1907, Australia built an immense \"[[rabbit-proof fence]]\" to halt the westward expansion of the infestation. The European rabbit, however, can not only jump very high but also burrow underground, making fencing essentially futile. During the 1950s, the intentional introduction of a virus, ''[[Myxomatosis|Myxomatosis cuniiculi]]'', provided some relief in Australia, but not in New Zealand, where the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s necessary for the spread of the disease were not present. Myxomatosis can also infect pet rabbits (the same species). Today's remaining feral rabbits in Australia are largely immune to myxomatosis. A second deadly rabbit virus, [[rabbit hemorrhagic disease]] (RHD), has been cleared in Australia as a [[biological control]] agent and has already killed millions of the European rabbits there. RHD was also introduced&mdash;illegally&mdash; in New Zealand.\n[[File:Okunojima-rabbit.JPG|thumb|right|Feral rabbits on the island of [[\u014ckunoshima]].

It was first widely kept in [[ancient Rome]], where fetal rabbits were known as ''[[laurices]]'' and considered a delicacy, and has been refined into a [[List of rabbit breeds|wide variety of breeds]] during and since the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nDomesticated rabbits have mostly been bred to be much larger than wild rabbits, though [[selective breeding]] has produced a range sizes from \"dwarf\" to \"giant\", which are kept as food animals and pets across the world. They have as much color variation among themselves as other livestock and pet animals. Their fur is prized for its softness; today, [[Angora rabbits]] are raised for their long, soft fur, which is often spun into yarn. Other breeds are raised for the fur industry, particularly the [[Rex rabbit|Rex]], which has a smooth, [[velvet]]-like coat and comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes.\n\n===Conservation status===\n{{anchor|Status|reason=This subsection's name was changed from \"Status\" to \"Conservation status\" on 29 March 2018}} \nThough the European rabbit thrives in many of the locations where it was introduced, in its native Iberia, populations are dwindling.
