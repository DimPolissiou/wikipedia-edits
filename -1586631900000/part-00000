The band signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1991. A few months after the completion of the band's debut studio album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] joined the band. ''Ten'' broke Pearl Jam into the mainstream, and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=Top 100 Albums |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqv3Gpco?url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |archivedate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, ''[[Vs.

''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'' July 2000.</ref> In 1994, the band released its third studio album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'', which became the band's third straight album to reach multi-platinum status.\n\nFollowing Abbruzzese's exit in 1994, original [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] joined the band. Pearl Jam subsequently released ''[[No Code]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]'' in 1998. The band once again changed drummers in 1998, with Irons being replaced by former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]], who had previously worked with the members of Pearl Jam in the Temple of the Dog project and had drummed on the band's first demos. Cameron has remained as Pearl Jam's drummer ever since. In 1998, Pearl Jam released \"[[Last Kiss]]\" on the band's fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. \"Last Kiss\" became the band's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]'', and initiated a series of \"[[Pearl Jam Official Bootlegs|official bootlegs]]\" of live albums. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the ''Billboard'' 200 at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629092938/http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |title=Pearl Jam Breaks Its Own Chart Record |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |author=Davis, Darren |publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

The band signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1991. A few months after the completion of the band's debut studio album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'', drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] joined the band. ''Ten'' broke Pearl Jam into the mainstream, and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=Top 100 Albums |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqv3Gpco?url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |archivedate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, ''[[Vs.

Burdened by the pressures of success, Pearl Jam decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos.<ref>Ashare, Matt. \"The Sweet Smell of (Moderate) Success\". ''[[CMJ New Music Monthly]]'' July 2000.</ref> In 1994, the band released its third studio album, ''[[Vitalogy]]'', which became the band's third straight album to reach multi-platinum status.\n\nFollowing Abbruzzese's exit in 1994, original [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] drummer [[Jack Irons]] joined the band. Pearl Jam subsequently released ''[[No Code]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]'' in 1998. The band once again changed drummers in 1998, with Irons being replaced by former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]], who had previously worked with the members of Pearl Jam in the Temple of the Dog project and had drummed on the band's first demos. Cameron has remained as Pearl Jam's drummer ever since. In 1998, Pearl Jam released \"[[Last Kiss]]\" on the band's fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. \"Last Kiss\" became the band's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]'', and initiated a series of \"[[Pearl Jam Official Bootlegs|official bootlegs]]\" of live albums. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the ''Billboard'' 200 at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629092938/http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |title=Pearl Jam Breaks Its Own Chart Record |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |author=Davis, Darren |publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

{"title_page": "Machinability", "text_new": "'''Machinability''' is the ease with which a metal can be cut ([[machining|machined]]) permitting the removal of the material with a satisfactory [[surface finish|finish]] at low cost.<ref name=degarmo542>Degarmo, p. 542.</ref> Materials with good machinability ('''free machining''' materials) require little power to cut, can be cut quickly, easily obtain a good finish, and do not [[tool wear|wear]] the [[cutting tool (machining)|tooling]] much. The factors that typically improve a material's performance often degrade its machinability. Therefore, to manufacture components economically, engineers are challenged to find ways to improve machinability without harming performance.\n\nMachinability can be difficult to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials.<ref>Schneider, George, \"Machinability of Metals,\" ''American Machinist'', December, 2009.</ref> The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength.<ref name=\"Schneider, Machinability.\">Schneider, \"Machinability.\"</ref> Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening.<ref name=\"Schneider, Machinability.\"/> Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting tool material and geometry, and the machining process parameters.<ref name=\"Schneider, Machinability.\"/>\n\n==Quantifying machinability==\nThere are many factors affecting machinability, but no widely accepted way to quantify it. Instead, machinability is often assessed on a case-by-case basis, and tests are tailored to the needs of a specific manufacturing process. Common metrics for comparison include tool life, surface finish, cutting temperature, and tool forces and power consumption.<ref name=tmeh/><ref name=Schneider8>Schneider, p. 8.</ref>\n\n===Tool life method===\nMachinability can be based on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when comparing materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. [[high speed steel|HSS]] tool to a carbide tool).<ref name=Schneider8/>\n\n<math>\\text{Machineability index (}\\%{)} = \\frac{\\text{cutting speed of material for 20 minute tool life}}{\\text{cutting speed of free-cutting steel for 20 minute tool life}} * 100</math>\n\n===Tool forces and power consumption method===\nThe forces required for a tool to cut through a material is directly related to the power consumed. Therefore, tool forces are often given in units of specific energy. This leads to a rating method where higher specific energies equal lower machinability. The advantage of this method is that outside factors have little effect on the rating.<ref name=Schneider8/>\n\n===Surface finish method===\nThe surface finish is sometimes used to measure the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a [[built up edge]]. Stainless steel and other materials with a high [[strain hardening]] ability also want to form a built up edge. Aluminium alloys, cold worked steels, and [[free machining steel]]s, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.<ref name=Schneider9>Schneider, p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe advantage of this method is that it is easily measured with the appropriate equipment. The disadvantage of this criterion is that it is often irrelevant. For instance when making a rough cut, the surface finish is of no importance. Also, finish cuts often require a certain accuracy that naturally achieves a good surface finish. This rating method also doesn't always agree with other methods. For instance titanium alloys would rate well by the surface finish method, low by the tool life method, and intermediate by the power consumption method.<ref name=Schneider9/><ref name=Schneider10>Schneider, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===Machinability rating===\nThe machinability rating of a material attempts to quantify the machinability of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized value]]. The [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI) determined machinability ratings for a wide variety of materials by running turning tests at 180 [[surface feet per minute]] (sfpm).<ref name=Schneider5/> It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a machinability rating of 100%.<ref name=Schneider5>Schneider, p. 5.</ref> The machinability rating is determined by measuring the weighted averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and tool life for each material.<ref name=Schneider5/> Note that a material with a machinability rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material with a value more than 100% would be easier.\n\nMachinability Rating=  (Speed of Machining the workpiece giving 60min tool life)/( Speed of machining the standard metal)\n\nMachinability ratings can be used in conjunction with the [[Tool wear#Effects_of_tool_wear|Taylor tool life equation]], <math>VT^n = C</math>, in order to determine cutting speeds or tool life. It is known that B1112 has a tool life of 60 minutes at a cutting speed of 100 sfpm. If a material has a machinability rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that in order to maintain the same tool life (60 minutes) the cutting speed must be 70 sfpm (assuming the same tooling is used).<ref name=degarmo542>Degarmo, p. 542.</ref>\n\n==Steels==\n{{See also|Free machining steel}}\n\nThe carbon content of steel greatly affects its machinability. High-carbon steels are difficult to machine because they are strong and because they may contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool. On the other end of the spectrum, low-carbon steels are troublesome because they are too soft. Low-carbon steels are \"gummy\" and stick to the cutting tool, resulting in a built up edge that shortens tool life. Therefore, steel has the best machinability with medium amounts of carbon, about 0.20%.<ref name=tmeh>{{cite book |author1=Bakerjian, Ramon |author2=Cubberly, W. H. |title=Tool and manufacturing engineers handbook |publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers |location=Dearborn, Mich |year=1989 |pages=15\u20133, 15\u201310, 19\u201313 to 19\u201318 |isbn=0-87263-351-9}}</ref>\n \nChromium, molybdenum and other alloying metals are often added to steel to improve its strength. However, most of these metals also decrease machinability.\n \nInclusions in steel, especially oxides, may abrade the cutting tool. Machinable steel should be free of these oxides.\n\n===Additives===\nThere are a variety of chemicals, both metal and non-metal, that can be added to steel to make it easier to cut. These additives may work by lubricating the tool-chip interface, decreasing the shear strength of the material, or increasing the brittleness of the chip. Historically, sulphur and lead have been the most common additives, but bismuth and tin are increasingly popular for environmental reasons.\n \nLead can improve the machinability of steel because it acts as an internal lubricant in the cutting zone.<ref name=kalpakjian>{{cite book |title=Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials |last=Kalpakjian |first=Serope  |author2=Steven R. Schmid |year=2003 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=81-7808-990-4 |pages=437\u2013440}}</ref> Since lead has poor shear strength, it allows the chip to slide more freely past the cutting edge. When it is added in small quantities to steel, it can greatly improve its machinability while not significantly affecting the steel's strength.\n \nSulphur improves the machinability of steel by forming low shear strength inclusions in the cutting zone. These inclusions are stress risers that weaken the steel, allowing it to deform more easily.\n\n===Stainless steel===\nStainless steels have poor machinability compared to regular carbon steel because they are tougher, gummier and tend to work harden very rapidly.<ref name=tmeh/> Slightly hardening the steel may decrease its gumminess and make it easier to cut. AISI grades 303 and 416 are easier to machine because of the addition of sulphur and phosphorus.<ref name=mcmaster>{{cite web |title = McMaster-Carr Catalog |url = http://www.mcmaster.com |accessdate = 2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\n==Aluminium==\nAluminium is a much softer metal than steel, and the techniques to improve its machinability usually rely on making it more brittle. [[Aluminium alloy|Alloys]] 2007, 2011 and 6020 have very good machinability.<ref name=mcmaster />\n\n==Other materials==\n[[Thermoplastics]] are difficult to machine because they have poor thermal conductivity.<ref name= kalpakjian /> This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which degrades the tool life and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts, it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it. Machinability can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the cutting area free of chip build up.\n \n[[Composite material|Composites]] often have the worst machinability because they combine the poor thermal conductivity of a plastic resin with the tough or abrasive qualities of the fiber (glass, carbon etc.) material.\n \nThe machinability of [[rubber]] and other soft materials improves by using a very low temperature coolant, such as liquid carbon dioxide. The low temperatures chill the material prior to cutting so that it cannot deform or stick to the cutting edge. This means less wear on the tools and easier machining.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Machining vibrations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book | last = Degarmo | first = E.

For instance titanium alloys would rate well by the surface finish method, low by the tool life method, and intermediate by the power consumption method.<ref name=Schneider9/><ref name=Schneider10>Schneider, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===Machinability rating===\nThe machinability rating of a material attempts to quantify the machinability of various materials. It is expressed as a percentage or a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized value]]. The [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI) determined machinability ratings for a wide variety of materials by running turning tests at 180 [[surface feet per minute]] (sfpm).<ref name=Schneider5/> It then arbitrarily assigned 160 Brinell B1112 steel a machinability rating of 100%.<ref name=Schneider5>Schneider, p. 5.</ref> The machinability rating is determined by measuring the weighed averages of the normal cutting speed, surface finish, and tool life for each material.<ref name=Schneider5/> Note that a material with a machinability rating less than 100% would be more difficult to machine than B1112 and material with a value more than 100% would be easier.\n\nMachinability Rating=  (Speed of Machining the workpiece giving 60min tool life)/( Speed of machining the standard metal)\n\nMachinability ratings can be used in conjunction with the [[Tool wear#Effects_of_tool_wear|Taylor tool life equation]], <math>VT^n = C</math>, in order to determine cutting speeds or tool life. It is known that B1112 has a tool life of 60 minutes at a cutting speed of 100 sfpm. If a material has a machinability rating of 70%, it can be determined, with the above knowns, that in order to maintain the same tool life (60 minutes) the cutting speed must be 70 sfpm (assuming the same tooling is used).<ref name=degarmo542>Degarmo, p. 542.</ref>\n\n==Steels==\n{{See also|Free machining steel}}\n\nThe carbon content of steel greatly affects its machinability. High-carbon steels are difficult to machine because they are strong and because they may contain carbides that abrade the cutting tool. On the other end of the spectrum, low-carbon steels are troublesome because they are too soft. Low-carbon steels are \"gummy\" and stick to the cutting tool, resulting in a built up edge that shortens tool life. Therefore, steel has the best machinability with medium amounts of carbon, about 0.20%.<ref name=tmeh>{{cite book |author1=Bakerjian, Ramon |author2=Cubberly, W. H. |title=Tool and manufacturing engineers handbook |publisher=Society of Manufacturing Engineers |location=Dearborn, Mich |year=1989 |pages=15\u20133, 15\u201310, 19\u201313 to 19\u201318 |isbn=0-87263-351-9}}</ref>\n \nChromium, molybdenum and other alloying metals are often added to steel to improve its strength. However, most of these metals also decrease machinability.\n \nInclusions in steel, especially oxides, may abrade the cutting tool. Machinable steel should be free of these oxides.\n\n===Additives===\nThere are a variety of chemicals, both metal and non-metal, that can be added to steel to make it easier to cut. These additives may work by lubricating the tool-chip interface, decreasing the shear strength of the material, or increasing the brittleness of the chip. Historically, sulphur and lead have been the most common additives, but bismuth and tin are increasingly popular for environmental reasons.\n \nLead can improve the machinability of steel because it acts as an internal lubricant in the cutting zone.<ref name=kalpakjian>{{cite book |title=Manufacturing Processes for Engineering Materials |last=Kalpakjian |first=Serope  |author2=Steven R. Schmid |year=2003 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=81-7808-990-4 |pages=437\u2013440}}</ref> Since lead has poor shear strength, it allows the chip to slide more freely past the cutting edge. When it is added in small quantities to steel, it can greatly improve its machinability while not significantly affecting the steel's strength.\n \nSulphur improves the machinability of steel by forming low shear strength inclusions in the cutting zone. These inclusions are stress risers that weaken the steel, allowing it to deform more easily.\n\n===Stainless steel===\nStainless steels have poor machinability compared to regular carbon steel because they are tougher, gummier and tend to work harden very rapidly.<ref name=tmeh/> Slightly hardening the steel may decrease its gumminess and make it easier to cut. AISI grades 303 and 416 are easier to machine because of the addition of sulphur and phosphorus.<ref name=mcmaster>{{cite web |title = McMaster-Carr Catalog |url = http://www.mcmaster.com |accessdate = 2008-04-01}}</ref>\n\n==Aluminium==\nAluminium is a much softer metal than steel, and the techniques to improve its machinability usually rely on making it more brittle. [[Aluminium alloy|Alloys]] 2007, 2011 and 6020 have very good machinability.<ref name=mcmaster />\n\n==Other materials==\n[[Thermoplastics]] are difficult to machine because they have poor thermal conductivity.<ref name= kalpakjian /> This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which degrades the tool life and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts, it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it. Machinability can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the cutting area free of chip build up.\n \n[[Composite material|Composites]] often have the worst machinability because they combine the poor thermal conductivity of a plastic resin with the tough or abrasive qualities of the fiber (glass, carbon etc.) material.\n \nThe machinability of [[rubber]] and other soft materials improves by using a very low temperature coolant, such as liquid carbon dioxide. The low temperatures chill the material prior to cutting so that it cannot deform or stick to the cutting edge. This means less wear on the tools and easier machining.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Machining vibrations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book | last = Degarmo | first = E.

Since 2014, it is supported by a [[nonprofit organization]] of the same name based in [[Lyon]], [[France]]. Mainly focused on\u00a0[[free software]] [[Valorisation|valorisation]], it is divided into three main branches of activities based upon a collaborative model: promotion, dissemination and development of [[free software]], and enrichment of the [[Free-culture movement|free culture]] movement and online services.\n\nAs a space for orientation, informations, news, exchange, and projects, Framasoft is one of the main [[Francophone|French language]] portals to the free and [[Open source|open-source]] culture. Its community regularly brings resources and assistance to people who would like to get started with [[free software]]. They also accompany people wishing to replace their [[proprietary software]] with open-source solutions at any step of the migration from proprietary to free software, such as [[Microsoft Windows]] to [[Linux|GNU/Linux]].\n\nThe entire Framasoft production is provided under [[Free license]] in order to promote participation and guarantee that everyone can benefit from it, without any appropriation whatsoever. Framasoft Free mentions is a corporate and non-profit third party.\n\n== Framasoft network ==\nList of Framasoft's products and services :\n\nFramasoft network has around thirty projects with as many [[website]]s, usually named with a prefix \"frama\" and an independent ''\".org''\" as [[domain name]]''.'' Those projects belong to three main categories: free and opensource software, free culture and free and open-source online services.\n\n* The \"free software\" category is composed of a directory (Framalibre), a [[Portable application|portable Application]] on [[USB flash drive|USB drive]] (Framakey), a [[DVD]] (Framadvd), a software distributor (Framapack), and a list of the greatest free software projects (Framastart).\n* The \"free culture\" category contains a news [[blog]] (Framablog), a [[Book publisher|Publishing]] (Framabook), an Anglo-French and a Spanish-French translation team (Framalang), a video platform (Framatube), and website to promote\u00a0 [[free music]] (Framazic).\n* The \"online open source services\"\u00a0category contains more than 30 services : a [[text editor]] ([[:fr:Framapad|Framapad]], [[:fr:Liste des produits et services de Framasoft#Framapad|MyPads]]) and a [[spreadsheet]] ([[:fr:Liste des produits et services de Framasoft#Framacalc|Framacalc]]), both collaboratives, a meeting planning and survey (Framadate), [[Mind map|Mind-map]] (Framindmap) and vectorial drawing (Framavectoriel). User also have access to a [[Web search engine|search engine]] (Framabee), 2 [[social network]] (Framasph\u00e8re and Framapiaf), an interesting articles save service (Framabag), and a news service (Framanews). Framabin permits to share notes, Framapics images, and Framalink is an URL shortener. At last, Framagit is a [[Forge (software)]] easing collaborative programs development. All these services are [[personal data]]s and [[private sphere|private life]] respectful and can be [[Decentralization|decentralized]] on [[On-premises software|one's own server]] by following guides available on Framacloud.\n* The network also has an [[Internet forum]] called Framacolibri and an [[Online shopping]], EnVenteLibre. Framasoft servers also host a few partners and friends websites.\n\n== Network history ==\nSome memorable dates in history of Framasoft's network:\n\n=== Early days ===\nIn October 1998 : Publication in ''<nowiki>''</nowiki>[[:fr:Qu\u00e9bec Science|Qu\u00e9bec Science]]<nowiki>''</nowiki>'' magazine of \"Comment informatiser intelligemment les \u00e9coles\" (How to put information technology in schools in a smart way) by [[Jean-Claude Gu\u00e9don]]. \"This article stroke Alexis Kauffmann so much, we can consider it led to the creation of Framasoft\".\n\nIn November 2001 is the official birthdate of the Framasoft website, first one of the network, created by mathematic teacher Alexis Kauffmann. The name comes from \"Framanet\" (for FRench and MAthematics on an intraNET), an educational project made with Caroline d'Atabekian, a literature teacher, within a [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] middleschool. Framasoft began as a software section of this project, before getting its independence, acting as a free software directory for Windows.\n\nIn June 2002, Framasoft and [[:fr:Association francophone des utilisateurs de logiciels libres|AFUL]] start the campaign \u00ab Lib\u00e9rons les logiciels \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole \u00bb (\"Let's free softwares at school\"). In September 2002, the website includes tutorials and an open forum.\n\nIn {{date|July 2003}}, the website is closed due to bandwidth overload on the shared host Amen. The website receives widespread support {{sfn|Piquard|2003}} and Amen became a partner of Framasoft, offering new hosting possibilities .{{sfn|Goncalves|2003}}\n\n=== As an association ===\n\nIn {{date|January 2004}}, Framasoft evolves with the creation of the [[Framasoft Association]]{{{sfn|Rousseaux|2013}}},.<ref>[http://www.journal-officiel.gouv.fr/association/index.php?ACTION=Research&HI_PAGE=1&HI_COMPTEUR=0&original_method=get&WHAT=Framasoft Creation of the Framasoft Association] in the [[Government gazette|Government Gazette of the French Republic]].</ref> The directory drops [[Freeware]] and is no longer restricted to Windows software. It became a collaborative project written by Thomas C\u00e9zard, Simon Leblanc, Paul Lunetta, Rui Nibau and Georges Silva. Subsequently, in {{date|February 2004}}, birth of the Framagora forum administered by Thierry Bernard.\n\nIn {{date|March 2005}}, French translation of [[OpenCD|TheOpenCD]] 2.0, a CD compilation of free software on Windows. Published in a special page of the magazine [[:fr:Freelog]] in June, the CD will also be shipped on the Ikarios mail order site of [[:fr:Nat Makarevitch]]. {{date|August 2005-}} sees the publication of the first version of Framakey {{sfn|Rocard|2005}} and the creation of an associated site by Pierre-Yves Gosset. In {{date|December 2005-}}, Framagora experiences a peak in traffic by becoming the main forum for monitoring enforcement of the [[Copyright and related rights in the information society|DADVSI]] law.\n\nIn February 2007, the second book of the Framabook collection is published: \"Simple like Ubuntu 6.10\" by Didier Roche, which will later be reedited and updated. In June 2007, Framasoft receives the \"Lut\u00e8ce d'Or\" for \"the best conducted community action\" during the event Paris Capitale du Libre. In August 2007, Framasoft added AdSense to its website, after a Framablog post reporting financial difficulties to host the network.\n\nIn January 2008, a third book in the Framabook's collection is published : ''Spip pratique 1.9'', by Perline followed in March 2008 by Change for OpenOffice.org, a translation coordinated by Johann Bulteau (alias Yostral). According to [[French Wikipedia|fr:Wikio]] in June 2008, the Framablog article ''Firefox : and 1, and 2, and 3.0 !'' has been the most cited article of the month in the French speaking [[blogosphere]].\n\nIn {{date|January 2009}}, Framasoft set up a support website dedicated to collect donations and testimonies. {{date|February 2009|}} sees the official birth of the Framatube video project. In {{date|march 2009|}}, the Framakey adds some  portable web applications, the \u00ab WebApps \u00bb, to its catalogue. In the month of May 2009, the sixth book of the Framabook collection is published : it is a [[Comics|comic]] called ''Geekscottes - 1. PATH, le chemin'' by Nojhan. In the meantime, a booklet S\u00e9samath is distributed in all French's high schools, containing a double-spread about free software and Framasoft and the Framadvd DVD. Another distribution the year after was set by masters students in multimedia and communications at [[Panth\u00e9on-Assas University]].{{sfn|Rees|2009}} In {{date|June 2009|}}, Framablog occupies the first position in the Wikio ranking of French blogs in the \"Free Software\" category.\n\nIn January 2010, while the Framapack project is online, the documentary [[:fr:Richard Stallman et la r\u00e9volution du logiciel libre|Richard Stallman et la r\u00e9volution du logiciel libre]] is published. For the occasion, [[:fr:Eyrolles|\u00e9ditions Eyrolles]]<nowiki/>organize in Paris a meeting with [[Richard Stallman]]. In May 2010, Framasoft demonstrates to defend free software against the censorship of the exhibition \u00ab true exhib talking about the false \u00bb about counterfeiting, at [[Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie|Cit\u00e9 des sciences et de l'industrie]]. In October 2010, the association starts supporting financially the campaign \u00ab 1000 10 1 \u00bb to find 1000 patreons to contribute at 10 euros by month for one year. Framadvd school version was also published during that time, a project lead by Cyrille Largillier.\nIn January 2011, a new publication appeared in the Framabook collection called ''Produire du logiciel libre'' by [[Karl Fogel]], as a collaborative translation. In March 2011, the project Framapad is online, followed in June 2011 by Framadate. In July 2011, publication of the cartoon ''GKND tome 2 : Le GNU du risque'' by Simon Giraudot in the Framabook's collection. Framasoft celebrates its 10 years with a radio show Place de la toile on [[France Culture]] in November 2011.\n\nIn February 2012, start the support campaign \u00ab Liberty Pack \u00bb with [[:fr:April (association)|April]], Framasoft and [[La Quadrature du Net]]. In October 2012, the first novel of the Framabook's collection is out ''#Smartarded - Le cycle des No\u00e9Nautes, I'' by Pouhiou. It also sees the release of the projets Framacalc, Framindmap, and Framavectoriel. In November 2012, Framasoft launch its 2013 support campaign and put online the Framazic project. In December 2012, launch of \u00ab Liberty Pack 2 \u00bb, new support campaign shared with April and La quadrature du Net.\n\nIn January 2013, Framasoft joins other organisations such as [[:fr:Savoirscom1|Savoirscom1]], [[:fr:Regards Citoyens|Regards citoyens]] or the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] France to refuse privatisation of [[Public domain|domaine public]] by the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]]. April 2013 sees an update of Framasoft main welcome page, then in September 2013, Framasoft announces its support to the \u00ab Romaine Lubrique \u00bb's project about public domain cultural valuation.\n\n=== De-google-ify Internet ===\n\nIn {{date|june 2014}}, a crowdfunding campaign allowed Framasoft to add new features to [https://framasphere.org Framapad],{{sfn|G\u00e9vaudan|2014}} followed in {{date|october 2014}} by the launch of the \"De-google-ify Internet\" campaign {{sfn|G\u00e9vaudan (2)|2014}} (D\u00e9googlisons Internet in French).  The association has launched its own social media too: [https://framasphere.org Framasph\u00e8re].\n\nIn {{date|march 2015}}, a new functionality was added to Framapad to avoid flooding servers with unused text. It became also possible to choose the data conservation time. In the meantime, the association developed a picture sharing tool (FramaPic) and an URL shortener (Huit.re / frama.link). Framasoft also took the opportunity to start their own code body hosting called [[Forge (software)|Forge]]. In May 2015, Framasoft started a new [[Web search engine]] service (Framabee), in order to continue demonstrating that alternatives to Google are possible.\n\nIn {{date|october 2016}}, phase 2 of the De-google-ify campaign started and lead into the release of 6 new services:\n* Framalistes: managing mailing lists\n* Framanotes: dealing with all sorts of contents\n* Framaforms: managing forms\n* Framatalk: audio/video chat\n* Framagenda: creating public or private calendars\n\n== The organization of the network ==\nThe '''[[Association loi de 1901|association]]''' \"Framasoft\" was founded in January 2004, about 3 years after first the publication of the web site.\n\nSince Framasoft was becoming a large collaborative project, it became necessary to provide all the technical parts of a growing network, like ownership of [[domain name]]s associated with a moral person, to accompany projects in a coherent way so they are part of a whole (starting with guarantee the open-source and free nature of the created resources) and also to represent Framasoft through more and more interventions in the field.\n\nThis association aims \"to promote and disseminate the free culture and especially the open-source software culture\". The founding is mainly based upon [[gift economy]] from users, collected through the Internet.\n\nThe association take part in many events, whether while giving conferences, or having a place, for example during the [[:fr:Rencontres mondiales du logiciel libre|Rencontres mondiales du logiciel libre]] (''<nowiki>''RMLL''</nowiki>'', from 2004 until 2014), the first \"Rencontres mondiales d\u00e9centralis\u00e9es du logiciel libre\" in\u00a0[[Saint-Joseph, R\u00e9union|Saint-Joseph]] on the [[R\u00e9union|island of R\u00e9union]] (from 2006 until 2014), \"Paris Capitale du Libre\" (from 2006 until 2008), the \"Salon de l'\u00c9ducation\"(from 2004 until 2006), the [[F\u00eate de l'Humanit\u00e9]] (from 2004 until 2009, and 2014) and also during many [[Installfest|Install parties]] et local \"Freeware Day\" organized by [[Linux user group|GULL]], like \"Ubuntu Party\" in Paris (from 2008 until 2011) and in Toulouse (from 2009 to 2010) or like JDLL in Lyon (from 2007 until 2010).\n\nThe association is a member of the [[:fr:April (association)|April]], of [[Wikimedia France]] and of the association of French-speaking freeware users [[:fr:Association francophone des utilisateurs de logiciels libres|AFUL]]. It collaborates with websites like\u00a0[[Linuxfr]], [[La Quadrature du Net]], the [[Tristan Nitot]] Standblog or the [[:fr:Format ouvert|formats ouverts]]'s blog about open formats by Thierry St\u0153hr.

Retrieved 26 Oct 2014.</ref> is a cross or [[crucifix]], especially the large [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifix]] set above the entrance to the [[chancel]] of a [[medieval]] church.<ref>\nCurl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, p. 658. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.\n</ref>\nAlternatively, it is a large sculpture or painting of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]].\n\n== Derivation ==\n''Rood'' is an archaic word for ''pole'', from [[Old English]] r\u014dd \"pole\", specifically \"[[cross]]\", from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*rodo'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''r\u014dda'', [[Old High German]] ''ruoda'' \"rod\".<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Rood\"</ref>\n\n''Rood'' was originally the only Old English word for the instrument of [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[crucifixion|death]]. The words ''cr\u00fac'' and in the North ''cros'' (from either [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Norse]]) appeared by late Old English; \"crucifix\" is first recorded in English in the [[Ancrene Wisse]] of about 1225.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Cross\", and \"Crucifix\"</ref> More precisely, the Rood or [[Holyrood (cross)|Holyrood]] was the [[True Cross]], the specific wooden cross used in Christ's crucifixion. The word remains in use in some names, such as [[Holyrood Palace]] and the [[Anglo-Saxon literature|Old English poem]] ''[[Dream of the Rood|The Dream of the Rood]]''. The phrase \"by the rood\" was used in [[oath|swearing]], e.g. \"No, by the rood, not so\" in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Act 3, Scene 4).\n\nThe alternative term ''triumphal cross'' ({{lang-la|crux triumphalis}}, {{lang-de|Triumphkreuz}}), which is more usual in Europe, signifies the triumph that the resurrected [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (''[[Christ]]us triumphans'') won over death.<ref>Margarete Luise Goecke-Seischab / J\u00f6rg Ohlemacher: ''Kirchen erkunden, Kirchen erschlie\u00dfen'', Ernst Kaufmann, Lahr 1998, p. 232</ref>\n\n[[File:Gotland-Stenkumla-Kirche 09.jpg|thumb|The 800-year-old cross in the Church of Stenkumla on [[Gotland]] shows the origin of the name ''Christus triumphans'': the crucified figure wears a crown and \"shoes\".]]\n\n== Position ==\nIn [[church architecture]] the rood, or rood cross, is a life-sized crucifix displayed on the central axis of a church, normally at the [[chancel]] arch.  The earliest roods hung from the top of the chancel arch (rood arch), or rested on a plain \"rood beam\" across it, usually at the level of the capitals of the columns. This original arrangement is still found in many churches in Germany and Scandinavia, although many other surviving crosses now hang on walls.\n\nIf the choir is separated from the church interior by a [[rood screen]], the rood cross is placed on, or more rarely in front of, the screen.<ref>E.g. in the abbey church of Wechselburg</ref><ref>In England the name \"rood screen\" indicates that there is a (monumental) cross, even if the original cross has not survived.</ref> Under the rood is usually the altar of the Holy Cross.\n\n== History ==\nNumerous near life-size crucifixes survive from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period or earlier, with the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne Cathedral]] (AD 965\u2013970) and the [[Volto Santo of Lucca]] the best known. The prototype may have been one known to have been set up in [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], apparently in gold foil worked over a wooden core in the manner of the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]],<ref>Schiller, 141\u2013146</ref> though figureless jeweled gold crosses are recorded in similar positions in [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]] in the 5th century. Many figures in precious metal are recorded in [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] monastic records, though none now survive.  Notables sometimes gave their crowns ([[Cnut the Great]] at [[Winchester Cathedral]]), necklaces ([[Lady Godiva]] to the Virgin accompanying the rood at [[Evesham Abbey]]), or swords ([[Tovi the Proud]], [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]]) to decorate them.<ref>Dodwell, 210\u2013215</ref>  The original location and support for the surviving figures is often unclear but a number of northern European churches preserve the original setting in full \u2014 they are known as a ''{{lang|de|Triumphkreuz}}'' in German, from the \"triumphal arch\" (or \"chancel arch\") of Early Christian architecture.  As in later examples the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]] and [[John the Apostle|Saint John]] often flank the cross, and [[cherubim]] and other figures are sometimes seen.  A gilt rood in the 10th-century [[Mainz Cathedral]] was only placed on a beam on special [[feast day]]s.<ref>Schiller, 140</ref>\n\n== Components ==\n[[File:France Albi jube cathedrale.jpg|thumb|Rood cross on [[rood screen]] at [[Albi Cathedral]], France]]\n\n=== Image of Christ ===\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] era the crucified Christ was presented as ruler and judge. Instead of a crown of thorns he wears a crown or a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], on his feet he wears \"shoes\" as a sign of the ruler. He is victorious over death. His feet are parallel to each other on the wooden support (\"Four nail type\") and not one on top of the other.<ref>Torsten Droste: Romanische Kunst in Frankreich, DuMont Kunstreisef\u00fchrer, Cologne, 1992(2), pp. 32f</ref> The [[perizoma (loincloth)]] is highly stylized and falls in vertical folds.\n\nIn the transition to the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style, the triumphant Christ becomes suffering Christ, the pitiful Man of Sorrows. Instead of the ruler's crown, he wears the [[crown of thorns]], his feet are placed one above the other and are pierced with a single nail. His facial expression and posture express his pain. The wounds of the body are often dramatically portrayed. The loincloth is no longer so clearly stylized. The attendant figures Mary and John show signs of grief.<ref>Formen der Kunst. Teil II. Die Kunst im Mittelalter, bearbeitet von Wilhelm Drixelius, Verlag M. Lurz, Munich, o.J. p. 71 and p. 88</ref>\n\n=== Attendant figures ===\nA triumphal cross may be surrounded by a group of people. These people may include Mary and John, the \"beloved disciple\" (based on [[John's Gospel]] ({{Bibleverse|John|19:25-27|NIV}}, {{Bibleverse|Matthew|27:25f|NIV}}, {{Bibleverse|Mark|15;40f|NIV}} and {{Bibleverse|Luke|23:49|NIV}})), but also apostles, angels and the benefactor.\n\n* The triumphal cross of [[\u00d6ja Church]] in [[\u00d6ja, Gotland|\u00d6ja]] on [[Gotland]] stands on a transverse beam beneath the triumphal arch and is flanked by two people: Mary and John.\n* The triumphal cross in the [[Wechselburg Abbey|abbey church of Wechselburg]] stands in an elevated position on the rood screen and also has the same pair of attendant figures.\n* The [[Schwerin Cathedral#Triumphal cross|triumphal cross in Schwerin Cathedral]] is also flanked by Mary and John. At the end of the cross' beam the Evangelist's symbols may be seen.\n* In [[St. Mary's Church, Osnabr\u00fcck|St. Mary's Church in Osnabr\u00fcck]] there are only the empty stone pedestals of the attendant figures.\n* The triumphal cross above the screen in Halberstadt Cathedral is not flanked by Mary and John, but by two angels.\n* On the supporting beam of the [[L\u00fcbeck Cathedral#Triumphal cross|triumphal cross in L\u00fcbeck Cathedral]] there is also a bishop, presumably the benefactor of the cross.\n\n=== Rood screens ===\n[[Rood screen]]s developed in the 13th century as wooden or stone [[Rood screen|screens]], usually separating the [[chancel]] or [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] from the [[nave]], upon which the rood now stood. The screen may be elaborately carved and was often richly painted and [[gilding|gilded]]. Rood screens were found in Christian churches in most parts of Europe by the end of the Middle Ages, though in Catholic countries the great majority were gradually removed after the [[Council of Trent]], and most were removed or drastically cut down in areas controlled by [[Calvinist]]s and [[Anglicans]]. The best medieval examples are now mostly in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] countries such as Germany and Scandinavia, where they were often left undisturbed in country churches.\n\nRood screens are the Western equivalent of the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[templon]] beam, which developed into the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[iconostasis]]. Some rood screens incorporate a rood loft, a narrow [[balcony|gallery]] or just flat walkway which could be used to clean or decorate the rood or cover it up in [[Lent]], or in larger examples by singers or musicians. An alternative type of screen is the [[Pulpitum]], as seen in [[Exeter Cathedral]], which is near the main altar of the church.\n\nThe rood provided a focus for worship, most especially in [[Holy Week]], when worship was highly elaborate. During [[Lent]] the rood was veiled; on [[Palm Sunday]] it was revealed before the procession of palms and the congregation knelt before it.

Retrieved 26 Oct 2014.</ref> is a cross or [[crucifix]], especially the large [[crucifixion of Jesus| Crucifixion]] set above the entrance to the [[chancel]] of a [[medieval]] church.<ref>\nCurl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, p. 658. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.\n</ref>\nAlternatively, it is a large sculpture or painting of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]].\n\n== Derivation ==\n''Rood'' is an archaic word for ''pole'', from [[Old English]] r\u014dd \"pole\", specifically \"[[cross]]\", from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*rodo'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''r\u014dda'', [[Old High German]] ''ruoda'' \"rod\".<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Rood\"</ref>\n\n''Rood'' was originally the only Old English word for the instrument of [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[crucifixion|death]]. The words ''cr\u00fac'' and in the North ''cros'' (from either [[Old Irish]] or [[Old Norse]]) appeared by late Old English; \"crucifix\" is first recorded in English in the [[Ancrene Wisse]] of about 1225.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Cross\", and \"Crucifix\"</ref> More precisely, the Rood or [[Holyrood (cross)|Holyrood]] was the [[True Cross]], the specific wooden cross used in Christ's crucifixion. The word remains in use in some names, such as [[Holyrood Palace]] and the [[Anglo-Saxon literature|Old English poem]] ''[[Dream of the Rood|The Dream of the Rood]]''. The phrase \"by the rood\" was used in [[oath|swearing]], e.g. \"No, by the rood, not so\" in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' (Act 3, Scene 4).\n\nThe alternative term ''triumphal cross'' ({{lang-la|crux triumphalis}}, {{lang-de|Triumphkreuz}}), which is more usual in Europe, signifies the triumph that the resurrected [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] (''[[Christ]]us triumphans'') won over death.<ref>Margarete Luise Goecke-Seischab / J\u00f6rg Ohlemacher: ''Kirchen erkunden, Kirchen erschlie\u00dfen'', Ernst Kaufmann, Lahr 1998, p. 232</ref>\n\n[[File:Gotland-Stenkumla-Kirche 09.jpg|thumb|The 800-year-old cross in the Church of Stenkumla on [[Gotland]] shows the origin of the name ''Christus triumphans'': the crucified figure wears a crown and \"shoes\".]]\n\n== Position ==\nIn [[church architecture]] the rood, or rood cross, is a life-sized crucifix displayed on the central axis of a church, normally at the [[chancel]] arch.  The earliest roods hung from the top of the chancel arch (rood arch), or rested on a plain \"rood beam\" across it, usually at the level of the capitals of the columns. This original arrangement is still found in many churches in Germany and Scandinavia, although many other surviving crosses now hang on walls.\n\nIf the choir is separated from the church interior by a [[rood screen]], the rood cross is placed on, or more rarely in front of, the screen.<ref>E.g. in the abbey church of Wechselburg</ref><ref>In England the name \"rood screen\" indicates that there is a (monumental) cross, even if the original cross has not survived.</ref> Under the rood is usually the altar of the Holy Cross.\n\n== History ==\nNumerous near life-size crucifixes survive from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period or earlier, with the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne Cathedral]] (AD 965\u2013970) and the [[Volto Santo of Lucca]] the best known. The prototype may have been one known to have been set up in [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], apparently in gold foil worked over a wooden core in the manner of the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]],<ref>Schiller, 141\u2013146</ref> though figureless jeweled gold crosses are recorded in similar positions in [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]] in the 5th century. Many figures in precious metal are recorded in [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] monastic records, though none now survive.  Notables sometimes gave their crowns ([[Cnut the Great]] at [[Winchester Cathedral]]), necklaces ([[Lady Godiva]] to the Virgin accompanying the rood at [[Evesham Abbey]]), or swords ([[Tovi the Proud]], [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]]) to decorate them.<ref>Dodwell, 210\u2013215</ref>  The original location and support for the surviving figures is often unclear but a number of northern European churches preserve the original setting in full \u2014 they are known as a ''{{lang|de|Triumphkreuz}}'' in German, from the \"triumphal arch\" (or \"chancel arch\") of Early Christian architecture.  As in later examples the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]] and [[John the Apostle|Saint John]] often flank the cross, and [[cherubim]] and other figures are sometimes seen.  A gilt rood in the 10th-century [[Mainz Cathedral]] was only placed on a beam on special [[feast day]]s.<ref>Schiller, 140</ref>\n\n== Components ==\n[[File:France Albi jube cathedrale.jpg|thumb|Rood cross on [[rood screen]] at [[Albi Cathedral]], France]]\n\n=== Image of Christ ===\nIn the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] era the crucified Christ was presented as ruler and judge. Instead of a crown of thorns he wears a crown or a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], on his feet he wears \"shoes\" as a sign of the ruler. He is victorious over death. His feet are parallel to each other on the wooden support (\"Four nail type\") and not one on top of the other.<ref>Torsten Droste: Romanische Kunst in Frankreich, DuMont Kunstreisef\u00fchrer, Cologne, 1992(2), pp. 32f</ref> The [[perizoma (loincloth)]] is highly stylized and falls in vertical folds.\n\nIn the transition to the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] style, the triumphant Christ becomes suffering Christ, the pitiful Man of Sorrows. Instead of the ruler's crown, he wears the [[crown of thorns]], his feet are placed one above the other and are pierced with a single nail. His facial expression and posture express his pain. The wounds of the body are often dramatically portrayed. The loincloth is no longer so clearly stylized. The attendant figures Mary and John show signs of grief.<ref>Formen der Kunst. Teil II. Die Kunst im Mittelalter, bearbeitet von Wilhelm Drixelius, Verlag M. Lurz, Munich, o.J. p. 71 and p. 88</ref>\n\n=== Attendant figures ===\nA triumphal cross may be surrounded by a group of people. These people may include Mary and John, the \"beloved disciple\" (based on [[John's Gospel]] ({{Bibleverse|John|19:25-27|NIV}}, {{Bibleverse|Matthew|27:25f|NIV}}, {{Bibleverse|Mark|15;40f|NIV}} and {{Bibleverse|Luke|23:49|NIV}})), but also apostles, angels and the benefactor.\n\n* The triumphal cross of [[\u00d6ja Church]] in [[\u00d6ja, Gotland|\u00d6ja]] on [[Gotland]] stands on a transverse beam beneath the triumphal arch and is flanked by two people: Mary and John.\n* The triumphal cross in the [[Wechselburg Abbey|abbey church of Wechselburg]] stands in an elevated position on the rood screen and also has the same pair of attendant figures.\n* The [[Schwerin Cathedral#Triumphal cross|triumphal cross in Schwerin Cathedral]] is also flanked by Mary and John. At the end of the cross' beam the Evangelist's symbols may be seen.\n* In [[St. Mary's Church, Osnabr\u00fcck|St. Mary's Church in Osnabr\u00fcck]] there are only the empty stone pedestals of the attendant figures.\n* The triumphal cross above the screen in Halberstadt Cathedral is not flanked by Mary and John, but by two angels.\n* On the supporting beam of the [[L\u00fcbeck Cathedral#Triumphal cross|triumphal cross in L\u00fcbeck Cathedral]] there is also a bishop, presumably the benefactor of the cross.\n\n=== Rood screens ===\n[[Rood screen]]s developed in the 13th century as wooden or stone [[Rood screen|screens]], usually separating the [[chancel]] or [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] from the [[nave]], upon which the rood now stood. The screen may be elaborately carved and was often richly painted and [[gilding|gilded]]. Rood screens were found in Christian churches in most parts of Europe by the end of the Middle Ages, though in Catholic countries the great majority were gradually removed after the [[Council of Trent]], and most were removed or drastically cut down in areas controlled by [[Calvinist]]s and [[Anglicans]]. The best medieval examples are now mostly in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] countries such as Germany and Scandinavia, where they were often left undisturbed in country churches.\n\nRood screens are the Western equivalent of the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[templon]] beam, which developed into the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[iconostasis]]. Some rood screens incorporate a rood loft, a narrow [[balcony|gallery]] or just flat walkway which could be used to clean or decorate the rood or cover it up in [[Lent]], or in larger examples by singers or musicians. An alternative type of screen is the [[Pulpitum]], as seen in [[Exeter Cathedral]], which is near the main altar of the church.\n\nThe rood provided a focus for worship, most especially in [[Holy Week]], when worship was highly elaborate. During [[Lent]] the rood was veiled; on [[Palm Sunday]] it was revealed before the procession of palms and the congregation knelt before it. The whole [[Passion of Christ|Passion]] story would then be read from the rood loft, at the foot of the [[crucifix]], by three ministers.\n\nNo original medieval rood has survived in a church in the United Kingdom.<ref>Duffy, 1992, page not cited</ref> Most were deliberately destroyed as acts of [[Iconoclasm#Reformation iconoclasm|iconoclasm]] during the [[English Reformation]] and the [[English Civil War]], when many rood screens were also removed. Today, in many British churches, the \"rood stair\" that gave access to the gallery is often the only remaining sign of the former rood screen and rood loft.\n\nIn the 19th century, under the influence of the [[Oxford Movement]], roods and screens were again added to many Anglican churches.\n\n== Representative examples ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Mg-k_d1102279_Linde-Triumphkruzifix.jpg|Cross from [[Linde Church]] on [[Gotland]] (today in the [[Swedish History Museum]]) also displays the symbol of a ruler, demonstrating the origin of the name.\nFile:Triumphkreuz2.jpg|Triumphal cross of Notke in [[L\u00fcbeck Cathedral]]\nFile:Bad Doberan - Kreuz im Bad Doberaner M\u00fcnster (Christusseite).jpg|Triumphal cross (Christ's side) in [[Doberan Minster]]\nFile:Soest130811hohnekirscheib.jpg|The \"plate cross\" (''Scheibenkreuz'') in St. Mary's (''Hohnekirche'') in [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] (around 1200)\nFile:Merzig StPeter Chor.jpg|[[Forked cross]] in [[St. Peter's Church, Merzig|St. Peter's]] at [[Merzig]]\nKaysersberg SteCroix29.JPG|Triumphal cross in the [[\u00c9glise Sainte-Croix, Kaysersberg|Holy Cross Church]] in [[Kaysersberg]] (late 15th-century)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Germany ===\n\n* the [[Gero Cross]] in [[Cologne Cathedral]]\n* the [[Ottonian Cross]] in [[St. Peter und Alexander (Aschaffenburg)|Kollegiatskirche St. Peter und Alexander]], Aschaffenburg\n* the Helmstedt Cross in the treasure chamber of [[Werden Abbey]]\n* the triumphal cross in [[L\u00fcbeck Cathedral]] from the workshop of [[Bernt Notke]], 1477, height 17 m\n* in [[St. Catherine's Church, L\u00fcbeck]], around 1450\n* in [[Halberstadt Cathedral]]\n* in [[Wechselburg Abbey]], Holy Cross [[basilica]] \n* in [[Naumburg Cathedral]]\n* in [[Doberan Minster]]\n* in [[Schwerin Cathedral]] (from [[St. Mary's Church, Wismar|St. Mary's, Wismar]])\n* in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] in [[St. Mary's, Osnabr\u00fcck|St. Mary's]] and in [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Osnabr\u00fcck|St. Peter's Cathedral]]\n* in [[Alfeld (Leine)]] in St. Nicholas' Church, around 1250\n* in [[Dinslaken]], [http://www.katholische-kirche-dinslaken.de/sankt-vincentius/ St. Vincent] around 1310\n\n=== Sweden ===\n* On [[Gotland]] in several of the medieval churches, including [[Alskog Church|Alskog]], [[Alva Church|Alva]], [[Bro Church, Gotland|Bro]], Fide, [[Fr\u00f6jel Church|Fr\u00f6jel]], [[Gr\u00f6tlingbo Church|Gr\u00f6tlingbo]], Hamra, [[Hemse Church|Hemse]], [[Klinte Church|Klinte]], [[Lye Church|Lye]], [[\u00d6ja Church|\u00d6ja]], Rute, Stenkumla and [[Stenkyrka Church|Stenkyrka]].

The diethylmethylamine produced by the reaction is a typical organic tertiary amine which have the same characteristic as other amine. This was obtained from the experiment results. Since in this reaction, diethylmethylamine is an additional product which only have a little amount, the industrial production may use other reaction.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Class|first=J.B.|title=Production of diethylemthylamine|publisher=United States Patent Office|year=1960|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\nBasic properties like density and melting point are shown in the information box. The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results. The results of the regular coordinate analysis indicated there were four conformers, and the [[diffraction]] data showed the conformation of diethylmethylamine is 35 (14)% tt + 27 (14)% g<sup>+</sup>t + 20 (17)% g<sup>-</sup>t (gauche<sup>-</sup>-trans conformer) + 18 (23)% g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup>(gauche<sup>+</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer). To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it. The first one is indeed pyramidal inversion, and the second is the isolated rotation of nitrogen carbon bond. From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]]. Also, the result indicates there were several \" familiars\" of [[rotamer]]s exist in diethylmethylamine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushweller|first=C.H.|last2=Fleischman|first2=S.P.|last3=Grady|first3=G.L.|last4=McGoff|first4=P.|last5=Rithner|first5=C.D.|last6=Whalon|first6=M.R.|last7=Brennan|first7=J.G.|last8=Marcantonio|first8=R.P.|last9=Dominigue|first9=R.P.|date=1982-11-01|title=Stereodynamics of diethylmethylamine and triethylamine|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=104|issue=23|pages=6224\u20136236|doi=10.1021/ja00387a012}}</ref>\n\n=== Rotation inversion ===\nRotation is part of the conformational isomer, so study the rotational isomer help the scientists to understand the chemical better. Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always plays a role in extraction reactions due to its characteristics.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion. Although it's common to use polymers on the surface of metal to prevent it from corrosive things, the interfacial bonding mechanisms between them are not understandable yet. Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing. The potential-time respond showed, the potential maintained constant for both unrinsed and rinsed sample. Further test by [[Attenuated total reflectance|ATR-FTIR]] about the iron surface indicated through the reaction all molecular compound still remains the same as original.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=P.|last2=Terryn|first2=H.|last3=Mol|first3=J.M.C.|date=2015-11-01|title=An in situ study of amine and amide molecular interaction on Fe surfaces|journal=Applied Surface Science|volume=354|pages=242\u2013249|doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2015.08.042|bibcode=2015ApSS..354..242T|issn=0169-4332}}</ref>\n\n=== Substrate of trimethylamine dehydrogenase half reaction ===\n[[Trimethylamine dehydrogenase]] is an enzyme which used as catalyst in [[chemical reaction]]. Since it's enzyme, a substrate is needed to study the reductive half-reaction of trimethylamine dehydrogenase. If using [[trimethylamine]] as a substrate, it is hard to characterize the substrate concentration and pH dependence in detail. Diethylmethylamine has similar characteristic with trimethylamine but react slower than trimethylamine.

The properties also contained part that need be discussed in micro level. Since diethylmethylamine is a polymer, it can have several isomers, the structural of the molecular is always focused.\n\n===Molecular structure and conformation===\nDue to the rotation of a single bond, [[Conformational isomerism|conformational isomers]] are formed. Conformational isomers have the same structural formula but different characteristic. This has always been interested by the scientist. In 1978, Crocker and Goggin had experimented on determined the conformation of diethylmethylamine. They used [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectra]] on diethylmethylamine in the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Results showed two conformers exist in the solid phase and can be determined as tt (trans-trans conformer) and g<sup>+</sup>t (gauche<sup>+</sup>-trans conformer). Because of the complexity of the vapor spectrum, they can only infer there are two or more conformers that exist in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Christopher|last2=Goggin|first2=Peter L.|date=1978|title=Infrared and Raman spectroscopic studies of conformations in liquid and solid triethyl-, diethyl(methyl)- and ethyldimethyl-amines, -phosphines, and -arsines|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Dalton Transactions|issue=5|pages=388|doi=10.1039/dt9780000388|issn=0300-9246}}</ref>\n\nPresent studies used gas-phase IR spectra and FT-Raman spectra of the liquid to get more detailed results.

To confirm the result, a [[Vibrational analysis with scanning probe microscopy|vibrational analysis]] of hydrocarbon analog in the liquid phase was done, and it identified the conformers were the same as diffraction data showed. Moreover, tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers were found more stable than the other two. The conformational stability of diethylmethylamine can be explained by the numbers of trans CNCC fragment that two fragments of tt and g<sup>+</sup>t conformers trans conformation and one fragment of g<sup>-</sup>t and g<sup>+</sup>g<sup>+</sup> conformers trans conformation. Further study showed the reason why diethylmethylamine did't have a g<sup>-</sup>g<sup>+</sup> (gauche<sup>-</sup>-gauche<sup>+</sup> conformer) conformer that is the steric repulsion between terminal methyl groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Hiroshi|last2=Ito|first2=Masaki|last3=Egawa|first3=Toru|date=2007-09-17|title=Molecular structure and conformation of diethylmethylamine determined by gas electron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations|journal=Journal of Molecular Structure|volume=840|issue=1\u20133|pages=107\u2013113|doi=10.1016/j.molstruc.2006.11.027|bibcode=2007JMoSt.840..107T|hdl=2115/28245|issn=0022-2860}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereodynamics (dynamics of stereochemical reaction) of N,N-diethylmethylamine ===\ndiethylmethylamine is the simplest trialkylamine that can be tested with two processes about the nitrogen atom in it.

From these two processes, the <sup>1</sup>H dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy obtained clear evidence for nitrogen [[pyramidal inversion]].

Rotation study of diethylmethylamine was done by Bushweller and Laurenzi. From the research image of <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine at 200 K, ethyl group shows a A<sub>2</sub> X<sub>3</sub> spectrum and N-methyl protons shows a [[singlet]]. Two resonances can be tested in temperature range 140 K to 200 K---N-methyl and C-methyl resonances and they are independent. The result of DNMR also indicated, the slow nitrogen inversion in diethylmethylamine was caused by the coalescence phenomenon connected with CH<sub>2</sub> resonance. The nitrogen inversion process in diethylmethylamine contained not only the inversion of nitrogen but also rotation about the C-N bond, which can be named as inversion rotation. Inversion rotation means nitrogen inversion always occur with rotation about the C-N bond. Other studies found out that at low temperature (99 K), the <sup>1</sup>H DNMR spectrum of diethylmethylamine has more change. At 99 K, N-methyl and C-methyl resonance separate into more peaks. Two important things need to be mentioned. First, peaks of the N-methyl in diethylmethylamine can be assumed as broad singlets. Second, the C-methyl resonance can be assumed as equivalent for all three methyl protons.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bushweller|first=C.

In research, it can be the lineshape standard of the NMR test. In industry, it always plays a role in extraction reactions due to its characteristics.\n\n=== Lineshape standard of nuclear magnetic resonance experiment ===\nFor an [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) experiment, the most important thing is to make sure the existence of narrow peak and maximum sensitivity, which can be achieved by adjusting shimming field to enhance the [[magnetic field]] homogeneity. A typically used sample is not very useful during low temperature (150 K) experiments, because the peak showed will broaden. Since no available samples can use in low temperature experiments, many tests were done under the condition that the researchers assume the field condition was the same for both low-temperature terms and room temperature conditions. This will influence the NMR result since the change in inhomogeneity is hard to notice. There were research shows in some instrument, re-shimming the field after changing temperature could improve the homogeneity. So, something is a liquid at standard temperature, and pressure has a low melting point is needed.\n\nN, N-diethylmethylamine was used to experiment. As the experimental results show, diethylmethylamine is useful in shimming magnetic field around 140 K. With other research, diethylmethylamine can be used in shimming the magnetic field at room temperature in NMR experiments and low temperature in dynamic nuclear polarization experiments. diethylmethylamine was very useful around 140 K; however, many low-temperature experiments need to proceed below 140 K. Future research need to focus on finding efficiency substitute of diethylmethylamine to work in experiments below 140 K. For now, diethylmethylamine is the best choice among all substances for low-temperature NMR experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritzsching|first=Keith J.|last2=Itin|first2=Boris|last3=McDermott|first3=Ann E.|date=2018-02-21|title=N,N-Diethylmethylamine as lineshape standard for NMR above 130\u202fK|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=287|pages=110\u2013112|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2017.12.021|pmid=29335163|pmc=5821130|bibcode=2018JMagR.287..110F|issn=1090-7807}}</ref>\n\n=== Extraction of oil sand with microemulsions===\n[[Oil sands|Tar sand]] is an important source of petroleum, which contain 60 percent of the petroleum around the world. Extracting oil from tar sand has become an important part for nowadays industry. One way to extract oil is by using [[microemulsion]]s which are a mixture of oil, water and [[surfactant]]. Extracting oil sand with microemulsions, an important step is to decentralize the light hydrocarbons in the aqueous medium. Usually, alcohols are used as cosurfactants in the microemulsions. A good cosurfactants has two conditions which are strong acid-base type interaction with water and good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance. However, some studies showed that diethylmethylamine is a more effective cosurfactants in water than commonly used alcohol. Experimental results indicated that a system based on diethylmethylamine and system based on simple alcohols have a similar feature in microemulsions. The result also pointed out diethylmethylamine reacts as medium chain length alcohols, which has both good hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance and high solubility in water and many types of oil. However, this property causes diethylmethylamine has high efficiency and low specificity on nature and temperature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Desnoyers|first=Jacques E.|last2=Quirion|first2=Fran\u00e7ois|last3=H\u00c9Tu|first3=Daniel|last4=Perron|first4=G\u00c9Rald|date=1983|title=Tar sand extractions with microemulsions: I-the dissolution of light hydrocarbons by microemulsions using 2-butoxyethanol and diethylmethylamine as cosurfactants|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=61|issue=5|pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1002/cjce.5450610509|issn=0008-4034}}</ref>\n\n=== Extractive crystallization ===\nExtractive crystallization is a way to obtain crystal besides using boiling. In the past, researchers used [[Diisopropylamine|di-isopropylamine]] (DIPA) to extract water; however, to get the crystal, it need to wait for the solution cool down. To reduce the energy used in refrigeration, diethylmethylamine is decided to use in extractive crystallization since it has similar properties as DIPA and higher [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical solution temperature]]. Critical solution temperature is the boundary that the mixture will mix. If the temperature is under the critical solution temperature, the mixture will remain the state of not mixed. So, a higher critical solution temperature means no refrigeration was needed. From the experiment, first, at low temperature (10<sup>o</sup>C to -0.5<sup>o</sup>C), diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium chloride; however, the percentage of sodium chloride in the organic phase increases. The best temperature range is 5<sup>o</sup>C to 10<sup>o</sup>C. In this range, the solubility of sodium chloride is relatively insensitive to temperature. For the diethylmethylamine/sodium chloride system, the lowest critical solution temperature is -0.6<sup>o</sup>C. Second, diethylmethylamine can be used in extractive crystallization of sodium sulfate at room temperature (21<sup>o</sup>C to 25<sup>o</sup>C). In this range, sodium sulfate solubility in diethylmethylamine is relatively insensitive to temperature. Further, for the diethylmethylamine/sodium sulfate system, the lowest critical solution temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ting|first=Andrew M.|last2=Lynn|first2=Scott|last3=Prausnitz|first3=John M.|date=1992-04-01|title=Liquid-liquid equilibria for aqueous systems containing N,N-diethylmethylamine and sodium chloride or sodium sulfate|journal=Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data|volume=37|issue=2|pages=252\u2013259|doi=10.1021/je00006a032|issn=0021-9568}}</ref>\n\n== Reaction with other chemical ==\n\n=== Interfacial bonding mechanisms between iron and diethylmethylamine ===\nMetal are easily be corroded when expose in environment, so polymers are always used on the surface of the metal inhibit it from erosion.

Research was done to understand the intersection mechanisms of dissolved diethylmethylamine (dissolve in [[tetrahydrofuran]]) to iron surface. From the [[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy]] (FTIR) result of unrinsed and rinsed sample, researchers discovered that diethylmethylamine bonds to Fe surface were washed away because of the rinsing.

However, diethylmethylamine has two opposite effect in the same reduction, and can change to each other based on different condition. N,N-diethylmethylamine has contrasting effects during the reduction of protons and oxidation of formic acid. Based on different reaction conditions, diethylmethylamine can either inhibit or enhance the electrocatalysis of the liquid. For reduction, it can co-absorb onto Pt surface, which restrains H<sub>upd</sub> absorption onto Pt. For oxidation, it reinforces the oxidation of HCOOH. So, through electrocatalysis in PILs, diethylmethylamine plays contrasting roles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Sean E.|last2=Muhammad|first2=Sayyar|last3=Tuan|first3=Li-Ping|last4=Walsh|first4=Darren A.|date=2018-06-15|title=The contrasting effects of diethylmethylamine during reduction of protons and oxidation of formic acid in diethylmethylammonium-based protic ionic liquids|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|volume=819|pages=187\u2013192|doi=10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.10.021|issn=1572-6657}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Amines]]\n", "name_user": "8BitTiger", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed date format in some references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-diethylmethylamine"}
