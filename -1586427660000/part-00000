Most forms of EDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder. A few are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by a disorder.

Diagnostic tests include collagen gene-variant testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity. However, these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped variation, so clinical evaluation remains important.

Group A disorders are those which affect primary collagen structure and processing. Group B disorders affect collagen folding and crosslinking. Group C are disorders of structure and function of myomatrix. Group D disorders are those that affect glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis.

It may lead to frequent joint subluxations (partial dislocations) and dislocations. In general, people with this variant have skin that is soft, smooth, and velvety and bruises easily, as well as chronic muscle and/or bone pain.<ref name=\"GARD2017\"/> It affects the skin less than other forms. It has no available genetic test.<ref name=\"Levy_2018\"/> Hypermobility EDS (hEDS) is the most common of the 13 types of connective tissue disorders. Since there is no known genetic test, providers have to diagnose hEDS based on what they already know about the condition and the physical attributes that the patient shows. Other than the general signs, attributes can include faulty connective tissues throughout the body, musculoskeletal issues, and family history. Along with these general signs and side effects, patients can have trouble healing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/hypermobile-eds-and-hypermobility-spectrum-disorders/|title=Hypermobile EDS and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders|last=Carter|first=Kane|date=|website=Ehlers-Danlos Support UK|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nWomen who are pregnant should be warned about things like pre-labor rupture of membranes, drop in blood pressure with anesthesia, precipitate birth (very fast active labor), malposition of bleeding, and more. New mothers with hEDS should pay extra attention to taking care of their new baby. Mothers may have trouble taking care of the baby because of the risk of dropping the baby due to weak connective tissue in arms and legs, falling, postpartum depression (more than the general population), and healing from the birthing process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/information/pregnancy-birth-feeding-and-hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-hypermobility-spectrum-disorders/|title=Pregnancy, birth, feeding and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome / hypermobility spectrum disorders \u2013 The Ehlers-Danlos Support UK|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n====Classical EDS====\nClassical EDS (formerly categorized as type 1) is characterized by extremely elastic skin that is fragile and bruises easily; and hypermobility of the joints.

At this time, the classification system underwent an overhaul and was reduced to six major types using descriptive titles. Genetic specialists recognize that other types of this condition exist, but have only been documented in single families. Except for [[Hypermobility (joints)|hypermobility]] (type 3), the most common type of all ten types, some of the specific [[mutation|variation]]s involved have been identified and they can be precisely identified by [[genetic testing]]; this is valuable due to a great deal of variation in individual cases. However, negative genetic test results do not rule out the diagnosis, since not all of the variations have been discovered; therefore, the clinical presentation is very important.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ednf.org/what-eds|title=What is EDS {{!}} The Ehlers\u2013Danlos National Foundation|website=www.ednf.org|access-date=2016-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150505/http://www.ednf.org/what-eds|archive-date=2016-04-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nForms of EDS in this category may present with soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic diarrhea, joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder rupture, or poor wound healing.

For example, in [[cutis laxa]], the skin is loose, hanging, and wrinkled. In EDS, the skin can be pulled away from the body, but is elastic and returns to normal when let go. In [[Marfan syndrome]], the joints are very mobile and similar cardiovascular complications occur. People with EDS tend to have a \"marfanoid\" appearance (e.g., tall, skinny, long arms and legs, \"spidery\" fingers). However, physical appearance and features in several types of EDS also have characteristics including short stature, large eyes, and the appearance of a small mouth and chin, due to a small palate. The palate can have a high arch, causing dental crowding. Blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin, especially on the chest. The genetic connective tissue disorder, [[Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome]], also has symptoms that overlap with EDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loeysdietz.org/en/medical-information/differential-diagnosis|title=Differential Diagnosis |website=www.loeysdietz.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623074459/http://www.loeysdietz.org/en/medical-information/differential-diagnosis|archive-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, [[Menkes disease]], a copper metabolism disorder, was thought to be a form of EDS. People are not uncommonly misdiagnosed with [[fibromyalgia]], [[Coagulopathy|bleeding disorders]], or other disorders that can mimic EDS symptoms. Because of these similar disorders and complications that can arise from an unmonitored case of EDS, a correct diagnosis is important.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rarediseases.about.com/cs/ehlersdanlossynd/a/102603.htm |title=Ehlers\u2013Danlos Syndrome |publisher=Rarediseases.about.com |date=2006-05-25 |access-date=2014-02-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011912/http://rarediseases.about.com/cs/ehlersdanlossynd/a/102603.htm |archive-date=2014-04-12 }}</ref> [[Pseudoxanthoma elasticum]] (PXE) is worth consideration in diagnosis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pseudoxanthoma-elasticum|title=Pseudoxanthoma elasticum |website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Management ==\nThere is no known cure for Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes and treatment is supportive. Close monitoring of the cardiovascular system, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic instruments (e.g., wheelchairs, bracing, casting) may be helpful. This can help stabilize the joints and prevent injury. Orthopedic instruments are helpful for the prevention of further joint damage, especially for long distances, although  individuals are advised not to become dependent on them until other mobility options have been exhausted. People should avoid activities that cause the joint to lock or overextend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/physiotherapy-and-self-management/|title=Physiotherapy and self-management \u2013 The Ehlers-Danlos Support UK|website=www.ehlers-danlos.org|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>\n\nA physician may prescribe casting to stabilize joints.

Before pregnancy, people with EDS should have genetic counseling and familiarize themselves with the risks to their own bodies that pregnancy poses. Children with EDS should be provided with information about their disorder so they can understand why they should avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities. Children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done, as this may cause early degeneration of the joints. Emotional support along with behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful. Support groups can be immensely helpful for people dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health.

Instability of almost all joints can happen, but appears most often in the lower and upper extremities, with the wrist, fingers, shoulder, knee, hip, and ankle being most common.<ref name=Rombaut11/>\n\nCommon surgical procedures are joint [[debridement]], tendon replacements, [[capsulorrhaphy]], and [[arthroplasty]]. After surgery, the degree of stabilization, pain reduction, and people's satisfaction can improve, but surgery does not guarantee an optimal result: affected peoples and surgeons report being dissatisfied with the results. Consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery,<ref name=Camerota14/> particularly since people have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease. Three basic surgical problems arise due to EDS: the strength of the tissues is decreased, which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery; the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete.<ref name=Rombaut11/> If considering surgical intervention, seeking care from a surgeon with extensive knowledge and experience in treating people with EDS and joint hypermobility issues would be prudent.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiesmann T, Castori M, Malfait F, Wulf H | title = Recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative management in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome(s) | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 9 | pages = 109 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25053156 | pmc = 4223622 | doi = 10.1186/s13023-014-0109-5 }}</ref>\n\nLocal anesthetics, [[arterial catheter]]s, and [[central venous catheters]] cause a higher risk of [[haematoma|bruise formation]] in people with EDS.

Symptoms vary in severity, even in the same disorder, and the frequency of complications varies. Some people have negligible symptoms, while others are severely restricted in daily life. Extreme joint instability, chronic musculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint disease, frequent injuries, and spinal deformities may limit mobility. Severe spinal deformities may affect breathing. In the case of extreme joint instability, dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob. Secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems, occurring in any type, can affect prognosis and quality of life. Severe mobility-related disability is seen more often in hypermobile EDS than in classical EDS or vascular EDS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/|title=What are the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes?|website=The Ehlers Danlos Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\nAlthough all types of EDS are potentially life-threatening, most people have a normal lifespan.

A defect in collagen can weaken connective tissue in the skin, bones, blood vessels, and organs, resulting in the features of the disorder.<ref name=\"NIHGHR2016\"/> Inheritance patterns depend on the specific syndrome. Most forms of EDS are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one of the two copies of the gene in question must be altered to cause a disorder. A few are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be altered for a person to be affected by a disorder.

The [[Hypermobility (joints)#Beighton criteria|Beighton criteria]] are widely used to assess the degree of joint hypermobility. DNA and biochemical studies can help identify affected individuals. Diagnostic tests include collagen gene-variant testing, collagen typing via skin biopsy, echocardiogram, and lysyl hydroxylase or oxidase activity. However, these tests are not able to confirm all cases, especially in instances of an unmapped variation, so clinical evaluation remains important.

Group A disorders are those which affect primary collagen structure and processing. Group B disorders affect collagen folding and crosslinking. Group C are disorders of structure and function of myomatrix. Group D disorders are those that affect glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis.

It may lead to frequent joint subluxations (partial dislocations) and dislocations. In general, people with this variant have skin that is soft, smooth, and velvety and bruises easily, as well as chronic muscle and/or bone pain.<ref name=\"GARD2017\"/> It affects the skin less than other forms. It has no available genetic test.<ref name=\"Levy_2018\"/> Hypermobility EDS (hEDS) is the most common of the 13 types of connective tissue disorders. Since there is no known genetic test, providers have to diagnose hEDS based on what they already know about the condition and the physical attributes that the patient shows. Other than the general signs, attributes can include faulty connective tissues throughout the body, musculoskeletal issues, and family history. Along with these general signs and side effects, patients can have trouble healing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/hypermobile-eds-and-hypermobility-spectrum-disorders/|title=Hypermobile EDS and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders|last=Carter|first=Kane|date=|website=Ehlers-Danlos Support UK|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nWomen who are pregnant should be warned about things like pre-labor rupture of membranes, drop in blood pressure with anesthesia, precipitate birth (very fast active labor), malposition of bleeding, and more. New mothers with hEDS should pay extra attention to taking care of their new baby. Mothers may have trouble taking care of the baby because of the risk of dropping the baby due to weak connective tissue in arms and legs, falling, postpartum depression (more than the general population), and healing from the birthing process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/information/pregnancy-birth-feeding-and-hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-hypermobility-spectrum-disorders/|title=Pregnancy, birth, feeding and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome / hypermobility spectrum disorders \u2013 The Ehlers-Danlos Support UK|language=en|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n====Classical EDS====\nClassical EDS (formerly categorized as type 1) is characterized by extremely elastic skin that is fragile and bruises easily; and hypermobility of the joints.

At this time, the classification system underwent an overhaul and was reduced to six major types using descriptive titles. Genetic specialists recognize that other types of this condition exist, but have only been documented in single families. Except for [[Hypermobility (joints)|hypermobility]] (type 3), the most common type of all ten types, some of the specific [[mutation|variation]]s involved have been identified and they can be precisely identified by [[genetic testing]]; this is valuable due to a great deal of variation in individual cases. However, negative genetic test results do not rule out the diagnosis, since not all of the variations have been discovered; therefore, the clinical presentation is very important.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ednf.org/what-eds|title=What is EDS {{!}} The Ehlers\u2013Danlos National Foundation|website=www.ednf.org|access-date=2016-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426150505/http://www.ednf.org/what-eds|archive-date=2016-04-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nForms of EDS in this category may present with soft, mildly stretchable skin, shortened bones, chronic diarrhea, joint hypermobility and dislocation, bladder rupture, or poor wound healing.

For example, in [[cutis laxa]], the skin is loose, hanging, and wrinkled. In EDS, the skin can be pulled away from the body, but is elastic and returns to normal when let go. In [[Marfan syndrome]], the joints are very mobile and similar cardiovascular complications occur. People with EDS tend to have a \"marfanoid\" appearance (e.g., tall, skinny, long arms and legs, \"spidery\" fingers). However, physical appearance and features in several types of EDS also have characteristics including short stature, large eyes, and the appearance of a small mouth and chin, due to a small palate. The palate can have a high arch, causing dental crowding. Blood vessels can sometimes be easily seen through translucent skin, especially on the chest. The genetic connective tissue disorder, [[Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome]], also has symptoms that overlap with EDS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loeysdietz.org/en/medical-information/differential-diagnosis|title=Differential Diagnosis |website=www.loeysdietz.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623074459/http://www.loeysdietz.org/en/medical-information/differential-diagnosis|archive-date=2017-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, [[Menkes disease]], a copper metabolism disorder, was thought to be a form of EDS. People are not uncommonly misdiagnosed with [[fibromyalgia]], [[Coagulopathy|bleeding disorders]], or other disorders that can mimic EDS symptoms. Because of these similar disorders and complications that can arise from an unmonitored case of EDS, a correct diagnosis is important.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rarediseases.about.com/cs/ehlersdanlossynd/a/102603.htm |title=Ehlers\u2013Danlos Syndrome |publisher=Rarediseases.about.com |date=2006-05-25 |access-date=2014-02-27 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011912/http://rarediseases.about.com/cs/ehlersdanlossynd/a/102603.htm |archive-date=2014-04-12 }}</ref> [[Pseudoxanthoma elasticum]] (PXE) is worth consideration in diagnosis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/pseudoxanthoma-elasticum|title=Pseudoxanthoma elasticum |website=Genetics Home Reference|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>\n\n== Management ==\nThere is no known cure for Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndromes and treatment is supportive. Close monitoring of the cardiovascular system, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic instruments (e.g., wheelchairs, bracing, casting) may be helpful. This can help stabilize the joints and prevent injury. Orthopedic instruments are helpful for the prevention of further joint damage, especially for long distances, although  individuals are advised not to become dependent on them until other mobility options have been exhausted. People should avoid activities that cause the joint to lock or overextend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/what-is-eds/information-on-eds/physiotherapy-and-self-management/|title=Physiotherapy and self-management \u2013 The Ehlers-Danlos Support UK|website=www.ehlers-danlos.org|access-date=2018-04-17}}</ref>\n\nA physician may prescribe casting to stabilize joints.

Before pregnancy, people with EDS should have genetic counseling and familiarize themselves with the risks to their own bodies that pregnancy poses. Children with EDS should be provided with information about their disorder so they can understand why they should avoid contact sports and other physically stressful activities. Children should be taught that demonstrating the unusual positions that they can maintain due to loose joints should not be done, as this may cause early degeneration of the joints. Emotional support along with behavioral and psychological therapy can be useful. Support groups can be immensely helpful for people dealing with major lifestyle changes and poor health.

Consensus is that conservative treatment is more effective than surgery,<ref name=Camerota14/> particularly since people have extra risks of surgical complications due to the disease. Three basic surgical problems arise due to EDS: the strength of the tissues is decreased, which makes the tissue less suitable for surgery; the fragility of the blood vessels can cause problems during surgery; and wound healing is often delayed or incomplete.<ref name=Rombaut11/> If considering surgical intervention, seeking care from a surgeon with extensive knowledge and experience in treating people with EDS and joint hypermobility issues would be prudent.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiesmann T, Castori M, Malfait F, Wulf H | title = Recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative management in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome(s) | journal = Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases | volume = 9 | pages = 109 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25053156 | pmc = 4223622 | doi = 10.1186/s13023-014-0109-5 }}</ref>\n\nLocal anesthetics, [[arterial catheter]]s, and [[central venous catheters]] cause a higher risk of [[haematoma|bruise formation]] in people with EDS.

Symptoms vary in severity, even in the same disorder, and the frequency of complications varies. Some people have negligible symptoms, while others are severely restricted in daily life. Extreme joint instability, chronic musculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint disease, frequent injuries, and spinal deformities may limit mobility. Severe spinal deformities may affect breathing. In the case of extreme joint instability, dislocations may result from simple tasks such as rolling over in bed or turning a doorknob. Secondary conditions such as autonomic dysfunction or cardiovascular problems, occurring in any type, can affect prognosis and quality of life. Severe mobility-related disability is seen more often in hypermobile EDS than in classical EDS or vascular EDS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/|title=What are the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes?|website=The Ehlers Danlos Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref>\n\nAlthough all types of EDS are potentially life-threatening, most people have a normal lifespan.
