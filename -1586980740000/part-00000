He was sent on loan twice during his debut season, to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], before securing a place in the first team by the 2000\u201301 season. He experienced relegation in the 2002\u201303 season and was voted into the PFA First Division Team of the Year in the following campaign. He made more than 150 appearances for ''the Hammers'', and in 2004, he moved to rival London club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a fee believed to be [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]3.5&nbsp;million. He played an influential role at the club for two seasons before moving to Manchester United in 2006 for \u00a318&nbsp;million.\n\nFrom his debut onwards, Carrick was a regular in the Manchester United first team, making more than 50 appearances in his first season with them. He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307]], their first title success in four years. The following season he was part of the side that won the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008 Champions League final]], playing the full 120 minutes as they enjoyed a 6\u20135 penalty shootout win, with Carrick converting his spot kick, to help achieve the [[Double (association football)#European Doubles|European Double]].

{"title_page": "List of Monsters, Inc. characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Monsters, Inc.'' characters}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{in-universe|date=June 2013}}\n{{Overlinked|date=June 2019}}\n}}\nThis is a '''list of characters''' from the [[Pixar]] [[media franchise]] ''[[Monsters, Inc. (franchise)|Monsters, Inc.]]'', including the 2001 film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and the 2013 film ''[[Monsters University]]'', and the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.\n\n==Setting==\n\n\nThe monster characters reside in the city of Monstropolis. According to a DVD bonus feature, Monstropolis was founded after all of the [[monster]]s who once co-existed with [[human]]s were chased off the mainland and eventually moved to an island on an unknown world where they have lived ever since. The only way for them to enter human-inhabited areas was via closet doors.\n\nThe company Monsters, Inc. provides Monstropolis with power from the screams of human children that have been scared by specialized agents who work for Monsters, Inc. called \"scarers\". There are also companies that rival Monsters, Inc. in this endeavor, such as Fear Co. and Scream Industries.\n\nThe city also provides universities at which monsters can study to scare, the most prominent in the storyline being Monsters University for its outstanding Scaring Program. One of its rivals is a college called Fear Tech.\n\n==Appearing in both films ==\n\n==={{Anchor|James P. Sullivan}}Sulley===\n'''James P. Sullivan''' or '''Sulley''' (voiced by [[John Goodman]] in the film series, [[Brian Cummings]] in the [[Monsters, Inc. (video game)|''Monsters, Inc.'' video game]], Joel McCrary in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' and ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', Christopher Swindle in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'') is a tall blue-furred giant ogre with horns, purple spots, razor-sharp claws on his hands, furry talons for feet, a [[theropod]]-like tail, spikes running down his back and [[shark]]-like fangs. Even though he excels at scaring children, he is kindhearted, thoughtful and affects a relaxed, amiable personality. In the film's beginning, he is \"The Best Scarer\" for several months running.\n\n''[[Monsters University]]'' depicts the college-age Sulley as a talented but lazy student whose father Bill had made a name for himself as a proficient Scarer. He and Mike start as arch-rivals in their introductory scaring class, but eventually form a friendship that lasts even beyond their expulsion from the university.\n\n===Mike Wazowski===\n'''Michael''' \"'''Mike'''\" '''Wazowski''' (voiced by [[Billy Crystal]] in the film series, [[Carlos Alazraqui]] in the video games, Merchandise, attractions and commercials, Noah Johnston as his younger self in ''[[Monsters University]]''), is a one-eyed green monster with a round body and two small horns. He also has claws, but they are not as sharp as Sulley's.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Monsters University]]'', Mike is depicted as a proud monster. Mike had a lonesome childhood and struggled to make friends. On a class field trip to ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Mike was inspired to become a scarer professionally, but other students made fun of him because he was perceived as undeniably \"unscary\". Even though he is the scariest monster no cap. \n\nEven so, Mike was accepted into Monsters University's scare program, where he was introduced to James P. Sullivan in a SCARE 101 class. Mike initially disliked Sulley for his arrogance and bad work ethic. This dislike escalated into a major disruption made in class which resulted in Mike and Sulley's expulsion from the scare program. Mike then works out a deal with the dean of the school to re-enroll in the program on the stipulation that he wins the Games. Sulley joins Mike, despite Mike\u2019s protestations.\n\nMike and Sulley joined the Oozma Kappa fraternity at Monsters University to qualify for the Games. Mike and Sulley begin to build a friendship as they compete together. During the final event, Sulley cheats, and both Mike and Sulley are expelled from school. After being expelled, the two were offered jobs as workers in the Monsters, Inc. mailroom nonetheless. They advance through the ranks until Sully is a scarer and Mike is his assistant. In Monsters, Inc., Mike runs Sulley's station on the scare floor and they are close friends and roommates. Mike is dating Celia Mae at this time. Additionally, Mike helps Sulley in his mission to save Boo.\n\nMike is portrayed as a comedian in [[Tomorrowland]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in [[Walt Disney World Resort]] attraction, [[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]]. Mike is not only known for his humor, but also his intelligence. He has made appearances in other Pixar movies, such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mikewazowskimania.weebly.com/|title=Mike Wazowski Mania|website=Mike Wazowski Mania|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Randall Boggs ===\n'''Randall Boggs''' (voiced by [[Steve Buscemi]] in the film series, [[Peter Kelamis]] in the ''Disney Infinity'' video game series, [[J. P. Manoux|J.P. Manoux]] in the [[Monsters, Inc. (video game)|video game]] and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'') is a purple, eight-legged [[chameleon]]-like monster with an ability to change skin color and blend in with his surroundings. He is very flexible, nimble and is an excellent climber. He is Sulley's nemesis and Mike's arch-rival and former best friend.\n\nIn ''Monsters, Inc.'', he is Sulley's arch-rival on the scare floor, as well as Jeffrey Fungus' boss. The two vie for position as the area's top scream collector, a competition set up to encourage working. Ironically, Randall does manage to win top position for a few seconds, until Sulley comes back from a slumber party, thus winning it back. They also compete for The All-Time Scare Record. Henry J. Waternoose secretly approaches Randall and orders him to build a scream extraction machine, a vacuum-like device, and use it on kidnapped children to save the company and solving the energy crisis at large. One night, Randall leaves a door activated on the Scare Floor, when he was doing a bit of late-night work, and a little girl, later dubbed Boo, wanders out. Randall makes several attempts to get information out of Mike and Sulley on where the kid is. With Waternoose's help, Randall helps banish Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas and kidnap Boo. However, before they could extract the scream from her, Mike and Sulley return and Sulley destroys the machine, rescuing Boo. After a long chase through the millions of doors in the factory's door storage facility, Boo eventually conquers her fear of Randall and buys Sulley enough time to defeat him. Afterwards, Randall is forcibly exiled to the human world and winds up in a mobile home where the inhabitants beat him senseless, believing him to be an alligator. Sulley and Mike then destroy the door to prevent Randall from returning to the monster world.\n\nIn the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Randall enrolls at the same time as Mike and the two end up as friends and roommates. He is insecure and shy at first, having trouble controlling his camouflage abilities, but is a model bookworm. When Randall is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the top fraternity in the university, he quickly abandons Mike in order retain his standing with the fraternity. He slowly becomes more ambitious and confident, and ultimately becomes less empathetic and more self-centered. After an embarrassing failure at the Scare Games to Sulley, an embittered Randall vows to himself to never be outdone by Sulley again, thus starting their unfortunate conflict in Monsters, Inc.\n\n===Roz===\t\n\n'''Roz''' (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]) is a slug-like monster who is the key master and administrator of Scare Floor F. Near the end of the film, she is revealed to be Number One of the CDA, having been on an undercover assignment to investigate the company and expose Randall and Waternoose's scheme.\n\nShe also makes surprise appearances in three outtakes of the film: when Boo is in the toilet cubicle with Sulley, the CDA shaves and showers George Sanderson, and when Sulley proves to Boo that there is no one behind his closet door.\n\nShe appears briefly near the end of the prequel as a member of the CDA squad that responds to the break-in at the Door Lab. Although she wears a full-body protective suit that covers her face, her shape and voice give away her identity.\n\n===CDA===\nThe '''CDA''' (short for '''Child Detection Agency''' and voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Bill Farmer]], [[Pete Docter]], [[Lee Unkrich]], [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and [[Teddy Newton]]) are an assortment of different monsters in [[hazmat suit]]s whose main job is to respond to any reported incidents of contact between monsters and children or their belongings, since it is believed that human objects are toxic. They isolate and destroy any items accidentally brought back into the monster world. Any monsters that comes in contact with a human object are quickly and forcibly decontaminated while having a neck cone applied afterwards.\n\nThey first appear when George Sanderson gets a sock on him and they had to decontaminate him after the sock is destroyed. When Boo gets into Monstropolis and appears at Harryhausen's, the CDA end up decontaminating the building and then disinfected the patrons. They later find the bag containing Boo that Mike and Sulley left behind at the restaurant, which traced them back to Monsters, Inc. where they end up searching the building. In one moment, two of the CDA members ask Sulley for an autograph to give to Bethany, the daughter of agent 00002, whom he mentions. Henry J. Waternoose had the CDA called in to cut the power to Boo's door as soon as it lands so as to contain Boo and arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike does a diversion that involved throwing one of Boo's socks on one of the agents and then had the other agents chase him. This trick enabled the CDA Agents to be present when Henry confesses his motives that involved abducting children to keep Monsters, Inc. alive. The CDA Agents arrest Waternoose as Mike and Sulley discover that Roz is the Number One of the CDA. During the credits, a CDA agent directs a monster to his seat during Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', the CDA are called when Mike and Sulley had entered a door that led to a human area. After Mike and Sulley make it back to Monsters University, they are taken away by the CDA.\n\n===Abominable Snowman===\n\nThe '''[[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) or '''Yeti''', is a white-furred monster from Monstropolis who got banished to the [[Himalayas]] in the human world. He is an expert of making [[snow cone]]s. He greets Sulley and Mike when Waternoose and Randall banish them to the Himalayas. While the Abominable Snowman tries to make Mike and Sulley feel at home in his abode, he understands Sulley must rescue Boo, and tells him of a [[Nepal]]ese village at the foot of the mountain whereupon they can regain access to the monster world. Despite everything, the Abominable Snowman seems to have made the best of his fate and genuinely seems to enjoy the human world.\n\nIn the credits to ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', he appeared as the '''Abominable [[Snowplow]]'''.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was shown to have worked as a [[mailroom]] supervisor at Monsters, Inc.. He warns Mike and Sulley not to mess with the mail which is a crime punished by banishment (which possibly hints why he was banished).\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters, Inc.''==\n===Boo===\n'''Boo''' (voiced by Mary Gibbs) is a 2-year-old human girl who becomes Sulley and Mike's friend.\n\nDuring Randall's secret late-night work on the Scare Floor, Boo gets into the factory and Sulley tries various attempts to put her back, none of which worked, so he eventually puts her inside a [[duffle bag]]. When Sulley brings this up with Mike at Harryhausen's, Boo gets out and frightens the patrons; the CDA have to \"decontaminate\" the restaurant. While Mike and Sulley are at home, they discover that the girl is not toxic after all. Sulley quickly grows attached to the girl and names her \"Boo\". The next day, they smuggle her into the factory disguised as a child of one of Sulley's relatives, and Mike attempts to return her through her door. Randall tries to kidnap Boo, but kidnaps Mike by mistake. Boo may not be afraid of Sulley, but when she was brought into the simulation room after Mike and Sulley escaped from Randall, she ended up severely frightened by Sulley's roar. When Mike and Sulley tried to return Boo to her home, Mr. Waternoose had Mike and Sulley exiled to the Himalayas. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from Randall's Scream Extractor. During the chase through the large storage vault, Boo's laughter ends up causing all the doors to operate. Eventually, Boo gets over being afraid of Randall, and helps to defeat him. Sulley and Mike are able to access Boo's door, but Mr. Waternoose and the CDA send it back to the Scare Floor. Mike distracts the CDA, while Sulley escapes with Boo and her door, although Waternoose follows. The CDA's undercover leader is revealed to be Roz, and she allows Sulley and Mike 5 minutes to return Boo to her world. Once Sulley and Mike have returned Boo to her room, her door is put through the shredder. Sometime later, Mike takes Sulley aside revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door requiring only one more piece which Sulley had taken as a memento, the one taped to his clipboard. Sulley inserts the last piece, reactivates the door and enters to find Boo there.\n\nBoo has had other cameo appearances in other Pixar films including ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.\n\n===Monsters, Inc. employees===\n====Henry J. Waternoose III ====\n'''Henry J. Waternoose III''' (voiced by [[James Coburn]]) is a five-eyed humanoid [[crustacean]]-like monster who is the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Monsters, Inc.. The company has been in Waternoose's family for 3 generations as he had inherited the company from his father at the age of 142. Waternoose also previously had a mentoring relationship with Sulley.  The monster wants to be the best one ever. \n\nWaternoose is first seen where he reminds Thaddeus Bile and the other trainees about the dangers of a human child getting into Monstropolis after Thaddeus left the door opened. He has been impressed with Sulley's progress. However, Mr. Waternoose is distraught to learn that the impending energy crisis is increasing, due to many children being desensitized and being unable to be scared by monsters, which might put the company on the verge of being shut down. \n\nWhen Sulley tells Waternoose that he can get the company through the energy crisis, Waternoose tells Sulley to tell that to the [[board of director]]s. When Boo is eventually discovered and Sulley and Mike wanted to return her home, Waternoose agrees to help them, but he later reveals that he and Randall are hand in glove. Waternoose was actually planning to kidnap Boo and several more children to extract their screams to fight the energy crisis and that Randall himself is just an accomplice to Waternoose's plan. \n\nAt that point, Waternoose betrayed both Sulley and Mike by exiling them to the Himalayas to ensure that they don't interfere with their plans any further (as they have found out too much about their scheme), though Waternoose would later regret his actions; he even argues with Randall about how he should not have trusted him since it led to him banishing his top employees in order to prevent them from exposing their scheme to the public. Regardless, Randall tells Waternoose the Scream Extractor would revolutionize Monsters, Inc., that there won't be any need for scarers and that Mike and Sulley \"got what they deserved\". Before Boo's screams can be extracted, Sulley returns and rescues Boo while destroying the machine and using it to pin Randall, Waternoose, and Fungus to the wall (although Randall was quick enough to avoid being trapped) before escaping as Randall gives pursuit. After Sulley and Mike defeat Randall and trap him in the [[Everglades]], Mr. Waternoose has called in the CDA to help apprehend Boo and arrest Sulley and Mike, attempting to frame them as the criminals responsible for the incident. Mike, carrying who they think is Boo, distracts them before running off. While the CDA gave chase to Mike, Sulley ran off with Boo as Waternoose gives chase after they accidentally get his attention. Waternoose follows Sulley to the simulation bedroom before Sulley jams the entrance shut with a metal pipe to hold back Waternoose long enough for Sulley to install Boo's door and supposedly activating it. He eventually manages to break through. In the room, Sulley confronts and argues with Waternoose over his and Randall's wrongdoings. Waternoose declares he will not stop attempting to end the energy crisis, even if it means kidnapping many children and doing away with anyone who stands in his way to ensure that their plot remains a secret. Brutishly knocking Sulley out of his way, he tries to grab Boo from the bed, but instead grabs the simulation child. Just then, the wall goes up to reveal that Mike is behind the controls and he records Sulley and Waternoose's confrontation, exposing Waternoose and Randall's plot as the corruptive CEO watches in shock, now realizing that he had been tricked. With this incriminating evidence and now knowing who the real criminal is, the CDA turns on Waternoose and arrests him. As he is being dragged away, Waternoose yells at Sulley, claiming that he destroyed the company and that the energy crisis will only get worse because of him before he is pulled out of the room. Waternoose is last seen loaded onto the CDA's van and taken to prison for his crimes as Sulley becomes the new CEO of Monsters, Inc., proving Waternoose's theory incorrect by changing the company's approach from scaring to laughter, allowing the company to gain enough power to end the energy crisis for good.\n\nDespite not appearing in the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Waternoose is seen in a photo at the end of the movie shaking hands with Mike and Sulley as they are being promoted to becoming a Scare Team.\n\nThe [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon processor]], used in the [[Xbox 360]], developed by [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]] under the IBM chip program was codenamed \"Waternoose\" in the character's honor.<ref>[https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/learning-failure/77528067352048 \"Learning from failure - The inside story on how IBM out-foxed Intel with the Xbox 360\"], Dean Takahashi, ''Electronic Business'', May 1, 2006</ref>\n\n====Celia Mae====\n'''Celia Mae''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Tilly]]) is a one-eyed monster with [[snake]]-like hair and tentacles for legs. She works as a [[receptionist]] at Monsters, Inc. and is Mike Wazowski's girlfriend. When Mike is at a date with Celia at Harryhausen's, a sushi restaurant,  Boo made herself known as the CDA raid the place and use a device that caused an energy dome that \"decontaminated\" Harryhausen's. Celia was among the monsters who were decontaminated at that time, which then forces her and her snakes hairs to wear neck cones after enduring the decontamination, much to her embarrassment. As a result, Celia is now angry at Mike and she confronts him the next day, and she unintentionally slips Mike's involvement in the incident the previous night while scolding him, which Randall discovers. When Mike and Sulley were being chased by Randall, Celia angrily grabbed onto Mike threatening to break up with him if he did not tell her what was happening; though Mike stated that they are trying to get Boo back to her room, Celia didn't believe him at first until Boo appeared over Sulley's shoulder. Celia does a diversion by announcing that Randall had broken the Scare Record. She is seen again at the end of the film, having fully recovered and made amends with Mike, and tells him that a box full of magazines has just arrived. Both she and Mike are surprised to see that Mike has made the cover of the magazine. During the credits, Celia takes part in Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nDespite not appearing in ''[[Monsters University]]'', Celia is seen in a photo in Mike's locker room, where he puts up a new photo of himself and Sulley in their first day as a Scarer Team, next to Celia's near the end of the movie.\n\n====Jeffrey Fungus====\n'''Jeffrey Fungus''' (voiced by [[Frank Oz]]) is Randall's red-skinned three-eyed assistant. Despite being partnered with Fungus, Randall seems to be annoyed by his antics and would often abuse him and boss him around. Fungus also is terrified by Randall's behavior and his involvement in the plot to kidnap human children and extract their screams forcibly, but feels either blackmailed or too intimidated to confront Randall, and is inwardly glad that Mike and Sulley are sabotaging the sinister conspiracy. When Randall attempts to test the extraction machine on Mike, Sulley puts Fungus on the chair and rescues Mike. The scream machine renders Fungus nearly unconscious and blanches him white,  showing that the machine asphyxiates its victims. In the end following Randall's defeat and Waternoose's arrest, Fungus is forgiven for his involvement and is now happy taking on a job of making children laugh to collect more power.\n\n====Needleman and Smitty====\n'''Needleman and Smitty''' (both voiced by [[Dan Gerson]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]] in ''[[Monsters at Work]]'') are two monsters that work as maintenance and errand monsters at Monsters, Inc.. Both of them worship Sulley and the ground that he walks upon. One of their jobs at Monsters, Inc. is to operate the Door Shredder, a [[woodchipper]]-like device that shreds the doors of children that are not afraid of monsters.\n\nIn one of the outtakes of the film, Smitty accidentally calls Sullivan \"Solomon\", while another outtake sees the Door Shredder shred the door too fast; it later runs backstage with them holding on to it, almost destroying the backstage equipment and props. Needleman and Smitty are also part of the company play, taking the roles as Randall and Fungus respectively.\n\n====Scarers of Scare Floor F====\nThe '''Scarers of Scare Floor F''' are the co-workers at Monsters, Inc.. Apart from James P. Sullivan and Randall Boggs, among these are:\n\n* '''Augustus''' \"'''Spike'''\" '''Jones''' - An red [[slug]]-like monster with tons of retractable purple spikes on his back. In \"Monsters University\", it was shown that Spike had graduated from Fear Tech and was a former worker at Fear Co.\n* '''Bob Peterson''' (voiced by [[Jack Angel]]) - A light blue [[dinosaur]]-like monster with removable teeth. He is named after [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]].\n* '''George Sanderson''' (voiced by Samuel Lord Black) - A one-horned furry monster who is good friends with Mike, Sulley, Lanky, and Claws. In ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was a member of the Jaws Theta Chi fraternity. In Monsters, Inc., when George emerged from one of the doors with a sock on him, his assistant Charlie sees the sock and shouts \"23-19\" which ended up calling in the CDA to take care of the situation. After the sock is removed and destroyed, George is then shaved, showered, and applied a neck cone to him. This becomes a running gag, as when in the locker room, the toys that Sulley hid in a nearby locker fell on George causing Charlie to shout \"23-19\" which caused the CDA to work on him again. When Charlie picks out a door to a house in the Himalayas, Sulley emerges from it and unknowingly placed a sock on him. Charlie shouts \"23-19\", but this time, George shoved the sock in Charlie's mouth and banished him by throwing him through the door but he escaped through the door and was with George seeing Waternoose being out in the CDA van. \n* '''Harley P. Gerson''' - An orange monster with only a large mouth and two legs.\n* '''Harry''' \"'''Bud'''\" '''Lucky''' - A thin turquoise [[Octopus]] monster with long shaggy purple hair covering his face. \n* '''Joe Ranft''' - A purple monster with huge fists and three eyes. He is named after [[Joe Ranft]].\n* '''Nicholas''' \"'''Lanky'''\" '''Schmidt''' (voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]) - A monster with a small head and long arms and legs who is good friends with Pete \"Claws\" Ward and George Sanderson. When interviewed about the \"kid-tastrophe\", he claimed Boo flew over him and used laser vision to blast a car.\n* '''Pete''' \"'''Claws'''\" '''Ward''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]) - A blue [[crocodile]]-like monster with retractable sharp claws and horrifying breath who is good friends with his assistant. When working on one door, he ran out and told his assistant that the child he tried to scare almost touched him resulting in his assistant calling for a door shredder making it the 58th door the company lost this week. He appears to be less fearsome than he tries to make himself look, as he was seen despairing at his aforementioned failed scare attempt and later crying during Mike's solo number in the company play. \n* '''Ricky Plesuski''' - A green monster with a huge mouth filled with sharp teeth, [[snail]]-like eyes, and eight legs.

After everybody gets tripped over, a crew member peeks his head out clapping the upside-down [[clapperboard]].\n\n====Assistants to the Scarers of Floor F====\n* '''Betty''' (voiced by [[Teresa Ganzel]]) - A light blue monster who is the assistant of Rivera.\n* '''Charlie Proctor''' (voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]) - A blue monster with [[snail]]-like eyes and tentacles for arms that is the assistant of George Sanderson.

He is a [[grocer]] that works at Tony's Grossery and was first seen telling Mike and Sulley that somebody is about to break the All-Scare Record and throws them blood oranges while wishing them the best of luck.\n\n===Ted===\n\n'''Ted''' is the largest monster in the movie; he's so big, only his elephant-like legs, covered with large, coarse brown scales, are shown at all. He also seems to be the only monster that can't talk, instead crowing like a rooster. He is shown at a crossroads waiting for the light to change with Mike and Sulley. Sulley yells \"Good Morning\" up at him, he crows back, then the light turns green, and Ted stumps across the road, causing an earthquake with every step.\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters University''==\n===University staff===\n====Dean Abigail Hardscrabble====\n'''[[Dean (education)|Dean]] Abigail Hardscrabble''' (voiced by [[Helen Mirren]]<ref name=EmpireMirren>{{cite news|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|title=Helen Mirren Set For Monsters University|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=36472|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Empire|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>) is the strict dean of Monsters University. She is a red [[dragon]]-like monster with [[centipede]]-like legs and red [[bat]] wings. She was modeled after a type of centipede called ''[[Scolopendra gigantea]],'' also known as the Amazonian giant centipede. When Dean Hardscrabble attended Monsters University in her youth, she was a member of the Eta Hiss Hiss sorority and is the founder and a four-time consecutive champion of the Scare Games.\n\nShe first appears where she flies into Professor Derek Knight's class at the beginning of the first day. She then also appears during the Scare Exam at the end of the semester that helps to weed out the least-worthy scarers from the University's School of Scaring. Mike was kicked out as Hardscrabble considered him \"not scary\", and Sulley was kicked out when he performed an incorrect scare due to his lack of studying and preparation. Mike later finds out that the only way to get back into the scaring program is to compete in the Scare Games with a fraternity of rejected monsters called Oozma Kappa. As a result, Mike makes a deal with Dean Hardscrabble that if Oozma Kappa wins the Games, they will be reinstated back into the scaring program. Otherwise if they lose, Mike will have to leave the school. Sensing this opportunity, Sulley offers to join in Oozma Kappa allowing the team to gain entry.\n\nDuring the Scare Games, Dean Hardscrabble is secretly watching Mike and Sulley competing from afar, aware and expecting that they are both going to fail. For the Toxicity challenge after Oozma Kappa came in last place, Hardscrabble stated to Mike that only a miracle can save him from expulsion. By coincidence before she could even finish her sentence, one miracle actually happened when Brock Pearson announces that Jaws Theta Chi is disqualified for using an illegal protective sting ointment during the Toxicity challenge which puts Oozma Kappa back into the competition. Dean Hardscrabble then keeps an eye on Oozma Kappa during the remaining challenges.\n\nBut after Oozma Kappa wins the Games when they beat Roar Omega Roar in the final round with the scare simulators, Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble that he cheated by setting Mike's simulator level to easy just to make Oozma Kappa win due to Mike's inability to scare. An outraged Hardscrabble orders him to leave the campus when all of a sudden, she is alerted that Mike had secretly snuck into the door lab, prompting Sulley to go there to save his friend, despite Harscrabble's warnings.\n\nDean Hardscrabble then shuts down the door in question, which led to a cabin at a campsite in a park until the authorities arrive, but Mike and Sulley manage to escape back by scaring several human adults in the form of a team of [[park ranger]]s. Mike's break-in led to him being expelled from Monsters University along with Sulley for rigging a game score, but Hardscrabble was sad to let them go. While considered as a major offense to her school, they ended up surprising her (something which no one has ever done). Dean Hardscrabble had the rest of Oozma Kappa enroll into the Scaring Program, admitting to Sulley and Mike that she was impressed by their performances in the Games.\n\n====Professor Derek Knight====\n'''Professor Derek Knight''' (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]<ref name=DigitalSpyCharacters>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title='Monsters University' unveils character posters, ID cards|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a460540/monsters-university-unveils-character-posters-id-cards.html|accessdate=February 21, 2013|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>) is a [[dinosaur]]-like monster who teaches SCARING 101: Intro to Scaring at the School of Scaring. He often weeds out the least worthy students so that the best of the best can move on to becoming Scarers. Professor Knight is also shown to be a fan of Bill Sullivan, Sully's father. When he is first seen during the exam that would determine who will take part in the School of Scaring, Dean Abigail Hardscrabble \"assists\" him where she weeds out Mike for not being scary and Sully for doing an incorrect scare. Professor Knight is later seen with Dean Hardscrabble when Sully admits that he rigged Mike's scare simulator during the final Scare Games event. During the credits, he has a card saying that he worked at Fear. Co.\n\n====Professor William Brandywine====\n'''Professor William Brandywine''' is a round monster with yellow fur whose eyes are invisible.

She is a large [[slug]]-headed teacher with six monstrous tentacles for legs and gray hair. The Librarian is involved in the \"Avoid the Parent\" challenge of the Scare Games where the Librarian's reaction to noise is made to emulate the danger of parents and how a Scarer has to get along without being caught by one. Any team who is caught by the Librarian is thrown out of the library and eliminated from the competition. That is what happened to Slugma Slugma Kappa when they were caught by the Librarian. The Oozma Kappa group gives up on silence after Sulley accidentally knocks over with a ladder and they start a noisy display to distract and confuse the Librarian to get their flag.\n\n===University students===\n====Oozma Kappa students====\n'''Oozma Kappa''' ('''O\u039a''', suggestive of \"[[OK]]\") is one of the six fraternities at Monsters University.

According to the \"Monsters University Essential Guide\", all of the members of Python Nu Kappa want to work at a [[crematorium]].

(franchise)|Monsters, Inc.]]'', including the 2001 film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and the 2013 film ''[[Monsters University]]'', and the [[Disney+]] series ''[[Monsters at Work]]''.\n\n==Setting==\n\n\nThe monster characters reside in the city of Monstropolis. According to a DVD bonus feature, Monstropolis was founded after all of the [[monster]]s who once co-existed with [[human]]s were chased off the mainland and eventually moved to an island on an unknown world where they have lived ever since. The only way for them to enter human-inhabited areas was via closet doors.\n\nThe company Monsters, Inc. provides Monstropolis with power from the screams of human children that have been scared by specialized agents who work for Monsters, Inc. called \"scarers\". There are also companies that rival Monsters, Inc. in this endeavor, such as Fear Co. and Scream Industries.\n\nThe city also provides universities at which monsters can study to scare, the most prominent in the storyline being Monsters University for its outstanding Scaring Program. One of its rivals is a college called Fear Tech.\n\n==Appearing in both films ==\n\n==={{Anchor|James P. Sullivan}}Sulley===\n'''James P. Sullivan''' or '''Sulley''' (voiced by [[John Goodman]] in the film series, [[Brian Cummings]] in the [[Monsters, Inc. (video game)|''Monsters, Inc.'' video game]], Joel McCrary in ''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' and ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', Christopher Swindle in ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'') is a tall blue-furred giant ogre with horns, purple spots, razor-sharp claws on his hands, furry talons for feet, a [[theropod]]-like tail, spikes running down his back and [[shark]]-like fangs. Even though he excels at scaring children, he is kindhearted, thoughtful and affects a relaxed, amiable personality. In the film's beginning, he is \"The Best Scarer\" for several months running.\n\n''[[Monsters University]]'' depicts the college-age Sulley as a talented but lazy student whose father Bill had made a name for himself as a proficient Scarer. He and Mike start as arch-rivals in their introductory scaring class, but eventually form a friendship that lasts even beyond their expulsion from the university.\n\n===Mike Wazowski===\n'''Michael''' \"'''Mike'''\" '''Wazowski''' (voiced by [[Billy Crystal]] in the film series, [[Carlos Alazraqui]] in the video games, Merchandise, attractions and commercials, Noah Johnston as his younger self in ''[[Monsters University]]''), is a one-eyed green monster with a round body and two small horns. He also has claws, but they are not as sharp as Sulley's.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Monsters University]]'', Mike is depicted as a proud monster. Mike had a lonesome childhood and struggled to make friends. On a class field trip to ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', Mike was inspired to become a scarer professionally, but other students made fun of him because he was perceived as undeniably \"unscary\".\n\nEven so, Mike was accepted into Monsters University's scare program, where he was introduced to James P. Sullivan in a SCARE 101 class. Mike initially disliked Sulley for his arrogance and bad work ethic. This dislike escalated into a major disruption made in class which resulted in Mike and Sulley's expulsion from the scare program. Mike then works out a deal with the dean of the school to re-enroll in the program on the stipulation that he wins the Games. Sulley joins Mike, despite Mike\u2019s protestations.\n\nMike and Sulley joined the Oozma Kappa fraternity at Monsters University to qualify for the Games. Mike and Sulley begin to build a friendship as they compete together. During the final event, Sulley cheats, and both Mike and Sulley are expelled from school. After being expelled, the two were offered jobs as workers in the Monsters, Inc. mailroom nonetheless. They advance through the ranks until Sully is a scarer and Mike is his assistant. In Monsters, Inc., Mike runs Sulley's station on the scare floor and they are close friends and roommates. Mike is dating Celia Mae at this time. Additionally, Mike helps Sulley in his mission to save Boo.\n\nMike is portrayed as a comedian in [[Tomorrowland]] at the [[Magic Kingdom]] in [[Walt Disney World Resort]] attraction, [[Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor]]. Mike is not only known for his humor, but also his intelligence. He has made appearances in other Pixar movies, such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mikewazowskimania.weebly.com/|title=Mike Wazowski Mania|website=Mike Wazowski Mania|access-date=2016-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Randall Boggs ===\n'''Randall Boggs''' (voiced by [[Steve Buscemi]] in the film series, [[Peter Kelamis]] in the ''Disney Infinity'' video game series, [[J.

He is Sulley's nemesis and Mike's arch-rival and former best friend.\n\nIn ''Monsters, Inc.'', he is Sulley's arch-rival on the scare floor, as well as Jeffrey Fungus' boss. The two vie for position as the area's top scream collector, a competition set up to encourage working. Ironically, Randall does manage to win top position for a few seconds, until Sulley comes back from a slumber party, thus winning it back. They also compete for The All-Time Scare Record. Henry J. Waternoose secretly approaches Randall and orders him to build a scream extraction machine, a vacuum-like device, and use it on kidnapped children to save the company and solving the energy crisis at large. One night, Randall leaves a door activated on the Scare Floor, when he was doing a bit of late-night work, and a little girl, later dubbed Boo, wanders out. Randall makes several attempts to get information out of Mike and Sulley on where the kid is. With Waternoose's help, Randall helps banish Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas and kidnap Boo. However, before they could extract the scream from her, Mike and Sulley return and Sulley destroys the machine, rescuing Boo. After a long chase through the millions of doors in the factory's door storage facility, Boo eventually conquers her fear of Randall and buys Sulley enough time to defeat him. Afterwards, Randall is forcibly exiled to the human world and winds up in a mobile home where the inhabitants beat him senseless, believing him to be an alligator. Sulley and Mike then destroy the door to prevent Randall from returning to the monster world.\n\nIn the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Randall enrolls at the same time as Mike and the two end up as friends and roommates. He is insecure and shy at first, having trouble controlling his camouflage abilities, but is a model bookworm. When Randall is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the top fraternity in the university, he quickly abandons Mike in order retain his standing with the fraternity. He slowly becomes more ambitious and confident, and ultimately becomes less empathetic and more self-centered. After an embarrassing failure at the Scare Games to Sulley, an embittered Randall vows to himself to never be outdone by Sulley again, thus starting their unfortunate conflict in Monsters, Inc.\n\n===Roz===\t\n\n'''Roz''' (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]) is a slug-like monster who is the key master and administrator of Scare Floor F. Near the end of the film, she is revealed to be Number One of the CDA, having been on an undercover assignment to investigate the company and expose Randall and Waternoose's scheme.\n\nShe also makes surprise appearances in three outtakes of the film: when Boo is in the toilet cubicle with Sulley, the CDA shaves and showers George Sanderson, and when Sulley proves to Boo that there is no one behind his closet door.\n\nShe appears briefly near the end of the prequel as a member of the CDA squad that responds to the break-in at the Door Lab. Although she wears a full-body protective suit that covers her face, her shape and voice give away her identity.\n\n===CDA===\nThe '''CDA''' (short for '''Child Detection Agency''' and voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Bill Farmer]], [[Pete Docter]], [[Lee Unkrich]], [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] and [[Teddy Newton]]) are an assortment of different monsters in [[hazmat suit]]s whose main job is to respond to any reported incidents of contact between monsters and children or their belongings, since it is believed that human objects are toxic. They isolate and destroy any items accidentally brought back into the monster world. Any monsters that comes in contact with a human object are quickly and forcibly decontaminated while having a neck cone applied afterwards.\n\nThey first appear when George Sanderson gets a sock on him and they had to decontaminate him after the sock is destroyed. When Boo gets into Monstropolis and appears at Harryhausen's, the CDA end up decontaminating the building and then disinfected the patrons. They later find the bag containing Boo that Mike and Sulley left behind at the restaurant, which traced them back to Monsters, Inc. where they end up searching the building. In one moment, two of the CDA members ask Sulley for an autograph to give to Bethany, the daughter of agent 00002, whom he mentions. Henry J. Waternoose had the CDA called in to cut the power to Boo's door as soon as it lands so as to contain Boo and arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike does a diversion that involved throwing one of Boo's socks on one of the agents and then had the other agents chase him. This trick enabled the CDA Agents to be present when Henry confesses his motives that involved abducting children to keep Monsters, Inc. alive. The CDA Agents arrest Waternoose as Mike and Sulley discover that Roz is the Number One of the CDA. During the credits, a CDA agent directs a monster to his seat during Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', the CDA are called when Mike and Sulley had entered a door that led to a human area. After Mike and Sulley make it back to Monsters University, they are taken away by the CDA.\n\n===Abominable Snowman===\n\nThe '''[[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]]''' (voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]]) or '''Yeti''', is a white-furred monster from Monstropolis who got banished to the [[Himalayas]] in the human world. He is an expert of making [[snow cone]]s. He greets Sulley and Mike when Waternoose and Randall banish them to the Himalayas. While the Abominable Snowman tries to make Mike and Sulley feel at home in his abode, he understands Sulley must rescue Boo, and tells him of a [[Nepal]]ese village at the foot of the mountain whereupon they can regain access to the monster world. Despite everything, the Abominable Snowman seems to have made the best of his fate and genuinely seems to enjoy the human world.\n\nIn the credits to ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', he appeared as the '''Abominable [[Snowplow]]'''.\n\nIn ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was shown to have worked as a [[mailroom]] supervisor at Monsters, Inc.. He warns Mike and Sulley not to mess with the mail which is a crime punished by banishment (which possibly hints why he was banished).\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters, Inc.''==\n===Boo===\n'''Boo''' (voiced by Mary Gibbs) is a 2-year-old human girl who becomes Sulley and Mike's friend.\n\nDuring Randall's secret late-night work on the Scare Floor, Boo gets into the factory and Sulley tries various attempts to put her back, none of which worked, so he eventually puts her inside a [[duffle bag]]. When Sulley brings this up with Mike at Harryhausen's, Boo gets out and frightens the patrons; the CDA have to \"decontaminate\" the restaurant. While Mike and Sulley are at home, they discover that the girl is not toxic after all. Sulley quickly grows attached to the girl and names her \"Boo\". The next day, they smuggle her into the factory disguised as a child of one of Sulley's relatives, and Mike attempts to return her through her door. Randall tries to kidnap Boo, but kidnaps Mike by mistake. Boo may not be afraid of Sulley, but when she was brought into the simulation room after Mike and Sulley escaped from Randall, she ended up severely frightened by Sulley's roar. When Mike and Sulley tried to return Boo to her home, Mr. Waternoose had Mike and Sulley exiled to the Himalayas. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from Randall's Scream Extractor. During the chase through the large storage vault, Boo's laughter ends up causing all the doors to operate. Eventually, Boo gets over being afraid of Randall, and helps to defeat him. Sulley and Mike are able to access Boo's door, but Mr. Waternoose and the CDA send it back to the Scare Floor. Mike distracts the CDA, while Sulley escapes with Boo and her door, although Waternoose follows. The CDA's undercover leader is revealed to be Roz, and she allows Sulley and Mike 5 minutes to return Boo to her world. Once Sulley and Mike have returned Boo to her room, her door is put through the shredder. Sometime later, Mike takes Sulley aside revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door requiring only one more piece which Sulley had taken as a memento, the one taped to his clipboard. Sulley inserts the last piece, reactivates the door and enters to find Boo there.\n\nBoo has had other cameo appearances in other Pixar films including ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.\n\n===Monsters, Inc. employees===\n====Henry J. Waternoose III ====\n'''Henry J. Waternoose III''' (voiced by [[James Coburn]]) is a five-eyed humanoid [[crustacean]]-like monster who is the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Monsters, Inc.. The company has been in Waternoose's family for 3 generations as he had inherited the company from his father at the age of 142. Waternoose also previously had a mentoring relationship with Sulley.  The monster wants to be the best one ever. \n\nWaternoose is first seen where he reminds Thaddeus Bile and the other trainees about the dangers of a human child getting into Monstropolis after Thaddeus left the door opened. He has been impressed with Sulley's progress. However, Mr. Waternoose is distraught to learn that the impending energy crisis is increasing, due to many children being desensitized and being unable to be scared by monsters, which might put the company on the verge of being shut down. \n\nWhen Sulley tells Waternoose that he can get the company through the energy crisis, Waternoose tells Sulley to tell that to the [[board of director]]s. When Boo is eventually discovered and Sulley and Mike wanted to return her home, Waternoose agrees to help them, but he later reveals that he and Randall are hand in glove. Waternoose was actually planning to kidnap Boo and several more children to extract their screams to fight the energy crisis and that Randall himself is just an accomplice to Waternoose's plan. \n\nAt that point, Waternoose betrayed both Sulley and Mike by exiling them to the Himalayas to ensure that they don't interfere with their plans any further (as they have found out too much about their scheme), though Waternoose would later regret his actions; he even argues with Randall about how he should not have trusted him since it led to him banishing his top employees in order to prevent them from exposing their scheme to the public. Regardless, Randall tells Waternoose the Scream Extractor would revolutionize Monsters, Inc., that there won't be any need for scarers and that Mike and Sulley \"got what they deserved\". Before Boo's screams can be extracted, Sulley returns and rescues Boo while destroying the machine and using it to pin Randall, Waternoose, and Fungus to the wall (although Randall was quick enough to avoid being trapped) before escaping as Randall gives pursuit. After Sulley and Mike defeat Randall and trap him in the [[Everglades]], Mr. Waternoose has called in the CDA to help apprehend Boo and arrest Sulley and Mike, attempting to frame them as the criminals responsible for the incident. Mike, carrying who they think is Boo, distracts them before running off. While the CDA gave chase to Mike, Sulley ran off with Boo as Waternoose gives chase after they accidentally get his attention. Waternoose follows Sulley to the simulation bedroom before Sulley jams the entrance shut with a metal pipe to hold back Waternoose long enough for Sulley to install Boo's door and supposedly activating it. He eventually manages to break through. In the room, Sulley confronts and argues with Waternoose over his and Randall's wrongdoings. Waternoose declares he will not stop attempting to end the energy crisis, even if it means kidnapping many children and doing away with anyone who stands in his way to ensure that their plot remains a secret. Brutishly knocking Sulley out of his way, he tries to grab Boo from the bed, but instead grabs the simulation child. Just then, the wall goes up to reveal that Mike is behind the controls and he records Sulley and Waternoose's confrontation, exposing Waternoose and Randall's plot as the corruptive CEO watches in shock, now realizing that he had been tricked. With this incriminating evidence and now knowing who the real criminal is, the CDA turns on Waternoose and arrests him. As he is being dragged away, Waternoose yells at Sulley, claiming that he destroyed the company and that the energy crisis will only get worse because of him before he is pulled out of the room. Waternoose is last seen loaded onto the CDA's van and taken to prison for his crimes as Sulley becomes the new CEO of Monsters, Inc., proving Waternoose's theory incorrect by changing the company's approach from scaring to laughter, allowing the company to gain enough power to end the energy crisis for good.\n\nDespite not appearing in the prequel ''[[Monsters University]]'', Waternoose is seen in a photo at the end of the movie shaking hands with Mike and Sulley as they are being promoted to becoming a Scare Team.\n\nThe [[Xenon (processor)|Xenon processor]], used in the [[Xbox 360]], developed by [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]] under the IBM chip program was codenamed \"Waternoose\" in the character's honor.<ref>[https://www.designnews.com/automation-motion-control/learning-failure/77528067352048 \"Learning from failure - The inside story on how IBM out-foxed Intel with the Xbox 360\"], Dean Takahashi, ''Electronic Business'', May 1, 2006</ref>\n\n====Celia Mae====\n'''Celia Mae''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Tilly]]) is a one-eyed monster with [[snake]]-like hair and tentacles for legs. She works as a [[receptionist]] at Monsters, Inc. and is Mike Wazowski's girlfriend. When Mike is at a date with Celia at Harryhausen's, a sushi restaurant,  Boo made herself known as the CDA raid the place and use a device that caused an energy dome that \"decontaminated\" Harryhausen's. Celia was among the monsters who were decontaminated at that time, which then forces her and her snakes hairs to wear neck cones after enduring the decontamination, much to her embarrassment. As a result, Celia is now angry at Mike and she confronts him the next day, and she unintentionally slips Mike's involvement in the incident the previous night while scolding him, which Randall discovers. When Mike and Sulley were being chased by Randall, Celia angrily grabbed onto Mike threatening to break up with him if he did not tell her what was happening; though Mike stated that they are trying to get Boo back to her room, Celia didn't believe him at first until Boo appeared over Sulley's shoulder. Celia does a diversion by announcing that Randall had broken the Scare Record. She is seen again at the end of the film, having fully recovered and made amends with Mike, and tells him that a box full of magazines has just arrived. Both she and Mike are surprised to see that Mike has made the cover of the magazine. During the credits, Celia takes part in Mike and Sulley's play \"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me\".\n\nDespite not appearing in ''[[Monsters University]]'', Celia is seen in a photo in Mike's locker room, where he puts up a new photo of himself and Sulley in their first day as a Scarer Team, next to Celia's near the end of the movie.\n\n====Jeffrey Fungus====\n'''Jeffrey Fungus''' (voiced by [[Frank Oz]]) is Randall's red-skinned three-eyed assistant. Despite being partnered with Fungus, Randall seems to be annoyed by his antics and would often abuse him and boss him around. Fungus also is terrified by Randall's behavior and his involvement in the plot to kidnap human children and extract their screams forcibly, but feels either blackmailed or too intimidated to confront Randall, and is inwardly glad that Mike and Sulley are sabotaging the sinister conspiracy. When Randall attempts to test the extraction machine on Mike, Sulley puts Fungus on the chair and rescues Mike. The scream machine renders Fungus nearly unconscious and blanches him white,  showing that the machine asphyxiates its victims. In the end following Randall's defeat and Waternoose's arrest, Fungus is forgiven for his involvement and is now happy taking on a job of making children laugh to collect more power.\n\n====Needleman and Smitty====\n'''Needleman and Smitty''' (both voiced by [[Dan Gerson]] in the film, [[Stephen Stanton]] in ''[[Monsters at Work]]'') are two monsters that work as maintenance and errand monsters at Monsters, Inc.. Both of them worship Sulley and the ground that he walks upon. One of their jobs at Monsters, Inc. is to operate the Door Shredder, a [[woodchipper]]-like device that shreds the doors of children that are not afraid of monsters.\n\nIn one of the outtakes of the film, Smitty accidentally calls Sullivan \"Solomon\", while another outtake sees the Door Shredder shred the door too fast; it later runs backstage with them holding on to it, almost destroying the backstage equipment and props. Needleman and Smitty are also part of the company play, taking the roles as Randall and Fungus respectively.\n\n====Scarers of Scare Floor F====\nThe '''Scarers of Scare Floor F''' are the co-workers at Monsters, Inc.. Apart from James P. Sullivan and Randall Boggs, among these are:\n\n* '''Augustus''' \"'''Spike'''\" '''Jones''' - An red [[slug]]-like monster with tons of retractable purple spikes on his back. In \"Monsters University\", it was shown that Spike had graduated from Fear Tech and was a former worker at Fear Co.\n* '''Bob Peterson''' (voiced by [[Jack Angel]]) - A light blue [[dinosaur]]-like monster with removable teeth. He is named after [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]].\n* '''George Sanderson''' (voiced by Samuel Lord Black) - A one-horned furry monster who is good friends with Mike, Sulley, Lanky, and Claws. In ''[[Monsters University]]'', he was a member of the Jaws Theta Chi fraternity. In Monsters, Inc., when George emerged from one of the doors with a sock on him, his assistant Charlie sees the sock and shouts \"23-19\" which ended up calling in the CDA to take care of the situation. After the sock is removed and destroyed, George is then shaved, showered, and applied a neck cone to him. This becomes a running gag, as when in the locker room, the toys that Sulley hid in a nearby locker fell on George causing Charlie to shout \"23-19\" which caused the CDA to work on him again. When Charlie picks out a door to a house in the Himalayas, Sulley emerges from it and unknowingly placed a sock on him. Charlie shouts \"23-19\", but this time, George shoved the sock in Charlie's mouth and banished him by throwing him through the door but he escaped through the door and was with George seeing Waternoose being out in the CDA van. \n* '''Harley P. Gerson''' - An orange monster with only a large mouth and two legs.\n* '''Harry''' \"'''Bud'''\" '''Lucky''' - A thin turquoise [[Octopus]] monster with long shaggy purple hair covering his face. \n* '''Joe Ranft''' - A purple monster with huge fists and three eyes. He is named after [[Joe Ranft]].\n* '''Nicholas''' \"'''Lanky'''\" '''Schmidt''' (voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]) - A monster with a small head and long arms and legs who is good friends with Pete \"Claws\" Ward and George Sanderson. When interviewed about the \"kid-tastrophe\", he claimed Boo flew over him and used laser vision to blast a car.\n* '''Pete''' \"'''Claws'''\" '''Ward''' (voiced by [[Joe Ranft]]) - A blue [[crocodile]]-like monster with retractable sharp claws and horrifying breath who is good friends with his assistant. When working on one door, he ran out and told his assistant that the child he tried to scare almost touched him resulting in his assistant calling for a door shredder making it the 58th door the company lost this week. He appears to be less fearsome than he tries to make himself look, as he was seen despairing at his aforementioned failed scare attempt and later crying during Mike's solo number in the company play. \n* '''Ricky Plesuski''' - A green monster with a huge mouth filled with sharp teeth, [[snail]]-like eyes, and eight legs. In \"Monsters University\", it is shown that Ricky had graduated from Fear Tech and was a former worker at Fear Co and Scream Industries.\n* '''Josh Rivera''' (voiced by [[Lee Unkrich]]) - A tall, slender orange monster with six tentacles for arms and four shorter tentacles for legs. \n* '''Theodore''' \"'''Ted'''\" '''Pauley''' (voiced by Katherine Ringgold) - A purple monster with a [[Gorilla]]-like stature and 16 removable eyes.\n\nIn an outtake of the film, as the scarers make their entrance to Scare Floor F, Sulley trips and falls, causing a domino effect where all the other scarers fall as well. After everybody gets tripped over, a crew member peeks his head out clapping the upside-down [[clapperboard]].\n\n====Assistants to the Scarers of Floor F====\n* '''Betty''' (voiced by [[Teresa Ganzel]]) - A light blue monster who is the assistant of Rivera.\n* '''Charlie Proctor''' (voiced by [[Philip Proctor]]) - A blue monster with [[snail]]-like eyes and tentacles for arms that is the assistant of George Sanderson. He would often freak out whenever a human object would come in contact with George, leading to the latter's forcible decontamination by the CDA.\n* '''Chuck''' (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]) - A pink [[frog]]-like monster with four arms and also assists Claws Ward.\n* '''Stuart''' - A turquoise monster with [[crab]]-like legs and a stalk with one eye who assists Harley Gerson.\n*'''Frank''' (voiced by [[Paul Eiding]]) - A one-eyed four-armed green monster with no visible mouth that has a ruff of fur around his stalk. He also assists Bob Peterston.\n* '''Kevin''' - The assistant of Ted Pauley and is a yellow Chalooby.\n* '''Marge''' - (voiced by Mickie McGowan) The assistant of Schmidt and a [[starfish]]-like monster.\n* '''Glenn''' - A light green [[gracility|slender]] monster with around 4 or 5 legs who assists Joe J.J. Ranft.\n* '''Eric'''  - The assistant of Lucky and is a red Chalooby.\n* '''Jimmy Waxford''' - A five-eyed monster with tentacles for legs that is the assistant of Spike. He was mentioned by Mike as having shifty eyes and was later seen with Randall asking if he knows anything about Boo.\n* '''Zack''' - A 3-eyed [[pistachio]]-like monster who assists Ricky.\n\n====Thaddeus Bile====\n'''Thaddeus Bile''' (voiced by [[Jeff Pidgeon]]) is a trainee Scarer who is also called \"'''Phlegm'''\". He was seen at the beginning of the movie botching his training by leaving the door open as well as being scared by the simulation child (voiced by [[Lisa Raggio]]) causing him to slip on a soccer ball and fall on some jacks. By the end of the film, he begins working on Scare Floor F where he has successfully made a child laugh by slipping on a soccer ball and falling on some jacks again.\n\n====Ms. Linda Flint====\n'''Ms. Linda Flint''' (voiced by [[Bonnie Hunt]]) is an employee at Monsters, Inc. that manages the simulation tests that monsters must pass in order to become scarers. Ms. Flint is a tall, red and black monster with dark red fins attached to her eyes, has long, sharp claws, wears a black jacket and a long, snakelike tail.\n\n===Jerry Slugworth===\n'''Jerry Slugworth''' (voiced by [[Steve Susskind]]) is a red monster with seven fingers who works as a [[Television floor manager|floor manager]] for Scare Floor F.\n\n===Tony===\n'''Tony''' (voiced by [[Guido Quaroni]]) is a tall, slender orange monster with a moustache, two tentacles for arms and four shorter tentacles for legs. He is a [[grocer]] that works at Tony's Grossery and was first seen telling Mike and Sulley that somebody is about to break the All-Scare Record and throws them blood oranges while wishing them the best of luck.\n\n===Ted===\n\n'''Ted''' is the largest monster in the movie; he's so big, only his elephant-like legs, covered with large, coarse brown scales, are shown at all. He also seems to be the only monster that can't talk, instead crowing like a rooster. He is shown at a crossroads waiting for the light to change with Mike and Sulley. Sulley yells \"Good Morning\" up at him, he crows back, then the light turns green, and Ted stumps across the road, causing an earthquake with every step.\n\n==Appearing in ''Monsters University''==\n===University staff===\n====Dean Abigail Hardscrabble====\n'''[[Dean (education)|Dean]] Abigail Hardscrabble''' (voiced by [[Helen Mirren]]<ref name=EmpireMirren>{{cite news|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|title=Helen Mirren Set For Monsters University|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=36472|accessdate=February 12, 2013|newspaper=Empire|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref>) is the strict dean of Monsters University. She is a red [[dragon]]-like monster with [[centipede]]-like legs and red [[bat]] wings. She was modeled after a type of centipede called ''[[Scolopendra gigantea]],'' also known as the Amazonian giant centipede. When Dean Hardscrabble attended Monsters University in her youth, she was a member of the Eta Hiss Hiss sorority and is the founder and a four-time consecutive champion of the Scare Games.\n\nShe first appears where she flies into Professor Derek Knight's class at the beginning of the first day. She then also appears during the Scare Exam at the end of the semester that helps to weed out the least-worthy scarers from the University's School of Scaring. Mike was kicked out as Hardscrabble considered him \"not scary\", and Sulley was kicked out when he performed an incorrect scare due to his lack of studying and preparation. Mike later finds out that the only way to get back into the scaring program is to compete in the Scare Games with a fraternity of rejected monsters called Oozma Kappa. As a result, Mike makes a deal with Dean Hardscrabble that if Oozma Kappa wins the Games, they will be reinstated back into the scaring program. Otherwise if they lose, Mike will have to leave the school. Sensing this opportunity, Sulley offers to join in Oozma Kappa allowing the team to gain entry.\n\nDuring the Scare Games, Dean Hardscrabble is secretly watching Mike and Sulley competing from afar, aware and expecting that they are both going to fail. For the Toxicity challenge after Oozma Kappa came in last place, Hardscrabble stated to Mike that only a miracle can save him from expulsion. By coincidence before she could even finish her sentence, one miracle actually happened when Brock Pearson announces that Jaws Theta Chi is disqualified for using an illegal protective sting ointment during the Toxicity challenge which puts Oozma Kappa back into the competition. Dean Hardscrabble then keeps an eye on Oozma Kappa during the remaining challenges.\n\nBut after Oozma Kappa wins the Games when they beat Roar Omega Roar in the final round with the scare simulators, Sulley confesses to Hardscrabble that he cheated by setting Mike's simulator level to easy just to make Oozma Kappa win due to Mike's inability to scare. An outraged Hardscrabble orders him to leave the campus when all of a sudden, she is alerted that Mike had secretly snuck into the door lab, prompting Sulley to go there to save his friend, despite Harscrabble's warnings.\n\nDean Hardscrabble then shuts down the door in question, which led to a cabin at a campsite in a park until the authorities arrive, but Mike and Sulley manage to escape back by scaring several human adults in the form of a team of [[park ranger]]s. Mike's break-in led to him being expelled from Monsters University along with Sulley for rigging a game score, but Hardscrabble was sad to let them go. While considered as a major offense to her school, they ended up surprising her (something which no one has ever done). Dean Hardscrabble had the rest of Oozma Kappa enroll into the Scaring Program, admitting to Sulley and Mike that she was impressed by their performances in the Games.\n\n====Professor Derek Knight====\n'''Professor Derek Knight''' (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]<ref name=DigitalSpyCharacters>{{cite news|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title='Monsters University' unveils character posters, ID cards|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a460540/monsters-university-unveils-character-posters-id-cards.html|accessdate=February 21, 2013|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>) is a [[dinosaur]]-like monster who teaches SCARING 101: Intro to Scaring at the School of Scaring. He often weeds out the least worthy students so that the best of the best can move on to becoming Scarers. Professor Knight is also shown to be a fan of Bill Sullivan, Sully's father. When he is first seen during the exam that would determine who will take part in the School of Scaring, Dean Abigail Hardscrabble \"assists\" him where she weeds out Mike for not being scary and Sully for doing an incorrect scare. Professor Knight is later seen with Dean Hardscrabble when Sully admits that he rigged Mike's scare simulator during the final Scare Games event. During the credits, he has a card saying that he worked at Fear. Co.\n\n====Professor William Brandywine====\n'''Professor William Brandywine''' is a round monster with yellow fur whose eyes are invisible. He works at Monsters University's School of Engineering where he teaches Scream Canister Designs to his students. Don Carlton's character model was used to make Professor Brandywine.\n\n====Librarian====\nThe '''[[Librarian]]''' (voiced by [[Marcia Wallace]]) is an elderly female monster that works at the library at Monsters University. She is a large [[slug]]-headed teacher with six monstrous tentacles for legs and gray hair. The Librarian is involved in the \"Avoid the Parent\" challenge of the Scare Games where the Librarian's reaction to noise is made to emulate the danger of parents and how a Scarer has to get along without being caught by one. Any team who is caught by the Librarian is thrown out of the library and eliminated from the competition. That is what happened to Slugma Slugma Kappa when they were caught by the Librarian. The Oozma Kappa group gives up on silence after Sulley accidentally knocks over with a ladder and they start a noisy display to distract and confuse the Librarian to get their flag.\n\n===University students===\n====Oozma Kappa students====\n'''Oozma Kappa''' ('''O\u039a''', suggestive of \"[[OK]]\") is one of the six fraternities at Monsters University. It is mostly filled with good-natured misfits. Besides the protagonists Mike and Sulley, among the members of Oozma Kappa are:\n\n* '''Don Carlton''' (voiced by [[Joel Murray]]<ref name=\"2011D23\">{{cite news|last=Eisenberg|first=Eric|title=Monsters University Voice Cast And Plot Details Announced At D23|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Monsters-University-Voice-Cast-And-Plot-Details-Announced-At-D23-26344.html|accessdate=March 6, 2012|newspaper=Cinema Blend|date=August 20, 2011}}</ref>) - Don Carlton is a red-skinned mature monster with a [[bat]]-like mustache and [[octopus]]-like tentacles for arms who returned to Monsters University to learn how to use computers and maybe consider trying for scaring. He is the President of Oozma Kappa. Don later got engaged to Scott \"Squishy\" Squibbles' mother Sherri. During the credits, it is shown that Don had gotten a job as a scarer at Monsters, Inc., under the moniker \"Dangerous Don Carlton\".\n* '''Art''' (voiced by [[Charlie Day]]<ref name=\"2011D23\"/>) - Art is a purple furry monster with an arch shape and a questionable background (in a scene he revealed that he was in jail before). It is shown during the credits that he got a job as a scarer at Monsters, Inc..\n* '''Scott''' \"'''Squishy'''\" '''Squibbles''' (voiced by [[Peter Sohn]]<ref name=\"2011D23\"/><ref name=PTCharacters />) - Scott Squibbles is a five-eyed jelly monster whose mother owns the fraternity house. It is shown during the credits that he got a job as a scarer at Monsters, Inc., under the moniker 'Scott \"Scary\" Squibbles'.\n* '''Terri and Terry Perry''' (voiced by [[Sean Hayes (actor)|Sean Hayes]]<ref name=PTCharacters>{{cite news|last=Rizvi|first=Samad|title=New \u2018Monsters University\u2019 Characters Revealed, Sean Hayes and Charlie Day Join Cast|url=http://pixartimes.com/2013/02/12/new-monsters-university-characters-revealed-sean-hayes-and-charlie-day-join-cast/|accessdate=February 20, 2013|newspaper=Pixar Times|date=February 12, 2013}}</ref> and [[Dave Foley]]<ref name=\"2011D23\"/>) - Terri and Terry are a two-headed monster with one eye on each head, four arms, and tentacles for legs. Terri's head has one horn while Terry's head has two horns. Terri, a dance major, is the naively optimistic one of the two while Terry, an English major, is more morose but has a fondness for [[close-up magic]].

{"title_page": "Funerary art in Puritan New England", "text_new": "[[File:Granary Burying Ground, Boston A.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Granary Burying Ground]], Boston MA]]\n'''Funerary art in Puritan New England''' encompasses graveyard [[headstone]]s carved between c. 1640 to the late 18th century by the [[Puritans|English Puritans]], founders of the first American colonies, and their immediate descants. The earliest graves were usually dug at random in designated local burial grounds, in rare instances marked with upright stones containing factual but inelegant inscriptions. The next generation of colonialists decorated the sites of their dead with carvings in [[slate]], [[sandstone]] and [[granite]]; the most impressive examples show a death's head; a sylized skull sometimes with wings or crossed bones.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> Later examples show the deceased carried by the wings that would apparently take its soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth (2003), p. 206</ref> From the 1690s the imagery becomes less severe, and began to include winged [[cherubs]] (known as ''soul effigies'') who had fuller faces and rounder and more life-sized eyes and mouths.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe minimalist artistry of the earliest known designs reflects the puritan's stern religious doctrine; largely avoiding unnecessary decoration or embellishment. Much later, coffins, [[urn]]s and the Triumph of Death became common iconographical elements, along with [[memento mori]] such as hourglasses and [[scythe]]s.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref> Their burial practices convey a practical attitudes to 17th mortality rates; death was an ever present fact for colonists of the time.<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> Later mid-18th imagery [[urn]]s and [[willow tree]]s (symbolising earthly sorrows) are common, but not really puritan motifs.<ref name=\"wb206\" /> In the 1690's \n\nNew England's early [[funerary art]] provides an unique insight into the Puritan view of death. Although they vehemently rejected Catholic imagery, their headstones and their inscriptions leave concrete evidence for their devotion to sculptural religious art.<ref>Prioli (1981), p. 328</ref> The primary objective of their funerary art was to extol the virtues of paradise and the transformation of the flesh to spirit; a distinct shift that rejected traditional European art traditions.\n\n==Early burial places==\nThe earliest puritan graves were either unmarked, or had very simple greenstone [[headstone]]s with little order to their plotting,{{efn-ua|Individual plots were often dug in random spots in the burial ground. See Green (2017), p. 13}}<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and no decorations or ornamentation to mark individual graves.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref> This was in part because the earliest settlers sought to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images. Some graves were marked by wooden sign or an uncut rock, with only very few having a carved headstone.<ref name=\"h342\">Hijiya (1983), p. 342</ref> According to writer Meg Greene \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> The inscriptions were brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\" with a [[interpunct]] (raised period) between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> By the mid-1600s, their headstones had become increasingly elaborate, describing the nature and frequency of death in dark, bleak and often bitter imagery.<ref name=\"G13\" />\n\nMid period imagery is largely uniform. Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are always given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 502</ref> A significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such grave yard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen and woman who designed and built the headstones were most often locally commissioned generalists rather than specialists, who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce locally, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. A significant number of surviving examples share a decorative traditions, which some variation between regions,<ref name=\"d502\" /> and through [[probate]] documentation, newspaper announcements and inscripted signatures, researches have been able to associate the carvers behind particular headstones with identifiable historical people.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nRural carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]] and [[Geometry|geometric]] and, at times abstract, patterns, in a unstylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoch.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\n==Attitude towards death==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Boston MA]]\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type towards a more provincial [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this it reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" /> Although the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, nor did show depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\nAlthough modern society sharply avoids the reality of everyday disposal of its communities' dead, in puritan society these were common facts of life. Thus, their art reflects a pragmatic approach, embracing realistic imagery that evokes human decay into skulls and bones. Their use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\nA common approach in the 1980s and 1990s in academic literature was to treat these older graveyards as [[museum]]s, that is (in the words of Meyer), treat the cemeteries as \"outdoor, spatially delineated repositories of cultural artifacts\",<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> and as material to understand the thoughts of the people who had created them. The historian [[Terry G. Jordan-Bychkov|Terry G. Jordan]] agrees with this, and said that, given such artifact's density and state of preservation in New   England, \"nowhere else [in America] is it possible to look so deeply into our people's past\".<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> Meyer's takes this further, writing that the grave art of this period \"exhibit patterns of change over temporal spans...and...can in many instances yield valuable cultural insights to a number of discrete time periods, including the present.\"<ref name=\"m2\" /> Following Forbes work, researchers applied [[social sciences]] techniques in interpretation.<ref name=\"m3\" />\n\nHijiya urged caution and rose concerns on the prevailing academic approach and methodology, and noted how the early carvers left no account record of their intentions, and so their motives cannot be easily interpreted, and observed that there is no remaining instance of any articulated evidence which indicates even \"their outlook on life and death.\"<ref name=\"h339-40\">Hijiya (1983), pp. 339-340</ref> Although a significant scholar in the field, Hijiya urges that reading into the meaning of any stone has to consider \"information extraneous to the stones themselves\" such as \"writings produced at the same time as the carvings, though by different hands [and] aesthetic or anthropological theory which purports to illuminate human behavior at any time\".<ref name=\"h340\">Hijiya (1983), p. 340</ref> Hijiya suggested an approach similar to the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]], a major figure in formulating 20th century interpretative scholarship, quoting Panofsky's advice that there is no reason to assume that any decoration is \"uniquely determined.\"<ref name=\"h340\" />\n\nWriting in 1983, the cultural historian James Hijiya broke American gravestones into six broad and overlapping styles (of which the first three are in scope for this article) which he said reflect \"six different attitudes toward death\".<ref name=\"h341\">Hijiya (1983), p. 341</ref> They were:\n\n# \"Plain Style\" (1640-1710): Resignation \n# \"Death's Head\" (1670-1770): Awe\n# \"Angel\" (1740-1820): Confidence\n# \"Um and Willow\" (1780-1850): Mourning \n# \"Monumentalism\" (1840-1920): Defiance\n# \"Modem Plain Style\" (1900-2001): Ignorance<ref name=\"h341\" />\n\nAccording to Hijiya, the Plain Style \"is hardly a style at all\", consisting of little more than un-ornamented, factual and inscriptions. It begins in the very early Colonial period, and lasts until roughly the first decade of the Eighteenth century. In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools, and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons. This explains in part why it remained in some areas later than others; with craftsmen in some areas developing their skills quicker than in others.<ref>Hijiya (1983), pp. 341-342</ref> A further reason may be that the early puritans, due to their feelings on humility and lack of regard for adornments, deliberately kept their headstones simple and minimalist.<ref name=\"h342\" /> A significant amount of stones for the Eighteenth century contain [[epithet]]s, so it becomes possible to tell something of the attitudes and outlook of both the masons and the deceased.<ref name=\"d502\" />\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Boston Puritan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Winged death headstone in [[Granary Burying Ground]], Boston. 17th century]]\nThe death's head is one of the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in the New England Puritan art. It is most common on older stones, typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was less about dread in Puritan New England, and more an accepted part of the human life cycle. In their belief system, death was when the flesh passed away to make way for renewal in the afterlife.<ref name=\"l77\">Ludwig (2000), p. 77</ref> The skulls should be taken in context of puritan funeral rituals in total, and their approach to [[elegy|elegies]], funerals rites and [[sermon]]s.<ref>Prioli (1980) , p. 334</ref> Death is first a winged head, but over time, evolved towards glorification of the soul. \n\nAnother depiction of death is a full skeletal body, typically holding a scythe or with the moon and sun in his hands, an image meant to instill the terrors of death. In the corners of a typical stone with this depiction are angels at the top and bats of the underworld at the bottom. The scythe is most often mid swing among flowers symbolizes the flowering of a man's life cut off by death and time.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Hurd headstone (36088).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Later example;gravestone of Elizabeth Hurd (d. 1779), Boston]]\nA winged death head generally symbolizes the triumph of death. A typical image has serrated teeth, \u201chole eyes,\u201d a thin elongated jaw, and a slash for a mouth. This image has been commonly used since Elizabethan times.\n\nLater, the death's head image became less stern and menacing. The figure become crowned, with the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century. Particularly, the eyes become more animated\u2014almond shaped and with pupils\u2014seeming more soul-like than deathlike. Extra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and resurrection. This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones with a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.\n\n===Later iconographical motifs===\nContinuing the evolution of the winged death head to the glorification of the soul, soul effigies comprise skull-like representations of the soul developed into soul effigies<ref name=\"l168\">Ludwig (2000), p. 168</ref> with distinctly human faces. Some are placed in an enclosing motif, such as a solar symbol or a tree. Others retain the angels wings commonly seen in the death head.<ref name=\"l168\" />\n\nThe imps of death are depicted as small evil [[demon]]s bearing the arrows of death are sometimes found on early 18th century New England gravestones. They are particularly associated with the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] stone mason Joseph Lamson, who carved [[imp]]s either [[pallbearer|pallbearing]] or adorned with imagery of death and decay such as [[scythe]]s, darts of death, or [[hourglass]]es.<ref name=\"l100\">Ludwig (2000), p. 100</ref>\n\nThe inclusion of cherubs mostly dates from the mid 18th century have a direct lineage to earlier funerary art, in that they often show a living human arched by wings.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> However, the 18th century art and epitaphs of the descendants of the original puritans tends towards solemn epitaphs encouraging reflection on mortality and the brevity of life,<ref name=\"BGov\" /> and is not of much art historical interest.\n\n==Study==\nSerious academic study of early puritan funerary art is a relatively new field. The historian and photographer [[Harriette Forbes]], working with the historian [[Ernest Caulfield]] in Massachusetts during the 1920's, was the first to study the subject and amassed the first significant library of photographs and an expansive catalog of 16th century graves.<ref name=\"p328\">Prioli (1979/80), p.328</ref> Her book \"Gravestones of Early New England and the Men Who Made Them, 1653-1800\" classified and interpret the artifacts in the context of the dominant religious and cultural influences of their times.<ref name=\"m3\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 3</ref> The influential puritan minister, author, and pamphleteer [[Cotton Mather]] observed in 1693 how \"the stones in this wilderness are already grown so witty as to speak\".<ref name=\"m1\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 1</ref> However modern scholars take a more circumspect view, in that most of the early carvers were often armatures, and although they had basic understandings of [[iconography]], their style and language evolved in a setting cut off from European trends, or a coherent, internal, written discourse. The historian [[Richard Meyer (academic)|Richard Meyer]] largely agrees with Mather's claim, and notes how the path of study of these early graveyards understood that such artifacts, \"through a variety of complex and often interrelated manifestations, establish patterns of communication (and even dynamic interaction) with those who use or view them\".<ref name=\"m1\" />\n\nThe next major publication was Allen Ludwig's 1966 book \"Graven Images: New England Stone Carving and its Symbols, 1650-1815\", although it tended to focus on specific examples, rather than present broad overviews or analysis.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Benes, Peter; Montague Benes; Jane. \"Puritan Gravestone Art II\".

The earliest graves were usually dug at random in designated local burial grounds, in rare instances marked with upright stones containing factual but inelegant inscriptions. The next generation of colonialists decorated the sites of their dead with carvings in [[slate]], [[sandstone]] and [[granite]]; the most impressive examples show a death's head; a sylized skull sometimes with wings or crossed bones.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> Later examples show the deceased carried by the wings that would apparently take its soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth (2003), p. 206</ref> From the 1690s the imagery becomes less severe, and began to include winged [[cherubs]] (known as ''soul effigies'') who had fuller faces and rounder and more life-sized eyes and mouths.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe minimalist artistry of the earliest known designs reflects the puritan's stern religious doctrine; largely avoiding unnecessary decoration or embellishment. Much later, coffins, [[urn]]s and the Triumph of Death became common iconographical elements, along with [[memento mori]] such as hourglasses and [[scythe]]s.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref> Their burial practices convey a practical attitudes to 17th mortality rates; death was an ever present fact for colonists of the time.<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> Later mid-18th imagery [[urn]]s and [[willow tree]]s (symbolising earthly sorrows) are common, but not really puritan motifs.<ref name=\"wb206\" /> In the 1690's \n\nNew England's early [[funerary art]] provides an unique insight into the Puritan view of death. Although they vehemently rejected Catholic imagery, their headstones and their inscriptions leave concrete evidence for their devotion to sculptural religious art.<ref>Prioli (1981), p. 328</ref> The primary objective of their funerary art was to extol the virtues of paradise and the transformation of the flesh to spirit; a distinct shift that rejected traditional European art traditions.\n\n==Early burial places==\nThe earliest puritan graves were either unmarked, or had very simple greenstone [[headstone]]s with little order to their plotting,{{efn-ua|Individual plots were often dug in random spots in the burial ground. See Green (2017), p. 13}}<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and no decorations or ornamentation to mark individual graves.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref> This was in part because the earliest settlers sought to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images. Some graves were marked by wooden sign or an uncut rock, with only very few having a carved headstone.<ref name=\"h342\">Hijiya (1983), p. 342</ref> According to writer Meg Greene \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> The inscriptions were brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\" with a [[interpunct]] (raised period) between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" /> By the mid-1600s, their headstones had become increasingly elaborate, describing the nature and frequency of death in dark, bleak and often bitter imagery.<ref name=\"G13\" />\n\nMid period imagery is largely uniform. Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are always given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 502</ref> A significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such grave yard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen and woman who designed and built the headstones were most often locally commissioned generalists rather than specialists, who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce locally, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. A significant number of surviving examples share a decorative traditions, which some variation between regions,<ref name=\"d502\" /> and through [[probate]] documentation, newspaper announcements and inscripted signatures, researches have been able to associate the carvers behind particular headstones with identifiable historical people.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nRural carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]] and [[Geometry|geometric]] and, at times abstract, patterns, in a unstylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoch.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\n==Attitude towards death==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Boston MA]]\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type towards a more provincial [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this it reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" /> Although the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, nor did show depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\nAlthough modern society sharply avoids the reality of everyday disposal of its communities' dead, in puritan society these were common facts of life. Thus, their art reflects a pragmatic approach, embracing realistic imagery that evokes human decay into skulls and bones. Their use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\nA common approach in the 1980s and 1990s in academic literature was to treat these older graveyards as [[museum]]s, that is (in the words of Meyer), treat the cemeteries as \"outdoor, spatially delineated repositories of cultural artifacts\",<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> and as material to understand the thoughts of the people who had created them. The historian [[Terry G. Jordan-Bychkov|Terry G. Jordan]] agrees with this, and said that, given such artifact's density and state of preservation in New   England, \"nowhere else [in America] is it possible to look so deeply into our people's past\".<ref name=\"m2\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 2</ref> Meyer's takes this further, writing that the grave art of this period \"exhibit patterns of change over temporal spans...and...can in many instances yield valuable cultural insights to a number of discrete time periods, including the present.\"<ref name=\"m2\" /> Following Forbes work, researchers applied [[social sciences]] techniques in interpretation.<ref name=\"m3\" />\n\nHijiya urged caution and rose concerns on the prevailing academic approach and methodology, and noted how the early carvers left no account record of their intentions, and so their motives cannot be easily interpreted, and observed that there is no remaining instance of any articulated evidence which indicates even \"their outlook on life and death.\"<ref name=\"h339-40\">Hijiya (1983), pp. 339-340</ref> Although a significant scholar in the field, Hijiya urges that reading into the meaning of any stone has to consider \"information extraneous to the stones themselves\" such as \"writings produced at the same time as the carvings, though by different hands [and] aesthetic or anthropological theory which purports to illuminate human behavior at any time\".<ref name=\"h340\">Hijiya (1983), p. 340</ref> Hijiya suggested an approach similar to the art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]], a major figure in formulating 20th century interpretative scholarship, quoting Panofsky's advice that there is no reason to assume that any decoration is \"uniquely determined.\"<ref name=\"h340\" />\n\nWriting in 1983, the cultural historian James Hijiya broke American gravestones into six broad and overlapping styles (of which the first three are in scope for this article) which he said reflect \"six different attitudes toward death\".<ref name=\"h341\">Hijiya (1983), p. 341</ref> They were:\n\n# \"Plain Style\" (1640-1710): Resignation \n# \"Death's Head\" (1670-1770): Awe\n# \"Angel\" (1740-1820): Confidence\n# \"Um and Willow\" (1780-1850): Mourning \n# \"Monumentalism\" (1840-1920): Defiance\n# \"Modem Plain Style\" (1900-2001): Ignorance<ref name=\"h341\" />\n\nAccording to Hijiya, the Plain Style \"is hardly a style at all\", consisting of little more than un-ornamented, factual and inscriptions. It begins in the very early Colonial period, and lasts until roughly the first decade of the Eighteenth century. In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools, and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons. This explains in part why it remained in some areas later than others; with craftsmen in some areas developing their skills quicker than in others.<ref>Hijiya (1983), pp. 341-342</ref> A further reason may be that the early puritans, due to their feelings on humility and lack of regard for adornments, deliberately kept their headstones simple and minimalist.<ref name=\"h342\" /> A significant amount of stones for the Eighteenth century contain [[epithet]]s, so it becomes possible to tell something of the attitudes and outlook of both the masons and the deceased.<ref name=\"d502\"\n\n==Iconography==\n[[File:Boston Puritan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Winged death headstone in [[Granary Burying Ground]], Boston. 17th century]]\nThe death's head is one of the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in the New England Puritan art. It is most common on older stones, typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was less about dread in Puritan New England, and more an accepted part of the human life cycle. In their belief system, death was when the flesh passed away to make way for renewal in the afterlife.<ref name=\"l77\">Ludwig (2000), p. 77</ref> The skulls should be taken in context of puritan funeral rituals in total, and their approach to [[elegy|elegies]], funerals rites and [[sermon]]s.<ref>Prioli (1980) , p. 334</ref> Death is first a winged head, but over time, evolved towards glorification of the soul. \n\nAnother depiction of death is a full skeletal body, typically holding a scythe or with the moon and sun in his hands, an image meant to instill the terrors of death. In the corners of a typical stone with this depiction are angels at the top and bats of the underworld at the bottom. The scythe is most often mid swing among flowers symbolizes the flowering of a man's life cut off by death and time.\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Hurd headstone (36088).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Later example;gravestone of Elizabeth Hurd (d. 1779), Boston]]\nA winged death head generally symbolizes the triumph of death. A typical image has serrated teeth, \u201chole eyes,\u201d a thin elongated jaw, and a slash for a mouth. This image has been commonly used since Elizabethan times.\n\nLater, the death's head image became less stern and menacing. The figure become crowned, with the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century. Particularly, the eyes become more animated\u2014almond shaped and with pupils\u2014seeming more soul-like than deathlike. Extra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and resurrection. This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones with a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.\n\n===Later iconographical motifs===\nContinuing the evolution of the winged death head to the glorification of the soul, soul effigies comprise skull-like representations of the soul developed into soul effigies<ref name=\"l168\">Ludwig (2000), p. 168</ref> with distinctly human faces. Some are placed in an enclosing motif, such as a solar symbol or a tree. Others retain the angels wings commonly seen in the death head.<ref name=\"l168\" />\n\nThe imps of death are depicted as small evil [[demon]]s bearing the arrows of death are sometimes found on early 18th century New England gravestones. They are particularly associated with the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] stone mason Joseph Lamson, who carved [[imp]]s either [[pallbearer|pallbearing]] or adorned with imagery of death and decay such as [[scythe]]s, darts of death, or [[hourglass]]es.<ref name=\"l100\">Ludwig (2000), p. 100</ref>\n\nThe inclusion of cherubs mostly dates from the mid 18th century have a direct lineage to earlier funerary art, in that they often show a living human arched by wings.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> However, the 18th century art and epitaphs of the descendants of the original puritans tends towards solemn epitaphs encouraging reflection on mortality and the brevity of life,<ref name=\"BGov\" /> and is not of much art historical interest.\n\n==Study==\nSerious academic study of early puritan funerary art is a relatively new field. The historian and photographer [[Harriette Forbes]], working with the historian [[Ernest Caulfield]] in Massachusetts during the 1920's, was the first to study the subject and amassed the first significant library of photographs and an expansive catalog of 16th century graves.<ref name=\"p328\">Prioli (1979/80), p.328</ref> Her book \"Gravestones of Early New England and the Men Who Made Them, 1653-1800\" classified and interpret the artifacts in the context of the dominant religious and cultural influences of their times.<ref name=\"m3\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 3</ref> The influential puritan minister, author, and pamphleteer [[Cotton Mather]] observed in 1693 how \"the stones in this wilderness are already grown so witty as to speak\".<ref name=\"m1\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 1</ref> However modern scholars take a more circumspect view, in that most of the early carvers were often armatures, and although they had basic understandings of [[iconography]], their style and language evolved in a setting cut off from European trends, or a coherent, internal, written discourse. The historian [[Richard Meyer (academic)|Richard Meyer]] largely agrees with Mather's claim, and notes how the path of study of these early graveyards understood that such artifacts, \"through a variety of complex and often interrelated manifestations, establish patterns of communication (and even dynamic interaction) with those who use or view them\".<ref name=\"m1\" />\n\nThe next major publication was Allen Ludwig's 1966 book \"Graven Images: New England Stone Carving and its Symbols, 1650-1815\", although it tended to focus on specific examples, rather than present broad overviews or analysis.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Benes, Peter; Montague Benes; Jane. \"Puritan Gravestone Art II\".
