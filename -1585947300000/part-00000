It was the group's second studio release to feature the \"classic\" lineup of [[Dave Mustaine]], [[Marty Friedman]], [[David Ellefson]] and [[Nick Menza]], with all of them contributing to songwriting on the album. The album features some of the band's best known songs such as \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\", \"[[Sweating Bullets (song)|Sweating Bullets]]\", and \"[[Skin o' My Teeth]]\", which enjoyed significant chart success and made a great musical impact.\n\n''Countdown to Extinction'' received positive reaction from [[music journalism|music critics]], who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound in comparison to their previous record. The album entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number two, the band's highest position ever. It eventually achieved [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] status and became their most commercially successful album. The record was nominated for [[Best Metal Performance]] at the [[1993 Grammy Awards]], while the album's title track won the [[Humane Society]]'s [[Genesis Award]] for raising awareness for animal rights issues.\n\nIn 2012, in recognition of the album's 20th anniversary, Megadeth kicked off a 20th anniversary tour in South America, playing the album in its entirety. In addition, a 20th anniversary special edition of the album was released in November 2012, and [[Countdown to Extinction: Live|a live album]] featuring a performance of the full album was released in September 2013.\n\n==Production and musical style==\n''Countdown to Extinction'' is Megadeth's fifth studio album, and the second to feature the line-up of Dave Mustaine, [[Marty Friedman]], [[David Ellefson]] and [[Nick Menza]].<ref name=\"About\"/> In an interview for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' at the time, Mustaine admitted that he fired past members [[Chuck Behler]] and [[Jeff Young]] because they resisted his pleas to seek rehabilitative counseling.<ref name=Billboard>{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Chris|title=Megadeth Comes Alive Again|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=25 July 1992|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=megadeth+countdown+to+extinction+metal#v=onepage&q=megadeth%20countdown%20to%20extinction%20metal&f=false|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}</ref> He added that it was a \"major accomplishment\" that all four members of Megadeth contributed material to the album, unlike their earlier releases which were \"nearly all Mustaine\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Jodi|title=Deth Metal!|work=[[Metal Hammer]]|publisher=Rockmetal.art.pl|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/articles_metalhammer1992.html|date=March 1992|accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> Mustaine also revealed that producer [[Max Norman]] had significant input to the album by making \"a lot of suggestions and a lot of great artistic ideas\".<ref name=\"Goldmine\">{{cite web|last=Prince|first=Patrick|title=Megadeth fully embraces \"Countdown\" anniversary|work=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|url=http://www.goldminemag.com/article/megadeth-fully-embraces-countdown-anniversary|date=November 19, 2012|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> Guitarist Marty Friedman said that unlike ''[[Rust in Peace]]'', the creation of this record was \"completely different\".

It was the group's second studio release to feature the \"classic\" lineup of [[Dave Mustaine]], [[Marty Friedman]], [[David Ellefson]] and [[Nick Menza]], with all of them contributing to songwriting on the album. The album features some of the band's best known songs such as \"[[Symphony of Destruction]]\", \"[[Sweating Bullets (song)|Sweating Bullets]]\", and \"[[Skin o' My Teeth]]\", which enjoyed significant chart success and made a great musical impact.\n\n''Countdown to Extinction'' received positive reaction from [[music journalism|music critics]], who noted its politically oriented lyrics and simplified sound in comparison to their previous record. The album entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number two, the band's highest position ever.

{"title_page": "Dynamic HTML", "text_new": "{{short description|Umbrella term for a collection of technologies (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS and DOM) used together to create interactive and animated web sites}}\n{{Manual|date=December 2008}}\n{{Html series}}\n\n'''Dynamic HTML''', or '''DHTML''', is a collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated [[website]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/DOM/#why|title=W3C Document Object Model|author=|date=|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> by using a combination of a static [[markup language]] (such as [[HTML]]), a [[client-side scripting]] language (such as [[JavaScript]]), a presentation definition language (such as [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]), and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/#dynamic|title=Web Style Sheets|author=|date=|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997. Today, references to [[unobtrusive JavaScript]] coding (DOM Scripting) have replaced the usage of the term DHTML.\n\nDHTML allows scripting languages to change [[variable (programming)|variable]]s in a web page's definition language, which in turn affects the look and function of otherwise \"static\" HTML page content, after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process. Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page is viewed, not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load.\n\nBy contrast, a [[dynamic web page]] is a broader concept, covering any web page generated differently for each user, load occurrence, or specific variable values. This includes pages created by client-side scripting, and ones created by [[server-side scripting]] (such as [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] or [[ASP.NET]]) where the web server generates content before sending it to the client.\n\nDHTML is differentiated from [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] by the fact that a DHTML page is still request/reload-based. With DHTML, there may not be any interaction between the client and server after the page is loaded; all processing happens in JavaScript on the client side. By contrast, an Ajax page uses features of DHTML to initiate a request (or 'subrequest') to the server to perform additional actions. For example, if there are multiple tabs on a page, pure DHTML approach would load the contents of all tabs and then dynamically display only the one that is active, while AJAX could load each tab only when it is really needed.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nDHTML allows authors to add effects to their pages that are otherwise difficult to achieve, by changing the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) and page style. The combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript offers ways to:\n\n* Animate text and images in their document.[https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp]\n* Embed a ticker or other dynamic display that automatically refreshes its content with the latest news, stock quotes, or other data.\n* Use a form to capture user input, and then process, verify and respond to that data without having to send data back to the server.\n* Include rollover buttons or drop-down menus.\n\nA less common use is to create browser-based action games. Although a number of games were created using DHTML during the late 1990s and early 2000s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} differences between browsers made this difficult: many techniques had to be implemented in code to enable the games to work on multiple platforms. Recently browsers have been converging towards [[web standards]], which has made the design of DHTML games more viable. Those games can be played on all major browsers and they can also be ported to [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|Plasma]] for [[KDE]], Widgets for [[macOS]] and Gadgets for [[Windows Vista]], which are based on DHTML code.\n\nThe term \"DHTML\" has fallen out of use in recent years as it was associated with practices and conventions that tended to not work well between various web browsers. DHTML may now be referred to as [[unobtrusive JavaScript]] coding (DOM Scripting), in an effort to place an emphasis on agreed-upon best practices while [[Progressive Enhancement|allowing similar effects in an accessible, standards-compliant way]].\n\nDHTML support with extensive DOM access was introduced with [[Internet Explorer 4.0]]. Although there was a basic dynamic system with [[Netscape Navigator|Netscape Navigator 4.0]], not all HTML elements were represented in the DOM. When DHTML-style techniques became widespread, varying degrees of support among web browsers for the technologies involved made them difficult to develop and [[debug]]. Development became easier when [[Internet Explorer 5|Internet Explorer 5.0+]], [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]] 2.0+, and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] 7.0+ adopted a shared [[Document Object Model|DOM]] inherited from [[ECMAScript]].\n\nMore recently, [[JavaScript library|JavaScript libraries]] such as [[jQuery]] have abstracted away many of the day-to-day difficulties in cross-browser DOM manipulation.\n\n== Structure of a web page ==\n{{see also|DOM events}}\n\nTypically a web page using DHTML is set up in the following way:\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>DHTML example</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=\"navigation\"></div>\n\n        <script>\n            function init() {\n                var myObj = document.getElementById(\"navigation\");\n                // ... manipulate myObj\n            }\n            window.onload = init;\n        </script>\n\n        <!--\n        Often the code is stored in an external file; this is done\n        by linking the file that contains the JavaScript.\n        This is helpful when several pages use the same script:\n        -->\n        <script src=\"myjavascript.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n== Example: Displaying an additional block of text ==\n\nThe following code illustrates an often-used function. An additional part of a web page will only be displayed if the user requests it.\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>Using a DOM function</title>\n        <style>\n            a { background-color: #eee; }\n            a:hover { background: #ff0; }\n            #toggleMe { background: #cfc; display: none; margin: 30px 0; padding: 1em; }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <h1>Using a DOM function</h1>\n        \n        <h2><a id=\"showhide\" href=\"#\">Show paragraph</a></h2>\n        \n        <p id=\"toggleMe\">This is the paragraph that is only displayed on request.\n        \n        <p>The general flow of the document continues.\n        \n        <script>\n            function changeDisplayState(id) {\n                var d = document.getElementById('showhide'),\n                    e = document.getElementById(id);\n                if (e.style.display === 'none' || e.style.display === '') {\n                    e.style.display = 'block';\n                    d.innerHTML = 'Hide paragraph';\n                } else {\n                    e.style.display = 'none';\n                    d.innerHTML = 'Show paragraph';\n                }\n            }\n            document.getElementById('showhide').addEventListener('click', function (e) {\n                e.preventDefault();\n                changeDisplayState('toggleMe');\n            });\n        </script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n==Document Object Model==\n{{main|Document Object Model}}\nDHTML is not a technology in and of itself; rather, it  is the product of three related and complementary technologies: HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and [[JavaScript]]. To allow scripts and components to access features of HTML and CSS, the contents of the document are represented as objects in a programming model known as the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM).\n\nThe DOM API is the foundation of DHTML, providing a structured interface that allows access and manipulation of virtually anything in the document. The HTML elements in the document are available as a hierarchical [[tree (data structure)|tree]] of individual objects, meaning you can examine and modify an element and its attributes by reading and setting properties and by calling methods. The text between elements is also available through DOM properties and methods.\n\nThe DOM also provides access to user actions such as pressing a key and clicking the mouse. You can intercept and process these and other events by creating event handler functions and routines. The event handler receives control each time a given event occurs and can carry out any appropriate action, including using the DOM to change the document.\n\n==Dynamic styles==\n\nDynamic styles are a key feature of DHTML. By using CSS, you can quickly change the appearance and formatting of elements in a document without adding or removing elements. This helps keep your documents small and the scripts that manipulate the document fast.\n\nThe object model provides programmatic access to styles. This means you can change inline styles on individual elements and change style rules using simple JavaScript programming.\n\nInline styles are CSS style assignments that have been applied to an element using the style attribute. You can examine and set these styles by retrieving the style object for an individual element. For example, to highlight the text in a heading when the user moves the mouse pointer over it, you can use the style object to enlarge the font and change its color, as shown in the following simple example.\n\n<source lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n        <title>Dynamic Styles</title>\n        <style>\n            ul { display: none; }\n        </style>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n        <h1 id=\"firstHeader\">Welcome to Dynamic HTML</h1>\n\n        <p><a id=\"clickableLink\" href=\"#\">Dynamic styles are a key feature of DHTML.</a></p>\n\n        <ul id=\"unorderedList\">\n            <li>Change the color, size, and typeface of text</li>\n            <li>Show and hide text</li>\n            <li>And much, much more</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>We've only just begun!</p>\n\n        <script>\n            function showMe() {\n                document.getElementById(\"firstHeader\").style.color = \"#990000\";\n                document.getElementById(\"unorderedList\").style.display = \"block\";\n            }\n\n            document.getElementById(\"clickableLink\").addEventListener(\"click\", function (e) {\n                e.preventDefault();\n                showMe();\n            });\n        </script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dynamic web page]]\n*[[Dynamic Cascading Style Sheets]]\n*[[DHTMLEdit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project|project=wikibooks|text=JavaScript/DHTML}}\n* [http://www.quirksmode.org/ QuirksMode], a comprehensive site with test examples and instructions on how to write DHTML code which runs on several browsers.\n* [http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/javascript/dhtmlexplained.html Introductory DHTML Tutorial]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070812201940/http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533050.aspx HTML & DHTML Reference on MSDN]\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n{{ECMAScript}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:HTML]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Umbrella term for a collection of technologies (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS and DOM) used together to create interactive and animated web sites}}\n{{Manual|date=December 2008}}\n{{Html series}}\n\n'''Dynamic HTML''', or '''DHTML''', is a collection of technologies used together to create interactive and animated [[website]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/DOM/#why|title=W3C Document Object Model|author=|date=|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> by using a combination of a static [[markup language]] (such as [[HTML]]), a [[client-side scripting]] language (such as [[JavaScript]]), a presentation definition language (such as [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]), and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/Style/#dynamic|title=Web Style Sheets|author=|date=|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> The application of DHTML was introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997. Today, references to [[unobtrusive JavaScript]] coding (DOM Scripting) have replaced the usage of the word DHTML.\n\nDHTML allows scripting languages to change [[variable (programming)|variable]]s in a web page's definition language, which in turn affects the look and function of otherwise \"static\" HTML page content, after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process. Thus the dynamic characteristic of DHTML is the way it functions while a page is viewed, not in its ability to generate a unique page with each page load.\n\nBy contrast, a [[dynamic web page]] is a broader concept, covering any web page generated differently for each user, load occurrence, or specific variable values. This includes pages created by client-side scripting, and ones created by [[server-side scripting]] (such as [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] or [[ASP.NET]]) where the web server generates content before sending it to the client.\n\nDHTML is differentiated from [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] by the fact that a DHTML page is still request/reload-based. With DHTML, there may not be any interaction between the client and server after the page is loaded; all processing happens in JavaScript on the client side. By contrast, an Ajax page uses features of DHTML to initiate a request (or 'subrequest') to the server to perform additional actions. For example, if there are multiple tabs on a page, pure DHTML approach would load the contents of all tabs and then dynamically display only the one that is active, while AJAX could load each tab only when it is really needed.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nDHTML allows authors to add effects to their pages that are otherwise difficult to achieve, by changing the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) and page style. The combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript offers ways to:\n\n* Animate text and images in their document.[https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_animate.asp]\n* Embed a ticker or other dynamic display that automatically refreshes its content with the latest news, stock quotes, or other data.\n* Use a form to capture user input, and then process, verify and respond to that data without having to send data back to the server.\n* Include rollover buttons or drop-down menus.\n\nA less common use is to create browser-based action games. Although a number of games were created using DHTML during the late 1990s and early 2000s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} differences between browsers made this difficult: many techniques had to be implemented in code to enable the games to work on multiple platforms. Recently browsers have been converging towards [[web standards]], which has made the design of DHTML games more viable. Those games can be played on all major browsers and they can also be ported to [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|Plasma]] for [[KDE]], Widgets for [[macOS]] and Gadgets for [[Windows Vista]], which are based on DHTML code.\n\nThe term \"DHTML\" has fallen out of use in recent years as it was associated with practices and conventions that tended to not work well between various web browsers. DHTML may now be referred to as [[unobtrusive JavaScript]] coding (DOM Scripting), in an effort to place an emphasis on agreed-upon best practices while [[Progressive Enhancement|allowing similar effects in an accessible, standards-compliant way]].\n\nDHTML support with extensive DOM access was introduced with [[Internet Explorer 4.0]]. Although there was a basic dynamic system with [[Netscape Navigator|Netscape Navigator 4.0]], not all HTML elements were represented in the DOM. When DHTML-style techniques became widespread, varying degrees of support among web browsers for the technologies involved made them difficult to develop and [[debug]].
