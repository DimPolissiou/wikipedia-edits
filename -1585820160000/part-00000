Egg deposition takes place by the female hovering above the entrance of a host insect nest, usually a solitary bee, and throwing down her eggs using a flicking movement.<ref name=\"Boesi, R., Polidori, C. and Andrietti, F.\">Boesi, R., Polidori, C. and Andrietti, F.  2009 \u2014 Searching for the Right Target: Oviposition and Feeding Behavior in Bombylius Bee Flies (Diptera:Bombyliidae).''Zool.

If the female is unable to flick her eggs near the nest she plants them on flowers visited by the host insects.

This is facilitated by the characterizable long proboscis of the fly, which is horizontally inserted into the flower.<ref name=\":0\" /> This occurs as the fly continues to buzz in the air, without touching either the anthers or stigma of the flower.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fly also consumes pollen as part of its diet, with considerable differences between the sexes.

It is bordered by [[Sudan]] in the west, [[Ethiopia]] in the south, and [[Djibouti]] in the southeast. The northeastern and eastern parts of Eritrea have an extensive coastline along the [[Red Sea]]. The nation has a total area of approximately {{Convert|117600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, and includes the [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and several of the [[Hanish Islands]].\n\nEritrea is a multi-ethnic country, with nine recognized ethnic groups in its population of around {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Eritrea}}|R}}/1e6 round 0}} million.

Among these communities, the [[Tigrayans|Tigrinyas]] make up about 55% of the population, with the [[Tigre people]] constituting around 30% of inhabitants. In addition, there are a number of [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking [[Nilotic]] ethnic minorities.

Retrieved 3 March 2012.</ref> In medieval times much of Eritrea fell under the [[Medri Bahri]] kingdom, with a smaller region being part of [[Hamasien]].\n\nThe creation of modern-day Eritrea is a result of the incorporation of independent, distinct kingdoms and sultanates (for example, [[Medri Bahri]] and the [[Sultanate of Aussa]]) eventually resulting in the formation of [[Italian Eritrea]]. After the defeat of the Italian colonial army in 1942, Eritrea was administered by the [[British Military Administration (Eritrea)|British Military Administration]] until 1952.

Eritrea lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel north|18\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[36th meridian east|36\u00b0]] and [[44th meridian east|44\u00b0E]].\n\nThe country is virtually bisected by a branch of the [[East African Rift]]. Eritrea, at the southern end of the Red Sea, is the home of the fork in the rift. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds are situated off the sandy and arid coastline.\n\n[[File:Dahlak reliefmap.png|thumb|left|upright|150px|The [[Dahlak Archipelago]]]]\n[[File:Dahlak Islands ISS042.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Dahlak Islands in the Red Sea as seen from the International Space Station]]\n\nEritrea can be split into three [[ecoregion]]s. To the east of the highlands are the hot, arid coastal plains stretching down to the southeast of the country. The cooler, more fertile highlands, reaching up to 3000 m, have a different habitat. Habitats here vary from the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|sub-tropical rainforest]] at Filfil Solomona to the precipitous cliffs and [[canyon]]s of the southern highlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eritrea|publisher=fatbirder.com|url=http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/africa/eritrea.html}}</ref>\nThe [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another.

Eritrean climate varies on the basis of seasonal and altitudinal differences.\n\nBased on variations in temperature, Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: the temperate zone, subtropical climate zone, and tropical climate zone.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tesfagiorgis, Mussie |title=Eritrea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&pg=PA10 |date=29 October 2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-232-6 |pages=10\u2013}}</ref>\n{{Weather box\n|location = Eritrea in general, based on 14 cities\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|temperature colour = pastel\n|Jan high C = 27.3\n|Feb high C = 28.3\n|Mar high C = 29.8\n|Apr high C = 32.3\n|May high C = 33.3\n|Jun high C = 33\n|Jul high C = 32\n|Aug high C = 31.5\n|Sep high C = 32.3\n|Oct high C = 31.8\n|Nov high C = 30\n|Dec high C = 28.3\n|year high C = 31\n|Jan mean C = 20\n|Feb mean C = 20.8\n|Mar mean C = 22.5\n|Apr mean C = 24.3\n|May mean C = 25.6\n|Jun mean C = 26\n|Jul mean C = 25.1\n|Aug mean C = 24.7\n|Sep mean C = 24.4\n|Oct mean C = 23.8\n|Nov mean C = 22.1\n|Dec mean C = 20.5\n|year mean C = 23.3\n|Jan low C = 17.8\n|Feb low C = 17.3\n|Mar low C = 18.3\n|Apr low C = 21\n|May low C = 23.3\n|Jun low C = 24.4\n|Jul low C = 24.4\n|Aug low C = 24.5\n|Sep low C = 23.3\n|Oct low C = 22.3\n|Nov low C = 20\n|Dec low C = 18.3\n|year low C = 20.8\n|Jan precipitation mm = 6.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 6.9\n|Mar precipitation mm = 9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 14.8\n|May precipitation mm = 20.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 26.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 100\n|Aug precipitation mm = 99.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 25.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 8.6\n|Nov precipitation mm = 11.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 9.4\n|year precipitation mm = 347\n|source 1 = weatherbase<ref name= weatherbase>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/city.php3?c=ER&name=Eritrea\n| title = Eritrea average climate\n| publisher = weatherbase\n| accessdate = 6 March 2016}}</ref>\n|date=March 2016\n}}\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{main|Politics of Eritrea}}\n{{advert|section|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:National Assembly of Eritrea.svg|thumb|130px|The National Assembly of Eritrea]]\n[[File:Flag of Eritrea.svg|thumb|right|The wreath with the upright olive-branch symbol derived from the 1952 flag, which had a light blue background to honour the United Nations.

The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T). The lowest level road is tertiary and serves local interests. Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved. During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable.\n\nThe next higher level road is a secondary road and typically is a single-layered asphalt road that connects district capitals together and those to the regional capitals.

The institute began with about 5,500 students during the 2003-2004 [[academic year]].\nThe EIT was opened after the [[University of Asmara]] was reorganized. According to the Ministry of Education, the institution was established, as one of many efforts to achieve equal distribution of higher learning in areas outside the capital city, Asmara. Accordingly, several similar colleges are also established in different other parts of the country. The Eritrea Institute of Technology is the main local institute of higher studies in science, engineering and education.

During the coffee ceremony, there are traditions that are upheld. The coffee is served in three rounds: the first brew or round is called ''awel'' in Tigrinya (meaning \"first\"), the second round is called ''kalaay'' (meaning \"second\"), and the third round is called ''bereka'' (meaning \"to be blessed\").\n\nTraditional Eritrean attire is quite varied among the ethnic groups of Eritrea. In the larger cities, most people dress in Western casual dress such as jeans and shirts. In offices, both men and women often dress in suits. A common traditional clothing for [[Christians|Christian]] Tigrayan highlanders consists of bright white gowns called ''[[zuria]]s'' for the women, and a white shirt accompanied by white pants for the men. In Muslim communities in the Eritrean lowland, the women traditionally dress in brightly colored clothes.

After the defeat of the Italian colonial army in 1942, Eritrea was administered by the [[British Military Administration (Eritrea)|British Military Administration]] until 1952. Following the UN General Assembly decision, in 1952, Eritrea would govern itself with a local Eritrean parliament but for foreign affairs and defense it would enter into a federal status with Ethiopia for a period of 10 years. However, in 1962 the government of Ethiopia annulled the Eritrean parliament and formally annexed Eritrea, but the Eritreans who had argued for complete Eritrean independence since the ouster of the Italians in 1941 anticipated what was coming and, in 1961, organized the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] in opposition. In 1991, after 30 years of continuous armed struggle for independence, the Eritrean liberation fighters entered the capital city, Asmara, in victory.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]]  is a [[totalitarian]] [[one-party]] [[dictatorship]] in which [[Elections in Eritrea|national legislative and presidential elections]] have never been held since independence.<ref name=\"gi\"/><ref name=\"Eritrea\u2019s Silent Totalitarianism - McGill Journal of Political Studies\" /> According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the [[Human rights in Eritrea|Eritrean government's human rights record]] is among the worst in the world.<ref name=\"hrw\"/> The Eritrean government has dismissed these allegations as politically motivated.<ref name=\"Tesf\">{{cite web|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND ERITREA'S REALITY|url=http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|website=E Smart|publisher=E Smart Campaign|accessdate=12 June 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084731/http://www.tesfanews.net/wp-content/uploads/Human-Rights-and-Eritreas-Reality.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2014}}</ref> The compulsory military service requires long, indefinite conscription periods (6.5 years on average), which some Eritreans leave the country to avoid.<ref name=\"National service in Eritrea\"/> Because all local media is state-owned, Eritrea was also ranked as having the third-least press freedom in the global [[Press Freedom Index]], behind [[North Korea]] and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Eritrea is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]], and is an [[Member_states_of_the_Arab_League#List_of_current_observer_states|observer state]] in the [[Arab League]] alongside [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name=\"edition.cnn.com\">[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/30/world/meast/arab-league-fast-facts/ Arab League Fast Facts \u2013 CNN.com].

In 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens. The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities.

It is bordered to the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]], [[Sudan]] to the west, [[Ethiopia]] to the south, and [[Djibouti]] to the southeast. Eritrea lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel north|18\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[36th meridian east|36\u00b0]] and [[44th meridian east|44\u00b0E]].\n\nThe country is virtually bisected by a branch of the [[East African Rift]]. Eritrea, at the southern end of the Red Sea, is the home of the fork in the rift. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds are situated off the sandy and arid coastline.\n\n[[File:Dahlak reliefmap.png|thumb|left|upright|150px|The [[Dahlak Archipelago]]]]\n[[File:Dahlak Islands ISS042.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|Dahlak Islands in the Red Sea as seen from the International Space Station]]\n\nEritrea can be split into three [[ecoregion]]s. To the east of the highlands are the hot, arid coastal plains stretching down to the southeast of the country. The cooler, more fertile highlands, reaching up to 3000 m, have a different habitat. Habitats here vary from the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|sub-tropical rainforest]] at Filfil Solomona to the precipitous cliffs and [[canyon]]s of the southern highlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eritrea|publisher=fatbirder.com|url=http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/africa/eritrea.html}}</ref>\nThe [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another.

At the time of independence in 1993, Eritrea was arranged into ten provinces. These provinces were similar to the nine provinces operating during the colonial period. In 1996, these were consolidated into six regions (zobas). The boundaries of these new regions are based on catchment basins.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Largest cities ==\n{{Largest cities of Eritrea}}\n\n==Transportation==\n{{main|Transport in Eritrea}}\n[[File:Eritrean mountai road archietcture.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Eritrean mountain road]]\nTransport in Eritrea includes highways, airports, railway, and seaports in addition to various forms of public and private vehicular, maritime and aerial transportation.\n\nThe Eritrean highway system is named according to the road classification. The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T). The lowest level road is tertiary and serves local interests. Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved. During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable.\n\nThe next higher level road is a secondary road and typically is a single-layered asphalt road that connects district capitals together and those to the regional capitals. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they carry traffic between all the major cities and towns in Eritrea.\n\n[[File:Eritrean Railway - 2008-11-04-edit4.jpg|thumb|left|Eritrean steam train on the [[Eritrean Railway]] ]]\n\nAs of 1999, there is a total of 317 kilometres of {{Track gauge|950 mm}} (narrow gauge) rail line in Eritrea.

In the larger cities, most people dress in Western casual dress such as jeans and shirts. In offices, both men and women often dress in suits. A common traditional clothing for [[Christians|Christian]] Tigrayan highlanders consists of bright white gowns called ''[[zuria]]s'' for the women, and a white shirt accompanied by white pants for the men. In Muslim communities in the Eritrean lowland, the women traditionally dress in brightly colored clothes. Besides convergent culinary tastes, Eritreans share an appreciation for similar music and lyrics, jewelry and fragrances, and tapestry and fabrics as many other populations in the Horn region.<ref name=\"Tekle197\">{{cite book|last=Tekle|first=Amare|title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: From Conflict to Cooperation|year=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0932415974 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|Eritrean cuisine}}\n[[File:Eritrean Injera with stews.jpg|thumb|Eritrean [[injera]] with various stews]]\nA typical traditional Eritrean dish consists of [[injera]] accompanied by a spicy stew, which frequently includes beef, chicken, lamb or fish.<!--(Commented out because it's repeated a few sentence later): People in Eritrea also tend to drink coffee and a bitter fermented barley called ''sowa''.--><ref name=\"Kittler\"/>  Overall, Eritrean cuisine strongly resembles those of neighboring [[Ethiopian cuisine|Ethiopia]],<ref name=\"Kittler\">{{cite book|author1=Goyan Kittler, Pamela |author2=Sucher, Kathryn P. |author3=Nahikian-Nelms, Marcia |title=Food and Culture, 6th ed|year=2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0538734974|page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R06H7WabJuMC}}</ref><ref name=\"Tekle142\">{{cite book|last=Tekle|first=Amare|title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: From Conflict to Cooperation|year=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0932415974 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC}}</ref> Eritrean cooking tend to feature more [[seafood]] than Ethiopian cuisine on account of their coastal location.<ref name=\"Kittler\"/> Eritrean dishes are also frequently \"lighter\" in texture than Ethiopian meals.
