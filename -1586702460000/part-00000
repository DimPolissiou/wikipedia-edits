Although the [[Artuqids|Artuqid dynasty]] was named after him, actually the dynasty was founded 11 years after his death by his sons [[S\u00f6kmen (Artuqid)|S\u00f6kmen]] and [[Ilghazi]].

After the battle, he took part in the conquest of [[Anatolia]] on behalf of the Seljuk Empire. He captured the [[Ye\u015fil River|Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak]] valley in 1074.

Another focus area has been the [[software industry]] as part of global [[software development]] and developing [[global information system]]s. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of [[trade in services]], [[India]] became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.\n\n==Frequently used terms==\nOffshoring is defined as the movement of a business process done at a company in one country to the same company in another country.\n\nIt is not the same as [[outsourcing]], which is the movement of internal business processes to an external organizational unit. This is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns.\n\nSubcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring: Offshore outsourcing.\n\nRelated terms include \n* [[nearshoring]], which implies relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting United States-based business processes to Canada, Mexico or [[Latin America]])\n* inshoring, which means picking services within a country; and \n* [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the \"best shore\" based on various criteria. \n* [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[Finance]] & [[Accounting]], Customer Service, etc.) are outsourced. More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.\n* [[Bodyshopping]] is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.\n\nOffshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring, and refers to substitution of a service from any company-owned foreign source for one formerly produced in the company's home country, whether or not outsourcing is involved.\n\n===Production offshoring===\nProduction offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes overseas,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/offshore-manufacturing/|title=Offshore manufacturing - definition and meaning}}</ref> usually to a lower-cost destination or one with fewer regulatory restrictions.\n\n[[Physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]].\n\nThis trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.<ref>Fishman, T: \"China, Inc.\" Scribner, 2006.</ref>\n\n===IT-enabled services offshoring===\nGrowth of offshoring of IT-enabled services, both to subsidiaries and to outside companies (offshore outsourcing) is linked to the availability of large amounts of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and Internet expansion of the late 1990s.<ref name=Telcom.out>{{cite book|title=Managing Projects in Telecommunication Service |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0470047674  |isbn=0470047674 |author=Mostafa Hashem Sherif |date=2006|quote=(chapter) COMMUNICATION AND OUTSOURCING  ...

This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn't so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff.  But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement.  In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community.  To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in Reshoring.<ref name=\"bsc3\">{{Cite web|url=http://bluesilkconsulting.com/reshoring/|title=Are you ready to evaluate Reshoring?|date=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Blue Silk Consulting Reshoring|author=Rosemary Coates}}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], companies have used the reintroduction of domestic [[call centres]] as a [[unique selling point]].

Companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.\n\nOffshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees.  When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported.  The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.\n\n==Debate==\nOffshoring to foreign subsidiaries has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists. Jobs go to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country.\n\nOn the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition. Free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.<ref name=\"Paul Krugman\">{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 12, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html|author=Paul Krugman|title=The Trouble with Trade}}</ref>\n\nCurrency manipulation by governments and their central banks cause differences in labor cost.

This is done under restrictions and strategies in order to establish consistency with the offshore outsourcing organizations. Many companies nowadays outsource various professional areas in the company such as e-mail services, payroll and [[call center]]. These jobs are being handled by other organizations that specialize in each sector allowing the offshoring company to focus more on other business concerns.\n\nSubcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or [[physical restructuring]], but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring: Offshore outsourcing.\n\nRelated terms include \n* [[nearshoring]], which implies relocation of business processes to (typically) lower cost foreign locations, but in close geographical proximity (e.g., shifting United States-based business processes to Canada, Mexico or [[Latin America]])\n* inshoring, which means picking services within a country; and \n* [[bestshoring]] or rightshoring, picking the \"best shore\" based on various criteria. \n* [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) refers to outsourcing arrangements when entire business functions (such as [[Finance]] & [[Accounting]], Customer Service, etc.) are outsourced. More specific terms can be found in the field of software development - for example [[Global Information System]] as a class of systems being developed for / by globally distributed teams.\n* [[Bodyshopping]] is the practice of using offshored resources and personnel to do small disaggregated tasks within a business environment, without any broader intention to offshore an entire business function.\n\nOffshoring can be seen in the context of either production offshoring or services offshoring, and refers to substitution of a service from any company-owned foreign source for one formerly produced in the company's home country, whether or not outsourcing is involved.\n\n===Production offshoring===\nProduction offshoring, also known as [[physical restructuring]], of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes overseas,<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Offshore manufacturing - definition and meaning\n   |url=https://marketbusinessnews.com/financial-glossary/offshore-manufacturing}}</ref> usually to a lower-cost destination or one with fewer regulatory restrictions.\n\n[[Physical restructuring]] arrived when the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to [[Mexico]].\n\nThis trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few [[workers' rights]] laws, a [[fixed currency]] pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge [[economies of scale]] based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product.

It is the reverse process of offshoring, where manufacturing is moved to another country where labor is cheaper.\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work<ref name=\"documents.worldbank.org\">[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]</ref> considers the potential for automation to drive companies to reshore production, reducing the role of labor in the process, and offers suggestions as to how governments can respond. A similar movement can be seen related to [[Robotic Process Automation]], called RPA or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0 based on [[artificial intelligence]], where the incentive to move repetitive shared services work to lower cost countries is partially taken away by the progression of technology.\n\n==United States==\nFor the last twenty years, American companies have been \"offshoring\" and outsourcing manufacturing to low cost countries such as [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]].\n\n===Government response===\nPresident Obama 2011 [[SelectUSA]] program was the first federal program to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in partnership with our states.

This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn't so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff.  But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement.  In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community.  To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in Reshoring.<ref name=\"bsc3\">{{Cite web|url=http://bluesilkconsulting.com/reshoring/|title=Are you ready to evaluate Reshoring?|date=|publisher=|access-date=|work=Blue Silk Consulting Reshoring|author=Rosemary Coates}}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], companies have used the reintroduction of domestic [[call centres]] as a [[unique selling point]].

Companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.\n\nOffshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees.  When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s, then [[intellectual property]] has been transferred or exported.  The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.\n\n==Debate==\nOffshoring to foreign subsidiaries has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists. Jobs go to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country.\n\nOn the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition. Free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.<ref name=\"Paul Krugman\">{{cite newspaper  \n   |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 12, 2007\n   |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/28/opinion/28krugman.html\n   |author=Paul Krugman\n   |title=The Trouble with Trade}}</ref>\n\nCurrency manipulation by governments and their central banks cause differences in labor cost.
