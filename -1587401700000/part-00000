Starting out as a classical cellist, he founded his own period instrument ensemble, [[Concentus Musicus Wien]], in the 1950s, and became a pioneer of the Early Music movement. Around 1970, Harnoncourt started to conduct opera and concert performances, soon leading renowned international symphony orchestras, and appearing at leading concert halls, operatic venues and festivals. His repertoire then widened to include composers of the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2001 and 2003, he conducted the [[Vienna New Year's Concert]]. Harnoncourt was also the author of several books, mostly on subjects of performance history and musical aesthetics.\n\n==Biography==\nJohann Nikolaus Harnoncourt was born 1929 as Austrian citizen in [[Berlin]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. His Austrian mother, Ladislaja, born [[Franz, Count of Meran|Gr\u00e4fin von Meran]], Freiin von Brandhoven, was the great-granddaughter of the [[Habsburg]] [[Archduke Johann]], the 13th child of Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], making him a descendant of various [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and other European royalty. His father, Eberhard Harnoncourt, born de la Fontaine [[Graf]] d'Harnoncourt-Unverzagt,<ref name=\"Munzinger\"/> was an Austrian engineer working in Berlin who had two children from a previous marriage. Two years after Nikolaus's birth, his brother Philipp was born. The family eventually moved to Graz, where Eberhard had obtained a post in the state government (''Landesregierung'') of [[Styria]].\n\nHarnoncourt was raised in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], and studied music in [[Vienna]].  During his youth, he served in the Hitler Youth under duress, where, as he noted:<ref name=\"Oestreich\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/arts/music/nikolaus-harnoncourt-conductor-and-early-music-specialist-dies-at-86.html | title=Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Conductor and Early-Music Specialist, Dies at 86 | work=The New York Times | author=James R Oestreich | date=6 March 2016 | accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n{{Quote|If you didn't go there every Wednesday and Saturday, the Hitler Youth police would come, fetch you, cut your hair and toss you into a group with other difficult ones who were treated terribly.}}\n\nAt the [[Vienna Music Academy]], Harnoncourt studied cello with [[Paul Gr\u00fcmmer]] and Emanuel Brabec, and also learned viola da gamba.<ref name=\"Millington\"/>\n\n==Career==\nHarnoncourt was a [[cello|cellist]] with the [[Vienna Symphony]] from 1952 to 1969.

Starting out as a classical cellist, he founded his own period instrument ensemble, [[Concentus Musicus Wien]], in the 1950s, and became a pioneer of the Early Music movement. Around 1970, Harnoncourt started to conduct opera and concert performances, soon leading renowned international symphony orchestras, and appearing at leading concert halls, operatic venues and festivals. His repertoire then widened to include composers of the 19th and 20th centuries. In 2001 and 2003, he conducted the [[Vienna New Year's Concert]]. Harnoncourt was also the author of several books, mostly on subjects of performance history and musical aesthetics.\n\n==Biography==\nJohann Nikolaus Harnoncourt was born 1929 as Austrian citizen in [[Berlin]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. His Austrian mother, Ladislaja, born [[Franz, Count of Meran|Gr\u00e4fin von Meran]], Freiin von Brandhoven, was the great-granddaughter of the [[Habsburg]] [[Archduke Johann]], the 13th child of Emperor [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], making him a descendant of various [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and other European royalty. His father, Eberhard Harnoncourt, born de la Fontaine [[Graf]] d'Harnoncourt-Unverzagt,<ref name=\"Munzinger\"/> was an Austrian engineer working in Berlin who had two children from a previous marriage. Two years after Nikolaus's birth, his brother Philipp was born. The family eventually moved to Graz, where Eberhard had obtained a post in the state government (''Landesregierung'') of [[Styria]].\n\nHarnoncourt was raised in [[Graz]], [[Austria]], and studied music in [[Vienna]].  During his youth, he served in the Hitler Youth under duress, where, as he noted:<ref name=\"Oestreich\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/arts/music/nikolaus-harnoncourt-conductor-and-early-music-specialist-dies-at-86.html | title=Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Conductor and Early-Music Specialist, Dies at 86 | work=The New York Times | author=James R Oestreich | date=6 March 2016 | accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n{{Quote|If you didn't go there every Wednesday and Saturday, the Hitler Youth police would come, fetch you, cut your hair and toss you into a group with other difficult ones who were treated terribly.}}\n\nAt the [[Vienna Music Academy]], Harnoncourt studied cello with [[Paul Gr\u00fcmmer]] and Emanuel Brabec, and also learned viola da gamba.<ref name=\"Millington\"/>\n\n==Career==\nHarnoncourt was a [[cello|cellist]] with the [[Vienna Symphony]] from 1952 to 1969.

It was first released in [[Japan]] on December 17, 2011, and in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and other international territories beginning on February 22, 2012. The console is the successor to the [[PlayStation Portable]], and a part of the [[PlayStation]] brand of gaming devices; as part of the [[eighth generation of video game consoles]], it primarily competed with the [[Nintendo 3DS]].\n\nThe original model of the handheld includes a {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[OLED]] multi-touch [[capacitive touchscreen]], two [[analog stick|analog joysticks]], and front and shoulder [[push-button]] input, and supports [[Bluetooth v2.1+EDR|Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], and optional [[3G]]. The Vita features a quad-core [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore]] CPU and a quad-core [[PowerVR SGXMP|SGX543MP]] GPU. The PS Vita 2000 series, a revised version of the system, was released across 2013 and 2014. It has all of the same features with a slightly smaller size, extended battery life, and an [[LCD]] screen instead of OLED. Sony released the [[PlayStation TV]], a short-lived, re-purposed version of the Vita that uses a [[television]] screen like a [[home video game console]], discontinued at the end of 2015.\n\nThe Vita's design was intended to meld the experience of big budget, dedicated [[video game platforms]] with the then up-and-coming trend of [[mobile gaming]] as seen on [[smart phones]] and [[tablet computer|tablets]]. However, in the year after the device's successful launch, sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled, threatening to end its lifespan. A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West, combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies, helped keep the platform afloat. Though this led to less diversity in its game library, it strengthened support in [[JRPG]]s, [[visual novels]], and Western-developed [[indie games]]. This built moderate sales in Japan, and a smaller, yet passionate userbase in the West. Though Sony has not released exact sales figures, late-lifespan sales estimates are around 15 to 16 million units. In the platform's later years, Sony promoted the PlayStation Vita's ability to work in conjunction with its other gaming products, such as [[Remote Play]] of [[PlayStation 4]] games, similar to the [[Wii U]]'s function of [[Off-TV Play]]. Production of the system and physical cartridge games ended in March 2019.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nAfter the success of [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy family]] of [[handheld game console]]s throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, with little market competition, and [[Sony]]'s massive success with its [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[PlayStation 2]] [[home video game console]]s around the same time, Sony entered the handheld market as well. In 2004, it released the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) to compete with the [[Nintendo DS]] as part of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]].<ref name=\"TAPSPRetrospective\">{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2016/04/07/rpg-reload-presents-the-history-of-handheld-rpgs-part-eight/|title=RPG Reload Presents \u2013 The History Of Handheld RPGs, Part Eight|date=April 7, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' series.<ref name=\"TAPSPRetrospective\" /><ref name=\"kotakuMH\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/bad-news-for-the-ps-vita-no-monster-hunter-4-anytime-s-1187588672|title=Bad News for the PS Vita: No Monster Hunter 4 Anytime Soon|first=Brian|last=Ashcraft|publisher=}}</ref> With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] had during the [[sixth generation of video game consoles]].<ref name=\"TAPSPRetrospective\" /> This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor, the DS, which was more than 150 million units by the end of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5879477/nintendo-ds-over-150-million-sold|title=Nintendo DS: Over 150 Million Sold|first=Brian|last=Ashcraft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July 2009 when ''[[Eurogamer]]'' reported that Sony was working on such a device, which would utilize the PowerVR SGX543MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5309010/psp2-in-development-as-powerful-as-xbox |title=PSP2 In Development, As Powerful As Xbox |author=Luke Plunkett |date=July 7, 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=December 8, 2010}}</ref> Through mid-2010, websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a \"PSP 2\".<ref name=\"Brian Crecente\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5581437/report-sony-working-on-new-gaming-machine |title=Report: Sony Working on New Gaming Machine |author=Brian Crecente |date=July 7, 2010 |website=Kotaku |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"KotakuOctPSP2\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5672410/psp2-will-be-bigger-sport-dual-analog-sticks-and-a-touch-pad-and-be-out-fall-2011 |title=PSP2 Hits Next Fall With Dual Analog Sticks, Touch Pad and Bigger Screen |author=Brian Ashcraft |date=October 25, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"PSP2 Leaked Pic\" /><ref name=\"MCVJan13\" /><ref name=\"Jim Reilly\">{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/113/1135225p1.html |title= Alleged PSP2 images surface |author=Jim Reilly |date=November 17, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> Reports arose during the [[Tokyo Game Show]] that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid-September held at Sony Computer Entertainment's headquarters in Aoyama, Tokyo.<ref name=\"KotakuOctPSP2\" /> Shortly after, reports of [[development kits]] for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both [[SIE Worldwide Studios|first-party]] and third-party developers to start making games for the device,<ref name=\"KotakuSep10\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5649239/report-psp2-hardware-now-in-the-hands-of-numerous-developers |title=Report: PSP2 Hardware Now In The Hands Of 'Numerous' Developers |author=Michael McWhertor |date=September 27, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref> a report later confirmed by ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/09/16/psp2-in-the-hands-of-mortal-kombat-devs/ |title=PSP2 in the hands of Mortal Kombat devs;

It was first released in [[Japan]] on December 17, 2011, and in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and other international territories beginning on February 22, 2012. The console is the successor to the [[PlayStation Portable]], and a part of the [[PlayStation]] brand of gaming devices; as part of the [[eighth generation of video game consoles]], it primarily competed with the [[Nintendo 3DS]].\n\nThe original model of the handheld includes a {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[OLED]] multi-touch [[capacitive touchscreen]], two [[analog stick|analog joysticks]], and front and shoulder [[push-button]] input, and supports [[Bluetooth v2.1+EDR|Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], and optional [[3G]]. The Vita features a quad-core [[ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore]] CPU and a quad-core [[PowerVR SGXMP|SGX543MP]] GPU. The PS Vita 2000 series, a revised version of the system, was released across 2013 and 2014. It has all of the same features with a slightly smaller size, extended battery life, and an [[LCD]] screen instead of OLED. Sony released the [[PlayStation TV]], a short-lived, re-purposed version of the Vita that uses a [[television]] screen like a [[home video game console]], discontinued at the end of 2015.\n\nThe Vita's design was intended to meld the experience of big budget, dedicated [[video game platforms]] with the then up-and-coming trend of [[mobile gaming]] as seen on [[smart phones]] and [[tablet computer|tablets]]. However, in the year after the device's successful launch, sales of the hardware and its bigger budget games stalled, threatening to end its lifespan. A concentrated effort to attract smaller independent developers in the West, combined with strong support from mid-level Japanese companies, helped keep the platform afloat. Though this led to less diversity in its game library, it strengthened support in [[JRPG]]s, [[visual novels]], and Western-developed [[indie games]]. This built moderate sales in Japan, and a smaller, yet passionate userbase in the West. Though Sony has not released exact sales figures, late-lifespan sales estimates are around 15 to 16 million units. In the platform's later years, Sony promoted the PlayStation Vita's ability to work in conjunction with its other gaming products, such as [[Remote Play]] of [[PlayStation 4]] games, similar to the [[Wii U]]'s function of [[Off-TV Play]]. Production of the system and physical cartridge games ended in March 2019.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\nAfter the success of [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy family]] of [[handheld game console]]s throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, with little market competition, and [[Sony]]'s massive success with its [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[PlayStation 2]] [[home video game console]]s around the same time, Sony entered the handheld market as well. In 2004, it released the [[PlayStation Portable]] (PSP) to compete with the [[Nintendo DS]] as part of the [[seventh generation of video game consoles]].<ref name=\"TAPSPRetrospective\">{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2016/04/07/rpg-reload-presents-the-history-of-handheld-rpgs-part-eight/|title=RPG Reload Presents \u2013 The History Of Handheld RPGs, Part Eight|date=April 7, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> After a slow start in the worldwide market, it was invigorated in Japan with multiple releases in the ''[[Monster Hunter]]'' series.<ref name=\"TAPSPRetrospective\" /><ref name=\"kotakuMH\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/bad-news-for-the-ps-vita-no-monster-hunter-4-anytime-s-1187588672|title=Bad News for the PS Vita: No Monster Hunter 4 Anytime Soon|first=Brian|last=Ashcraft|publisher=}}</ref> With the series being less popular in western regions, it failed to revive the platform in the same way. The PSP ended up being a mixed result for the company. It was seen as a success in that it was the only handheld video game platform that had ever significantly competed with Nintendo for market share, with almost 80 million units sold in its lifespan, roughly the same amount as Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] had during the [[sixth generation of video game consoles]].<ref name=\"TAPSPRetrospective\" /> This is only a little more than half of the sales of its actual market competitor, the DS, which was more than 150 million units by the end of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5879477/nintendo-ds-over-150-million-sold|title=Nintendo DS: Over 150 Million Sold|first=Brian|last=Ashcraft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRumors of a successor to the PSP came as early as July 2009 when ''[[Eurogamer]]'' reported that Sony was working on such a device, which would utilize the PowerVR SGX543MP processor and perform at a level similar to the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5309010/psp2-in-development-as-powerful-as-xbox |title=PSP2 In Development, As Powerful As Xbox |author=Luke Plunkett |date=July 7, 2009 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=December 8, 2010}}</ref> Through mid-2010, websites continued to run stories about accounts of the existence of a \"PSP 2\".<ref name=\"Brian Crecente\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5581437/report-sony-working-on-new-gaming-machine |title=Report: Sony Working on New Gaming Machine |author=Brian Crecente |date=July 7, 2010 |website=Kotaku |accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"KotakuOctPSP2\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5672410/psp2-will-be-bigger-sport-dual-analog-sticks-and-a-touch-pad-and-be-out-fall-2011 |title=PSP2 Hits Next Fall With Dual Analog Sticks, Touch Pad and Bigger Screen |author=Brian Ashcraft |date=October 25, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"PSP2 Leaked Pic\" /><ref name=\"MCVJan13\" /><ref name=\"Jim Reilly\">{{cite web |url=http://psp.ign.com/articles/113/1135225p1.html |title= Alleged PSP2 images surface |author=Jim Reilly |date=November 17, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> Reports arose during the [[Tokyo Game Show]] that the device was unveiled internally during a private meeting during mid-September held at Sony Computer Entertainment's headquarters in Aoyama, Tokyo.<ref name=\"KotakuOctPSP2\" /> Shortly after, reports of [[development kits]] for the handheld had reportedly already been shipped to numerous video game developers including both [[SIE Worldwide Studios|first-party]] and third-party developers to start making games for the device,<ref name=\"KotakuSep10\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5649239/report-psp2-hardware-now-in-the-hands-of-numerous-developers |title=Report: PSP2 Hardware Now In The Hands Of 'Numerous' Developers |author=Michael McWhertor |date=September 27, 2010 |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref> a report later confirmed by ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' Executive Producer Shaun Himmerick.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/09/16/psp2-in-the-hands-of-mortal-kombat-devs/ |title=PSP2 in the hands of Mortal Kombat devs;
