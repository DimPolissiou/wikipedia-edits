{"title_page": "Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina", "text_new": "{{History of Bosnia}}\nWithin the boundaries of today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], there have been many layers of prehistoric cultures whose creation and disappearance are linked to migrations of unidentified ethnic groups.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:Butmirska vaza.jpg|left|thumb|The vase from Butmir near Sarajevo, early Neolithic]]\n{{Main|Prehistory of Southeastern Europe}}\nThe [[Paleolithic]] in Bosnia is marked by the oldest Paleolithic monument in southeastern Europe, the engravings in [[Badanj Cave]] near [[Stolac]] in Herzegovina. A magnificent one is ''Horse attacked by arrows'', preserved in fragments and dated around 14-12000 BC.\n\nDuring the time when [[Neolithic]] cultures were appearing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there existed interesting mixtures of [[Mediterranean]] and [[Pannonian]] cultures.\nHerzegovina was under the influence of [[impresso]] [[Pottery|ceramics]] from the western Mediterranean, as seen in ''Green Cave'' near [[Mostar]], \u010cairi near [[Stolac]], [[Lisi\u010di\u0107i]] near [[Konjic]] and ''Pe\u0107 Mlini'' near [[Grude]]. People then lived in caves or simple settlements on hilltops.  \nOn the upper mainstream of the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river and in northeast parts of Bosnia (''Obre I'' near [[Kakanj]]), people lived in wooden houses built by the river. In this culture we can see influences from [[Adriatic]] cultures in the south and the Star\u010devi\u0107 culture in the northeast. Original expressions of [[Kakanj culture]] are ceramic pots on four legs, called [[rhyton]]. We can also find them in the [[Danilo culture]] on the Croatian coast. Due to these objects, ''Kakanj culture'' is considered a part of the wide circle of Neolithic populations that followed a cult of life force (from northern Italy, Dalmatia and [[Epirus]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]). \nThe [[Butmir culture]] near [[Sarajevo]] is distinctive, with fine glazed ceramics and miscellaneous geometrical decorations (often spirals). Figures from Butmir are unique sculptures modeled with hand; heads are almost like portraits with emphasized parts of body.\n\n[[Bronze Age]] settlements in Herzegovina were built like [[citadel]]s (natively called ''gradina''), and in Bosnia we have necropolises with stone [[tumuli]]. During this time, bronze arms, decorated plates, flat necklaces, and fibulas were decorated with a specific geometrical style of engraved ornament.\n\n==Illyrian period==\n{{See|Illyria}}\n[[File:Glasinac culture.png|thumb|right|200px|Iron Age Glasinac culture (around 300 BC).]]\nThe bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].\n\nFrom  8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was that of the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC.[7] The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom.[8] The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC.[9] The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom.[10] Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.\n\nFrom the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Halstat]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different.\nA very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high.\n''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).\n\n[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]\nIn the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.\n\nIn the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]], the main center of ancient culture in B&H. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.\n\n==Roman period==\n{{See|Dalmatia (Roman province)}}\n{{See|Illyricum (Roman province)}}\nConflict between the Illyrians and [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] started in 229 BC. In the year 168 BC, the land of Illyrians became the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. Rome completed its annexation of the region in 9 A.D, ending a three-year rebellion of Illyrians against Romans. In the year 10 A.D., Illyria was divided and the northern strip of today's Bosnia along the south side of the [[Sava|Sava River]] became part of the new province of [[Pannonia]]. The rest of what is today [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Dalmatia]], and western [[Serbia]] became part of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]]. \n[[File:Ancient Bosnia.png|thumbnail|Map of ancient settlements and roads in Bosnia and Herzegovina|left]]\nIn the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from all over the [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region. Several towns of today's Bosnia were founded under Roman rule. For example, the town of [[Blagaj]] on the [[Buna River (Neretva)|Buna River]] is built on the site of the Roman town of [[Bona (Hum)|Bona]]. Roman Bosnia enjoyed a huge development, with many \"Roman via\" and \"castra\" and an economy based on the exploitation of mines.<ref>[http://av.zrc-sazu.si/pdf/56/AV_56_Skegro.pdf Map and information of Roman Bosnia-Herzegovina]</ref> Following Roman rule there was a large number of [[Vlachs]] who were descended from a pre-Slavic population.

The Ostrogoth Kingdom was defeated by Byzantine Empire in the [[Gothic War (535\u2013552)|Gothic War]] (535&ndash;553) by the Emperor [[Justinian I]], and the area was re-conquered for the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== Sources ==\n*[[Noel Malcolm]], Bosnia A Short History, Macmillan London Limited, 1994.\n*\u201cUmjetni\u010dko Blago Bosne i Hercegovine\u201d, several authors, Svjetlost, Sarajevo, 1987.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Early History Of Bosnia And Herzegovina}}\n{{Roman history by territory}}\n[[Category:Prehistoric Bosnia and Herzegovina| ]]\n[[Category:Ancient Bosnia and Herzegovina| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{History of Bosnia}}\nWithin the boundaries of today's [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], there have been many layers of prehistoric cultures whose creation and disappearance are linked to migrations of unidentified ethnic groups.\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:Butmirska vaza.jpg|left|thumb|The vase from Butmir near Sarajevo, early Neolithic]]\n{{Main|Prehistory of Southeastern Europe}}\nThe [[Paleolithic]] in Bosnia is marked by the oldest Paleolithic monument in southeastern Europe, the engravings in [[Badanj Cave]] near [[Stolac]] in Herzegovina.

It is {{convert|4.4|mi|km}} from {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}}. Its three letter station code is FIT. There are four platforms but minimal facilities. The station is managed by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], the seventh company to be responsible for the station, and the third franchise since privatisation in 1997. They provide most train services at the station, with two trains per day operated by [[CrossCountry]]. The general service level is eight trains per hour - two to South Wales, two to {{rws|Bristol Parkway}}, two toward {{rws|Weston-super-Mare}} and two toward {{rws|Westbury}}.\n\nFilton Abbey Wood is the third station on the site. The first station, Filton, was opened in 1863 by the [[Bristol and South Wales Union Railway]]. The station had a single platform, with a second added in 1886 to cope with traffic from the [[Severn Tunnel]]. The station was closed in 1903, replaced by a new station, Filton Junction, {{convert|0.15|mi|km}} further north, which was built at the junction with the newly constructed Badminton Line from [[Wootton Bassett Junction railway station|Wootton Bassett Junction]]. The new station had four platforms, each with waiting rooms and large canopies.\n\nServices at Filton Junction declined in the second half of the twentieth century, with the station buildings and Badminton Line platforms demolished in 1976. The station was closed completely in September 1996, replaced by the current station, Filton Abbey Wood. This was built {{convert|0.3|mi|km}} south of the original station, adjacent to a new [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] office development. The station was built with two platforms, but a third was added in 2004 and a fourth in 2018.\n\nThe line through Filton Abbey Wood is not electrified. Platform 4 was completed in 2018 as part of the Filton Bank four-tracking project, allowing increased services between Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads.\n\n== Description ==\n\n[[File:Filton Abbey Wood from the footbridge.jpg|thumb|A view from the footbridge.]]\n\nFilton Abbey Wood railway station is located in the [[Filton]] area of [[South Gloucestershire]], within the [[Bristol]] [[conurbation]].

As part of this development, a new station was built in Filton, primarily to serve the MoD workers. Construction began in 1995, and cost \u00a31,400,000. The station, named Filton Abbey Wood, was opened to the public on 11 March 1996 and officially opened on 19 March by [[Department for Transport|Minister for Transport]] [[Steven Norris]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and the Chair of [[Avon County Council]].<ref name=\"Oakley\"/> Shortly after the station was opened, the [[Avon (county)|county of Avon]] was disbanded, with the Filton region now governed by [[South Gloucestershire]] council.<ref name=\"avon\">{{cite news|title=The End of Avon|publisher=[[BBC]]|year=1996|author1=Orr, Linda|author2=[[Michael Lund|Lund, Michael]]}}</ref>\n\nThe new station was situated {{convert|23|chain|m}} south of the first Filton station, and {{convert|34|chain|m}} south of Filton Junction.<ref name=\"BSW\"/><ref name=\"chains\" group=\"note\"/> There were two platforms, each {{convert|108|m|yds}} long, separated by two running lines.<ref name=\"nrwrspeed\"/> A ramped footbridge connected the platforms at the north end, and each platform had ground-level access from the sides: the eastern, southbound platform from MoD Abbey Wood; the western, northbound platform via a footpath from the car park to the north.

Wessex Trains 'Alphaline' services departed from Temple Meads at 10 minutes past the hour, normally 20 minutes later than usual. Some also called at Lawrence Hill, Stapleton Road and Patchway where there was a road bus connection to Parkway and Filton Abbey Wood. In the opposite direction, the usual 30 minutes past the hour services from Cardiff ran 10 minutes later, making similar calls and arriving at Temple Meads at 15 minutes past the hour  (95 minutes from Cardiff) leaving at 22 minutes past the hour for Portsmouth Harbour. Running times between Parkway and Temple Meads was 30 minutes and between Patchway and Temple Meads around 35 minutes, resulting in some trains from Bristol to Cardiff standing at Patchway (leaving at 58 minutes past the hour) for about 10 minutes.

It is {{convert|4.4|mi|km}} from {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}}. Its three letter station code is FIT. There are four platforms but minimal facilities. The station is managed by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]], the seventh company to be responsible for the station, and the third franchise since privatisation in 1997. They provide most train services at the station, with two trains per day operated by [[CrossCountry]]. The general service level is eight trains per hour - two to South Wales, two to {{rws|Bristol Parkway}}, two toward {{rws|Weston-super-Mare}} and two toward {{rws|Westbury}}.\n\nFilton Abbey Wood is the third station on the site. The first station, Filton, was opened in 1863 by the [[Bristol and South Wales Union Railway]]. The station had a single platform, with a second added in 1886 to cope with traffic from the [[Severn Tunnel]]. The station was closed in 1903, replaced by a new station, Filton Junction, {{convert|0.15|mi|km}} further north, which was built at the junction with the newly constructed Badminton Line from [[Wootton Bassett Junction railway station|Wootton Bassett Junction]]. The new station had four platforms, each with waiting rooms and large canopies.\n\nServices at Filton Junction declined in the second half of the twentieth century, with the station buildings and Badminton Line platforms demolished in 1976. The station was closed completely in September 1996, replaced by the current station, Filton Abbey Wood. This was built {{convert|0.3|mi|km}} south of the original station, adjacent to a new [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] office development. The station was built with two platforms, but a third was added in 2004 and a fourth in 2018.\n\nThe line through Filton Abbey Wood is not electrified. Platform 4 was completed in 2018 as part of the Filton Bank four-tracking project, allowing increased services between Bristol Parkway and Bristol Temple Meads.\n\n== Description ==\n\n[[File:Filton Abbey Wood from the footbridge.jpg|thumb|A view from the footbridge.]]\n\nFilton Abbey Wood railway station is located in the [[Filton]] area of [[South Gloucestershire]], within the [[Bristol]] [[conurbation]].

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]]. <ref name=\"A Munly Man\">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Brad |title=A Munly Man |url=https://www.westword.com/music/a-munly-man-5055649 |accessdate=26 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=October 18, 1995 |ref=A Munly Man}}</ref>\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]].

It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable; the [[half-lives]] of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate= 22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050\u20130.0059%).<ref>{{cite web|title = Uranium Isotopes|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/u-isotopes.htm|accessdate = 14 March 2012}}</ref> Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]].

Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (<sup>238</sup>U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].<ref name=\"BuildingBlocks479\">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.</ref> Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].\n\nThe 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in ''[[Little Boy]]'', the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear weapon used in war]]. An ensuing [[arms race]] during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived [[plutonium-239]]. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)#Dissolution of the USSR|breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/world/20100218/157925732.html \"U.S. to pump money into nuke stockpile, increase security,\"] ''RIA Novosti'' 18 February 2010</ref> See [[Nuclear proliferation]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235|alt=A diagram showing a chain transformation of uranium-235 to uranium-236 to barium-141 and krypton-92]]\nWhen [[refining (metallurgy)|refined]], uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]].

Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses [[plutonium-239]] derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ([[thermonuclear weapon]]) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of [[tritium]] and [[deuterium]] to undergo [[nuclear fusion]].

All three are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]], emitting [[alpha particle]]s, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing [[spontaneous fission]]. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when <sup>238</sup>U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another <sup>238</sup>U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when <sup>238</sup>U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to [[neptunium-237]]; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the [[decay chain]] of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that [[thorium-232]] should be able to undergo [[double beta decay]], which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.<ref name=NUBASE>{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref>\n\nUranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a [[half-life]] of about 4.468{{e|9}} years, roughly the [[age of the Earth]]. Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13{{e|8}} years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48{{e|5}} years.<ref name=\"EncyChem777\">{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=777}}.</ref>\nFor natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by <sup>238</sup>U, and also 49% by <sup>234</sup>U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the <sup>235</sup>U. When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of <sup>234</sup>U was probably much lower than this.\n\nUranium-238 is usually an \u03b1 emitter (occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous fission), decaying through the [[decay chain#Uranium series|uranium series]], which has 18 members, into [[lead#Isotopes|lead-206]], by a variety of different decay paths.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/>\n\nThe [[decay chain]] of <sup>235</sup>U, which is called the [[decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]], has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/> The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to [[decay product|daughter elements]] useful in [[radiometric dating]].\n\nUranium-234, which is a member of the uranium series (the decay chain of uranium-238), decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes.\n\nUranium-233 is made from [[thorium#Isotopes|thorium-232]] by neutron bombardment, usually in a nuclear reactor, and <sup>233</sup>U is also fissile.<ref name=\"LANL\"/> Its decay chain forms part of the [[decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] and ends at [[bismuth-209]] and [[thallium]]-205.\n\nUranium-235 is important for both [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s, because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is [[fissile]]. This means that it can be split into two or three fragments ([[fission products]]) by thermal neutrons.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/>\n\nUranium-238 is not fissile, but is a fertile isotope, because after [[neutron activation]] it can be converted to [[plutonium-239]], another fissile isotope. Indeed, the <sup>238</sup>U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope [[uranium-239]]. <sup>239</sup>U decays by [[beta emission]] to [[neptunium]]-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. <sup>239</sup>Pu was used as fissile material in the first [[atomic bomb]] detonated in the \"[[Trinity test]]\" on 15 July 1945 in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"EncyChem773\"/>\n\n===Enrichment===\n{{Main|Enriched uranium}}\n[[File:Gas centrifuge cascade.jpg|thumb|Cascades of [[gas centrifuge]]s are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes.|alt=A photo of a large hall filled with arrays of long white standing cylinders.]]\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and uranium-235 (0.7204%).

It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable; the [[half-lives]] of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate= 22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050\u20130.0059%).<ref>{{cite web|title = Uranium Isotopes|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/u-isotopes.htm|accessdate = 14 March 2012}}</ref> Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]].

Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (<sup>238</sup>U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].<ref name=\"BuildingBlocks479\">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.</ref> Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].\n\nThe 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J.

When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of <sup>234</sup>U was probably much lower than this.\n\nUranium-238 is usually an \u03b1 emitter (occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous fission), decaying through the [[decay chain#Uranium series|uranium series]], which has 18 members, into [[lead#Isotopes|lead-206]], by a variety of different decay paths.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/>\n\nThe [[decay chain]] of <sup>235</sup>U, which is called the [[decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]], has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/> The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to [[decay product|daughter elements]] useful in [[radiometric dating]].\n\nUranium-234, which is a member of the uranium series (the decay chain of uranium-238), decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes.\n\nUranium-233 is made from [[thorium#Isotopes|thorium-232]] by neutron bombardment, usually in a nuclear reactor, and <sup>233</sup>U is also fissile.<ref name=\"LANL\"/> Its decay chain forms part of the [[decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] and ends at [[bismuth-209]] and [[thallium]]-205.\n\nUranium-235 is important for both [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s, because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is [[fissile]]. This means that it can be split into two or three fragments ([[fission products]]) by thermal neutrons.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/>\n\nUranium-238 is not fissile, but is a fertile isotope, because after [[neutron activation]] it can be converted to [[plutonium-239]], another fissile isotope. Indeed, the <sup>238</sup>U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope [[uranium-239]]. <sup>239</sup>U decays by [[beta emission]] to [[neptunium]]-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. <sup>239</sup>Pu was used as fissile material in the first [[atomic bomb]] detonated in the \"[[Trinity test]]\" on 15 July 1945 in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"EncyChem773\"/>\n\n===Enrichment===\n{{Main|Enriched uranium}}\n[[File:Gas centrifuge cascade.jpg|thumb|Cascades of [[gas centrifuge]]s are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes.|alt=A photo of a large hall filled with arrays of long white standing cylinders.]]\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and uranium-235 (0.7204%).
