Macedonian is spoken as a native language by migrant communities throughout the [[Balkan Peninsula]], [[continental Europe]] and the rest of the world, predominantly [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. The actual number of Macedonian [[native language|native]] and [[second language]]  speakers is difficult to establish due to historico-political policies of countries neighboring North Macedonia and the large emigration of the population. An additional factor making the estimate of speakers difficult is that several [[dialects of Macedonian|Macedonian dialects]] are also considered dialects of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] or [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. \n\nAccording to the 2002 census, the total population of [[North Macedonia]] was 2,022,547, with 1,344,815 citizens declaring Macedonian their native language.<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf|title=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e, \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430\u045c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, 2002|trans-title=Census of the population, households and dwellings in the Republic of Macedonia, 2002|work=Book X|publisher=Republic of Macedonia State Statistical Office|year=May 2005|location=Skopje|language=Macedonian and English|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> Macedonian is also studied and spoken to various degrees as a second language by all [[Demographics of North Macedonia#ethnic groups|ethnic minorities]] in the country.<ref name=\"periods435\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/fisol/zbornik.pdf|title=\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438: \u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0430\u045a\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian as a foreign and second language: terminological questions|language=mk|first1=Emilija|last1=Crvenkovska|first2=Elena|last2=Petroska|publisher=[[Ss.

It was a 1976 hit and a staple of disco music, and became Boney M.'s first United Kingdom hit.\n\nIt was the second Boney M. single, released in 1976, without making any major impact at first. After a spectacular performance on the ''[[Musikladen]]'' TV show in September the single became a hit, topping most European charts. It reached number six in the United Kingdom charts and number 65 in the [[United States]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The single also topped the German charts and reached the Top 20 in Canada. It proved to be the major European breakthrough of the band.\n\n==The song==\n\"Daddy Cool\" was a novelty gimmick record with an unusual, percussive intro by producer [[Frank Farian]] doing rhythmic tic-tic-tics and playing on his teeth with a pencil. Farian also sang all male voice parts ([[Bobby Farrell]] always danced to full playback). His characteristic deep voice sings: \"She's crazy like a fool...\" and is answered by the bright voices of [[Liz Mitchell]] and [[Marcia Barrett]]: \"...wild about Daddy Cool\". This line has been misheard by listeners as \"...what about Daddy Cool\", so much that the band started singing it that way during live performances.<ref>{{cite web|first= J. |last= Temptation |title= Notes toward a reconceptualization of Boney M.'s \"Daddy Cool\" |website= [[The New Inquiry]] |date= 7 August 2015 |accessdate= 18 April 2019 |url= https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/notes-toward-a-reconceptualiztion-of-boney-m-s-daddy-cool/}}</ref> The bass [[riff]] kicks in and builds to the instrumental theme followed by the repetitive, nursery rhyme-like verse and chorus twice.\n\nThe song [[breakdown (music)|breaks down]] into a spoken passage by Farrell before it goes back into the bass riff and repeats the verse and chorus for the last time. With its slightly hypnotic, repetitive bassline and strings and likewise repetitive, bright female vocals, the track is highly typical of mid-1970s \"Munich disco\".\n\n==The single==\nOriginally, [[Hansa Records]] wanted Boney M.'s cover of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\" as the A-side of the single but Farian - seeing that his own song was the clear winner when testing both tracks in his discoth\u00e8que in [[Sankt Ingbert|St. Ingbert]] \u2013 managed to persuade the record company to have it his way. In the US, Hungary and Japan (where the single wasn't released until November), the single was backed by the album track \"Lovin' or Leavin'\", in East Germany the record was released in 1977, backed by their next hit \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]\".\n\nBelgium released 7\" has a rare B-side version of \"No Woman, No Cry\" as the track does not fade out at the end but has a hard ending and thus runs slightly longer 5:03 instead the common 4:58. This rare version has so far not been released on CD.\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1976\u20131977)\n!Peak<br/>Position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |publisher= Australian-charts.com.

The 7\" version made its CD debut on ''The Collection'' (disc 2, track 1).\n\n===Releases===\n'''7\" Single''' \n*\"\"Daddy Cool (Anniversary Recording '86)\" \u2013 (Farian, Reyam, Farian, Bischof) 5:18 / \"B.M.A.G.O.\" (Farian) \u2013 4:10 ([[Hansa Records]] 107 994-100, 1986)\n\n'''12\" Single'''\n* \"Daddy Cool (Anniversary Recording '86)\" Special Club Mix \u2013 9:07 / Extended Radio Edit (Not credited on label) \u2013 5:50 / \"B.M.A.G.O.\" \u2013 3:15 (Hansa 607 994-213, 1986)\n\n==Boney M. 2000 version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Daddy Cool '99\n| cover      = Boney_M._2000_-_Daddy_Cool_'99_(1999_single).jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Boney M.]]\n| album      = [[20th Century Hits]]\n| released   = 1999\n| format     = {{hlist|[[12-inch single|12\" single]]|[[CD single]]}}\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Records]] <small>(FRG)</small>\n| writer     = {{hlist|[[Frank Farian]]|George Reyam}}\n| producer   = [[Frank Farian]]\n| prev_title = [[Ma Baker#1998 Remix|Ma Baker (Boney M. vs. Sash!)]]\n| prev_year  = 1998\n| next_title = [[Hooray!

An all-new line-up '''Boney M. 2000''' featuring three young girls and rapper Mobi T. was featured in the video and also announced to front a forthcoming remix album. This decision was not popular with the group's fan base, and Farian subsequently dropped the idea. \"Daddy Cool\" could not match the success of its predecessor, peaking only at no. 47 in the German charts.\n\n===Charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1999)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders Tip|2|artist=Boney M. 2000 feat.

It was a 1976 hit and a staple of disco music, and became Boney M.'s first United Kingdom hit.\n\nIt was the second Boney M. single, released in 1976, without making any major impact at first. After a spectacular performance on the ''[[Musikladen]]'' TV show in September the single became a hit, topping most European charts. It reached number six in the United Kingdom charts and number 65 in the [[United States]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The single also topped the German charts and reached the Top 20 in Canada. It proved to be the major European breakthrough of the band.\n\n==The song==\n\"Daddy Cool\" was a novelty gimmick record with an unusual, percussive intro by producer [[Frank Farian]] doing rhythmic tic-tic-tics and playing on his teeth with a pencil. Farian also sang all male voice parts ([[Bobby Farrell]] always danced to full playback). His characteristic deep voice sings: \"She's crazy like a fool...\" and is answered by the bright voices of [[Liz Mitchell]] and [[Marcia Barrett]]: \"...wild about Daddy Cool\". This line has been misheard by listeners as \"...what about Daddy Cool\", so much that the band started singing it that way during live performances.<ref>{{cite web|first= J. |last= Temptation |title= Notes toward a reconceptualization of Boney M.'s \"Daddy Cool\" |website= [[The New Inquiry]] |date= 7 August 2015 |accessdate= 18 April 2019 |url= https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/notes-toward-a-reconceptualiztion-of-boney-m-s-daddy-cool/}}</ref> The bass [[riff]] kicks in and builds to the instrumental theme followed by the repetitive, nursery rhyme-like verse and chorus twice.\n\nThe song [[breakdown (music)|breaks down]] into a spoken passage by Farrell before it goes back into the bass riff and repeats the verse and chorus for the last time. With its slightly hypnotic, repetitive bassline and strings and likewise repetitive, bright female vocals, the track is highly typical of mid-1970s \"Munich disco\".\n\n==The single==\nOriginally, [[Hansa Records]] wanted Boney M.'s cover of [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\" as the A-side of the single but Farian - seeing that his own song was the clear winner when testing both tracks in his discoth\u00e8que in [[Sankt Ingbert|St. Ingbert]] \u2013 managed to persuade the record company to have it his way. In the US, Hungary and Japan (where the single wasn't released until November), the single was backed by the album track \"Lovin' or Leavin'\", in East Germany the record was released in 1977, backed by their next hit \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]\".\n\nBelgium released 7\" has a rare B-side version of \"No Woman, No Cry\" as the track does not fade out at the end but has a hard ending and thus runs slightly longer 5:03 instead the common 4:58. This rare version has so far not been released on CD.\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1976\u20131977)\n!Peak<br/>Position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|title= Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |publisher= Australian-charts.com.

The original plans of releasing another single (\"[[Dreadlock Holiday]]\") from the group's final album ''[[Eye Dance]]'' were cancelled, instead producer Frank Farian recorded a new version of \"Daddy Cool\" in a special \"anniversary recording\", featuring rap parts, and new instrumental parts. The single, however, proved to be Boney M.'s worst-selling single, failing to chart anywhere. The B-side \"B.M.A.G.O.\" appeared in a longer version on the 7\" than on the 12\" single. The 12\" single also included an edit version of \"Daddy Cool\" which was not credited on the cover. The 7\" version made its CD debut on ''The Collection'' (disc 2, track 1).\n\n===Releases===\n'''7\" Single''' \n*\"\"Daddy Cool (Anniversary Recording '86)\" \u2013 (Farian, Reyam, Farian, Bischof) 5:18 / \"B.M.A.G.O.\" (Farian) \u2013 4:10 ([[Hansa Records]] 107 994-100, 1986)\n\n'''12\" Single'''\n* \"Daddy Cool (Anniversary Recording '86)\" Special Club Mix \u2013 9:07 / Extended Radio Edit (Not credited on label) \u2013 5:50 / \"B.M.A.G.O.\" \u2013 3:15 (Hansa 607 994-213, 1986)\n\n==Boney M. 2000 version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Daddy Cool '99\n| cover      = Boney_M._2000_-_Daddy_Cool_'99_(1999_single).jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Boney M.]]\n| album      = [[20th Century Hits]]\n| released   = 1999\n| format     = {{hlist|[[12-inch single|12\" single]]|[[CD single]]}}\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Records]] <small>(FRG)</small>\n| writer     = {{hlist|[[Frank Farian]]|George Reyam}}\n| producer   = [[Frank Farian]]\n| prev_title = [[Ma Baker#1998 Remix|Ma Baker (Boney M. vs. Sash!)]]\n| prev_year  = 1998\n| next_title = [[Hooray!

An all-new line-up '''Boney M. 2000''' featuring three young girls and rapper Mobi T. was featured in the video and also announced to front a forthcoming remix album. This decision was not popular with the group's fan base, and Farian subsequently dropped the idea. \"Daddy Cool\" could not match the success of its predecessor, peaking only at no. 47 in the German charts.\n\n===Charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1999)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders Tip|2|artist=Boney M. 2000 feat.
