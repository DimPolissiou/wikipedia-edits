It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she has also brought with her a man whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee feels that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, return.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she has also brought with her a man whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee feels that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

{"title_page": "DEVS", "text_new": "'''DEVS''' abbreviating '''Discrete Event System Specification''' is a modular and hierarchical formalism for modeling and analyzing general systems that can be discrete event systems which might be described by [[state transition table]]s, and continuous state systems which might be described by [[differential equation]]s, and hybrid continuous state and discrete event systems. DEVS is a [[timed event system]].\n\n==History==\nDEVS abbreviating Discrete Event System Specification is a modular and hierarchical formalism for modeling and analyzing general systems that can be discrete event systems which might be described by state transition tables, and continuous state systems which might be described by differential equations, and hybrid ...\nDEVS is a formalism for modeling and analysis of discrete event systems (DESs). The DEVS formalism was invented by [[Bernard P. Zeigler]], who is emeritus professor at the [[University of Arizona]]. DEVS was introduced to the public in Zeigler's first book, [http://acims.asu.edu/publications/books-proceedings-and-manuscripts/theory-of-modeling-and-simulation-2nd-edition-academic-press ''Theory of Modeling and Simulation''], in 1976, while Zeigler was an associate professor at [[University of Michigan]]. DEVS can be seen as an extension of the [[Moore machine]] formalism,<ref>automata were the mathematical models of Dr. Zeigler's Ph.D. thesis [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler68]]]</ref> which is a finite state automaton where the outputs are determined by the current state alone (and do not depend directly on the input). The extension was done by   \n# associating a lifespan with each state [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler76]]],\n# providing a hierarchical concept with an operation, called ''coupling'' [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]].\n\nSince the lifespan of each state is a real number (more precisely, non-negative real) or infinity, it is distinguished from discrete time systems, sequential machines, and [[Moore machine]]s, in which time is determined by a tick time multiplied by non-negative integers. Moreover, the lifespan can be a [[random variable]]; for example the lifespan of a given state can be distributed [[Exponential distribution|exponentially]] or [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]]. The state transition and output functions of DEVS can also be [[stochastic]].\n\nZeigler proposed a hierarchical algorithm for DEVS model simulation in 1984 [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]] which was published in ''Simulation'' journal in 1987. Since then, many extended formalism from DEVS have been introduced with their own purposes: DESS/DEVS for combined continuous and discrete event systems, P-DEVS for parallel DESs, G-DEVS for piecewise continuous state trajectory modeling of DESs, RT-DEVS for realtime DESs, Cell-DEVS for cellular DESs, Fuzzy-DEVS for fuzzy DESs, Dynamic Structuring DEVS for DESs changing their coupling structures dynamically, and so on. In addition to its extensions, there are some subclasses such as [[SP-DEVS]] and [[FD-DEVS]] have been researched for achieving decidability of system properties.\n\nDue to the modular and hierarchical modeling views, as well as its simulation-based analysis capability, the DEVS formalism and its variations have been used in many application of engineering (such as hardware design, hardware/software codesign, [[communications system]]s, [[manufacturing]] systems) and science (such as [[biology]], and [[sociology]])\n\n==Formalism==\n[[File:FD-DEVS PINGPONG.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Fig. 1. A DEVS Model for Ping-Pong Game]]\n; Intuitive Example\nDEVS defines system behavior as well as system structure. System behavior in DEVS formalism is described using input and output events as well as states. For example, for the ping-pong player of Fig. 1, the input event is ''?receive'', and the output event is ''!send''. Each player, ''A'', ''B'', has its states: ''Send'' and ''Wait''. ''Send'' state takes 0.1 seconds to send back the ball that is the output event ''!send'', while the ''Wait'' state lasts until the player receives the ball that is the input event ''?receive''.\n\nThe structure of ping-pong game is to connect two players: Player ''A'' 's output event ''!send'' is transmitted to Player ''B'' 's input event ''?receive'', and vice versa.\n\nIn the classic DEVS formalism, ''Atomic DEVS'' captures the system behavior, while ''Coupled DEVS'' describes the structure of system.\n\nThe following formal definition is for Classic DEVS [[DEVS#References|[ZKP00]]]. In this article, we will use the time base, <math> \\mathbb{T}=[0,\\infty)</math> that is the set of non-negative real numbers; the extended time base,<math> \\mathbb{T}^\\infty=[0,\\infty]</math> that is the set of non-negative real numbers plus infinity.\n\n===Atomic DEVS===\nAn atomic DEVS model is defined as a 7-[[tuple]] <br />\n   <center><math>M=<X,Y,S,ta, \\delta_{ext}, \\delta_{int}, \\lambda></math> </center>\n\nwhere \n<blockquote>\n*<math>X</math> is ''the set of input events'';\n*<math>Y</math> is ''the set of output events'';\n*<math>S</math> is ''the set of sequential states'' (or also called ''the set of partial states'');\n*<math>s_0\\in S</math> is ''the initial state'';\n*<math>ta:S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{T}^\\infty</math> is ''the time advance function'' which is used to determine the lifespan of a state;\n*<math>\\delta_{ext}:Q \\times X \\rightarrow  S </math> is ''the external transition function'' which defines how an input event changes a state of the system, where <math>Q=\\{(s,t_e)|s \\in S, t_e \\in (\\mathbb{T} \\cap [0, ta(s)])\\}</math> is the ''set of total states'', and <math>t_e</math> is the ''elapsed time'' since ''the last event'';\n<ref>We can also define the external transition function as <math>\\delta_{ext}:Q \\times X \\rightarrow S \\times \\{0,1\\} </math> where <math> Q = S \\times \\mathbb{T}^\\infty \\times \\mathbb{T} </math> such that for a total state <math>(s, t_s, t_e) \\in Q</math>, <math>s \\in S</math> is a partial state, <math> t_s \\in \\mathbb{T}^\\infty</math> is the lifespan of <math>s</math>, and <math> t_e \\in (\\mathbb{T} \\cap [0,t_s])</math> is the  elapsed time since ''last update'' of <math> t_s</math>. For more how to understand this function, refer to the article, [[Behavior of DEVS]].</ref>\n\n<br />\n*<math>\\delta_{int}:S \\rightarrow S </math> is ''the internal transition function'' which defines how a state of the system changes internally (when the elapsed time reaches to the lifetime of the state);\n*<math>\\lambda:S \\rightarrow  Y^\\phi</math> is ''the output function'' where <math>Y^\\phi=Y \\cup \\{\\phi\\}</math> and <math> \\phi \\not\\in Y</math> is a ''silent'' event or an ''unobserved'' event. This function defines how a state of the system generates an output event (when the elapsed time reaches to the lifetime of the state);  </blockquote>\n\n; The atomic DEVS Model for Ping-Pong Players\nThe atomic DEVS model for player A of Fig. 1 is given \nPlayer=<math><X,Y,S,s_0,ta,\\delta_{ext}, \\delta_{int}, \\lambda></math> \nsuch that \n<blockquote>\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n X &= \\{?\\textit{receive}\\}\\\\\n Y &= \\{!\\textit{send}\\}\\\\\n S &= \\{(d,\\sigma)| d \\in \\{\\textit{Wait},\\textit{Send}\\}, \\sigma \\in \\mathbb{T}^\\infty\\}\\\\\n s_0 &= (\\textit{Send}, 0.1)\\\\\n t_a(s) &=\\sigma \\text{ for all } s \\in S\\\\\n\\delta_{ext}(((\\textit{Wait},\\sigma),t_e),?\\textit{receive})&=(\\textit{Send},0.1)\\\\\n\\delta_{int}(\\textit{Send},\\sigma)&=(\\textit{Wait},\\infty)\\\\\n\\delta_{int}(\\textit{Wait},\\sigma)&=(\\textit{Send},0.1)\\\\\n\\lambda(\\textit{Send},\\sigma)&=!\\textit{send}\\\\\n\\lambda(\\textit{Wait},\\sigma)&=\\phi\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n</blockquote>\n\nBoth Player A and Player B are atomic DEVS models.\n\n==== Behavior of Atomic DEVS ====\nSimply speaking, there are two cases that an atomic DEVS model <math> M </math> can change its state <math>s \\in S</math>: (1) when an external input <math> x \\in X </math> comes into the system <math> M </math>; (2) when the elapsed time <math> t_e </math> reaches the lifespan of <math>s</math> which is defined by <math> ta(s) </math>. (At the same time of (2), <math> M </math> generates an output <math> y \\in Y</math> which is defined by <math> \\lambda(s) </math>.) .\n\nFor formal behavior description of given an Atomic DEVS model, refer to the page [[Behavior of DEVS]]. Computer algorithms to implement the behavior of a given Atomic DEVS model are available at [[Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS]].\n\n=== Coupled DEVS ===\nThe coupled DEVS defines which sub-components belong to it and how they are connected with each other. A coupled DEVS model is defined as an 8-[[tuple]]\n\n<center>  <math>N=<X,Y,D,\\{M_i\\},C_{xx}, C_{yx}, C_{yy}, Select> </math> </center>\n\nwhere\n<blockquote>\n*<math>X</math> is ''the set of input events'';\n*<math>Y</math> is ''the set of output events'';\n*<math>D</math> is ''the name set of sub-components'';\n*<math>\\{M_i\\}</math> is ''the set of sub-components'' where for each <math>i \\in D, M_i</math> can be either an atomic DEVS model or a coupled DEVS model.\n*<math>C_{xx}\\subseteq X \\times \\bigcup_{i \\in D} X_i</math> is ''the set of external input couplings'';\n*<math>C_{yx}\\subseteq \\bigcup_{i \\in D} Y_i \\times \\bigcup_{i \\in D} X_i</math> is ''the set of internal couplings'';\n*<math>C_{yy}: \\bigcup_{i \\in D} Y_i \\rightarrow Y^\\phi</math> is ''the external output coupling function'';\n*<math>Select:2^D \\rightarrow D</math> is ''the tie-breaking function'' which defines how to select the event from the set of simultaneous events;\n</blockquote>\n\n; The coupled DEVS model for Ping-Pong Game\nThe ping-pong game of Fig. 1 can be modeled as a coupled DEVS model <math> N=<X,Y,D,\\{M_i\\},C_{xx}, C_{yx}, C_{yy}, Select></math> where <math>X=\\{\\} </math>;<math>Y=\\{\\} </math>;<math>D=\\{A,B\\} </math>; <math>M_A \\text{ and } M_B </math> is described as above; <math>C_{xx}=\\{\\}</math>; <math>C_{yx}=\\{(A.!send, B.?receive), (B.!send, A.?receive)\\}</math>; and <math>C_{yy}(A.!send)=\\phi, C_{yy}(B.!send)=\\phi</math>.\n\n==== Behavior of Coupled DEVS ====\nSimply speaking, like the behavior of the atomic DEVS class, a coupled DEVS model <math> N </math> changes its components' states (1) when an external event <math>x \\in X</math> comes into <math> N </math>; (2) when one of components <math> M_i </math> where <math> i \\in D </math> executes its internal state transition and generates its output <math> y_i \\in Y_i</math>. In both cases (1) and (2), a triggering event is transmitted to all influencees which are defined by coupling sets <math> C_{xx}, C_{yx},</math> and <math> C_{yy} </math>.\n\nFor formal definition of behavior of the coupled DEVS, you can refer to [[Behavior of Coupled DEVS]]. Computer algorithms to implement the behavior of a given coupled DEVS mode are available at [[Simulation Algorithms for Coupled DEVS]].\n\n==Analysis Methods==\n\n=== Simulation for Discrete Event Systems ===\nThe simulation algorithm of DEVS models considers two issues: time synchronization and message propagation. ''Time synchronization'' of DEVS is to control all models to have the identical current time. However, for an efficient execution, the algorithm makes the current time jump to the most urgent time when an event is scheduled to execute its internal state transition as well as its output generation. ''Message propagation'' is to transmit a triggering message which can be either an input or output event along the associated couplings which are defined in a coupled DEVS model. For more detailed information, the reader can refer to [[Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS]] and [[Simulation Algorithms for Coupled DEVS]].\n\n===Simulation for Continuous State Systems===\nBy introducing a quantization method which abstracts a continuous segment as a piecewise const segment, DEVS can simulate behaviors of continuous state systems which are described by networks of [[differential algebraic equation]]s. This research has been initiated by Zeigler in 1990s<ref>the use of quantized values in order to simulate continuous systems by means of a [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] method was empirically tried out a few years sooner - in the early 1990s - by a [[Engineering education#France|French]] [[engineer]] <We need any reference for this argument>. He was then working for a company spun off from [[Polytechnic_University_of_Hauts-de-France|University of Valenciennes]], and now part of the [[Schneider Electric]]. This ''quantization'' is a feature of a [[simulation]] [[Application software|software]] of which this engineer is the conceptor and main [[Software developer|developer]], that is used for [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]] programs checking and operator training.</ref> and many properties have been clarified by Prof. Kofman in 2000s and Dr. Nutaro. In 2006, Prof. Cellier who is the author of ''Continuous System Modeling''[[DEVS#References|[Cellier91]]], and Prof. Kofman wrote a text book, ''Continuous System Simulation''[[DEVS#References|[CK06]]] in which Chapters 11 and 12 cover how DEVS simulates continuous state systems.

DEVS is a [[timed event system]].\n\n==History==\nDEVS is a formalism for modeling and analysis of discrete event systems (DESs). The DEVS formalism was invented by [[Bernard P. Zeigler]], who is emeritus professor at the [[University of Arizona]]. DEVS was introduced to the public in Zeigler's first book, [http://acims.asu.edu/publications/books-proceedings-and-manuscripts/theory-of-modeling-and-simulation-2nd-edition-academic-press ''Theory of Modeling and Simulation''], in 1976, while Zeigler was an associate professor at [[University of Michigan]]. DEVS can be seen as an extension of the [[Moore machine]] formalism,<ref>automata were the mathematical models of Dr. Zeigler's Ph.D. thesis [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler68]]]</ref> which is a finite state automaton where the outputs are determined by the current state alone (and do not depend directly on the input). The extension was done by   \n# associating a lifespan with each state [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler76]]],\n# providing a hierarchical concept with an operation, called ''coupling'' [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]].\n\nSince the lifespan of each state is a real number (more precisely, non-negative real) or infinity, it is distinguished from discrete time systems, sequential machines, and [[Moore machine]]s, in which time is determined by a tick time multiplied by non-negative integers. Moreover, the lifespan can be a [[random variable]]; for example the lifespan of a given state can be distributed [[Exponential distribution|exponentially]] or [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly]]. The state transition and output functions of DEVS can also be [[stochastic]].\n\nZeigler proposed a hierarchical algorithm for DEVS model simulation in 1984 [[DEVS#References|[Zeigler84]]] which was published in ''Simulation'' journal in 1987. Since then, many extended formalism from DEVS have been introduced with their own purposes: DESS/DEVS for combined continuous and discrete event systems, P-DEVS for parallel DESs, G-DEVS for piecewise continuous state trajectory modeling of DESs, RT-DEVS for realtime DESs, Cell-DEVS for cellular DESs, Fuzzy-DEVS for fuzzy DESs, Dynamic Structuring DEVS for DESs changing their coupling structures dynamically, and so on. In addition to its extensions, there are some subclasses such as [[SP-DEVS]] and [[FD-DEVS]] have been researched for achieving decidability of system properties.\n\nDue to the modular and hierarchical modeling views, as well as its simulation-based analysis capability, the DEVS formalism and its variations have been used in many application of engineering (such as hardware design, hardware/software codesign, [[communications system]]s, [[manufacturing]] systems) and science (such as [[biology]], and [[sociology]])\n\n==Formalism==\n[[File:FD-DEVS PINGPONG.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Fig. 1. A DEVS Model for Ping-Pong Game]]\n; Intuitive Example\nDEVS defines system behavior as well as system structure. System behavior in DEVS formalism is described using input and output events as well as states. For example, for the ping-pong player of Fig. 1, the input event is ''?receive'', and the output event is ''!send''. Each player, ''A'', ''B'', has its states: ''Send'' and ''Wait''. ''Send'' state takes 0.1 seconds to send back the ball that is the output event ''!send'', while the ''Wait'' state lasts until the player receives the ball that is the input event ''?receive''.\n\nThe structure of ping-pong game is to connect two players: Player ''A'' 's output event ''!send'' is transmitted to Player ''B'' 's input event ''?receive'', and vice versa.\n\nIn the classic DEVS formalism, ''Atomic DEVS'' captures the system behavior, while ''Coupled DEVS'' describes the structure of system.\n\nThe following formal definition is for Classic DEVS [[DEVS#References|[ZKP00]]]. In this article, we will use the time base, <math> \\mathbb{T}=[0,\\infty)</math> that is the set of non-negative real numbers; the extended time base,<math> \\mathbb{T}^\\infty=[0,\\infty]</math> that is the set of non-negative real numbers plus infinity.\n\n===Atomic DEVS===\nAn atomic DEVS model is defined as a 7-[[tuple]] <br />\n   <center><math>M=<X,Y,S,ta, \\delta_{ext}, \\delta_{int}, \\lambda></math> </center>\n\nwhere \n<blockquote>\n*<math>X</math> is ''the set of input events'';\n*<math>Y</math> is ''the set of output events'';\n*<math>S</math> is ''the set of sequential states'' (or also called ''the set of partial states'');\n*<math>s_0\\in S</math> is ''the initial state'';\n*<math>ta:S \\rightarrow \\mathbb{T}^\\infty</math> is ''the time advance function'' which is used to determine the lifespan of a state;\n*<math>\\delta_{ext}:Q \\times X \\rightarrow  S </math> is ''the external transition function'' which defines how an input event changes a state of the system, where <math>Q=\\{(s,t_e)|s \\in S, t_e \\in (\\mathbb{T} \\cap [0, ta(s)])\\}</math> is the ''set of total states'', and <math>t_e</math> is the ''elapsed time'' since ''the last event'';\n<ref>We can also define the external transition function as <math>\\delta_{ext}:Q \\times X \\rightarrow S \\times \\{0,1\\} </math> where <math> Q = S \\times \\mathbb{T}^\\infty \\times \\mathbb{T} </math> such that for a total state <math>(s, t_s, t_e) \\in Q</math>, <math>s \\in S</math> is a partial state, <math> t_s \\in \\mathbb{T}^\\infty</math> is the lifespan of <math>s</math>, and <math> t_e \\in (\\mathbb{T} \\cap [0,t_s])</math> is the  elapsed time since ''last update'' of <math> t_s</math>.

This function defines how a state of the system generates an output event (when the elapsed time reaches to the lifetime of the state);  </blockquote>\n\n; The atomic DEVS Model for Ping-Pong Players\nThe atomic DEVS model for player A of Fig. 1 is given \nPlayer=<math><X,Y,S,s_0,ta,\\delta_{ext}, \\delta_{int}, \\lambda></math> \nsuch that \n<blockquote>\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n X &= \\{?\\textit{receive}\\}\\\\\n Y &= \\{!\\textit{send}\\}\\\\\n S &= \\{(d,\\sigma)| d \\in \\{\\textit{Wait},\\textit{Send}\\}, \\sigma \\in \\mathbb{T}^\\infty\\}\\\\\n s_0 &= (\\textit{Send}, 0.1)\\\\\n t_a(s) &=\\sigma \\text{ for all } s \\in S\\\\\n\\delta_{ext}(((\\textit{Wait},\\sigma),t_e),?\\textit{receive})&=(\\textit{Send},0.1)\\\\\n\\delta_{int}(\\textit{Send},\\sigma)&=(\\textit{Wait},\\infty)\\\\\n\\delta_{int}(\\textit{Wait},\\sigma)&=(\\textit{Send},0.1)\\\\\n\\lambda(\\textit{Send},\\sigma)&=!\\textit{send}\\\\\n\\lambda(\\textit{Wait},\\sigma)&=\\phi\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n</blockquote>\n\nBoth Player A and Player B are atomic DEVS models.\n\n==== Behavior of Atomic DEVS ====\nSimply speaking, there are two cases that an atomic DEVS model <math> M </math> can change its state <math>s \\in S</math>: (1) when an external input <math> x \\in X </math> comes into the system <math> M </math>; (2) when the elapsed time <math> t_e </math> reaches the lifespan of <math>s</math> which is defined by <math> ta(s) </math>. (At the same time of (2), <math> M </math> generates an output <math> y \\in Y</math> which is defined by <math> \\lambda(s) </math>.) .\n\nFor formal behavior description of given an Atomic DEVS model, refer to the page [[Behavior of DEVS]]. Computer algorithms to implement the behavior of a given Atomic DEVS model are available at [[Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS]].\n\n=== Coupled DEVS ===\nThe coupled DEVS defines which sub-components belong to it and how they are connected with each other. A coupled DEVS model is defined as an 8-[[tuple]]\n\n<center>  <math>N=<X,Y,D,\\{M_i\\},C_{xx}, C_{yx}, C_{yy}, Select> </math> </center>\n\nwhere\n<blockquote>\n*<math>X</math> is ''the set of input events'';\n*<math>Y</math> is ''the set of output events'';\n*<math>D</math> is ''the name set of sub-components'';\n*<math>\\{M_i\\}</math> is ''the set of sub-components'' where for each <math>i \\in D, M_i</math> can be either an atomic DEVS model or a coupled DEVS model.\n*<math>C_{xx}\\subseteq X \\times \\bigcup_{i \\in D} X_i</math> is ''the set of external input couplings'';\n*<math>C_{yx}\\subseteq \\bigcup_{i \\in D} Y_i \\times \\bigcup_{i \\in D} X_i</math> is ''the set of internal couplings'';\n*<math>C_{yy}: \\bigcup_{i \\in D} Y_i \\rightarrow Y^\\phi</math> is ''the external output coupling function'';\n*<math>Select:2^D \\rightarrow D</math> is ''the tie-breaking function'' which defines how to select the event from the set of simultaneous events;\n</blockquote>\n\n; The coupled DEVS model for Ping-Pong Game\nThe ping-pong game of Fig. 1 can be modeled as a coupled DEVS model <math> N=<X,Y,D,\\{M_i\\},C_{xx}, C_{yx}, C_{yy}, Select></math> where <math>X=\\{\\} </math>;<math>Y=\\{\\} </math>;<math>D=\\{A,B\\} </math>; <math>M_A \\text{ and } M_B </math> is described as above; <math>C_{xx}=\\{\\}</math>; <math>C_{yx}=\\{(A.!send, B.?receive), (B.!send, A.?receive)\\}</math>; and <math>C_{yy}(A.!send)=\\phi, C_{yy}(B.!send)=\\phi</math>.\n\n==== Behavior of Coupled DEVS ====\nSimply speaking, like the behavior of the atomic DEVS class, a coupled DEVS model <math> N </math> changes its components' states (1) when an external event <math>x \\in X</math> comes into <math> N </math>; (2) when one of components <math> M_i </math> where <math> i \\in D </math> executes its internal state transition and generates its output <math> y_i \\in Y_i</math>. In both cases (1) and (2), a triggering event is transmitted to all influencees which are defined by coupling sets <math> C_{xx}, C_{yx},</math> and <math> C_{yy} </math>.\n\nFor formal definition of behavior of the coupled DEVS, you can refer to [[Behavior of Coupled DEVS]]. Computer algorithms to implement the behavior of a given coupled DEVS mode are available at [[Simulation Algorithms for Coupled DEVS]].\n\n==Analysis Methods==\n\n=== Simulation for Discrete Event Systems ===\nThe simulation algorithm of DEVS models considers two issues: time synchronization and message propagation. ''Time synchronization'' of DEVS is to control all models to have the identical current time. However, for an efficient execution, the algorithm makes the current time jump to the most urgent time when an event is scheduled to execute its internal state transition as well as its output generation. ''Message propagation'' is to transmit a triggering message which can be either an input or output event along the associated couplings which are defined in a coupled DEVS model. For more detailed information, the reader can refer to [[Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS]] and [[Simulation Algorithms for Coupled DEVS]].\n\n===Simulation for Continuous State Systems===\nBy introducing a quantization method which abstracts a continuous segment as a piecewise const segment, DEVS can simulate behaviors of continuous state systems which are described by networks of [[differential algebraic equation]]s. This research has been initiated by Zeigler in 1990s<ref>the use of quantized values in order to simulate continuous systems by means of a [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] method was empirically tried out a few years sooner - in the early 1990s - by a [[Engineering education#France|French]] [[engineer]] <We need any reference for this argument>. He was then working for a company spun off from [[Polytechnic_University_of_Hauts-de-France|University of Valenciennes]], and now part of the [[Schneider Electric]]. This ''quantization'' is a feature of a [[simulation]] [[Application software|software]] of which this engineer is the conceptor and main [[Software developer|developer]], that is used for [[Programmable logic controller|PLC]] programs checking and operator training.</ref> and many properties have been clarified by Prof. Kofman in 2000s and Dr. Nutaro. In 2006, Prof. Cellier who is the author of ''Continuous System Modeling''[[DEVS#References|[Cellier91]]], and Prof. Kofman wrote a text book, ''Continuous System Simulation''[[DEVS#References|[CK06]]] in which Chapters 11 and 12 cover how DEVS simulates continuous state systems. Dr. Nutaro's book [[DEVS#References|[Nutaro10]]], covers the discrete event simulation of continuous state systems too.\n\n=== Verification for Discrete Event Systems ===\nAs an alternative analysis method against the sampling-based simulation method, an exhaustive generating behavior approach, generally called ''verification'' has been applied for analysis of DEVS models. It is proven that infinite states of a given DEVS model (especially a coupled DEVS model ) can be abstracted by behaviorally isomorphic finite structure, called a ''reachability graph'' when the given DEVS model is a sub-class of DEVS such as Schedule-Preserving DEVS ([[SP-DEVS]]), Finite & Deterministic DEVS ([[FD-DEVS]]) [[DEVS#References|[HZ09]]], and Finite & Real-time DEVS (FRT-DEVS) [[DEVS#References|[Hwang12]]]. As a result, based on the rechability graph, (1) dead-lock and live-lock freeness as qualitative properties are decidable with SP-DEVS [[DEVS#References|[Hwang05]]], FD-DEVS [[DEVS#References|[HZ06]]], and FRT-DEVS [[DEVS#References|[Hwang12]]]; and (2) min/max processing time bounds as a quantitative property are decidable with SP-DEVS so far by 2012.\n\n==Variations of DEVS==\n\n===Extensions (Superclassing)===\n{{Expand section|date=November 2007}}\nNumerous extensions of the classic DEVS formalism have been developed in the last decades.\nAmong them formalisms which allow to have changing model structures while the simulation time evolves.\n\nG-DEVS [[DEVS#References|[Giambiasi01]]][[DEVS#References|[Zacharewicz08]]], Parallel DEVS, Dynamic Structuring DEVS, Cell-DEVS [[DEVS#References|[Wainer09]]], dynDEVS, Fuzzy-DEVS, GK-DEVS, ml-DEVS, Symbolic DEVS, Real-Time DEVS, rho-DEVS\n\n===Restrictions (Subclassing)===\nThere are some sub-classes known as Schedule-Preserving DEVS ([[SP-DEVS]]) and Finite and Deterministic DEVS ([[FD-DEVS]]) which were designated to support verification analysis.\n[[SP-DEVS]] and [[FD-DEVS]] whose expressiveness are ''E''([[SP-DEVS]]) <math>\\subset</math> ''E''([[FD-DEVS]])<math>\\subset</math> ''E''(DEVS) where ''E''(''formalism'') denotes the expressiveness of ''formalism''.\n\n== See also ==\n\n===DEVS Related Articles ===\n*[[Event Segment]]\n*[[Timed Event System]]\n* Verifiable sub-classes of DEVS: [[SP-DEVS]], [[FD-DEVS]]\n*[[Behavior of Atomic DEVS]]\n*[[Behavior of Coupled DEVS]]\n*[[Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS]]\n*[[Simulation Algorithms for Coupled DEVS]]\n\n===Other Formalisms===\n*[[Automata Theory]]: a formal method for state transition systems\n*[[Finite State Machine]]: a state transition machine with finite sets of events and states\n*[[Petri Nets]]: a graphical representation of state and transition relations\n*[[Markov Chain]]: a [[stochastic]] process in which the future will be determined by the current state\n*[[Specification and Description Language]]: SDL, a formal complete and unambiguous language to represent graphically simulation models.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* [Cellier91] {{cite book|author = Francois E.
