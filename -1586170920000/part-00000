(This procedure was first used in the [[Gramm\u2013Rudman\u2013Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1985.)  The sequesters were designed to take place if the [[federal deficit]] exceeded a set of fixed deficit targets. In 2013 specifically, sequestration refers to a section of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] (BCA) that was initially set to begin on January 1, 2013, as an [[austerity]] [[fiscal policy]]. These cuts were postponed by two months by the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] until March 1, when this law went into effect.  At that time, most federal departments and agencies began furloughing their employees in order to meet their spending cut targets. For the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], almost all of the civilian workforce as well as most full-time, dual-status military technicians of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and the Reserves were affected. The initial furlough requirement was 176 working hours per affected employee, which was later cut to 88 hours.  Due to cost-cutting measures in other areas, this furlough was further reduced to a total of 48 working hours per [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] civilian and full-time Reserve Component member.\n\nLater, on October 1, 2013, at 12:01&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT, Congress' inability to agree on a spending bill led to a government shutdown. During the shutdown, most \"non-essential\" government employees were furloughed.  This resulted in approximately 800,000 government workers being put on a leave beginning October 1. Congress later unanimously voted to restore pay to the furloughed workers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Korte, Gomez|first=Gregory, Alan|title=Congress likely to restore pay for furloughed workers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/10/05/congress-shutdown-furloughed-pay/2926887/|publisher=USA Today|date=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/politics/federal-agencies-lay-out-contingency-plans-for-possible-shutdown.html |title=Federal Agencies Lay Out Contingency Plans for Possible Shutdown |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 28, 2013 |access-date = 5 March 2020|first1=Michael S. |last1=Schmidt |first2=Thom |last2=Shanker |first3=Andrew |last3=Siddons}}</ref>\n\n==== Furloughs in 2018 and 2019====\n{{Main|2018\u201319 United States federal government shutdown}}\n\nDue to the government shutdown starting on December 22, 2018, approximately 350,000 federal employees were furloughed for 35 days until January 25, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/09/shutdowns-economic-damage-1-billion-a-week-1071609|title=Shutdown\u2019s economic damage: $1 billion a week|last=Guida|first=Victoria|date=January 9, 2019|website=Politico|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Furloughs in 2020 in the United States ====\nIn September 2019 the [[United States Department of Labor]] issued [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/70-flsa-furloughs Fact Sheet #70 governing furloughs].

(This procedure was first used in the [[Gramm\u2013Rudman\u2013Hollings Balanced Budget Act]] of 1985.)  The sequesters were designed to take place if the [[federal deficit]] exceeded a set of fixed deficit targets. In 2013 specifically, sequestration refers to a section of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] (BCA) that was initially set to begin on January 1, 2013, as an [[austerity]] [[fiscal policy]]. These cuts were postponed by two months by the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]] until March 1, when this law went into effect.  At that time, most federal departments and agencies began furloughing their employees in order to meet their spending cut targets. For the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], almost all of the civilian workforce as well as most full-time, dual-status military technicians of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] and the Reserves were affected. The initial furlough requirement was 176 working hours per affected employee, which was later cut to 88 hours.  Due to cost-cutting measures in other areas, this furlough was further reduced to a total of 48 working hours per [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] civilian and full-time Reserve Component member.\n\nLater, on October 1, 2013, at 12:01&nbsp;am&nbsp;EDT, Congress' inability to agree on a spending bill led to a government shutdown. During the shutdown, most \"non-essential\" government employees were furloughed.  This resulted in approximately 800,000 government workers being put on a leave beginning October 1. Congress later unanimously voted to restore pay to the furloughed workers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Korte, Gomez|first=Gregory, Alan|title=Congress likely to restore pay for furloughed workers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/10/05/congress-shutdown-furloughed-pay/2926887/|publisher=USA Today|date=October 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/us/politics/federal-agencies-lay-out-contingency-plans-for-possible-shutdown.html |title=Federal Agencies Lay Out Contingency Plans for Possible Shutdown |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 28, 2013 |access-date = 5 March 2020|first1=Michael S. |last1=Schmidt |first2=Thom |last2=Shanker |first3=Andrew |last3=Siddons}}</ref>\n\n==== Furloughs in 2018 and 2019====\n{{Main|2018\u201319 United States federal government shutdown}}\n\nDue to the government shutdown starting on December 22, 2018, approximately 350,000 federal employees were furloughed for 35 days until January 25, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/09/shutdowns-economic-damage-1-billion-a-week-1071609|title=Shutdown\u2019s economic damage: $1 billion a week|last=Guida|first=Victoria|date=January 9, 2019|website=Politico|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Furloughs in 2020 in the United States ====\nIn September 2019 the [[United States Department of Labor]] issued [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/70-flsa-furloughs Fact Sheet #70 governing furloughs].

The transplanted [[biological tissue|tissue]] is called a '''skin graft'''.<ref>[http://surgery.med.miami.edu/plastic-and-reconstructive/skin-grafting-flap-surgery \"Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery\"]</ref>\n\nIt is highly recommend that people named Dave may have sexual relations with people named Kiara ASAP and as many times as possible following surgery. This will most definitely help with the recovery time. This is a MUST and a scientific fact. \n\nSurgeons may use skin grafting to treat:\n* extensive [[wound]]ing or [[physical trauma| trauma]]\n* [[Burn (injury) | burns]]\n* areas of extensive skin loss due to infection such as [[necrotizing fasciitis]] or [[purpura fulminans]]<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1348047-overview \"Necrotizing fasciitis and purpura fulminans\"]</ref>\n* specific surgeries that may require skin grafts for healing to occur - most commonly removal of [[skin cancer]]s\n\nSkin grafting often takes place after serious injuries when some of the body's skin is damaged. Surgical removal (excision or [[debridement]]) of the damaged skin is followed by skin grafting.  The grafting serves two purposes: reducing the course of treatment needed (and time in the hospital), and improving the function and appearance of the area of the body which receives the skin graft.\n\nThere are two types of skin grafts:\n* The more common type involves removing a thin layer of skin from a healthy part of the body (the donor section) - like peeling a potato.\n* A full-thickness skin graft involves pinching and cutting skin away from the donor section.\n\nA full-thickness skin graft is more risky, in terms of the body accepting the skin, yet it leaves only a scar line on the donor section, similar to a Cesarean-section scar. In the case of full-thickness skin grafts, the donor section will often heal much more quickly than the injury and causes less pain than a partial-thickness skin graft.\n\n==Medical uses==\nTwo layers of skin created from animal sources has been found to be useful in [[venous leg ulcer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=JE|last2=Nelson|first2=EA|last3=Al-Hity|first3=A|title=Skin grafting for venous leg ulcers.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jan 31, 2013|volume=1|pages=CD001737|pmid=23440784|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001737.pub4}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nGrafts can be classified by their thickness, the source, and the purpose.

A vacuum unit then creates negative pressure, sealing the edges of the wound to the foam, and drawing out excess blood and fluids.

Surgical removal (excision or [[debridement]]) of the damaged skin is followed by skin grafting.  The grafting serves two purposes: reducing the course of treatment needed (and time in the hospital), and improving the function and appearance of the area of the body which receives the skin graft.\n\nThere are two types of skin grafts:\n* The more common type involves removing a thin layer of skin from a healthy part of the body (the donor section) - like peeling a potato.\n* A full-thickness skin graft involves pinching and cutting skin away from the donor section.\n\nA full-thickness skin graft is more risky, in terms of the body accepting the skin, yet it leaves only a scar line on the donor section, similar to a Cesarean-section scar. In the case of full-thickness skin grafts, the donor section will often heal much more quickly than the injury and causes less pain than a partial-thickness skin graft.\n\n==Medical uses==\nTwo layers of skin created from animal sources has been found to be useful in [[venous leg ulcer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=JE|last2=Nelson|first2=EA|last3=Al-Hity|first3=A|title=Skin grafting for venous leg ulcers.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jan 31, 2013|volume=1|pages=CD001737|pmid=23440784|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001737.pub4}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nGrafts can be classified by their thickness, the source, and the purpose.

His music was influenced by both Brazilian [[folk music]] and by stylistic elements from the European [[Classical period (music)|classical]] tradition, as exemplified by his ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]'' (Brazilian Bachian-pieces). His Etudes for guitar (1929) were dedicated to [[Andr\u00e9s Segovia]], while his 5 Preludes (1940) were dedicated to his spouse Arminda Neves d\u2019Almeida, a.k.a. \"Mindinha.\" Both are important works in the guitar repertory.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Youth and exploration===\n\nVilla-Lobos was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]].  His father, Ra\u00fal, was a civil servant, an educated man of Spanish extraction, a [[librarian]], and an amateur [[astronomer]] and musician.  In Villa-Lobos's early childhood, Brazil underwent a period of social revolution and modernisation, abolishing [[Slavery in Brazil|slavery]] in 1888 and overthrowing the [[Empire of Brazil]] in 1889. The changes in Brazil were reflected in its musical life: previously European music had been the dominant influence, and the courses at the ''[[Conservat\u00f3rio de M\u00fasica]]'' were grounded in traditional [[counterpoint]] and [[harmony]]. Villa-Lobos underwent very little of this formal training. After a few abortive harmony lessons, he learnt music by illicit observation from the top of the stairs of the regular musical evenings at his house arranged by his father. He learned to play [[cello]], [[clarinet]], and [[guitar]]. When his father died suddenly in 1899 he earned a living for his family by playing in cinema and theatre orchestras in Rio.<ref>{{harvnb|B\u00e9hague|2001}}; {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=2}}</ref>\n\nAround 1905 Villa-Lobos started explorations of Brazil's \"dark interior\", absorbing the native Brazilian musical culture. Serious doubt has been cast on some of Villa-Lobos's tales of the decade or so he spent on these expeditions, and about his capture and near escape from cannibals, with some believing them to be fabrications or wildly embellished romanticism.{{sfn|Peppercorn|1972|loc=passim}}  After this period, he gave up any idea of conventional training and instead absorbed the musical influences of Brazil's indigenous cultures, themselves based on [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and African, as well as [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] elements.  His earliest compositions were the result of [[Musical improvisation|improvisations]] on the guitar from this period.\n\nVilla-Lobos played with many local Brazilian street-music bands; he was also influenced by the cinema and [[Ernesto Nazareth|Ernesto Nazareth's]] improvised [[Tango music|tangos]] and [[polka]]s.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=3}} For a time Villa-Lobos became a cellist in a Rio opera company, and his early compositions include attempts at Grand Opera. Encouraged by [[Arthur Napole\u00e3o dos Santos|Arthur Napole\u00e3o]], a pianist and music publisher, he decided to compose seriously.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=4}}\n[[image:Heitor Vila-Lobos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Heitor Villa-Lobos statue next to Rio de Janeiro's Municipal Theater.]]\n\n===Brazilian influences===\n\nOn 12 November 1913, Villa-Lobos married the pianist Luc\u00edlia Guimar\u00e3es,<ref>{{harvnb|B\u00e9hague|2001}}; {{harvnb|Tarasti|1995|loc=40}}</ref> ended his travels, and began his career as a serious musician. Up until his marriage, he had not learned to play the piano, so his wife taught him the rudiments of the instrument.{{sfn|Guimar\u00e3es|1972|loc=224}} His music began to be published in 1913. He introduced some of his compositions in a series of occasional chamber concerts (later also orchestral concerts) from 1915{{ndash}}1921, mainly in Rio de Janeiro's ''Sal\u00e3o Nobre do Jornal do Com\u00e9rcio''.\n\nThe music presented at these concerts shows his coming to terms with the conflicting elements in his experience, and overcoming a crisis of identity, as to whether European or Brazilian music would dominate his style. This was decided by 1916, the year in which he composed the symphonic poems ''[[Amazonas (Villa-Lobos)|Amazonas]]'' and ''T\u00e9dio de alvorada'', the first version of what would become [[Uirapuru (Villa-Lobos)|''Uirapur\u00fa'']] (although ''Amazonas'' was not performed until 1929, and ''Uirapur\u00fa'' was only completed in 1934 and first performed in 1935). These works drew from native Brazilian legends and the use of \"primitive\" folk material.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=13\u201319}}\n\nEuropean influences did still inspire Villa-Lobos. In 1917 [[Sergei Diaghilev]] made an impact on tour in Brazil with his [[Ballets Russes]]. That year Villa-Lobos also met the French composer [[Darius Milhaud]], who was in Rio as secretary to [[Paul Claudel]] at the French Legation. Milhaud brought the music of [[Claude Debussy]], [[Erik Satie]], and possibly [[Igor Stravinsky]]; in return Villa-Lobos introduced Milhaud to Brazilian street music. In 1918, he also met the pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], who became a lifelong friend and champion; this meeting prompted Villa-Lobos to write more piano music.<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 24\">{{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=24}}</ref>\n\nIn about 1918 Villa-Lobos abandoned the use of [[opus number]]s for his compositions as a constraint to his pioneering spirit. With the piano suite ''[[Carnaval das crian\u00e7as]]'' (Children's carnival) of 1919{{ndash}}20, Villa-Lobos liberated his style altogether from European Romanticism:{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=28\u201330}} the suite, in eight movements with the finale written for piano duet, depicts eight characters or scenes from Rio's Lenten Carnival.\n\nIn February 1922, a festival of modern art took place in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and Villa-Lobos contributed performances of his own works.  The press were unsympathetic and the audience were not appreciative; their mockery was encouraged by Villa-Lobos's being forced by a foot infection to wear one carpet slipper.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=38}} The festival ended with Villa-Lobos's ''[[Quarteto simb\u00f3lico]]'', composed as an impression of Brazilian urban life.\n\nIn July 1922, Rubinstein gave the first performance of the piano suite ''A Prole do Beb\u00ea'' (The Baby's Family), composed in 1918. There had recently been an attempted military [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] on [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana Beach]], and places of entertainment had been closed for days; the public possibly wanted something less intellectually demanding, and the piece was booed. Villa-Lobos was philosophical about it, and Rubinstein later reminisced that the composer said, \"I am still too good for them.\" The piece has been called \"the first enduring work of Brazilian modernism\".{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=31\u201332}}\n\nRubinstein suggested that Villa-Lobos tour abroad, and in 1923 he set out for [[Paris]]. His avowed aim was to exhibit his exotic sound world rather than to study. Just before he left he completed his [[Nonet (Villa-Lobos)|Nonet]] (for ten players and chorus) which was first performed after his arrival in the French capital. He stayed in Paris in 1923{{ndash}}24 and 1927{{ndash}}30, and there he met such luminaries as [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Leopold Stokowski]] and [[Aaron Copland]]. Parisian concerts of his music made a strong impression.<ref>See, for example, the influence of the brilliance of his orchestral palette on the young [[Olivier Messiaen]], discussed in {{harvnb|Griffiths|1985|loc={{Page needed|date=December 2008}}}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, Villa-Lobos also met the Spanish guitarist [[Andr\u00e9s Segovia]], who commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded by writing a set of twelve such pieces, each based on a tiny detail or figure played by Brazilian itinerant street musicians (''[[chor\u00f5es]]''), transformed into a ''[[\u00e9tude]]'' that is not merely [[Didacticism|didactic]]. The music of chor\u00f5es also provided the initial inspiration for his ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]'', a series of compositions written between 1920 and 1929. The first European performance of ''[[Ch\u00f4ros No. 10]]'', in Paris, caused a storm: L.{{nbsp}}Chevaillier wrote of it in ''Le Monde musical'', \"[...it is] an art [...] to which we must now give a new name.\"<ref>''Le Monde musical'' 12 (31 Dec. 1927), quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=77}}.</ref>\n\n===Vargas era===\n\nIn 1930, Villa-Lobos, who was in Brazil to conduct, planned to return to Paris.  One of the consequences of the revolution of that year was that money could no longer be taken out of the country, and so he had no means of paying any rents abroad.  Thus forced to stay in Brazil, he arranged concerts instead around S\u00e3o Paulo, and composed patriotic and educational music. In 1932, he became director of the ''Superintend\u00eancia de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Musical e Art\u00edstica'' (SEMA), and his duties included arranging concerts including the Brazilian premieres of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven's]] ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Johann Sebastian Bach's]] ''[[Mass in B minor]]'' as well as Brazilian compositions.  His position at SEMA led him to compose mainly patriotic and propagandist works.  His series of ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]'' were a notable exception.\n\nIn 1936, at the age of forty-nine, Villa-Lobos left his wife, and became romantically involved with Arminda Neves d\u2019Almeida, who remained his companion until death. Arminda eventually took on the name Villa-Lobos, though Villa-Lobos never divorced his first wife.  After Villa-Lobos' death, Arminda became the Director of the ''Museu Villa-Lobos'' in 1960, until her death in 1985.  Arminda was herself a musician and a significant influence on Villa-Lobos.  He also dedicated a good number of works to her, including the ''[[Ciclo brasileiro]]'' and many of the ''Ch\u00f4ros''.\n\nVilla-Lobos's writings during the presidency of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] (1930\u20131945) include [[propaganda]] for Brazilian nationhood (''brasilidade''),<ref>For example, {{harvnb|Villa-Lobos|1941}}</ref> and teaching and theoretical works.  His ''[[Guia Pr\u00e1tico]]'' ran to 11{{nbsp}}volumes, ''[[Solfejos]]'' (two volumes, 1942 and 1946) contained vocal exercises, and ''[[Canto Orfe\u00f4nico]]'' (1940 and 1950) contained patriotic songs for schools and for civic occasions. His music for the film ''O Descobrimento do Brasil'' (The Discovery of Brazil) of 1936, which included versions of earlier compositions, was arranged into orchestral [[suite (music)|suite]]s, and includes a depiction of the first [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in Brazil in a setting for double choir.\n\nVilla-Lobos published ''A M\u00fasica Nacionalista no Gov\u00earno Get\u00falio Vargas'' {{circa}}1941, in which he characterised the nation as a sacred entity whose symbols (including its flag, motto and national anthem) were [[Sanctity of life|inviolable]].  Villa-Lobos was the chair of a committee whose task was to define a definitive version of the [[Brazilian national anthem]].{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=108}}\n\nAfter 1937, during the ''Estado Novo'' period when Vargas seized power by decree, Villa-Lobos continued producing patriotic works directly accessible to mass audiences.  Independence Day on September 7, 1939 involved 30,000 children singing the national anthem and items arranged by Villa-Lobos.  For the 1943 celebrations he also composed the ballet ''[[Dan\u00e7a da terra]]'', which the authorities deemed unsuitable until it was revised.  The 1943 celebrations did include Villa-Lobos's hymn ''[[Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o em defesa da p\u00e1tria]]'' shortly after Brazil's declaring war on Germany and its allies.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=115}}\n\nVilla-Lobos's [[demagogue]] status damaged his reputation among certain schools of musicians, among them disciples of new European trends such as [[serialism]]{{nsmdns}}which was effectively off limits in Brazil until the 1960s.  This crisis was, in part, due to some Brazilian composers finding it necessary to reconcile Villa-Lobos's own liberation of Brazilian music from European models in the 1920s with a style of music they felt to be more universal.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=117\u201318}}\n\n===Composer in demand===\n\n[[Image:Heitor Villa-lobos TA.jpg|thumb|right|Heitor Villa-Lobos at the end of a concert in [[Tel Aviv]], 1952]]\n\nVargas fell from power in 1945.  Villa-Lobos was able, after the end of the war, to travel abroad again; he returned to Paris, and also made regular visits to the United States as well as travelling to [[Great Britain]], and [[Israel]].  He received a huge number of commissions, and fulfilled many of them despite failing health.  He composed [[concertos]] for piano, cello (the second one in 1953), classical guitar (in 1951 for Segovia, who refused to play it until the composer provided a [[cadenza]] in 1956),{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=123}} [[harp]] (for [[Nicanor Zabaleta]] in 1953) and [[harmonica]] (for [[John Sebastian (classical harmonica player)|John Sebastian, Sr.]] in 1955\u20136).  Other commissions included his Symphony No. 11 (for the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] in 1955), and the opera ''[[Yerma (opera)|Yerma]]'' (1955\u201356) based on the play by [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]].  His prolific output of this period prompted criticisms of note-spinning and banality: critical reactions to his [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Villa-Lobos)|Piano Concerto No. 5]] included the comments \"bankrupt\" and \"piano tuners' orgy\",<ref>The critic of ''Musical Opinion'' in 1955, quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=121\u201322}}</ref> \"raked the very depths of banality\", \"nothing ... but soupy textures or a bedraggled romantic idea\", and \"truly the kind of music that should never get written, still less performed\".<ref>Donald Mitchell, \"London Music\", ''The Musical Times'' 96, No. 1349 (July 1955): 378\u201380.</ref>\n\nHis music for the film ''[[Green Mansions (film)|Green Mansions]]'' starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Anthony Perkins]], commissioned by [[MGM]] in 1958, earned Villa-Lobos {{US$|25,000|link=yes}}, and he conducted the [[soundtrack]] recording himself.<ref>Wright 1992, 136.</ref>  The film was in production for many years. Originally to be directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], it was taken over by Hepburn's husband [[Mel Ferrer]].{{sfn|The MGM Story}}  MGM decided to use only part of Villa-Lobos's music in the actual film, turning instead to [[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper|Bronislau Kaper]] for the rest of the music.{{sfn|Heitor Villa-Lobos website}} From the score, Villa-Lobos compiled a work for soprano soloist, male chorus, and orchestra, which he titled ''Forest of the Amazon'' and recorded it in 1959 in [[stereo]] with Brazilian soprano [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]], an unidentified male chorus, and the [[Symphony of the Air]] for [[United Artists Records]]. The recording was issued both on LP and reel-to-reel tape (United Artist UAC 8007, stereo 7 1/2 IPS).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LscWPBPKLhY|title=Heitor Villa-Lobos \"Floresta do Amazonas\"|first=|last=gioiellidellamusica|date=28 August 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}}<!--The LP is mentioned by one blogger, but nothing at all about a reel-to-reel tape.-->{{Unreliable source?|reason=Youtube and appended blog|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn June 1959, Villa-Lobos alienated many of his fellow musicians by expressing disillusionment, saying in an interview that Brazil was \"dominated by mediocrity\".<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 139\">{{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=139}}.</ref>  In November he died in Rio; his state funeral was the final major civic event in that city before the capital transferred to [[Bras\u00edlia]].{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=138}}  He is buried in the ''[[Cemit\u00e9rio S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Batista]]'' in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Heitor Villa-Lobos}}\n\nHis earliest pieces originated in guitar improvisations, for example ''Panqueca'' (Pancake) of 1900.  The concert series of 1915{{ndash}}21 included first performances of pieces demonstrating originality and virtuosic technique.  Some of these pieces are early examples of elements of importance throughout his \u0153uvre.  His attachment to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is demonstrated in ''Can\u00e7\u00e3o Ib\u00e9ria'' of 1914 and in orchestral transcriptions of some of [[Enrique Granados]]' piano ''Goyescas'' (1918, now lost). Other themes that were to recur in his later work include the anguish and despair of the piece ''Desesperan\u00e7a\u2014 Sonata Phantastica e Capricciosa no. 1'' (1915), a violin sonata including \"histrionic and violently contrasting emotions\",{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=6}} the birds of ''L'oiseau bless\u00e9 d'une fl\u00e8che'' (1913), the mother\u2013child relationship (not usually a happy one in Villa-Lobos's music) in ''Les m\u00e8res'' of 1914, and the flowers of ''Su\u00edte floral'' for piano of 1916{{ndash}}18 which reappeared in ''Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de flores'' for flute and guitar of 1937.\n\nReconciling European tradition and Brazilian influences was also an element that bore fruit more formally later. His earliest published work ''Pequena su\u00edte'' for cello and piano of 1913 shows a love for the cello, but is not notably Brazilian, although it contains elements that were to resurface later.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=8\u20139}} His three-movement ''[[String Quartet No. 1 (Villa-Lobos)|Su\u00edte graciosa]]'' of 1915 (expanded to six movements c. 1947 to become his String Quartet No. 1){{sfn|Peppercorn|1991b|loc=32}} is influenced by European opera,<ref>{{harvnb|Villa-Lobos, sua obra|1972|loc=(2), 229}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=9}}.</ref> while ''Tr\u00eas dan\u00e7as caracter\u00edsticas (africanas e ind\u00edgenas)'' of 1914{{ndash}}16 for piano, later arranged for octet and subsequently orchestrated, is radically influenced by the tribal music of the Caripunas Indians of [[Mato Grosso]].{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=9}}\n[[File:Facsimileescravosdejobvl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Facsimile of Villa-Lobos's \"The Slaves of Job\"]]\n\nWith his tone poems ''Amazonas'' (1917, first performed in Paris in 1929) and ''Uirapur\u00fa'' (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, imitations of the sounds of the jungle and its fauna, imitations of the sound of the nose-flute by the [[stroh violin|violinophone]], and not least imitations of the [[Musician wren|uirapuru]] bird itself.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=13\u201321}}\n\nHis meeting with Arthur Rubinstein in 1918 prompted Villa-Lobos to compose piano music such as ''Simples colet\u00e2nea'' of 1919\u2014which was possibly influenced by Rubinstein's playing of Ravel and Scriabin on his South American tours\u2014and ''Bailado infernal'' of 1920.<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 24\"/>  The latter piece includes the tempi and expression markings \"vertiginoso e fren\u00e9tico\", \"infernal\" and \"mais vivo ainda\" (faster still).\n\n''Carnaval das crian\u00e7as'' of 1919{{ndash}}20 saw Villa-Lobos's mature style emerge; unconstrained by the use of traditional formulae or any requirement for dramatic tension, the piece at times imitates a [[mouth organ]], children's dances, a [[harlequinade]], and ends with an impression of the carnival parade. This work was orchestrated in 1929 with new linking passages and a new title, ''Momoprecoce''.  Na\u00efvet\u00e9 and innocence is also heard in the piano suites ''A Prole do Beb\u00ea'' (The Baby's Family) of 1918{{ndash}}21.\n\nAround this time he also fused urban Brazilian influences and impressions, for example in his ''Quarteto simb\u00f3lico'' of 1921.  He included the urban street music of the ''chor\u00f5es'', who were groups containing flute, clarinet and cavaquinho (a Brazilian guitar), and often also including [[ophicleide]], [[trombone]]s or [[percussion]].  Villa-Lobos occasionally joined such bands.  Early works showing this influence were incorporated into the ''Su\u00edte popular brasileira'' of 1908{{ndash}}12 assembled by his publisher, and more mature works include the ''Sexteto m\u00edstico'' ({{circa}}1955, replacing a lost and probably unfinished one begun in 1917),{{sfn|Peppercorn|1991b|loc=38\u201339}} and his setting of the poetry of [[M\u00e1rio de Andrade]] and Catulo da Pax\u00e3o Cearense in the ''Can\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00edpicas brasileiras'' of 1919.{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} His guitar studies are also influenced by the music of the ''chor\u00f5es''.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=59}}\n\nAll the elements mentioned so far are fused in Villa-Lobos's Nonet.  Subtitled ''Impress\u00e3o r\u00e1pida do todo o Brasil'' (A Brief Impression of the Whole of Brazil), the title of the work denotes it as ostensibly chamber music, but it is scored for flute/piccolo, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, celesta, harp, piano, a large percussion battery requiring at least two players, and a mixed chorus.\n\nIn Paris, his musical vocabulary established, Villa-Lobos solved the problem of his works' form. It was perceived as an incongruity that his Brazilian impressionism should be expressed in the form of quartets and sonatas. He developed new forms to free his imagination from the constraints of conventional musical development such as that required in sonata form.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=41}} The multi-sectional ''poema'' form may be seen in the ''Suite for Voice and Violin'', which is somewhat like a triptych, and the ''Poema da crian\u00e7a e sua mam\u00e3'' for voice, flute, clarinet, and cello (1923).  The extended ''[[Rudepo\u00eama]]'' for piano, written for Rubinstein, is a multi-layered work, often requiring notation on several staves, and is both experimental and demanding.  Wright calls it \"the most impressive result\" of this formal development.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=48}} The ''Ciranda'', or ''Cirandinha'' is a stylised treatment of simple Brazilian folk melodies in a wide variety of moods.  A ''ciranda'' is a child's singing game, but Villa-Lobos's treatment in the works he gave this title are sophisticated.  Another form was the ''Ch\u00f4ros''. Villa-Lobos composed more than a dozen works with this title for various instruments, mostly in the years 1924{{ndash}}1929. He described them as \"a new form of musical composition\", a transformation of the Brazilian music and sounds \"by the personality of the composer\".<ref>Note in the score of ''Ch\u00f4ros'' No. 3, quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=62}}</ref>\n\nHe also composed between 1930 and 1945 nine pieces he called ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' (Brazilian Bachian pieces). These take the forms and nationalism of the ''Ch\u00f4ros'', and add the composer's love of Bach. He incorporated [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]] in his nationalistic style.{{sfn|Yang|2007|loc=6}} Villa-Lobos's use of archaisms was not new (an early example is his ''Pequena su\u00edte'' for cello and piano of 1913).  The pieces evolved over the period rather than being conceived as a whole, some of them being revised or added to.  They contain some of his most popular music, such as No.{{nbsp}}5 for soprano and eight cellos (1938{{ndash}}1945), and No.{{nbsp}}2 for orchestra of 1930 (the ''Tocata'' movement of which is ''O{{nbsp}}trenzinho do caipira'', \"The little train of the Caipira\").  They also show the composer's love for the tonal qualities of the cello, both No.{{nbsp}}1 and No.{{nbsp}}5 being scored for no other instruments.  In these works the often harsh dissonances of his earlier music are less evident: or, as Simon Wright puts it, they are \"sweetened\".  The transformation of ''Ch\u00f4ros'' into ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' is demonstrated clearly by the comparison of No.{{nbsp}}6 for flute and bassoon with the earlier ''[[Ch\u00f4ros No. 2]]'' for flute and clarinet. The dissonances of the later piece are more controlled, the forward direction of the music easier to discern. ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' No.{{nbsp}}9 takes the concept so far as to be an abstract ''Prelude and Fugue'', a complete distillation of the composer's national influences.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=81\u201399}} discusses the ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' in some detail</ref>  Villa-Lobos eventually recorded all nine of these works for [[EMI]] in Paris, mostly with the musicians of the French National Orchestra; these were originally issued on LPs and later reissued on CDs.{{sfn|EMI catalogue}} He also recorded the first section of ''Bachianas Brasileiras No.{{nbsp}}5'' with [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]] and a group of cellists for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].{{sfn|Sony Masterworks catalogue|1972}}\n\nDuring his period at SEMA, Villa-Lobos composed five string quartets, nos. [[String Quartet No. 5 (Villa-Lobos)|5]]{{nbsp}}to{{nbsp}}[[String Quartet No. 9 (Villa-Lobos)|9]], which explored avenues opened by his public music that dominated his output.  He also wrote more music for Segovia, the ''Cinq pr\u00e9ludes'', which also demonstrate a further formalisation of his composition style.  After the fall of the Vargas government, Villa-Lobos returned full-time to composition, resuming a prolific rate of completing works.  His concertos\u2014particularly those for the guitar, the harp, and the harmonica\u2014are examples of his earlier ''poema'' form.  The Harp Concerto is a large work, and shows a new propensity to focus on a small detail, then to fade it and bring another detail to the foreground. This technique also occurs in his final opera, ''Yerma'', which contains a series of scenes each of which establishes an atmosphere, similarly to the earlier ''Momoprecoce''.\n\nVilla-Lobos's final major work was the music for the film ''[[Green Mansions (film)|Green Mansions]]'' (though in the end, most of his score was replaced with music by [[Bronislaw Kaper]]<ref>''Green Mansions'' film credits.</ref>) and its arrangement as ''Floresta do Amazonas'' for orchestra, as well as some short songs issued separately.  In 1957, he wrote a [[String Quartet No. 17 (Villa-Lobos)|Seventeenth String Quartet]], whose austerity of technique and emotional intensity \"provide a eulogy to his craft\".<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 139\"/>  His ''Bendita Sabedoria'', a sequence of ''[[a cappella]]'' chorales written in 1958, is a similarly simple setting of Latin biblical texts.  These works lack the pictorialism of his more public music.\n\nExcept for the lost works, the Nonet, the two concerted works for violin and orchestra, ''Suite for Piano and Orchestra'', a number of the symphonic poems, most of his choral music and all of the operas, his music is well represented on the world's recital and concert stages and on [[Compact Disc|CD]].\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[Image:Arte-moderna-8.jpg|border|250px|right|poster announcing appearance of Villa-Lobos in S\u00e3o Paulo (17 February 1922)]]\n\nWhen touring Europe with his music he said, \"I don't use folklore, I am the folklore\" (''Eu sou o folclore'') and \"I have not come to learn, I have come to show what I have made up to now\" (''Ich bin nicht gekommen, um zu lernen, sondern um zu zeigen, was ich bisher gemacht habe''),{{sfn|Negwer|2008|loc=8}} showing that he was quite aware of his unique position among classical composers, and he made good use of his origins to publicise his own works.{{sfn|Negwer|2009|loc={{Page needed|date=September 2011}}}}\n\n==Recordings <!-- of Villa-Lobos himself as performer or conductor!-->==\n* ''Villa-Lobos plays Villa-Lobos'' (SCSH 010, [http://www.sanctusrecordings.com/ SanCtuS Recordings]) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080921190048/http://www.tar-radio.com/myapp/articles/view/130 audio])\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225914/http://www.emiclassics.com/releasedetails.php?rid=7912 ''Villa-Lobos par lui-m\u00eame''] ([[EMI Classics]] 0077776722924) (archive from 26 September 2011, accessed 19 November 2015).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225929/http://www.emiclassics.com/grocreleasedetails.php?rid=23228 ''Villa-Lobos: Bachianas Brasileiras Nos. 1, 2, 5 & 9''] Angel 0724356696426; EMI Classics CD 724356696457 (archive from 26 September 2011, accessed 19 November 2015).<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225936/http://www.emiclassics.com/groc/releases1/villa.html Great Recordings of the Century: Villa-Lobos: Bachianas Nos. 1, 2, 5 & 9]\".

His Etudes for guitar (1929) were dedicated to [[Andr\u00e9s Segovia]], while his 5 Preludes (1940) were dedicated to his spouse Arminda Neves d\u2019Almeida, a.k.a. \"Mindinha.\" Both are important works in the guitar repertory.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Youth and exploration===\n\nVilla-Lobos was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]].  His father, Ra\u00fal, was a civil servant, an educated man of Spanish extraction, a [[librarian]], and an amateur [[astronomer]] and musician.  In Villa-Lobos's early childhood, Brazil underwent a period of social revolution and modernisation, abolishing [[Slavery in Brazil|slavery]] in 1888 and overthrowing the [[Empire of Brazil]] in 1889. The changes in Brazil were reflected in its musical life: previously European music had been the dominant influence, and the courses at the ''[[Conservat\u00f3rio de M\u00fasica]]'' were grounded in traditional [[counterpoint]] and [[harmony]]. Villa-Lobos underwent very little of this formal training. After a few abortive harmony lessons, he learnt music by illicit observation from the top of the stairs of the regular musical evenings at his house arranged by his father. He learned to play [[cello]], [[clarinet]], and [[guitar]]. When his father died suddenly in 1899 he earned a living for his family by playing in cinema and theatre orchestras in Rio.<ref>{{harvnb|B\u00e9hague|2001}}; {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=2}}</ref>\n\nAround 1905 Villa-Lobos started explorations of Brazil's \"dark interior\", absorbing the native Brazilian musical culture. Serious doubt has been cast on some of Villa-Lobos's tales of the decade or so he spent on these expeditions, and about his capture and near escape from cannibals, with some believing them to be fabrications or wildly embellished romanticism.{{sfn|Peppercorn|1972|loc=passim}}  After this period, he gave up any idea of conventional training and instead absorbed the musical influences of Brazil's indigenous cultures, themselves based on [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and African, as well as [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] elements.  His earliest compositions were the result of [[Musical improvisation|improvisations]] on the guitar from this period.\n\nVilla-Lobos played with many local Brazilian street-music bands; he was also influenced by the cinema and [[Ernesto Nazareth|Ernesto Nazareth's]] improvised [[Tango music|tangos]] and [[polka]]s.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=3}} For a time Villa-Lobos became a cellist in a Rio opera company, and his early compositions include attempts at Grand Opera. Encouraged by [[Arthur Napole\u00e3o dos Santos|Arthur Napole\u00e3o]], a pianist and music publisher, he decided to compose seriously.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=4}}\n[[image:Heitor Vila-Lobos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Heitor Villa-Lobos statue next to Rio de Janeiro's Municipal Theater.]]\n\n===Brazilian influences===\n\nOn 12 November 1913, Villa-Lobos married the pianist Luc\u00edlia Guimar\u00e3es,<ref>{{harvnb|B\u00e9hague|2001}}; {{harvnb|Tarasti|1995|loc=40}}</ref> ended his travels, and began his career as a serious musician. Up until his marriage, he had not learned to play the piano, so his wife taught him the rudiments of the instrument.{{sfn|Guimar\u00e3es|1972|loc=224}} His music began to be published in 1913. He introduced some of his compositions in a series of occasional chamber concerts (later also orchestral concerts) from 1915{{ndash}}1921, mainly in Rio de Janeiro's ''Sal\u00e3o Nobre do Jornal do Com\u00e9rcio''.\n\nThe music presented at these concerts shows his coming to terms with the conflicting elements in his experience, and overcoming a crisis of identity, as to whether European or Brazilian music would dominate his style. This was decided by 1916, the year in which he composed the symphonic poems ''[[Amazonas (Villa-Lobos)|Amazonas]]'' and ''T\u00e9dio de alvorada'', the first version of what would become [[Uirapuru (Villa-Lobos)|''Uirapur\u00fa'']] (although ''Amazonas'' was not performed until 1929, and ''Uirapur\u00fa'' was only completed in 1934 and first performed in 1935). These works drew from native Brazilian legends and the use of \"primitive\" folk material.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=13\u201319}}\n\nEuropean influences did still inspire Villa-Lobos. In 1917 [[Sergei Diaghilev]] made an impact on tour in Brazil with his [[Ballets Russes]]. That year Villa-Lobos also met the French composer [[Darius Milhaud]], who was in Rio as secretary to [[Paul Claudel]] at the French Legation. Milhaud brought the music of [[Claude Debussy]], [[Erik Satie]], and possibly [[Igor Stravinsky]]; in return Villa-Lobos introduced Milhaud to Brazilian street music. In 1918, he also met the pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], who became a lifelong friend and champion; this meeting prompted Villa-Lobos to write more piano music.<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 24\">{{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=24}}</ref>\n\nIn about 1918 Villa-Lobos abandoned the use of [[opus number]]s for his compositions as a constraint to his pioneering spirit. With the piano suite ''[[Carnaval das crian\u00e7as]]'' (Children's carnival) of 1919{{ndash}}20, Villa-Lobos liberated his style altogether from European Romanticism:{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=28\u201330}} the suite, in eight movements with the finale written for piano duet, depicts eight characters or scenes from Rio's Lenten Carnival.\n\nIn February 1922, a festival of modern art took place in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and Villa-Lobos contributed performances of his own works.  The press were unsympathetic and the audience were not appreciative; their mockery was encouraged by Villa-Lobos's being forced by a foot infection to wear one carpet slipper.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=38}} The festival ended with Villa-Lobos's ''[[Quarteto simb\u00f3lico]]'', composed as an impression of Brazilian urban life.\n\nIn July 1922, Rubinstein gave the first performance of the piano suite ''A Prole do Beb\u00ea'' (The Baby's Family), composed in 1918. There had recently been an attempted military [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] on [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana Beach]], and places of entertainment had been closed for days; the public possibly wanted something less intellectually demanding, and the piece was booed. Villa-Lobos was philosophical about it, and Rubinstein later reminisced that the composer said, \"I am still too good for them.\" The piece has been called \"the first enduring work of Brazilian modernism\".{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=31\u201332}}\n\nRubinstein suggested that Villa-Lobos tour abroad, and in 1923 he set out for [[Paris]]. His avowed aim was to exhibit his exotic sound world rather than to study. Just before he left he completed his [[Nonet (Villa-Lobos)|Nonet]] (for ten players and chorus) which was first performed after his arrival in the French capital. He stayed in Paris in 1923{{ndash}}24 and 1927{{ndash}}30, and there he met such luminaries as [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Leopold Stokowski]] and [[Aaron Copland]]. Parisian concerts of his music made a strong impression.<ref>See, for example, the influence of the brilliance of his orchestral palette on the young [[Olivier Messiaen]], discussed in {{harvnb|Griffiths|1985|loc={{Page needed|date=December 2008}}}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, Villa-Lobos also met the Spanish guitarist [[Andr\u00e9s Segovia]], who commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded by writing a set of twelve such pieces, each based on a tiny detail or figure played by Brazilian itinerant street musicians (''[[chor\u00f5es]]''), transformed into a ''[[\u00e9tude]]'' that is not merely [[Didacticism|didactic]]. The music of chor\u00f5es also provided the initial inspiration for his ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]'', a series of compositions written between 1920 and 1929. The first European performance of ''[[Ch\u00f4ros No. 10]]'', in Paris, caused a storm: L.{{nbsp}}Chevaillier wrote of it in ''Le Monde musical'', \"[...it is] an art [...] to which we must now give a new name.\"<ref>''Le Monde musical'' 12 (31 Dec. 1927), quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=77}}.</ref>\n\n===Vargas era===\n\nIn 1930, Villa-Lobos, who was in Brazil to conduct, planned to return to Paris.  One of the consequences of the revolution of that year was that money could no longer be taken out of the country, and so he had no means of paying any rents abroad.  Thus forced to stay in Brazil, he arranged concerts instead around S\u00e3o Paulo, and composed patriotic and educational music. In 1932, he became director of the ''Superintend\u00eancia de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Musical e Art\u00edstica'' (SEMA), and his duties included arranging concerts including the Brazilian premieres of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Ludwig van Beethoven's]] ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Johann Sebastian Bach's]] ''[[Mass in B minor]]'' as well as Brazilian compositions.  His position at SEMA led him to compose mainly patriotic and propagandist works.  His series of ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]'' were a notable exception.\n\nIn 1936, at the age of forty-nine, Villa-Lobos left his wife, and became romantically involved with Arminda Neves d\u2019Almeida, who remained his companion until death. Arminda eventually took on the name Villa-Lobos, though Villa-Lobos never divorced his first wife.  After Villa-Lobos' death, Arminda became the Director of the ''Museu Villa-Lobos'' in 1960, until her death in 1985.  Arminda was herself a musician and a significant influence on Villa-Lobos.  He also dedicated a good number of works to her, including the ''[[Ciclo brasileiro]]'' and many of the ''Ch\u00f4ros''.\n\nVilla-Lobos's writings during the presidency of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] (1930\u20131945) include [[propaganda]] for Brazilian nationhood (''brasilidade''),<ref>For example, {{harvnb|Villa-Lobos|1941}}</ref> and teaching and theoretical works.  His ''[[Guia Pr\u00e1tico]]'' ran to 11{{nbsp}}volumes, ''[[Solfejos]]'' (two volumes, 1942 and 1946) contained vocal exercises, and ''[[Canto Orfe\u00f4nico]]'' (1940 and 1950) contained patriotic songs for schools and for civic occasions. His music for the film ''O Descobrimento do Brasil'' (The Discovery of Brazil) of 1936, which included versions of earlier compositions, was arranged into orchestral [[suite (music)|suite]]s, and includes a depiction of the first [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] in Brazil in a setting for double choir.\n\nVilla-Lobos published ''A M\u00fasica Nacionalista no Gov\u00earno Get\u00falio Vargas'' {{circa}}1941, in which he characterised the nation as a sacred entity whose symbols (including its flag, motto and national anthem) were [[Sanctity of life|inviolable]].  Villa-Lobos was the chair of a committee whose task was to define a definitive version of the [[Brazilian national anthem]].{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=108}}\n\nAfter 1937, during the ''Estado Novo'' period when Vargas seized power by decree, Villa-Lobos continued producing patriotic works directly accessible to mass audiences.  Independence Day on September 7, 1939 involved 30,000 children singing the national anthem and items arranged by Villa-Lobos.  For the 1943 celebrations he also composed the ballet ''[[Dan\u00e7a da terra]]'', which the authorities deemed unsuitable until it was revised.  The 1943 celebrations did include Villa-Lobos's hymn ''[[Invoca\u00e7\u00e3o em defesa da p\u00e1tria]]'' shortly after Brazil's declaring war on Germany and its allies.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=115}}\n\nVilla-Lobos's [[demagogue]] status damaged his reputation among certain schools of musicians, among them disciples of new European trends such as [[serialism]]{{nsmdns}}which was effectively off limits in Brazil until the 1960s.  This crisis was, in part, due to some Brazilian composers finding it necessary to reconcile Villa-Lobos's own liberation of Brazilian music from European models in the 1920s with a style of music they felt to be more universal.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=117\u201318}}\n\n===Composer in demand===\n\n[[Image:Heitor Villa-lobos TA.jpg|thumb|right|Heitor Villa-Lobos at the end of a concert in [[Tel Aviv]], 1952]]\n\nVargas fell from power in 1945.  Villa-Lobos was able, after the end of the war, to travel abroad again; he returned to Paris, and also made regular visits to the United States as well as travelling to [[Great Britain]], and [[Israel]].  He received a huge number of commissions, and fulfilled many of them despite failing health.  He composed [[concertos]] for piano, cello (the second one in 1953), classical guitar (in 1951 for Segovia, who refused to play it until the composer provided a [[cadenza]] in 1956),{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=123}} [[harp]] (for [[Nicanor Zabaleta]] in 1953) and [[harmonica]] (for [[John Sebastian (classical harmonica player)|John Sebastian, Sr.]] in 1955\u20136).  Other commissions included his Symphony No. 11 (for the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] in 1955), and the opera ''[[Yerma (opera)|Yerma]]'' (1955\u201356) based on the play by [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]].  His prolific output of this period prompted criticisms of note-spinning and banality: critical reactions to his [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Villa-Lobos)|Piano Concerto No. 5]] included the comments \"bankrupt\" and \"piano tuners' orgy\",<ref>The critic of ''Musical Opinion'' in 1955, quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=121\u201322}}</ref> \"raked the very depths of banality\", \"nothing ... but soupy textures or a bedraggled romantic idea\", and \"truly the kind of music that should never get written, still less performed\".<ref>Donald Mitchell, \"London Music\", ''The Musical Times'' 96, No. 1349 (July 1955): 378\u201380.</ref>\n\nHis music for the film ''[[Green Mansions (film)|Green Mansions]]'' starring [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Anthony Perkins]], commissioned by [[MGM]] in 1958, earned Villa-Lobos {{US$|25,000|link=yes}}, and he conducted the [[soundtrack]] recording himself.<ref>Wright 1992, 136.</ref>  The film was in production for many years. Originally to be directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]], it was taken over by Hepburn's husband [[Mel Ferrer]].{{sfn|The MGM Story}}  MGM decided to use only part of Villa-Lobos's music in the actual film, turning instead to [[Bronis\u0142aw Kaper|Bronislau Kaper]] for the rest of the music.{{sfn|Heitor Villa-Lobos website}} From the score, Villa-Lobos compiled a work for soprano soloist, male chorus, and orchestra, which he titled ''Forest of the Amazon'' and recorded it in 1959 in [[stereo]] with Brazilian soprano [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]], an unidentified male chorus, and the [[Symphony of the Air]] for [[United Artists Records]]. The recording was issued both on LP and reel-to-reel tape (United Artist UAC 8007, stereo 7 1/2 IPS).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LscWPBPKLhY|title=Heitor Villa-Lobos \"Floresta do Amazonas\"|first=|last=gioiellidellamusica|date=28 August 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}}<!--The LP is mentioned by one blogger, but nothing at all about a reel-to-reel tape.-->{{Unreliable source?|reason=Youtube and appended blog|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn June 1959, Villa-Lobos alienated many of his fellow musicians by expressing disillusionment, saying in an interview that Brazil was \"dominated by mediocrity\".<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 139\">{{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=139}}.</ref>  In November he died in Rio; his state funeral was the final major civic event in that city before the capital transferred to [[Bras\u00edlia]].{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=138}}  He is buried in the ''[[Cemit\u00e9rio S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Batista]]'' in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Heitor Villa-Lobos}}\n\nHis earliest pieces originated in guitar improvisations, for example ''Panqueca'' (Pancake) of 1900.  The concert series of 1915{{ndash}}21 included first performances of pieces demonstrating originality and virtuosic technique.  Some of these pieces are early examples of elements of importance throughout his \u0153uvre.  His attachment to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] is demonstrated in ''Can\u00e7\u00e3o Ib\u00e9ria'' of 1914 and in orchestral transcriptions of some of [[Enrique Granados]]' piano ''Goyescas'' (1918, now lost). Other themes that were to recur in his later work include the anguish and despair of the piece ''Desesperan\u00e7a\u2014 Sonata Phantastica e Capricciosa no. 1'' (1915), a violin sonata including \"histrionic and violently contrasting emotions\",{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=6}} the birds of ''L'oiseau bless\u00e9 d'une fl\u00e8che'' (1913), the mother\u2013child relationship (not usually a happy one in Villa-Lobos's music) in ''Les m\u00e8res'' of 1914, and the flowers of ''Su\u00edte floral'' for piano of 1916{{ndash}}18 which reappeared in ''Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de flores'' for flute and guitar of 1937.\n\nReconciling European tradition and Brazilian influences was also an element that bore fruit more formally later. His earliest published work ''Pequena su\u00edte'' for cello and piano of 1913 shows a love for the cello, but is not notably Brazilian, although it contains elements that were to resurface later.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=8\u20139}} His three-movement ''[[String Quartet No. 1 (Villa-Lobos)|Su\u00edte graciosa]]'' of 1915 (expanded to six movements c. 1947 to become his String Quartet No. 1){{sfn|Peppercorn|1991b|loc=32}} is influenced by European opera,<ref>{{harvnb|Villa-Lobos, sua obra|1972|loc=(2), 229}}, quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=9}}.</ref> while ''Tr\u00eas dan\u00e7as caracter\u00edsticas (africanas e ind\u00edgenas)'' of 1914{{ndash}}16 for piano, later arranged for octet and subsequently orchestrated, is radically influenced by the tribal music of the Caripunas Indians of [[Mato Grosso]].{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=9}}\n[[File:Facsimileescravosdejobvl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Facsimile of Villa-Lobos's \"The Slaves of Job\"]]\n\nWith his tone poems ''Amazonas'' (1917, first performed in Paris in 1929) and ''Uirapur\u00fa'' (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, imitations of the sounds of the jungle and its fauna, imitations of the sound of the nose-flute by the [[stroh violin|violinophone]], and not least imitations of the [[Musician wren|uirapuru]] bird itself.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=13\u201321}}\n\nHis meeting with Arthur Rubinstein in 1918 prompted Villa-Lobos to compose piano music such as ''Simples colet\u00e2nea'' of 1919\u2014which was possibly influenced by Rubinstein's playing of Ravel and Scriabin on his South American tours\u2014and ''Bailado infernal'' of 1920.<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 24\"/>  The latter piece includes the tempi and expression markings \"vertiginoso e fren\u00e9tico\", \"infernal\" and \"mais vivo ainda\" (faster still).\n\n''Carnaval das crian\u00e7as'' of 1919{{ndash}}20 saw Villa-Lobos's mature style emerge; unconstrained by the use of traditional formulae or any requirement for dramatic tension, the piece at times imitates a [[mouth organ]], children's dances, a [[harlequinade]], and ends with an impression of the carnival parade. This work was orchestrated in 1929 with new linking passages and a new title, ''Momoprecoce''.  Na\u00efvet\u00e9 and innocence is also heard in the piano suites ''A Prole do Beb\u00ea'' (The Baby's Family) of 1918{{ndash}}21.\n\nAround this time he also fused urban Brazilian influences and impressions, for example in his ''Quarteto simb\u00f3lico'' of 1921.  He included the urban street music of the ''chor\u00f5es'', who were groups containing flute, clarinet and cavaquinho (a Brazilian guitar), and often also including [[ophicleide]], [[trombone]]s or [[percussion]].  Villa-Lobos occasionally joined such bands.  Early works showing this influence were incorporated into the ''Su\u00edte popular brasileira'' of 1908{{ndash}}12 assembled by his publisher, and more mature works include the ''Sexteto m\u00edstico'' ({{circa}}1955, replacing a lost and probably unfinished one begun in 1917),{{sfn|Peppercorn|1991b|loc=38\u201339}} and his setting of the poetry of [[M\u00e1rio de Andrade]] and Catulo da Pax\u00e3o Cearense in the ''Can\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00edpicas brasileiras'' of 1919.{{sfn|Anon.|2016}} His guitar studies are also influenced by the music of the ''chor\u00f5es''.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=59}}\n\nAll the elements mentioned so far are fused in Villa-Lobos's Nonet.  Subtitled ''Impress\u00e3o r\u00e1pida do todo o Brasil'' (A Brief Impression of the Whole of Brazil), the title of the work denotes it as ostensibly chamber music, but it is scored for flute/piccolo, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, celesta, harp, piano, a large percussion battery requiring at least two players, and a mixed chorus.\n\nIn Paris, his musical vocabulary established, Villa-Lobos solved the problem of his works' form. It was perceived as an incongruity that his Brazilian impressionism should be expressed in the form of quartets and sonatas. He developed new forms to free his imagination from the constraints of conventional musical development such as that required in sonata form.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=41}} The multi-sectional ''poema'' form may be seen in the ''Suite for Voice and Violin'', which is somewhat like a triptych, and the ''Poema da crian\u00e7a e sua mam\u00e3'' for voice, flute, clarinet, and cello (1923).  The extended ''[[Rudepo\u00eama]]'' for piano, written for Rubinstein, is a multi-layered work, often requiring notation on several staves, and is both experimental and demanding.  Wright calls it \"the most impressive result\" of this formal development.{{sfn|Wright|1992|loc=48}} The ''Ciranda'', or ''Cirandinha'' is a stylised treatment of simple Brazilian folk melodies in a wide variety of moods.  A ''ciranda'' is a child's singing game, but Villa-Lobos's treatment in the works he gave this title are sophisticated.  Another form was the ''Ch\u00f4ros''. Villa-Lobos composed more than a dozen works with this title for various instruments, mostly in the years 1924{{ndash}}1929. He described them as \"a new form of musical composition\", a transformation of the Brazilian music and sounds \"by the personality of the composer\".<ref>Note in the score of ''Ch\u00f4ros'' No. 3, quoted in {{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=62}}</ref>\n\nHe also composed between 1930 and 1945 nine pieces he called ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' (Brazilian Bachian pieces). These take the forms and nationalism of the ''Ch\u00f4ros'', and add the composer's love of Bach. He incorporated [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]] in his nationalistic style.{{sfn|Yang|2007|loc=6}} Villa-Lobos's use of archaisms was not new (an early example is his ''Pequena su\u00edte'' for cello and piano of 1913).  The pieces evolved over the period rather than being conceived as a whole, some of them being revised or added to.  They contain some of his most popular music, such as No.{{nbsp}}5 for soprano and eight cellos (1938{{ndash}}1945), and No.{{nbsp}}2 for orchestra of 1930 (the ''Tocata'' movement of which is ''O{{nbsp}}trenzinho do caipira'', \"The little train of the Caipira\").  They also show the composer's love for the tonal qualities of the cello, both No.{{nbsp}}1 and No.{{nbsp}}5 being scored for no other instruments.  In these works the often harsh dissonances of his earlier music are less evident: or, as Simon Wright puts it, they are \"sweetened\".  The transformation of ''Ch\u00f4ros'' into ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' is demonstrated clearly by the comparison of No.{{nbsp}}6 for flute and bassoon with the earlier ''[[Ch\u00f4ros No. 2]]'' for flute and clarinet. The dissonances of the later piece are more controlled, the forward direction of the music easier to discern. ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' No.{{nbsp}}9 takes the concept so far as to be an abstract ''Prelude and Fugue'', a complete distillation of the composer's national influences.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|1992|loc=81\u201399}} discusses the ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' in some detail</ref>  Villa-Lobos eventually recorded all nine of these works for [[EMI]] in Paris, mostly with the musicians of the French National Orchestra; these were originally issued on LPs and later reissued on CDs.{{sfn|EMI catalogue}} He also recorded the first section of ''Bachianas Brasileiras No.{{nbsp}}5'' with [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]] and a group of cellists for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].{{sfn|Sony Masterworks catalogue|1972}}\n\nDuring his period at SEMA, Villa-Lobos composed five string quartets, nos. [[String Quartet No. 5 (Villa-Lobos)|5]]{{nbsp}}to{{nbsp}}[[String Quartet No. 9 (Villa-Lobos)|9]], which explored avenues opened by his public music that dominated his output.  He also wrote more music for Segovia, the ''Cinq pr\u00e9ludes'', which also demonstrate a further formalisation of his composition style.  After the fall of the Vargas government, Villa-Lobos returned full-time to composition, resuming a prolific rate of completing works.  His concertos\u2014particularly those for the guitar, the harp, and the harmonica\u2014are examples of his earlier ''poema'' form.  The Harp Concerto is a large work, and shows a new propensity to focus on a small detail, then to fade it and bring another detail to the foreground. This technique also occurs in his final opera, ''Yerma'', which contains a series of scenes each of which establishes an atmosphere, similarly to the earlier ''Momoprecoce''.\n\nVilla-Lobos's final major work was the music for the film ''[[Green Mansions (film)|Green Mansions]]'' (though in the end, most of his score was replaced with music by [[Bronislaw Kaper]]<ref>''Green Mansions'' film credits.</ref>) and its arrangement as ''Floresta do Amazonas'' for orchestra, as well as some short songs issued separately.  In 1957, he wrote a [[String Quartet No. 17 (Villa-Lobos)|Seventeenth String Quartet]], whose austerity of technique and emotional intensity \"provide a eulogy to his craft\".<ref name=\"Wright 1992, 139\"/>  His ''Bendita Sabedoria'', a sequence of ''[[a cappella]]'' chorales written in 1958, is a similarly simple setting of Latin biblical texts.  These works lack the pictorialism of his more public music.\n\nExcept for the lost works, the Nonet, the two concerted works for violin and orchestra, ''Suite for Piano and Orchestra'', a number of the symphonic poems, most of his choral music and all of the operas, his music is well represented on the world's recital and concert stages and on [[Compact Disc|CD]].\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[Image:Arte-moderna-8.jpg|border|250px|right|poster announcing appearance of Villa-Lobos in S\u00e3o Paulo (17 February 1922)]]\n\nWhen touring Europe with his music he said, \"I don't use folklore, I am the folklore\" (''Eu sou o folclore'') and \"I have not come to learn, I have come to show what I have made up to now\" (''Ich bin nicht gekommen, um zu lernen, sondern um zu zeigen, was ich bisher gemacht habe''),{{sfn|Negwer|2008|loc=8}} showing that he was quite aware of his unique position among classical composers, and he made good use of his origins to publicise his own works.{{sfn|Negwer|2009|loc={{Page needed|date=September 2011}}}}\n\n==Recordings <!-- of Villa-Lobos himself as performer or conductor!-->==\n* ''Villa-Lobos plays Villa-Lobos'' (SCSH 010, [http://www.sanctusrecordings.com/ SanCtuS Recordings]) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080921190048/http://www.tar-radio.com/myapp/articles/view/130 audio])\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225914/http://www.emiclassics.com/releasedetails.php?rid=7912 ''Villa-Lobos par lui-m\u00eame''] ([[EMI Classics]] 0077776722924) (archive from 26 September 2011, accessed 19 November 2015).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225929/http://www.emiclassics.com/grocreleasedetails.php?rid=23228 ''Villa-Lobos: Bachianas Brasileiras Nos. 1, 2, 5 & 9''] Angel 0724356696426; EMI Classics CD 724356696457 (archive from 26 September 2011, accessed 19 November 2015).<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110926225936/http://www.emiclassics.com/groc/releases1/villa.html Great Recordings of the Century: Villa-Lobos: Bachianas Nos. 1, 2, 5 & 9]\".

However, this area, which falls under the administration of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], is uninhabited save for the presence of a [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] base on the island of [[Diego Garcia]], after the [[United Kingdom]] [[Expulsion of the Chagossians|evicted the local population between 1967 and 1973]]. As a consequence, the team in fact represents the [[Chagossians|Chagossian diaspora]] around the world.\nThey are led by sussex based manager Jimmy Ferrar, who has previously managed at Oakwood, Crawley Down and Alfold where he won the Southern combination Div 1 for season 18/19.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tuvalu and Chagos Islands line up, 9 June 2018.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chagos Islands and [[Tuvalu national football team|Tuvalu]] line up before their match in June 2018]]\nIn 2004, following the granting of Chagossians living in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the right to apply for a [[British passport]], a group of islanders living near [[Crawley]] in [[West Sussex]] founded a governing body for football among their community, and the wider worldwide Chagossian diaspora, with a view to forming a national team. This resulted in the formation of the ''Union Chagossiene de Football'', which joined the [[N.F.-Board]], an international body for national football teams unable to join [[FIFA]], in 2005.<ref name=\"dream\">{{cite web |url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2012/4/30/the-chagossian-dream.html |title=The Chagossian Dream |last1=Stubbs |first1=Ed |last2= |first2= |date=30 April 2012 |website=In Bed With Maradona |publisher= |access-date=13 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref> Amongst the activities the UCF undertook was organizing a club side, Chagos Islands F.C., which played in the [[Crawley and District Football League]] until it was disbanded in 2010. With no immediate UK domestic outlet for their players to play, the UCF attempted to promote the side in the international arena, attempting to take a team to the [[2010 Viva World Cup]] in [[Gozo]]. However, owing to the association's financial situation, and the wholly amateur status of the players, this was not possible.<ref name=\"dream\" /> Attempts to reform the club side in another local league in Sussex also failed, leading to the team training regularly, but not playing.\n\nIn December 2011, a friendly was finally arranged with the [[Raetia football team]], another member of the N.F.-Board, who not only came to the UK, but also brought a full set of kit for the Chagossian team to use. The game was played at the ground of [[Oakwood F.C.]], for whom Chagossian straker Mervin Bhujan was a player, and who arranged use of the stadium, and led to a 6\u20131 victory for the Chagos Islands.

However, this area, which falls under the administration of the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], is uninhabited save for the presence of a [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] base on the island of [[Diego Garcia]], after the [[United Kingdom]] [[Expulsion of the Chagossians|evicted the local population between 1967 and 1973]]. As a consequence, the team in fact represents the [[Chagossians|Chagossian diaspora]] around the world.\nThey are led by sussex based manager Jimmy Ferrar, who has previously managed at Oakwood, Crawley Down and Alfold where he won the Southern combination Div 1 for season 18/19.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Tuvalu and Chagos Islands line up, 9 June 2018.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Chagos Islands and [[Tuvalu national football team|Tuvalu]] line up before their match in June 2018]]\nIn 2004, following the granting of Chagossians living in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the right to apply for a [[British passport]], a group of islanders living near [[Crawley]] in [[West Sussex]] founded a governing body for football among their community, and the wider worldwide Chagossian diaspora, with a view to forming a national team. This resulted in the formation of the ''Union Chagossiene de Football'', which joined the [[N.F.-Board]], an international body for national football teams unable to join [[FIFA]], in 2005.<ref name=\"dream\">{{cite web |url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2012/4/30/the-chagossian-dream.html |title=The Chagossian Dream |last1=Stubbs |first1=Ed |last2= |first2= |date=30 April 2012 |website=In Bed With Maradona |publisher= |access-date=13 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref> Amongst the activities the UCF undertook was organizing a club side, Chagos Islands F.C., which played in the [[Crawley and District Football League]] until it was disbanded in 2010. With no immediate UK domestic outlet for their players to play, the UCF attempted to promote the side in the international arena, attempting to take a team to the [[2010 Viva World Cup]] in [[Gozo]]. However, owing to the association's financial situation, and the wholly amateur status of the players, this was not possible.<ref name=\"dream\" /> Attempts to reform the club side in another local league in Sussex also failed, leading to the team training regularly, but not playing.\n\nIn December 2011, a friendly was finally arranged with the [[Raetia football team]], another member of the N.F.-Board, who not only came to the UK, but also brought a full set of kit for the Chagossian team to use. The game was played at the ground of [[Oakwood F.C.]], for whom Chagossian straker Mervin Bhujan was a player, and who arranged use of the stadium, and led to a 6\u20131 victory for the Chagos Islands. This led to hopes that the team would be able to participate more fully in N.F.-Board events, but lack of finances again meant this was to prove impossible.<ref name=\"dream\" />\n\nIn May 2012, a second match was organized, this time against [[Sealand national football team|Sealand]]. This was a first \"away\" game for the Chagossians, played at the home of [[Godalming Town F.C.]] in [[Surrey]], which was used by Sealand for their home games, and resulted in a second consecutive win for the Chagos Islands.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/17981522 |title= Ralf Little gets an international cap for Sealand|last1=Geary |first1=Patrick |last2= |first2= |date=7 May 2012 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |access-date=13 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref> However, in spite of successfully staging a pair of games, the UCF was forced to fold.\n\nIn February 2013, a new organization, the Chagos Football Association, was formed to continue the management of the Chagos team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=913408358779773&id=606823479438264&comment_id=913408895446386&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D |title=The CFA Was set up in Feb 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=14 April 2016 |website=Facebook |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref> The first match organized under the new body was a game against Sealand, taking place in February 2014 at Godalming, and which saw the Chagossians suffer their first defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sealandgov.org/football-blog-posts/sealand-to-meet-chagos-islands-on-february-23rd |title=Sealand to meet Chagos Islands on February 23rd |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=30 January 2014 |website=Sealand Government |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2016 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324091544/http://www.sealandgov.org/football-blog-posts/sealand-to-meet-chagos-islands-on-february-23rd |archive-date=24 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/chagos-islands-sealand-football-match |title=I Went to an International Football Match Between Two Non-Countries |last1=Baines |first1=James |last2= |first2= |date=7 March 2014 |website=vice.com |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref> A third game was quickly organized, this time taking place at the home of [[Crawley Town F.C.]], in May 2014, ending in a 1\u20131 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manygameshaveiseen.blogspot.com/2014/05/chagos-islands-1-v-1-sealand.html |title=Chagos Islands 1 v Sealand 1 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=6 May 2014 |website=Many Games I Have Seen |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, around the same time as playing their second fixture against Sealand, the CFA joined [[Confederation of Independent Football Associations|ConIFA]], in an attempt to find more regular games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nonfifafootball.blogspot.com/2014/02/chagos-islands-join-conifa-ahead-of.html |title=Chagos Islands join ConIFA ahead of Sealand game |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=19 February 2014 |website=Non-Fifa Football Updates |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref> The team played its first official fixture against another member of ConIFA when they turned out for a game against [[Somaliland national football team|Somaliland]] in London in November 2014, again ending in a 1\u20131 draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://somalilandsun.com/section-table/29-community/6694-somaliland-sl-diaspora-football-team-draw-with-chagos-island-in-a-charity-match-/ |title=SL Diaspora Football Team Draw with Chagos Island in a Charity Match  |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=6 November 2014 |website=Somaliland Sun |publisher= |access-date=14 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref> In 2015, the CFA announced its intention to attempt to qualify to participate in its first tournament, the [[ConIFA World Football Cup]], via ConIFA's recently announced qualification process, by participating in a tournament hosted by Raetia, the Benedikt Fontana Cup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faraetia.ch/?p=251 |title=Chagos ersetzt Panjab |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=22 May 2015 |website=FA Raetia |access-date=14 April 2016 |language=German |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529203057/http://www.faraetia.ch/?p=251 |archive-date=29 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Originally planned as a three-team tournament, this altered into a two-legged play-off between the hosts and the Chagossians.
