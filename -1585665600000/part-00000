Her progress was very rapid with the instrument, and she soon began to receive lessons from a violin professor, [[Henry Holmes (composer)|Henry Holmes]].\n\nTo become a top professional violinist and to begin a concert career, Parlow followed the normal route for North Americans and moved to Europe.  Kathleen and her mother arrived in [[London]] on January 1, 1905.  Upon attending a concert by [[Mischa Elman]], the Parlows decided to seek out Elman's teacher, [[Leopold Auer]].  Minnie and Kathleen Parlow had arrived in London with $300 raised by their church in San Francisco, which was not sufficient to get them to [[St. Petersburg]], where Auer was a professor.  To pay the cost of travel, the Parlows obtained a loan from [[Lord Strathcona]], the Canadian High Commissioner.<ref name = \"CHILDHOOD\" />  The pair travelled to Russia, and in October 1906, Kathleen Parlow became the first foreigner to attend the [[St. Petersburg Conservatory]].  In her class of forty-five students, Parlow was the only female.\n\n==Concert career==\nAt 17, having spent a year at the conservatory, Parlow began to put on public performances.<ref name = \"EARLY\">{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.2-e.html|title = Kathleen Parlow - Early Career and Concert Tours|publisher = Collections Canada}}</ref>  She gave solo performances in both St. Petersburg and [[Helsinki]].  Parlow and her mother had little money, and could not otherwise support themselves.  Soon after, Kathleen Parlow made her professional debut in Berlin,<ref name=canenc/> and then began a tour of [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Norway]].  In Norway she performed for [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud]], of whom she would become a favourite.  There she also met [[Einar Bj\u00f8rnson]], a wealthy Norwegian (son of Nobel laureate [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]]) who would become her friend and [[patron]].  Bj\u00f8rnson purchased for Parlow a [[Giuseppe Guarneri|Guarnerius del Ges\u00f9]] violin, made in 1735.  The violin cost \u00a32000 and had previously been owned by [[Viotti]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = Foreign Notes|journal = The Musical Times|volume = 49|date = May 1908|pages = 334\u2013335|issue = 783|issn = 0027-4666|jstor=903014}}</ref>\n\nParlow travelled Europe with her mother performing for five years.  Auer remained a strong influence on Parlow, who referred to him as \"Papa Auer\".  Her mother and Auer arranged concerts and opportunities for Kathleen, including concerts with famed conductors such as [[Thomas Beecham]] and [[Bruno Walter]].\n\nIn November 1910, Kathleen Parlow returned to North America for a tour.  Parlow performed in [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Montreal]], [[Quebec City|Quebec]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].  Her first performance with the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]] was on March 16, 1911.  Returning to her birthplace of western Canada, Parlow gave performances in [[Calgary]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan|Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatoon]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].  Her performances were lauded by provincial premiers, and both mother and daughter Parlow were pleased by her positive reception in western Canada.\n\nParlow returned to England with her mother in 1911 for further concerts.  Her mother would remain her constant travelling companion, well into adulthood.  She performed in the [[Ostend Festival]], preparing again with Auer.  Parlow maintained a heavy touring schedule, crossing and recrossing the Atlantic to tour both Europe and North America.  She participated in a benefit concert for survivors of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]], and made her first recording at the request of [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name = \"EARLY\" />  She signed with [[Columbia Records]] to produce recordings.\n\nUntil 1912, Parlow had performed primarily as a solo artist, but after meeting [[Ernesto Consolo]], an Italian pianist, she began to perform [[chamber music]].<ref name = \"EARLY\" />\n\nThe Parlows were in England when [[World War I]] broke out.  During the war, Parlow toured neutral nations of Europe such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].  She returned to North America for a tour in the spring of 1916.  She returned to England, but the increasing difficulty of travel kept her there until 1919.  Her former teacher emigrated to New York around this time because of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|political situation in Russia]], but Parlow worked with him less and less.\n\n[[File:KathleenAndMinnieParlowInJapan.jpg|right|thumb|Kathleen Parlow and her mother in Japan]]\n\nKathleen Parlow began her fifth tour of North American in December 1920, and she gave her first radio performance in [[Seattle]] in April 1922.<ref name = \"EARLY\" />  After this, Parlow went on a 22-month tour that included [[Hawaii]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Singapore]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].  She made recordings for the [[Columbia Music Entertainment|Nipponophone Company]] while in Japan.\n\nParlow continued touring, returning to Europe, but in 1926 she took a break.  Motivated by the stress of traveling or perhaps a broken relationship, she stopped performing for a year.  To renew her career, she traveled to [[Mexico]] for concerts.  There she was praised by critics, but her financial situation remained poor.  Her tour of Mexico in 1929 was her first without her mother.\n\n==Later years==\nWith her concert career not particularly profitable, Parlow looked for other career options.  In 1929, she was appointed to the faculty of [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland]], [[California]].<ref name = \"TEACH\">{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.3-e.html|title = Kathleen Parlow - Teaching and Chamber Music|publisher = Collections Canada}}</ref>  She received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Mills College in 1933.  While at Mills College she began to play in [[string quartet]]s, in which she played violin, and in 1935 she formed the [[South Mountain Parlow Quartet]].\n\nIn 1936, Parlow accepted a position at the [[Juilliard School of Music]].  She remained there until [[World War II]], when she returned to Canada and gave a series of lecture-recitals at the [[Royal Conservatory of Music]] in Toronto.  She wrote to [[Sir Ernest MacMillan]] about a permanent position with the Royal Conservatory of Music, and obtained one in 1941.  While there, she was a teacher for the singer [[Gis\u00e8le LaFleche]], violinist [[Ivan Romanoff]], and the conductor [[Victor Feldbrill]].\n\n[[File:TheCanadianTrio.jpg|right|thumb|The Canadian Trio (left to right: Nelsova, MacMillan, Parlow)]]\n\nShe became a regular performer with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra as well, bringing additional income.<ref name = \"TEACH\" />  In Toronto, she organised the [[Canadian Trio]], which she performed in with [[Zara Nelsova]] playing the [[cello]], and Sir Ernest MacMillan playing [[piano]].  The trio debuted with a performance of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s Trio in B-flat Major, and [[Haydn]]'s Trio in A Major and [[Tchaikovsky]]'s Trio in A minor.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fnLDHFT158UC&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=kathleen+parlow|title = Sir Ernest Macmillan: The Importance of Being Canadian|author = Ezra Schabas|publisher = University of Toronto Press|isbn = 0-8020-2849-7|year = 1994}}</ref>  They received excellent reviews and the trio continued performing across southern Ontario, as well as on radio, until 1944.\n\nThe Canadian Trio was earning as much as $750 per performance.<ref name = \"TEACH\" />  Inspired by this success, Parlow started her third string quartet in 1942, called the [[Parlow String Quartet]].<ref name = \"QUART\">{{cite web|title = Kathleen Parlow - The Parlow String Quartet|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.4-e.html|publisher= Collections Canada}}</ref>  The quartet also included [[Isaac Mamott]] on cello, [[Samuel Hersenhoren]] as second violin and violist [[John Dembeck]].  Parlow did all the administrative work for the quartet.  The quartet gave concerts in Canada, both live and on radio, but did not travel to any other countries.  Their first performance was broadcast on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1943, and they remained together for 15 years.  During this time, Parlow remained the head of the quartet, but the other performers were occasionally replaced.\n\nAs Parlow's career began to decline, her financial situation became progressively worse, and [[Godfrey Ridout]] and other friends of hers established a fund to support her.<ref name = \"QUART\" />  In October 1959, she was appointed head of the College of Music of the [[University of Western Ontario]], which provided much needed income.

Her progress was very rapid with the instrument, and she soon began to receive lessons from a violin professor, [[Henry Holmes (composer)|Henry Holmes]].\n\nTo become a top professional violinist and to begin a concert career, Parlow followed the normal route for North Americans and moved to Europe.  Kathleen and her mother arrived in [[London]] on January 1, 1905.  Upon attending a concert by [[Mischa Elman]], the Parlows decided to seek out Elman's teacher, [[Leopold Auer]].  Minnie and Kathleen Parlow had arrived in London with $300 raised by their church in San Francisco, which was not sufficient to get them to [[St. Petersburg]], where Auer was a professor.  To pay the cost of travel, the Parlows obtained a loan from [[Lord Strathcona]], the Canadian High Commissioner.<ref name = \"CHILDHOOD\" />  The pair travelled to Russia, and in October 1906, Kathleen Parlow became the first foreigner to attend the [[St. Petersburg Conservatory]].  In her class of forty-five students, Parlow was the only female.\n\n==Concert career==\nAt 17, having spent a year at the conservatory, Parlow began to put on public performances.<ref name = \"EARLY\">{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.2-e.html|title = Kathleen Parlow - Early Career and Concert Tours|publisher = Collections Canada}}</ref>  She gave solo performances in both St. Petersburg and [[Helsinki]].  Parlow and her mother had little money, and could not otherwise support themselves.  Soon after, Kathleen Parlow made her professional debut in Berlin,<ref name=canenc/> and then began a tour of [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Norway]].  In Norway she performed for [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud]], of whom she would become a favourite.  There she also met [[Einar Bj\u00f8rnson]], a wealthy Norwegian (son of Nobel laureate [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]]) who would become her friend and [[patron]].  Bj\u00f8rnson purchased for Parlow a [[Giuseppe Guarneri|Guarnerius del Ges\u00f9]] violin, made in 1735.  The violin cost \u00a32000 and had previously been owned by [[Viotti]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = Foreign Notes|journal = The Musical Times|volume = 49|date = May 1908|pages = 334\u2013335|issue = 783|issn = 0027-4666|jstor=903014}}</ref>\n\nParlow travelled Europe with her mother performing for five years.  Auer remained a strong influence on Parlow, who referred to him as \"Papa Auer\".  Her mother and Auer arranged concerts and opportunities for Kathleen, including concerts with famed conductors such as [[Thomas Beecham]] and [[Bruno Walter]].\n\nIn November 1910, Kathleen Parlow returned to North America for a tour.  Parlow performed in [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Montreal]], [[Quebec City|Quebec]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]].  Her first performance with the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]] was on March 16, 1911.  Returning to her birthplace of western Canada, Parlow gave performances in [[Calgary]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan|Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatoon]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].  Her performances were lauded by provincial premiers, and both mother and daughter Parlow were pleased by her positive reception in western Canada.\n\nParlow returned to England with her mother in 1911 for further concerts.  Her mother would remain her constant travelling companion, well into adulthood.  She performed in the [[Ostend Festival]], preparing again with Auer.  Parlow maintained a heavy touring schedule, crossing and recrossing the Atlantic to tour both Europe and North America.  She participated in a benefit concert for survivors of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]], and made her first recording at the request of [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name = \"EARLY\" />  She signed with [[Columbia Records]] to produce recordings.\n\nUntil 1912, Parlow had performed primarily as a solo artist, but after meeting [[Ernesto Consolo]], an Italian pianist, she began to perform [[chamber music]].<ref name = \"EARLY\" />\n\nThe Parlows were in England when [[World War I]] broke out.  During the war, Parlow toured neutral nations of Europe such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].  She returned to North America for a tour in the spring of 1916.  She returned to England, but the increasing difficulty of travel kept her there until 1919.  Her former teacher emigrated to New York around this time because of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|political situation in Russia]], but Parlow worked with him less and less.\n\n[[File:KathleenAndMinnieParlowInJapan.jpg|right|thumb|Kathleen Parlow and her mother in Japan]]\n\nKathleen Parlow began her fifth tour of North American in December 1920, and she gave her first radio performance in [[Seattle]] in April 1922.<ref name = \"EARLY\" />  After this, Parlow went on a 22-month tour that included [[Hawaii]], [[Indonesia]], [[China]], [[Singapore]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].  She made recordings for the [[Columbia Music Entertainment|Nipponophone Company]] while in Japan.\n\nParlow continued touring, returning to Europe, but in 1926 she took a break.  Motivated by the stress of traveling or perhaps a broken relationship, she stopped performing for a year.  To renew her career, she traveled to [[Mexico]] for concerts.  There she was praised by critics, but her financial situation remained poor.  Her tour of Mexico in 1929 was her first without her mother.\n\n==Later years==\nWith her concert career not particularly profitable, Parlow looked for other career options.  In 1929, she was appointed to the faculty of [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland]], [[California]].<ref name = \"TEACH\">{{cite web|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.3-e.html|title = Kathleen Parlow - Teaching and Chamber Music|publisher = Collections Canada}}</ref>  She received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Mills College in 1933.  While at Mills College she began to play in [[string quartet]]s, in which she played violin, and in 1935 she formed the [[South Mountain Parlow Quartet]].\n\nIn 1936, Parlow accepted a position at the [[Juilliard School of Music]].  She remained there until [[World War II]], when she returned to Canada and gave a series of lecture-recitals at the [[Royal Conservatory of Music]] in Toronto.  She wrote to [[Sir Ernest MacMillan]] about a permanent position with the Royal Conservatory of Music, and obtained one in 1941.  While there, she was a teacher for the singer [[Gis\u00e8le LaFleche]], violinist [[Ivan Romanoff]], and the conductor [[Victor Feldbrill]].\n\n[[File:TheCanadianTrio.jpg|right|thumb|The Canadian Trio (left to right: Nelsova, MacMillan, Parlow)]]\n\nShe became a regular performer with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra as well, bringing additional income.<ref name = \"TEACH\" />  In Toronto, she organised the [[Canadian Trio]], which she performed in with [[Zara Nelsova]] playing the [[cello]], and Sir Ernest MacMillan playing [[piano]].  The trio debuted with a performance of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s Trio in B-flat Major, and [[Haydn]]'s Trio in A Major and [[Tchaikovsky]]'s Trio in A minor.<ref>{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fnLDHFT158UC&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=kathleen+parlow|title = Sir Ernest Macmillan: The Importance of Being Canadian|author = Ezra Schabas|publisher = University of Toronto Press|isbn = 0-8020-2849-7|year = 1994}}</ref>  They received excellent reviews and the trio continued performing across southern Ontario, as well as on radio, until 1944.\n\nThe Canadian Trio was earning as much as $750 per performance.<ref name = \"TEACH\" />  Inspired by this success, Parlow started her third string quartet in 1942, called the [[Parlow String Quartet]].<ref name = \"QUART\">{{cite web|title = Kathleen Parlow - The Parlow String Quartet|url = http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/m2-1022.4-e.html|publisher= Collections Canada}}</ref>  The quartet also included [[Isaac Mamott]] on cello, [[Samuel Hersenhoren]] as second violin and violist [[John Dembeck]].  Parlow did all the administrative work for the quartet.  The quartet gave concerts in Canada, both live and on radio, but did not travel to any other countries.  Their first performance was broadcast on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1943, and they remained together for 15 years.  During this time, Parlow remained the head of the quartet, but the other performers were occasionally replaced.\n\nAs Parlow's career began to decline, her financial situation became progressively worse, and [[Godfrey Ridout]] and other friends of hers established a fund to support her.<ref name = \"QUART\" />  In October 1959, she was appointed head of the College of Music of the [[University of Western Ontario]], which provided much needed income.

Their differences are so great that historian [[James Tinney]] has suggested that the organizations should be divided into three groups:<ref name=Tinney/>\n* [[Black Jews]]{{dn|date=January 2020}}, who maintain a Christological perspective while adopting Jewish rituals despite not being Jewish.\n* Black Hebrews, who are more traditional in their practice of Judaism but are not Jewish.\n* Black Israelites, who are the most [[Black nationalism|nationalistic]] and the furthest from traditional Judaism.<ref name=Tinney>{{cite journal |last=Tinney |first=James |authorlink=James Tinney |date=December 7, 1973 |title=Black Jews: A House Divided |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |pages=52\u201354 }}, cited at Chireau, p. 29.</ref>\n\nBlack Hebrew organizations have certain common characteristics. [[Anthropologist]] James E. Landing, author of ''Black Judaism'', distinguishes the Black Hebrew movement, which he refers to as Black Judaism, from the normative form of Judaism that is practiced by people who are Black (\"black Judaism\"). Significantly, it does not depend on a documented lineage to Jewish ancestors nor does it require recognized [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] conversions:\n\n{{quote|Black Judaism is ... a form of institutionalized (congregational) religious expression in which black persons identify themselves as Jews, Israelites, or Hebrews ... in a manner that seems unacceptable to the \"whites\" of the world's Jewish community, primarily because Jews take issue with the various justifications that are set forth by Black Jews in establishing this identity. Thus \"Black Judaism,\" as defined here, stands distinctly apart from \"black Judaism,\" or that Judaic expression which is found among black persons that would be acceptable to the world's Jewish community, such as conversion or birth from a recognized Jewish mother. \"Black Judaism\" has been a social movement; \"black Judaism\" has been an isolated social phenomenon.<ref name=Landing10>Landing, p. 10, quoted in Isaac, p. 520.</ref>}}\n\nLanding's definition, and its underlying assumptions about race and normative Judaism, have been criticized.{{by whom|date=March 2019}}<ref name=Isaac>Isaac, pp. 512\u2013542.</ref>\n\nThe group sometimes employs [[Open-air preaching|street preaching]] to promote their ideology.

[[Anthropologist]] James E. Landing, author of ''Black Judaism'', distinguishes the Black Hebrew movement, which he refers to as Black Judaism, from the normative form of Judaism that is practiced by people who are Black (\"black Judaism\"). Significantly, it does not depend on a documented lineage to Jewish ancestors nor does it require recognized [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] conversions:\n\n{{quote|Black Judaism is ... a form of institutionalized (congregational) religious expression in which black persons identify themselves as Jews, Israelites, or Hebrews ... in a manner that seems unacceptable to the \"whites\" of the world's Jewish community, primarily because Jews take issue with the various justifications that are set forth by Black Jews in establishing this identity. Thus \"Black Judaism,\" as defined here, stands distinctly apart from \"black Judaism,\" or that Judaic expression which is found among black persons that would be acceptable to the world's Jewish community, such as conversion or birth from a recognized Jewish mother. \"Black Judaism\" has been a social movement; \"black Judaism\" has been an isolated social phenomenon.<ref name=Landing10>Landing, p. 10, quoted in Isaac, p. 520.</ref>}}\n\nLanding's definition, and its underlying assumptions about race and normative Judaism, have been criticized.{{by whom|date=March 2019}}<ref name=Isaac>Isaac, pp. 512\u2013542.</ref>\n\nThe group sometimes employs [[Open-air preaching|street preaching]] to promote their ideology.

The film also features [[Izabella Scorupco]] and [[Gerard Butler]].\n\nThe film is set in [[England]] in the year 2020, twenty years after London tunneling project workers inadvertently awakened [[dragon]]s from centuries of slumber and the creatures have subsequently replaced humans as the dominant species on Earth. With the fate of mankind at stake, two surviving parties, led by Quinn Abercromby (Bale) and Denton Van Zan (McConaughey), find that they must work together to hunt down and destroy the beasts in a desperate attempt to take back the world.\n\nThe film was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on 12 July 2002. Upon release, it received generally mixed reviews from critics and audiences and became a commercial failure,  grossing $82&nbsp;million on a $60&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web | url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=reignoffire.htm | title = Reign of Fire (2002) | publisher= IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate= 2011-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens at an unspecified date in the early 21st century. During construction on the [[London Underground]], workers penetrate a cave. A huge [[European dragon|dragon]] emerges from [[hibernation]], incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen ([[Alice Krige]]) - the construction crew chief - is crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear. It is revealed through newspaper clippings and the narration that dragons are the species responsible for the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s. They are speculated to hibernate after destroying most living creatures until the planet repopulates. Mankind's militaristic resistance, including [[nuclear weapon]]s in 2010, only hastens the destruction, and by 2020, humans are [[Endangered species|nearly extinct]].\n\nQuinn ([[Christian Bale]]) leads a community of survivors at [[Bamburgh Castle]], [[Northumberland]]. They are starving while awaiting harvest. Although most trust Quinn, some are restless and defiant. Eddie ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) and his group steal a truck to pick tomatoes, though it is too soon for harvest. They are attacked by a dragon. One man is killed and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy ([[Gerard Butler]]), and Jared (Scott Moutter) rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping.\n\nThe [[Kentucky]] [[Irregular military|Irregulars]], a group of [[Americans]] led by Denton Van Zan ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), arrive on a [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]] with a [[Chieftain tank]] and [[AgustaWestland AW109]] utility helicopter, the latter of which is piloted by Alex Jensen ([[Izabella Scorupco]]). Van Zan has a system for hunting dragons and knows their weakness: poor vision during [[twilight]]. With Quinn's help, Van Zan, Alex, and their team hunt and slay the dragon who destroyed the crops.\n\nThe survivors enjoy a celebration at the castle that night but Van Zan is embittered by the loss of several of his men. Van Zan and Alex tell Quinn that all the dragons they have found have been female. The Americans believe there is only one male - if they kill it, the dragons can no longer reproduce. Although Quinn knows about the male dragon, which killed his mother, he refuses to help.\n\nIn open defiance Van Zan orders his soldiers to enlist the castle's best men despite Quinn's argument that if they find the male it will kill them and find the castle the men remain hesitant at Van Zans request. Quinn attacks Van Zan in-front of the castle's inhabitants and a fight to the death ensues, Van Zan gives Quinn a terrible beating and it's left for the watching crowd to pull Van Zan off before Quinn is beaten to death, Van Zan giving Quinn the beating has an impact on the castle's inhabitants, Van Zan and indeed some of the castle's men then depart with Quinn bloodied and helpless to stop them, But true to Quinn's warnings Van Zan's caravan is attacked by the dragon in the ruins of a town {{convert|66|mi}} from London. The dragon then finds the castle and kills most of the inhabitants. Quinn gets the survivors to a [[bunker]], but they are trapped when the dragon returns; during its final attack, Creedy is killed.\n\nVan Zan and Jensen return and free everyone trapped in the bunker. Quinn decides to help Van Zan and Alex hunt down the male dragon. They fly to London and find hundreds of small dragons, one of which is cannibalized by the larger male. Van Zan plans to shoot explosives down the dragon's throat with a [[crossbow]]. He fires, but the dragon destroys the arrow and eats Van Zan. Quinn and Alex lure the dragon to ground level, where Quinn fires another explosive into the dragon's mouth, killing it.\n\nLater, Quinn and Alex erect a [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]] on a hill overlooking the [[North Sea]]. There has been no dragon sighting for over three months. Jared arrives to say they have contacted a group of [[French people|French]] survivors who want to speak to their leader. Quinn tells Jared he is now their leader and dedicates himself to rebuilding.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Quinn Abercromby\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Denton Van Zan\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as Alex Jensen\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Creedy\n* Scott Moutter as Jared Wilke\n* [[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]] as Eddie Stax\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as Ajay\n* [[Ned Dennehy]] as Barlow\n* Rory Keenan as Devon\n* Terence Maynard as Gideon\n* [[Doug Cockle]] as Goosh\n* Randall Carlton as Burke\n* Chris Kelly as Mead\n* Ben Thornton as Young Quinn\n* [[Alice Krige]] as Karen Abercromby\n* [[Jack Gleeson]] as \"Kid\" (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Reign of Fire'' was filmed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland's]] [[Wicklow Mountains]], at the Glendasan Valley Lead Mines. Permission was given on the condition that the area was not damaged and the crew removed all sets once filming was complete. However an [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak#Spread to the rest of Europe|outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe]] stopped many planned scenes from being filmed due to quarantine restrictions.\n\nThe dead dragon was designed and built by [[Artem]], with visual effects by [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Secret Lab|Secret Lab]]. The dragon's digital effects posed a problem for animators: <blockquote>\"In recent years there have been several movies starring creatures with scaled surfaces. Among these are ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Dragonheart]]'', and ''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]''. The surfaces of these creatures have generally been constructed by layering painted textures atop displacement maps.

The film also features [[Izabella Scorupco]] and [[Gerard Butler]].\n\nThe film is set in [[England]] in the year 2020, twenty years after London tunneling project workers inadvertently awakened [[dragon]]s from centuries of slumber and the creatures have subsequently replaced humans as the dominant species on Earth. With the fate of mankind at stake, two surviving parties, led by Quinn Abercromby (Bale) and Denton Van Zan (McConaughey), find that they must work together to hunt down and destroy the beasts in a desperate attempt to take back the world.\n\nThe film was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]] on 12 July 2002. Upon release, it received generally mixed reviews from critics and audiences and became a commercial failure,  grossing $82&nbsp;million on a $60&nbsp;million budget.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\">{{cite web | url= http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=reignoffire.htm | title = Reign of Fire (2002) | publisher= IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate= 2011-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens at an unspecified date in the early 21st century. During construction on the [[London Underground]], workers penetrate a cave. A huge [[European dragon|dragon]] emerges from [[hibernation]], incinerating the workers with its breath. The only survivor is a boy, Quinn Abercromby (Ben Thornton), whose mother, Karen ([[Alice Krige]]) - the construction crew chief - is crushed to death protecting him. The dragon flies out of the Underground, and soon more dragons appear. It is revealed through newspaper clippings and the narration that dragons are the species responsible for the extinction of the [[dinosaur]]s. They are speculated to hibernate after destroying most living creatures until the planet repopulates. Mankind's militaristic resistance, including [[nuclear weapon]]s in 2010, only hastens the destruction, and by 2020, humans are [[Endangered species|nearly extinct]].\n\nQuinn ([[Christian Bale]]) leads a community of survivors at [[Bamburgh Castle]], [[Northumberland]]. They are starving while awaiting harvest. Although most trust Quinn, some are restless and defiant. Eddie ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]) and his group steal a truck to pick tomatoes, though it is too soon for harvest. They are attacked by a dragon. One man is killed and the rest are surrounded by fire. Quinn, Creedy ([[Gerard Butler]]), and Jared (Scott Moutter) rescue them with old fire engines, but the dragon kills Eddie's son before escaping.\n\nThe [[Kentucky]] [[Irregular military|Irregulars]], a group of [[Americans]] led by Denton Van Zan ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), arrive on a [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]] with a [[Chieftain tank]] and [[AgustaWestland AW109]] utility helicopter, the latter of which is piloted by Alex Jensen ([[Izabella Scorupco]]). Van Zan has a system for hunting dragons and knows their weakness: poor vision during [[twilight]]. With Quinn's help, Van Zan, Alex, and their team hunt and slay the dragon who destroyed the crops.\n\nThe survivors enjoy a celebration at the castle that night but Van Zan is embittered by the loss of several of his men. Van Zan and Alex tell Quinn that all the dragons they have found have been female. The Americans believe there is only one male - if they kill it, the dragons can no longer reproduce. Although Quinn knows about the male dragon, which killed his mother, he refuses to help.\n\nIn open defiance, Van Zan orders his soldiers to enlist the castle's best men despite Quinn's argument that if they find the male it will kill them and find the castle the men remain hesitant at Van Zans request. Quinn and in an attempt to stop them taking the castle's men away Quinn attacks Van Zan in-front of the castle's inhabitants and a fight ensues where Van Zan gives Quinn a terrible beating and it's left for the watching crowd to pull Van Zan off before Quinn is beaten to death, Van Zan giving Quinn the beating has an impact on the castle's inhabitants, Van Zan and indeed some of the castle's men then depart with Quinn bloodied and helpless to stop them, But true to Quinn's warnings Van Zan's caravan is attacked by the dragon in the ruins of a town {{convert|66|mi}} from London. The dragon then finds the castle and kills most of the inhabitants. Quinn gets the survivors to a [[bunker]], but they are trapped when the dragon returns; during its final attack, Creedy is killed.\n\nVan Zan and Jensen return and free everyone trapped in the bunker. Quinn decides to help Van Zan and Alex hunt down the male dragon. They fly to London and find hundreds of small dragons, one of which is cannibalized by the larger male. Van Zan plans to shoot explosives down the dragon's throat with a [[crossbow]]. He fires, but the dragon destroys the arrow and eats Van Zan. Quinn and Alex lure the dragon to ground level, where Quinn fires another explosive into the dragon's mouth, killing it.\n\nLater, Quinn and Alex erect a [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]] on a hill overlooking the [[North Sea]]. There has been no dragon sighting for over three months. Jared arrives to say they have contacted a group of [[French people|French]] survivors who want to speak to their leader. Quinn tells Jared he is now their leader and dedicates himself to rebuilding.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Quinn Abercromby\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Denton Van Zan\n* [[Izabella Scorupco]] as Alex Jensen\n* [[Gerard Butler]] as Creedy\n* Scott Moutter as Jared Wilke\n* [[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]] as Eddie Stax\n* [[Alexander Siddig]] as Ajay\n* [[Ned Dennehy]] as Barlow\n* Rory Keenan as Devon\n* Terence Maynard as Gideon\n* [[Doug Cockle]] as Goosh\n* Randall Carlton as Burke\n* Chris Kelly as Mead\n* Ben Thornton as Young Quinn\n* [[Alice Krige]] as Karen Abercromby\n* [[Jack Gleeson]] as \"Kid\" (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n''Reign of Fire'' was filmed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland's]] [[Wicklow Mountains]], at the Glendasan Valley Lead Mines. Permission was given on the condition that the area was not damaged and the crew removed all sets once filming was complete. However an [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak#Spread to the rest of Europe|outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe]] stopped many planned scenes from being filmed due to quarantine restrictions.\n\nThe dead dragon was designed and built by [[Artem]], with visual effects by [[List of animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Secret Lab|Secret Lab]]. The dragon's digital effects posed a problem for animators: <blockquote>\"In recent years there have been several movies starring creatures with scaled surfaces. Among these are ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Dragonheart]]'', and ''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]''. The surfaces of these creatures have generally been constructed by layering painted textures atop displacement maps. This gives the model texture, but the scales stretch and shrink under the movement of the creature, giving a rubbery look that is not realistic.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Petti|first1=Ernest J|last2=Thompson|first2=Thomas V, II|last3=Lusinsky|first3=Adolph|last4=Driskill|first4=Hank|title=Dragon Scales: The Evolution of Scale Tool for ''Reign of Fire''|journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2002 Conference Abstracts and Applications|date=2002|pages=172|doi=10.1145/1242073.1242185|publisher=ACM}}</ref></blockquote> In order to overcome this limitation, the then-groundbreaking work done by digital effects animator Neil Eskuri on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] 2000 release ''[[Dinosaur (film)|Dinosaur]]'' was utilized as a benchmark in order to create a realistic physical simulation of the dragon.
