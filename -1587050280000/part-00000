Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the notoriously reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.\n\nExplaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said, <blockquote>\nThere are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others.

Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.\n\nGaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.\n\nYet the fact that ''The Matrix'' films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [''Mortal Kombat''], is fantastically exciting.|The Wachowskis<ref name=\"IGN\" />}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"3\" | Functioned as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

Her acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances by either of the notoriously reclusive sisters. Lana said that, although she and Lilly had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the previous decade, it was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends. Rather, she stated, the two are generally shy about the news media and prefer to maintain their privacy. Comparing media exposure to losing one's virginity as an irreversible event that only happens once, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye. They feared losing their privacy and the ability to go to public places without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.\n\nExplaining her decision to appear at the HRC event, Lana said, <blockquote>\nThere are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others. If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value.<ref name=\"HRC award speech transcript\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177|title=Lana Wachowski's HRC Visibility Award Acceptance Speech (Transcript)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026232657/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177|archivedate=October 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>\nIn February 2014, Lana received the Freedom Award from [[Equality Illinois]] at their annual gala in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalityillinois.us/2014/01/equality-illinois-honors-chicago-filmmaker-lana-wachowski/|title=EQIL Honors Chicago Filmmaker Lana Wachowski|work=equalityillinois.us|publisher=Equality Illinois|accessdate=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626110854/http://www.equalityillinois.us/2014/01/equality-illinois-honors-chicago-filmmaker-lana-wachowski/|archivedate=June 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Equality Illinois to honor Chicago filmmaker Lana Wachowski |url=http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/52261729 |publisher=GoPride.com |date=January 21, 2014 |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125639/http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/52261729 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"EQIL Award Speech\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqeXgPE03Q|title=Equality Illinois 2014 Gala&nbsp;\u2013 Lana Wachowski Accepts Freedom Award|date=February 21, 2014|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608035432/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqeXgPE03Q|archivedate=June 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Lilly's gender transition ===\nIn March 2016, Lilly Wachowski also came out as a transgender woman, issuing a statement to the ''Windy City Times'' after a visit from a reporter from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper, who had attempted to get an interview with her about it.<ref name=hr20160308 /><ref name=\"var20160308\" /><ref name=\"glaad20160308\" /><ref name=windycitytimes>{{cite news| url =http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html|title= Second Wachowski filmmaker sibling comes out as trans |first=Tracy |last=Baim| work=[[Windy City Times]]| date=March 8, 2016|accessdate=March 9, 2016| archivedate= March 9, 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160309093348/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/09/matrix-director-lilly-wachowski-comes-out-as-a-transgender-woman|title=Film director Lilly Wachowski comes out as transgender woman|last=Davies|first=Caroline|last2=Sweney|first2=Mark|date=2016-03-09|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref> In that article, she said, \"I am one of the lucky ones.

Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.\n\nGaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.\n\nYet the fact that ''The Matrix'' films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and [''Mortal Kombat''], is fantastically exciting.|The Wachowskis<ref name=\"IGN\" />}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"3\" | Functioned as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

For people with diabetes maintaining 'tight diabetes control', the [[American Diabetes Association]] recommends a post-meal glucose level of less than 10&nbsp;mmol/L (180&nbsp;mg/dL) and a fasting plasma glucose of 3.9 to 7.2&nbsp;mmol/L (70\u2013130&nbsp;mg/dL).<ref>{{cite journal | author = American Diabetes Association | title = Standards of medical care in diabetes--2006 | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 29 Suppl 1 | issue = Supplement 1 | pages = S4\u201342 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16373931 | url = http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/suppl_1/s4.full | quote = Standards of Medical Care \u2013 Table 6 and Table 7, Correlation between A1C level and Mean Plasma Glucose Levels on Multiple Testing over 2\u20133 months }}</ref>\n\nThe actual amount of glucose in the blood and body fluids is very small.

It is composed of several interacting systems, of which hormone regulation is the most important.\n\nThere are two types of mutually antagonistic metabolic hormones affecting blood glucose levels:\n* [[catabolic]] hormones (such as [[glucagon]], [[cortisol]] and [[catecholamines]]) which increase blood glucose;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehninger|first1=Albert|last2=Nelson|first2=David|last3=Cox|first3=Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=Lehininger Principles of Biochemistry|date=2017|publisher=W.H.

Glucagon is secreted from alpha cells, while insulin is secreted by beta cells. Together they regulate the blood-glucose levels through negative feedback, a process where the end product of one reaction stimulates the beginning of another reaction. In blood-glucose levels, insulin lowers the concentration of glucose in the blood. The lower blood-glucose level (a product of the insulin secretion) triggers glucagon to be secreted, and repeats the cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard | name-list-format = vanc |title=Principles Anatomy and Physiology|date=December 2016|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781119343738|pages=Chapter 18|edition=15}}</ref>\n\nIn order for blood glucose to be kept stable, modifications to insulin, glucagon, epinephrine and cortisol are made. Each of these hormones has a different responsibility to keep blood glucose regulated; when blood sugar is too high, insulin tells muscles to take up excess glucose for storage. Glucagon responds to too low of a blood glucose level; it informs the tissue to produce more glucose. Epinephrine prepares the muscles and respiratory system for activity in the case of a \"fight and flight\" response. Lastly, cortisol supplies the body with fuel in times of heavy stress.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lehninger|first1=Albert|last2=Nelson|first2=David|last3=Cox|first3=Michael| name-list-format = vanc |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|date=2017|publisher=W.H.Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9781319117689|page=930|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\n==Abnormalities==\n{{see also|Dysglycemia}}\n===High blood sugar===\n{{main|Hyperglycemia}}\n\nIf blood sugar levels remain too high the body suppresses appetite over the short term.

When diabetes is the cause, physicians typically recommend an [[anti-diabetic medication]] as treatment.

Symptoms may include [[lethargy]], impaired mental functioning; [[irritability]]; shaking, twitching, weakness in arm and leg muscles; pale complexion; sweating; [[Unconsciousness|loss of consciousness]].\n\nMechanisms that restore satisfactory blood glucose levels after extreme [[hypoglycemia]] (below 2.2 mmol/L or 40&nbsp;mg/dL) must be quick and effective to prevent extremely serious consequences of insufficient glucose: confusion or unsteadiness and, in the extreme (below 0.8 mmol/L or 15&nbsp;mg/dL)  loss of consciousness and seizures. Without discounting the potentially quite serious conditions and risks due to or oftentimes accompanying hyperglycemia, especially in the long-term (diabetes or pre-diabetes, obesity or overweight, [[hyperlipidemia]], [[hypertension]], etc.), it is still generally more dangerous to have too little glucose \u2013 especially if levels are very low \u2013 in the blood than too much, at least temporarily, because glucose is so important for metabolism and nutrition and the proper functioning of the body's organs. This is especially the case for those organs that are metabolically active or that require a constant, regulated supply of blood sugar (the liver and brain are examples). In healthy individuals, blood glucose-regulating mechanisms are generally quite effective, and symptomatic hypoglycemia is generally found only in diabetics using insulin or other pharmacological treatment, and in starvation or severe malnutrition or malabsorption (of various causes), and conditions such as anorexia{{dubious|date=May 2013}}. Hypoglycemic episodes can vary greatly between persons and from time to time, both in severity and swiftness of onset. For severe cases, prompt medical assistance is essential, as damage to brain and other tissues and even death will result from sufficiently low blood-glucose levels.\n\n==Glucose measurement==\n{{Further| Blood glucose monitoring|Glucose meter}}\n\n===Sample source===\n[[Glucose test]]ing in a fasting individual, show comparable levels of glucose in arterial, venous, and capillary blood.

Historically, blood glucose values were given in terms of whole blood, but most laboratories now measure and report plasma or serum glucose levels.

Alternatively, blood can be drawn from the same arm with an IV line after the IV has been turned off for at least 5 minutes, and the arm has been elevated to drain infused fluids away from the vein. Inattention can lead to large errors, since as little as 10% contamination with a 5% [[glucose]] solution (D5W) will elevate glucose in a sample by 500&nbsp;mg/dL or more. The actual concentration of glucose in blood is very low, even in the hyperglycemic.\n\n===Measurement techniques===\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}\nTwo major methods have been used to measure glucose. The first, still in use in some places, is a chemical method exploiting the nonspecific reducing property of glucose in a reaction with an indicator substance that changes color when reduced. Since other blood compounds also have reducing properties (e.g., urea, which can be abnormally high in uremic patients), this technique can produce erroneous readings in some situations (5\u201315&nbsp;mg/dL has been reported). The more recent technique, using enzymes specific to glucose, is less susceptible to this kind of error. The two most common employed enzymes are glucose oxidase and hexokinase.<ref name=\"W.H. Freeman\">{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Michael M.|last2=Lehninger|first2=Albert L.|last3=Nelson|first3=David L.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|date=2017|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9781319117689|pages=248\u201349}}</ref> Average blood glucose concentrations can also be measured. This method measures the level of [[glycated hemoglobin]], which is representative of the average blood glucose levels over the last, approximately, 120 days.<ref name=\"W.H. Freeman\"/>\n\nIn either case, the chemical system is commonly contained on a test strip which is inserted into a meter, and then has a blood sample applied. Test-strip shapes and their exact chemical composition vary between meter systems and cannot be interchanged. Formerly, some test strips were read (after timing and wiping away the blood sample) by visual comparison against a color chart printed on the vial label. Strips of this type are still used for urine glucose readings, but for blood glucose levels they are obsolete. Their error rates were, in any case, much higher. Errors when using test strips were often caused by the age of the strip or exposure to high temperatures or humidity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ginsberg BH | title = Factors affecting blood glucose monitoring: sources of errors in measurement | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 903\u201313 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 20144340 | pmc = 2769960 | doi = 10.1177/193229680900300438 }}</ref> More precise blood glucose measurements are performed in a [[medical laboratory]], using hexokinase, glucose oxidase, or glucose dehydrogenase enzymes.\n\n[[Urine glucose]] readings, however taken, are much less useful. In properly functioning kidneys, glucose does not appear in urine until the [[renal threshold]] for glucose has been exceeded. This is substantially above any normal glucose level, and is evidence of an existing severe hyperglycemic condition. However, as urine is stored in the bladder, any glucose in it might have been produced at any time since the last time the bladder was emptied. Since metabolic conditions change rapidly, as a result of any of several factors, this is delayed news and gives no warning of a developing condition. Blood glucose monitoring is far preferable, both clinically and for home monitoring by patients. Healthy urine glucose levels were first standardized and published in 1965<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Renschler HE, Weicker H, von Baeyer H | title = [The upper limit of glucose concentration in the urine of healthy subjects] | journal = Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift | volume = 90 | issue = 53 | pages = 2349\u201353 | date = December 1965 | pmid = 5851934 }}</ref> by [[Hans Renschler]].\n\nA noninvasive method of sampling to monitor glucose levels has emerged using an ''exhaled breath condensate''.

Conditions affecting glucose levels are shown in the table below. Abnormalities in these test results are due to problems in the multiple control mechanism of glucose regulation.\n\nThe metabolic response to a carbohydrate challenge is conveniently assessed by a postprandial glucose level drawn 2 hours after a meal or a glucose load. In addition, the glucose tolerance test, consisting of several timed measurements after a standardized amount of oral glucose intake, is used to aid in the diagnosis of [[diabetes]].\n\nError rates for blood glucose measurements systems vary, depending on laboratories, and on the methods used. Colorimetry techniques can be biased by color changes in test strips (from airborne or finger borne contamination, perhaps) or interference (e.g., tinting contaminants) with light source or the light sensor. Electrical techniques are less susceptible to these errors, though not to others. In home use, the most important issue is not accuracy, but trend. Thus if a meter / test strip system is consistently wrong by 10%, there will be little consequence, as long as changes (e.g., due to exercise or medication adjustments) are properly tracked. In the US, home use blood test meters must be approved by the federal [[Food and Drug Administration]] before they can be sold.\n\nFinally, there are several influences on blood glucose level aside from food intake.

Glucagon is secreted from alpha cells, while insulin is secreted by beta cells. Together they regulate the blood-glucose levels through negative feedback, a process where the end product of one reaction stimulates the beginning of another reaction. In blood-glucose levels, insulin lowers the concentration of glucose in the blood. The lower blood-glucose level (a product of the insulin secretion) triggers glucagon to be secreted, and repeats the cycle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tortora|first1=Gerard | name-list-format = vanc |title=Principles Anatomy and Physiology|date=December 2016|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=9781119343738|pages=Chapter 18|edition=15}}</ref>\n\nIn order for blood glucose to be kept stable, modifications to insulin, glucagon, epinephrine and cortisol are made. Each of these hormones has a different responsibility to keep blood glucose regulated; when blood sugar is too high, insulin tells muscles to take up excess glucose for storage. Glucagon responds to too low of a blood glucose level; it informs the tissue to produce more glucose. Epinephrine prepares the muscles and respiratory system for activity in the case of a \"fight and flight\" response.

Without discounting the potentially quite serious conditions and risks due to or oftentimes accompanying hyperglycemia, especially in the long-term (diabetes or pre-diabetes, obesity or overweight, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, etc.), it is still generally more dangerous to have too little glucose \u2013 especially if levels are very low \u2013 in the blood than too much, at least temporarily, because glucose is so important for metabolism and nutrition and the proper functioning of the body's organs. This is especially the case for those organs that are metabolically active or that require a constant, regulated supply of blood sugar (the liver and brain are examples). In healthy individuals, blood glucose-regulating mechanisms are generally quite effective, and symptomatic hypoglycemia is generally found only in diabetics using insulin or other pharmacological treatment, and in starvation or severe malnutrition or malabsorption (of various causes), and conditions such as anorexia{{dubious|date=May 2013}}.

Alternatively, blood can be drawn from the same arm with an IV line after the IV has been turned off for at least 5 minutes, and the arm has been elevated to drain infused fluids away from the vein. Inattention can lead to large errors, since as little as 10% contamination with a 5% [[glucose]] solution (D5W) will elevate glucose in a sample by 500&nbsp;mg/dL or more.

The first, still in use in some places, is a chemical method exploiting the nonspecific reducing property of glucose in a reaction with an indicator substance that changes color when reduced. Since other blood compounds also have reducing properties (e.g., urea, which can be abnormally high in uremic patients), this technique can produce erroneous readings in some situations (5\u201315&nbsp;mg/dL has been reported). The more recent technique, using enzymes specific to glucose, is less susceptible to this kind of error. The two most common employed enzymes are glucose oxidase and hexokinase.<ref name=\"W.H.

This method measures the level of [[glycated hemoglobin]], which is representative of the average blood glucose levels over the last, approximately, 120 days.<ref name=\"W.H. Freeman\"/>\n\nIn either case, the chemical system is commonly contained on a test strip which is inserted into a meter, and then has a blood sample applied. Test-strip shapes and their exact chemical composition vary between meter systems and cannot be interchanged. Formerly, some test strips were read (after timing and wiping away the blood sample) by visual comparison against a color chart printed on the vial label. Strips of this type are still used for urine glucose readings, but for blood glucose levels they are obsolete. Their error rates were, in any case, much higher. Errors when using test strips were often caused by the age of the strip or exposure to high temperatures or humidity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ginsberg BH | title = Factors affecting blood glucose monitoring: sources of errors in measurement | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 903\u201313 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 20144340 | pmc = 2769960 | doi = 10.1177/193229680900300438 }}</ref> More precise blood glucose measurements are performed in a [[medical laboratory]], using hexokinase, glucose oxidase, or glucose dehydrogenase enzymes.\n\n[[Urine glucose]] readings, however taken, are much less useful. In properly functioning kidneys, glucose does not appear in urine until the [[renal threshold]] for glucose has been exceeded. This is substantially above any normal glucose level, and is evidence of an existing severe hyperglycemic condition. However, as urine is stored in the bladder, any glucose in it might have been produced at any time since the last time the bladder was emptied. Since metabolic conditions change rapidly, as a result of any of several factors, this is delayed news and gives no warning of a developing condition. Blood glucose monitoring is far preferable, both clinically and for home monitoring by patients. Healthy urine glucose levels were first standardized and published in 1965<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Renschler HE, Weicker H, von Baeyer H | title = [The upper limit of glucose concentration in the urine of healthy subjects] | journal = Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift | volume = 90 | issue = 53 | pages = 2349\u201353 | date = December 1965 | pmid = 5851934 }}</ref> by [[Hans Renschler]].\n\nA noninvasive method of sampling to monitor glucose levels has emerged using an ''exhaled breath condensate''.

Conditions affecting glucose levels are shown in the table below. Abnormalities in these test results are due to problems in the multiple control mechanism of glucose regulation.\n\nThe metabolic response to a carbohydrate challenge is conveniently assessed by a postprandial glucose level drawn 2 hours after a meal or a glucose load. In addition, the glucose tolerance test, consisting of several timed measurements after a standardized amount of oral glucose intake, is used to aid in the diagnosis of [[diabetes]].\n\nError rates for blood glucose measurements systems vary, depending on laboratories, and on the methods used. Colorimetry techniques can be biased by color changes in test strips (from airborne or finger borne contamination, perhaps) or interference (e.g., tinting contaminants) with light source or the light sensor. Electrical techniques are less susceptible to these errors, though not to others. In home use, the most important issue is not accuracy, but trend. Thus if a meter / test strip system is consistently wrong by 10%, there will be little consequence, as long as changes (e.g., due to exercise or medication adjustments) are properly tracked. In the US, home use blood test meters must be approved by the federal [[Food and Drug Administration]] before they can be sold.\n\nFinally, there are several influences on blood glucose level aside from food intake. Infection, for instance, tends to change blood glucose levels, as does stress either physical or psychological. Exercise, especially if prolonged or long after the most recent meal, will have an effect as well. In the typical person, maintenance of blood glucose at near constant levels will nevertheless be quite effective.{{Clarify|date=August 2010}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ '''Causes of abnormal glucose levels'''\n! style=\"background:#ffdfae;\" | Persistent hyperglycemia\n! style=\"background:#ffdfae;\" | Transient hyperglycemia\n! style=\"background:#ffdfae;\" | Persistent hypoglycemia\n! style=\"background:#ffdfae;\" | Transient hypoglycemia\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:lightblue; color:black;\" | Reference range, [[fasting blood glucose]] (FBG): 70\u2013110&nbsp;mg/dL\n|-\n| Diabetes mellitus\n| [[Pheochromocytoma]]\n| [[Insulinoma]]\n| Acute alcohol ingestion\n|-\n| Adrenal cortical hyperactivity [[Cushing's syndrome]]\n| Severe [[liver disease]]\n| Adrenal cortical insufficiency [[Addison's disease]]\n| Drugs: [[salicylates]], antituberculosis agents\n|-\n| [[Hyperthyroidism]]\n| [[Stress hyperglycemia|Acute stress reaction]]\n| [[Hypopituitarism]]\n| Severe liver disease\n|-\n| [[Acromegaly]]\n| [[Shock (circulatory)|Shock]]\n| [[Galactosemia]]\n| Several [[glycogen storage diseases]]\n|-\n| [[Obesity]]\n| [[Convulsions]]\n| Ectopic insulin production from tumors\n| Hereditary fructose intolerance\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Blood glucose monitoring]]\n* [[Boronic acid#Boronic acids in supramolecular chemistry|Saccharide recognition by boronic acids]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |first=John Bernard |last=Henry | name-list-format = vanc |title=Clinical diagnosis and Management by Laboratory Methods |edition=20th |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2001 |isbn=978-0721688640 }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Levine R | title = Monosaccharides in health and disease | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 211\u201324 | year = 1986 | pmid =  3524617| doi = 10.1146/annurev.nu.06.070186.001235 }}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = R\u00f6der PV, Wu B, Liu Y, Han W | title = Pancreatic regulation of glucose homeostasis | journal = Experimental & Molecular Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 3, March | pages = e219 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26964835 | pmc = 4892884 | doi = 10.1038/emm.2016.6 }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscatinline}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121113144108/http://www.acb.org.uk/docs/NHLM/Glucose.pdf Glucose (blood, serum, plasma): analyte monograph] \u2013 The Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine\n\n{{Human homeostasis}}\n{{Blood tests}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood Sugar}}\n[[Category:Human homeostasis]]\n[[Category:Blood tests]]\n[[Category:Diabetes]]\n", "name_user": "OlliverWithDoubleL", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_level"}
