In 1978, the first female recruits entered basic training at Fort Dix. In 1991, Dix trained [[Kuwait]]i civilians in basic military skills so they could take part in their country's liberation.<ref name=\"Dix\"/>\n\nDix ended its active Army training mission in 1991 due to [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] recommendations, which ended its command by a two-star general. Presently, it serves as a joint training site for all military components and all services.\n\nIn 2009 Fort Dix, and the adjacent Air Force and Naval facilities were consolidated into a single secure facility, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  The supporting component is the [[United States Air Force]], and base operations are executed by the [[87th Air Base Wing]] (87 ABW). The 87 ABW provides installation management to all of JBMDL while both the Navy and Army retain command and control of their mission, personnel, equipment and component-specific services. Neither the Navy nor the Army bases are subordinate to the Joint Base; each are simply supported by the joint base in base operations such as utilities, child care centers, gyms, and other services, but each report through their own service-specific command chains and have their own commanders (the Navy a Captain and the Army a Colonel).

Between the World Wars, Camp Dix was a reception, training and discharge center for the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Camp Dix became Fort Dix on March 8, 1939, and the installation became a permanent Army post. During and after [[World War II]] the fort served the same purpose as in the first World War. It served as a training and staging ground during the war and a demobilization center after the war.\n\nOn July 15, 1947, Fort Dix became a [[Recruit training|basic training]] center and the home of the [[U.S. 9th Infantry Division|9th Infantry Division]]. In 1954, the 9th moved out and the 69th Infantry Division made the fort home until it was deactivated on March 16, 1956. During the [[Vietnam War]] rapid expansion took place. A mock [[Vietnam]] village was constructed and soldiers received Vietnam-specific training before being deployed. Since Vietnam, Fort Dix has sent soldiers to Operation [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]], [[Desert Storm]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].\n\n===U.S. Coast Guard site===\nThe [[Atlantic Strike Team]] (AST) of the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] is based at Fort Dix.

The [[USAF]] moved the Security Police Air Base Ground Defence school from [[Camp Bullis]], Texas, to Dix in fall 1987. It was eventually realized that it was not cost effective to put 50\u2013100 S.P. trainees on a commercial flight from San Antonio, Texas, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, every couple of weeks, so the school was later moved back to Camp Bullis, Texas.\n\nFort Dix was an early casualty of the first [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process in the early 1990s, after having lost it traditional basic-training mission. But Fort Dix advocates attracted Army Reserve interest in keeping the {{convert|31000|acre|ha|adj=on}} post as a training reservation. With the reserves, and millions of dollars for improvements, Fort Dix has grown again to employ 3,000. As many as 15,000 troops train there on weekends, and the post has been a major mobilization point for reserve and National Guard troops since the [[September 11 attacks]] on [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nFort Dix has completed its realignment from an individual training center to a [[United States Army Forces Command|FORSCOM]] Power Projection Platform for the Northeastern United States under the command and control of the Army's Installation Management Command. Primary missions include training and providing regional base operations support to on-post and off-post active component and U.S Army Reserve units, soldiers, families and retirees. Fort Dix supported more than 1.1 million man-days of training in 1998. A daily average of more than 13,500 persons live or work within the garrison and its tenant organizations. [[Fort Devens|Devens Reserve Force Training Area, MA]] is a sub-installation of the ASA.\n\n===2005 realignments===\n{{main|Base Realignment and Closure, 2005}}\nIn 2005, the [[United States Department of Defense]] announced that Fort Dix would be affected by a [[Base Realignment and Closure]]. For base operations support, it became part of [[Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst]], N.J. It was the first base of its kind in the United States and is the Department of Defense's only tri-service joint base.

In 1978, the first female recruits entered basic training at Fort Dix. In 1991, Dix trained [[Kuwait]]i civilians in basic military skills so they could take part in their country's liberation.<ref name=\"Dix\"/>\n\nDix ended its active Army training mission in 1991 due to [[Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] recommendations, which ended its command by a two-star general. Presently, it serves as a joint training site for all military components and all services.\n\nIn 2009 Fort Dix, and the adjacent Air Force and Naval facilities were consolidated into a single secure facility, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.  The supporting component is the [[United States Air Force]], and base operations are executed by the [[87th Air Base Wing]] (87 ABW). The 87 ABW provides installation management to all of JBMDL while both the Navy and Army retain command and control of their mission, personnel, equipment and component-specific services. Neither the Navy nor the Army bases are subordinate to the Joint Base; each are simply supported by the joint base in base operations such as utilities, child care centers, gyms, and other services, but each report through their own service-specific command chains and have their own commanders (the Navy a Captain and the Army a Colonel).

Between the World Wars, Camp Dix was a reception, training and discharge center for the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. Camp Dix became Fort Dix on March 8, 1939, and the installation became a permanent Army post. During and after [[World War II]] the fort served the same purpose as in the first World War. It served as a training and staging ground during the war and a demobilization center after the war.\n\nOn July 15, 1947, Fort Dix became a [[Recruit training|basic training]] center and the home of the [[U.S. 9th Infantry Division|9th Infantry Division]]. In 1954, the 9th moved out and the 69th Infantry Division made the fort home until it was deactivated on March 16, 1956. During the [[Vietnam War]] rapid expansion took place. A mock [[Vietnam]] village was constructed and soldiers received Vietnam-specific training before being deployed. Since Vietnam, Fort Dix has sent soldiers to Operation [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]], [[Desert Storm]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]].\n\n===U.S. Coast Guard site===\nThe [[Atlantic Strike Team]] (AST) of the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] is based at Fort Dix.

The [[USAF]] moved the Security Police Air Base Ground Defence school from [[Camp Bullis]], Texas, to Dix in fall 1987. It was eventually realized that it was not cost effective to put 50\u2013100 S.P. trainees on a commercial flight from San Antonio, Texas, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, every couple of weeks, so the school was later moved back to Camp Bullis, Texas.\n\nFort Dix was an early casualty of the first [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process in the early 1990s, after having lost it traditional basic-training mission. But Fort Dix advocates attracted Army Reserve interest in keeping the {{convert|31000|acre|ha|adj=on}} post as a training reservation. With the reserves, and millions of dollars for improvements, Fort Dix has grown again to employ 3,000. As many as 15,000 troops train there on weekends, and the post has been a major mobilization point for reserve and National Guard troops since the [[September 11 attacks]] on [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nFort Dix has completed its realignment from an individual training center to a [[United States Army Forces Command|FORSCOM]] Power Projection Platform for the Northeastern United States under the command and control of the Army's Installation Management Command. Primary missions include training and providing regional base operations support to on-post and off-post active component and U.S Army Reserve units, soldiers, families and retirees. Fort Dix supported more than 1.1 million man-days of training in 1998. A daily average of more than 13,500 persons live or work within the garrison and its tenant organizations. [[Fort Devens|Devens Reserve Force Training Area, MA]] is a sub-installation of the ASA.\n\n===2005 realignments===\n{{main|Base Realignment and Closure, 2005}}\nIn 2005, the [[United States Department of Defense]] announced that Fort Dix would be affected by a [[Base Realignment and Closure]]. For base operations support, it became part of [[Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst]], N.J. It was the first base of its kind in the United States and is the Department of Defense's only tri-service joint base.

The \"preto\" prefix of the compound's name honors Pretoria, South Africa, the home of a TB Alliance clinical development office where much of the drug's development took place. The \"manid\" suffix is used to group compounds with similar chemical structures.  This class of drug is variously referred to as [[nitroimidazole]]s, nitroimidazooxazines or nitroimidazopyrans.  Development of this compound was initiated because of the urgent need for new antibacterial drugs effective against resistant strains of tuberculosis. Also, current anti-TB drugs are mainly effective against replicating and metabolically active bacteria, creating a need for drugs effective against persisting or latent bacterial infections as often occur in patients with tuberculosis.<ref name=\"Lenaerts_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenaerts AJ, Gruppo V, Marietta KS, Johnson CM, Driscoll DK, Tompkins NM, Rose JD, Reynolds RC, Orme IM | title = Preclinical testing of the nitroimidazopyran PA-824 for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a series of in vitro and in vivo models | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 2294\u2013301 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15917524 | pmc = 1140539 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.49.6.2294-2301.2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Discovery and pre-clinical development===\nPretomanid was first identified in 2000 in a series of 100 nitroimidazopyran derivatives synthesized and tested for antitubercular activity, by PathoGenesis (now a subsidiary of Novartis).<ref name=\"Stover2000\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stover CK, Warrener P, VanDevanter DR, Sherman DR, Arain TM, Langhorne MH, Anderson SW, Towell JA, Yuan Y, McMurray DN, Kreiswirth BN, Barry CE, Baker WR | journal = Nature | year = 2000 | volume = 405 | issue = 6789 | pages = 962\u20136 |\ntitle = A small-molecule nitroimidazopyran drug candidate for the treatment of tuberculosis. | doi = 10.1038/35016103 | pmid = 10879539 | bibcode = 2000Natur.405..962S }}</ref> Importantly, pretomanid has activity against static ''M. tuberculosis'' isolates that survive under anaerobic conditions, with bactericidal activity comparable to that of the existing drug [[metronidazole]].

|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref>  Pretomanid is referred to as \"Pa\" in regimen abbreviations, such as BPaL. The \"preto\" prefix of the compound's name honors Pretoria, South Africa, the home of a TB Alliance clinical development office where much of the drug's development took place. The \"manid\" suffix is used to group compounds with similar chemical structures.  This class of drug is variously referred to as [[nitroimidazole]]s, nitroimidazooxazines or nitroimidazopyrans.  Development of this compound was initiated because of the urgent need for new antibacterial drugs effective against resistant strains of tuberculosis. Also, current anti-TB drugs are mainly effective against replicating and metabolically active bacteria, creating a need for drugs effective against persisting or latent bacterial infections as often occur in patients with tuberculosis.<ref name=\"Lenaerts_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lenaerts AJ, Gruppo V, Marietta KS, Johnson CM, Driscoll DK, Tompkins NM, Rose JD, Reynolds RC, Orme IM | title = Preclinical testing of the nitroimidazopyran PA-824 for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a series of in vitro and in vivo models | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 2294\u2013301 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15917524 | pmc = 1140539 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.49.6.2294-2301.2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Discovery and pre-clinical development===\nPretomanid was first identified in 2000 in a series of 100 nitroimidazopyran derivatives synthesized and tested for antitubercular activity, by PathoGenesis (now a subsidiary of Novartis).<ref name=\"Stover2000\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stover CK, Warrener P, VanDevanter DR, Sherman DR, Arain TM, Langhorne MH, Anderson SW, Towell JA, Yuan Y, McMurray DN, Kreiswirth BN, Barry CE, Baker WR | journal = Nature | year = 2000 | volume = 405 | issue = 6789 | pages = 962\u20136 |\ntitle = A small-molecule nitroimidazopyran drug candidate for the treatment of tuberculosis. | doi = 10.1038/35016103 | pmid = 10879539 | bibcode = 2000Natur.405..962S }}</ref> Importantly, pretomanid has activity against static ''M. tuberculosis'' isolates that survive under anaerobic conditions, with bactericidal activity comparable to that of the existing drug [[metronidazole]].

These works explored [[chronology]], [[alchemy]], and [[Biblical hermeneutics|Biblical interpretation]] (especially of the [[Apocalypse]]). Newton's scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, some historians, including economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], believe that any reference to a \"Newtonian Worldview\" as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.<ref>Keynes, J.M., 'Newton, The Man'; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15\u201319 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947)</ref> Historical research on Newton's occult studies in relation to his science have also been used to challenge the [[disenchantment]] narrative within [[critical theory]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | pages = 43 and Chapter 2, ''passim'' |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing and studying Newton's alchemical works, Keynes, for example, opined in 1942 at the [[tercentenary]] of his birth that \"Newton was not the first of the [[age of reason]], he was the last of the [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]].\" In the [[Early Modern Period]] of Newton's lifetime, the educated embraced a [[world view]] different from that of later centuries. Distinctions between science, [[superstition]], and [[pseudoscience]] were still being formulated, and a devoutly Christian biblical perspective permeated Western culture.\n\n==Alchemical research==\nMuch of what are known as Isaac Newton's [[occult]] studies can largely be attributed to his study of [[alchemy]].<ref>\"Newton's manuscripts provide evidence that he gave considerable thought to alchemy as emblematic of a purely scientific explanation of nature and was in fact deeply involved in conceiving alchemy as spiritual.\" F. Calian, \"Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy\" in ''Annual of Medieval Studies'' at CEU (2010), 186.</ref> From a young age, Newton was deeply interested in all forms of [[natural sciences]] and [[materials science]], an interest which would ultimately lead to some of his better-known contributions to science. His earliest encounters with certain alchemical theories and practices were during his childhood, when a twelve year old Isaac Newton was boarding in the attic of an apothecaries shop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Isaac the Alchemist: Secrets of Isaac Newton|last=Losure|first=Mary|publisher=Candlewick Press|year=2017|isbn=9780763670634|location=Somerville, MA|pages=}}</ref> During Newton's lifetime, the study of [[chemistry]] was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language and vague terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism.<ref>\"his alchemy cannot be seen solely in connection with his chemical experiments but was also a link between his religious beliefs and his scientific aims\".

Bernard Cohen and George Edwin Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 375.</ref> It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of [[stoichiometry]] under the pioneering works of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, [[Robert Boyle]], had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not use.\n\nMuch of Newton's writing on alchemy may have been lost in a fire in his laboratory, so the true extent of his work in this area may have been larger than is currently known. Newton also suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during his period of alchemical work, possibly due to some form of chemical poisoning (perhaps from [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, or some other substance).<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\n[[File:Isaac Newton laboratory fire.jpg|thumb|left|An 1874 engraving showing a probably apocryphal account of Newton's lab fire.

[[English crown|The English Crown]], also fearing the potential devaluation of gold because of the creation of fake gold, made penalties for alchemy very severe. In some cases the punishment for unsanctioned alchemy would include the public hanging of an offender on a gilded scaffold while adorned with tinsel and other unspecified items.<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\nHe needed to be discreet about alchemy since: alchemy was a vector of heretical ideas and mobs were lynching heretics; alchemy provided technical knowledge about counterfeiting money. So, alchemy was considered dangerous.<ref>''Newton: The Dark Heretic'', BBC, 2003.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the question of the nature and degree of influence of alchemy on Newton\u2019s main works, \u201c[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]\u201d and \u201cOptics\u201d has been actively discussed. At present, the understanding that there is a connection between the alchemical and natural science views of Newton has become generally accepted. Some historians of science express an opinion on the decisive nature of the influence of alchemy, occultism and hermetism on the theory of forces and gravity. A discussion of Newton's alchemical studies had a significant impact on the understanding of the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n==Writings==\nDue to the threat of punishment and the potential scrutiny he feared from his peers within the scientific community, Newton may have deliberately left his work on alchemical subjects unpublished. Newton was well known as being highly sensitive to criticism, such as the numerous instances when he was criticized by [[Robert Hooke]], and his admitted reluctance to publish any substantial information regarding [[calculus]] before 1693. A perfectionist by nature, Newton also refrained from publication of material that he felt was incomplete, as evident from a 38-year gap from Newton's conception of calculus in 1666 and its final full publication in 1704, which would ultimately lead to the infamous [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy]].\n\nMost of the scientist\u2019s manuscript heritage after his death passed to [[John Conduitt]], the husband of his niece [[Catherine Barton|Catherine]]<ref>For more information on Newton\u2019s archive, see ''Iliffe, 1998''{{sfn|Iliffe|1998|pp=137\u2014158}}.</ref>. To evaluate the manuscripts, physician Thomas Pellet was involved, who decided that only \u201c[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended|the Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms]]\u201d, an unreleased fragment of \u201c[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]\u201d, \"Obsevations upon the Prophesies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John\" and \"Paradoxical Questions Concerning the Morals and Actions of Athanasius and His Followers\" were suitable for publication. The remaining manuscripts, according to Pellet, were \"foul draughts of the Prophetic stile\" and were not suitable for publication. After the death of J. Conduitt in 1737, manuscripts were transferred to Catherine, who unsuccessfully tried to publish theological notes of her uncle. She consulted with Newton's friend, the theologian [[Arthur Ashley Sykes]] (1684\u20141756). Sykes kept 11 manuscripts for himself, and the rest of the archive passed into the family of Catherine's daughter, who married the [[John Wallop, Viscount Lymington]], and was then owned by the [[Earl of Portsmouth|Earls of Portsmouth]]. Sykes' documents after his death came to the Rev. [[Jeffery Ekins]] (d. 1791) and were kept in the family of the latter until they were presented to the [[New College, Oxford]] in 1872{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432|1999|pp=7\u20148}}. Until the mid-19th century, few had access to the Portsmouth collection, including David Brewster, a renowned physicist and biographer of Newton. In 1872, the fifth Earl of Portsmouth transferred part of the manuscripts (mainly of a physical and mathematical nature) to [[Cambridge University]].\n\nIn 1936, a collection of Isaac Newton's unpublished works were auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] on behalf of [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth]]. Known as the \"Portsmouth Papers\", this material consisted of 329 lots of Newton's manuscripts, over a third of which were filled with content that appeared to be alchemical in nature. At the time of Newton's death this material was considered \"unfit to publish\" by Newton's estate, and consequently fell into obscurity until their somewhat sensational reemergence in 1936.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newman\n |first       = William R.\n |title       = Newton and Alchemy\n |publisher   = The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |accessdate  = 12 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807181322/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |archivedate = 7 August 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAt the auction many of these documents, along with Newton's [[death mask]], were purchased by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who throughout his life collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.<ref name=\"Gleick2004\">{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|authorlink=James Gleick|title=Isaac Newton|url={{Google books|t2-KDQAAQBAJ|page=188|plainurl=yes}}|year=2004|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3295-2|page=188}}</ref> Much of the Keynes collection later passed to eccentric document collector [[Abraham Yahuda]], who was himself a vigorous collector of Isaac Newton's original manuscripts.\n\nMany of the documents collected by Keynes and Yahuda are now in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|reason=Newton Project says King's College|date=December 2016}} In recent years, several projects have begun to gather, catalogue, and transcribe the fragmented collection of Newton's work on alchemical subjects and make them freely available for on-line access.

Most notably are documents entitled ''Artephius his secret Book'', followed by ''The Epistle of Iohn Pontanus, wherein he beareth witness of ye book of Artephius''; these are themselves a collection of excerpts from another work entitled ''Nicholas Flammel, His Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures'' which he caused to be painted upon an Arch in St Innocents Church-yard in Paris. Together with ''The secret Booke of Artephius, And the Epistle of Iohn Pontanus: Containing both the Theoricke and the Practicke of the Philosophers Stone''. This work may also have been referenced by Newton in its Latin version found within [[Lazarus Zetzner]]'s ''[[Theatrum Chemicum]]'', a volume often associated with the ''[[Turba Philosophorum]]'' and other early European alchemical manuscripts. [[Nicolas Flamel]], one subject of the aforementioned work, was a notable, though mysterious figure, often associated with the discovery of the philosopher's stone, hieroglyphical figures, early forms of [[tarot]], and occultism. [[Artephius]], and his \"secret book\", were also subjects of interest to 17th-century alchemists.\n\nAlso in the 1936 auction of Newton's collection was ''The Epitome of the treasure of health written by Edwardus Generosus Anglicus innominatus who lived Anno Domini 1562''. This is a twenty-eight-page treatise on the philosopher's stone, the Animal or [[Angelicall Stone]], the Prospective stone or magical stone of Moses, and the vegetable or the growing stone.  The treatise concludes with an alchemical poem.\n\n===== The Principia =====\nMany of the discoveries and mathematical formula found within Newton's ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' can be linked, often very directly, to his occult and alchemical studies.  Much of his research into the movement of heavenly bodies was influenced by his belief that there are invisible, occult forces at work in the orbits of celestial bodies. Other natural philosophers, most notably Descartes, tended to object to this notion and insisted instead that action depended on physical contact, proposing that celestial objects were moved about by a great many small particles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Newton: The Making of a Genius|last=Fara|first=Patricia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780231128063|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/newtonmakingofge00fara}}</ref>\n\nThe second book of the Principia has not withstood the test of time.\u00a0Much of the work within this volume revolved around measuring air resistance on the motion of pendulums and spheres.\u00a0 Some believe that the main corpus of this work was ultimately an effort to refute Descartes\u2019s Cartesian theory of Vortices, according to which, planetary motion was produced by whirling fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space. This motion supposedly carried the planets with them.\u00a0 As a spiritual man, and as an alchemist, Newton was determined that the motion of heavenly bodies was motivated by invisible forces, that natural phenomena were motivated by forces spiritual, not merely physical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton|last=Westfall|first=R.S.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0521274357|location=UK|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/neveratrestbiogr00west}}</ref>\n\n===== \"The Key\" a.k.a ''Newton's Clavis'' =====\nA fragmentary alchemical text which, in 1975, became \"generally accepted as\" to be penned by Newton.  Its authorship was immediately questioned by Karin Figala, and in 1988 William Newman conclusively proved it to be a composition by George Starkey; this fact has been repeated in a dozen publications since, and no scholar now thinks the \"Key\" is Newton's.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=P.H.|date=2005|title=The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton|url=|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|volume=Vol.38(iss.138).|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n===== Other works =====\nWilliam Newman, a leading scholar of the history of science, has collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.\n\nNewton's various surviving alchemical notebooks clearly show that he made no distinctions between alchemy and what we today consider science. The very same pages in which we find the recordings of his legendary optics experiments we also find various recipes culled from arcane sources. \"Alongside sober explanations of optical and physical phenomena such as freezing and boiling,\" Newman says, \"we find 'Neptune's Trident', 'Mercury's Caducean Rod' and the 'Green Lion', all symbolising alchemical substances.\"\n\nDetermining that many of Newton's acclaimed scientific discoveries were influenced by his research of the occult and obscure has not been the simplest of tasks.  Newton did not always record his chemical experiments in the most transparent way. Alchemists were notorious for veiling their writings in impenetrable jargon, and Newton made matters even worse by inventing symbols and systems of his own. That is part of the reason why, despite Newton's reputation, many of his manuscripts have still not been properly edited and interpreted. \"They are in a state of considerable disorder,\" Newman says.\n\nEven where the text can be deciphered this only gets you so far. \"Although we can make educated guesses about his chymical work from reading,\" Newman says, \"there are often too many variables in chemical research to make it possible to predict an exact outcome from Newton's notes.\" So Newman and his colleagues set out to repeat the experiments Newton described - using exactly the same conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|date=2006|title=Newtons Curse|url=|journal=New Scientist|volume=Vol.190(iss.2546)|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n== Biblical studies ==\nIn a manuscript from 1704, Newton describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible and estimates that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this, he said, \"This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail.\"<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Papers Show Isaac Newton's Religious Side, Predict Date of Apocalypse \n |work=The Christian Post \n |date=19 June 2007 \n |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton%27s_Religious_Side%2C_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm \n |accessdate=28 May 2018 \n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070629231937/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton's_Religious_Side,_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm \n |archivedate=29 June 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Newton's studies of the Temple of Solomon ===\n[[File:Isaac Newton's Temple of Solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Isaac Newton's diagram of part of the [[Temple of Solomon]], taken from Plate 1 of [[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]] (published London, 1728)]]\nNewton extensively studied and wrote about the [[Temple of Solomon]], dedicating an entire chapter of ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' to his observations of the temple.

He believed that many ancient sources were endowed with sacred wisdom<ref name=\"Nova\" /> and that the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of many of their temples were in themselves sacred. This belief would lead Newton to examine many architectural works of Hellenistic [[ancient Greece|Greece]], as well as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources such as [[Vitruvius]], in a search for their occult knowledge.

He believed that these men had hidden their knowledge in a complex code of symbolic and mathematical language that, when deciphered, would reveal an unknown knowledge of how nature works.<ref name=\"Christianson\" />\n\nIn 1675 Newton annotated a copy of ''Manna \u2013 a disquisition of the nature of alchemy'', an anonymous treatise which had been given to him by his fellow scholar [[Ezekiel Foxcroft]]. In his annotation Newton reflected upon his reasons for examining Solomon's Temple by writing:\n\n{{quote|This philosophy, both speculative and active, is not only to be found in the volume of nature, but also in the sacred scriptures, as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Job|Job]], Psalms, Isaiah and others.

In 1628, [[Judah Leon Templo]] produced a model of the temple and surrounding Jerusalem, which was popular in its day. Around 1692, Gerhard Schott produced a highly detailed model of the temple for use in an opera in Hamburg composed by Christian Heinrich Postel. This immense {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-around}} model was later sold in 1725 and was exhibited in London as early as 1723, and then later temporarily installed at the London [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] from 1729 to 1730, where it could be viewed for [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]].

In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.\n\nIn addition, Newton would spend much of his life seeking and revealing what could be considered a [[Bible Code]]. He placed a great deal of emphasis upon the interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], writing generously upon this book and authoring several manuscripts detailing his interpretations. Unlike a [[prophet]] in the true sense of the word, Newton relied upon existing Scripture to prophesy for him, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be \"so little understood\".<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newton\n |first       = Isaac\n |title       = The First Book Concerning the Language of the Prophets\n |publisher   = The Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |accessdate  = 15 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210637/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |archivedate = 8 November 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' would be published, and although it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to be just one popular misunderstanding of Scripture.\n\nAlthough Newton's approach to these studies could not be considered a scientific approach, he did write as if his findings were the result of evidence-based research.\n\n=== 2060 ===\nIn late February and early March 2003, a large amount of media attention circulated around the globe regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, indicating that he believed the world would end no earlier than 2060.

Furthermore, he at no time provides a specific date for the end of the world in either of these documents.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n\nTo understand the reasoning behind the 2060 prediction, an understanding of Newton's theological beliefs should be taken into account, particularly his apparent [[antitrinitarian]] beliefs and his Protestant views on the [[Papacy]].

And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of lived [sic for \"long lived\"] kingdoms, the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end A.C. 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner. This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fancifull men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, & by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. Christ comes as a thief in the night, & it is not for us to know the times & seasons wch God hath put into his own breast.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />}}\n\nClearly Newton's mathematical prediction of the end of the world is one derived from his interpretation of not only scripture, but also one based upon his theological viewpoint regarding specific chronological dates and events as he saw them.\n\nNewton may not have been referring to the post 2060 event as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the globe and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world, as he saw it, was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian and [[Islamic theology]] this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.  In a separate manuscript,<ref>Yahuda MS 7.2a, f. 31r</ref> Isaac Newton paraphrases Revelation 21 and 22 and relates the post 2060 events by writing:\n{{quote|A new heaven & new earth. New Jerusalem comes down from heaven prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband. The marriage supper. God dwells with men wipes away all tears from their eyes, gives them of ye fountain of living water & creates all thin things new saying, It is done. The glory & felicity of the New Jerusalem is represented by a building of Gold & Gemms enlightened by the glory of God & ye [[Lamb of God|Lamb]] & watered by ye river of Paradise on ye banks of which grows the [[tree of life#Hebrew Bible/Christianity|tree of life]]. Into this city the kings of the earth do bring their glory & that of the nations & the saints reign for ever & ever.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n}}\n\n=== 2016 ===\nFor Newton's view of 2016 according to his contemporaries, see [[Religious views of Isaac Newton]]\n\n== Newton's chronology ==\nIsaac Newton wrote extensively upon the historical topic of [[chronology]]. In 1728 ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'', an approximately 87,000-word composition that details the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms was published. The publication date of this work occurred after his death, although the majority of it had been reviewed for publication by Newton himself shortly before he died. As such, this work represents one of his last known personally reviewed publications. Sometime around 1701 he also produced a thirty page unpublished treatise entitled \"The Original of Monarchies\" detailing the rise of several monarchs throughout antiquity and tracing them back to the biblical figure of [[Noah]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Isaac | title = The Original of Monarchies | url = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | accessdate = 19 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210642/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | archivedate = 8 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nNewton's chronological writing is [[Eurocentric]], with the earliest records focusing upon [[Greece]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Levant]]. Many of Newton's dates do not correlate with current historical knowledge. While Newton mentions several pre-historical events found within the Bible, the oldest actual historical date he provides is 1125 BC. In this entry he mentions [[Mephres]], a ruler over [[Upper Egypt]] from the territories of Syene to [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and his successor [[Misphragmuthosis]]. However, during 1125 BC the Pharaoh of Egypt is now understood to be [[Ramesses IX]].\n\nAlthough some of the dates Newton provides for various events are accurate by 17th century standards, [[archaeology]] as a form of modern science did not exist in Newton's time. In fact, the majority of the conclusionary dates which Newton cites are based on the works of [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Plutarch]], [[Homer]], and various other classical historians, authors, and poets; themselves often citing secondary sources and oral records of uncertain date. Newton's approach to chronology was focused upon gathering historical information from various sources found throughout antiquity and cataloguing them according to their appropriate date by his contemporary understanding, standards, and available source material.\n\n=== Newton's Atlantis ===\nFound within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', are several passages that directly mention the land of [[Atlantis]]. The first such passage is part of his ''Short Chronicle'' which indicates his belief that Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] left the island of [[Ogygia]] in 896 BC. In [[Greek mythology]], Ogygia was home to [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], the daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (after whom Atlantis was named). Some scholars have suggested that Ogygia and Atlantis are locationally connected, or possibly the same island. From his writings it appears Newton may have shared this belief. Newton also lists Cadis or Cales as possible candidates for Ogygia, though does not cite his reasons for believing so.\n\n== Newton and secret societies ==\nIsaac Newton has often been associated with various [[secret societies]] and [[fraternal orders]] throughout history.  Due to the secretive nature of such organizations, lack of supportive publicized material, and dubious motives for claiming Newton's participation in these groups, it is difficult to establish his actual membership in any specific organization.<ref name=\"NEWTONSFREEMASONRY\">{{Cite book | last =Bauer | first =Alain | publicationdate =2007 | title = Isaac Newton's Freemasonary: The Alchemy of Science and Mysticism | location = Originally published as: Aux origines de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie: Newton et les Newtoniens by Editions Dervy (2003)| publisher =Inner Traditions | pages =Book Excerpt \u2013 from Chapter 3 | isbn =978-1-59477-172-9 | doi = | oclc = | url =http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/book_bauer.html | accessdate =25 June 2008 | nopp =true | date =2007 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref>\nIn particular, Isaac Newton is believed to have been a 33-degree [[Scottish Rite]] Freemason since he was one of the 1717 founders of the [[Ancient Grand Lodge of England|Lodge of England]],<ref>{{cite web | first1= F. | last1 = Millikan | url = http://freemasoninformation.com/tag/isaac-newton | title = Dr. Bro.

It is unclear if these associations were a result of his being a well established and prominently publicized scholar, an early member and sitting [[President of the Royal Society]] (1703\u20131727), a prominent figure of State and [[Master of the Mint]], a recognized [[Knight]], or if Newton actually sought active membership within these esoteric organizations himself.  Considering the nature and legality of alchemical practices during his lifetime, as well as his possession of various materials and manuscripts pertaining to alchemical research, Newton may very well have been a member of a group of like minded thinkers and colleagues. The organized level of this group (if in fact any existed), the level of their secrecy, as well as the depth of Newton's involvement within them, remains unclear.\n\nAlthough Newton was largely considered a reclusive personality and not prone to socializing, during his lifetime being a member of \"Societies\" or \"Clubs\" was a very popular form of interpersonal networking. Considering his esteemed social status, it is probable that Newton would have had a least some contact with such groups at various levels. He was most certainly a member of [[The Royal Society]] of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge and the [[Spalding Gentlemen's Society]],<ref name=\"Stukeley\">{{cite book|last=Stukeley|first=William|authorlink=William Stukeley|editor=Rob Iliffe |editor2=Scott Mandelbrote |title=Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's life|origyear= 1752 |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|edition=transcript|date=2010|publisher=The Newton Project|location=University of Sussex|type=AHRC Newton Papers Project, Ms. 142, The Royal Society Library, London}}</ref><ref name=\"SPALDING\">{{cite web | title =Spalding Gentlemen's Society | url =http://www.spalding-gentlemens-society.org | accessdate =25 June 2008 }}</ref> however, these are considered [[learned societies]], not [[secret societies|esoteric societies]]. Newton's membership status within any particular secret society remains verifiably allusive and largely speculative, however, it still lends itself to popular sensationalism.\n\n=== Newton and the Rosicrucians ===\nPerhaps the movement which most influenced Isaac Newton was [[Rosicrucianism]].<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\">{{Cite book | last =White | first =Michael| publicationdate = | date =1999 | title =Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer | publisher =Da Capo Press | page =117 | isbn =978-0-7382-0143-6 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C | accessdate =25 June 2008 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> Although the Rosicrucian movement had caused a great deal of excitement within Europe's scholarly community during the early seventeenth century, by the time Newton had reached maturity the movement had become less sensationalized. However, the Rosicrucian movement still would have a profound influence upon Newton, particularly in regard to his alchemical work and philosophical thought.\n\nThe Rosicrucian belief in being specially chosen for the ability to communicate with angels or spirits is echoed in Newton's prophetic beliefs. Additionally, the Rosicrucians proclaimed to have the ability to live forever through the use of the ''[[Elixir of Life|elixir vitae]]'' and the ability to produce limitless amounts of time and gold from the use of the [[philosopher's stone]], which they claimed to have in their possession. Like Newton, the Rosicrucians were deeply religious, avowedly Christian, anti-Catholic, and highly politicised. Isaac Newton would have a deep interest in not just their alchemical pursuits, but also their belief in esoteric truths of the ancient past and the belief in enlightened individuals with the ability to gain insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nAt the time of his death, Isaac Newton had 169 books on the topic of alchemy in his personal library, and was believed to have considerably more books on this topic during his Cambridge years, though he may have sold them before moving to London in 1696. For its time, his was considered one of the finest alchemical libraries in the world. In his library, Newton left behind a heavily annotated personal copy of ''The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity R.C.'', by [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] which represents an English translation of [[Rosicrucian Manifestos|The Rosicrucian Manifestos]]. Newton also possessed copies of ''[[Themis Aurea]]'' and ''[[Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecium]]'' by the learned alchemist [[Michael Maier]], both of which are significant early books about the Rosicrucian movement. These books were also extensively annotated by Newton.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nNewton's ownership of these materials by no means denotes membership within any early Rosicrucian order. Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership. However, in religious terms, the fact that a saint might have 'found God' would not preclude others from the search \u2013 quite the opposite. The Ancient & Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater.<ref>Lewis, H. Spencer 1981, ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'', 15th edn, The Rosicrucian Press Ltd, San Jose, Calif. USA.</ref> During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yates |first=Frances A. |date=1972 |title=The Rosicrucian Enlightenment |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}</ref> Although it is not known for sure if Isaac Newton was in fact a Rosicrucian, and he never publicly identified himself as one, from his writings it does appear that he may have shared many of their sentiments and beliefs.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dobbs, Betty Jo Teeter.

These works explored [[chronology]], [[alchemy]], and [[Biblical hermeneutics|Biblical interpretation]] (especially of the [[Apocalypse]]). Newton's scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, some historians, including economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], believe that any reference to a \"Newtonian Worldview\" as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.<ref>Keynes, J.M., 'Newton, The Man'; Proceedings of the Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations, 15\u201319 July 1946; Cambridge University Press (1947)</ref> Historical research on Newton's occult studies in relation to his science have also been used to challenge the [[disenchantment]] narrative within [[critical theory]].<ref>{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | pages = 43 and Chapter 2, ''passim'' |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing and studying Newton's alchemical works, Keynes, for example, opined in 1942 at the [[tercentenary]] of his birth that \"Newton was not the first of the [[age of reason]], he was the last of the [[Magician (paranormal)|magicians]].\" In the [[Early Modern Period]] of Newton's lifetime, the educated embraced a [[world view]] different from that of later centuries. Distinctions between science, [[superstition]], and [[pseudoscience]] were still being formulated, and a devoutly Christian biblical perspective permeated Western culture.\n\n==Alchemical research==\nMuch of what are known as Isaac Newton's [[occult]] studies can largely be attributed to his study of [[alchemy]].<ref>\"Newton's manuscripts provide evidence that he gave considerable thought to alchemy as emblematic of a purely scientific explanation of nature and was in fact deeply involved in conceiving alchemy as spiritual.\" F. Calian, \"Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy\" in ''Annual of Medieval Studies'' at CEU (2010), 186.</ref> From a young age, Newton was deeply interested in all forms of [[natural sciences]] and [[materials science]], an interest which would ultimately lead to some of his better-known contributions to science. His earliest encounters with certain alchemical theories and practices were during his childhood, when a twelve year old Isaac Newton was boarding in the attic of an apothecaries shop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Isaac the Alchemist: Secrets of Isaac Newton|last=Losure|first=Mary|publisher=Candlewick Press|year=2017|isbn=9780763670634|location=Somerville, MA|pages=}}</ref> During Newton's lifetime, the study of [[chemistry]] was still in its infancy, so many of his experimental studies used esoteric language and vague terminology more typically associated with alchemy and occultism.<ref>\"his alchemy cannot be seen solely in connection with his chemical experiments but was also a link between his religious beliefs and his scientific aims\". Karin Figala, \"Newton's Alchemy,\" in The Cambridge Companion to Newton, ed. I. Bernard Cohen and George Edwin Smith (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 375.</ref> It was not until several decades after Newton's death that experiments of [[stoichiometry]] under the pioneering works of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] were conducted, and analytical chemistry, with its associated nomenclature, came to resemble modern chemistry as we know it today. However, Newton's contemporary and fellow Royal Society member, [[Robert Boyle]], had already discovered the basic concepts of modern chemistry and began establishing modern norms of experimental practice and communication in chemistry, information which Newton did not use.\n\nMuch of Newton's writing on alchemy may have been lost in a fire in his laboratory, so the true extent of his work in this area may have been larger than is currently known. Newton also suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] during his period of alchemical work, possibly due to some form of chemical poisoning (perhaps from [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, or some other substance).<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\n[[File:Isaac Newton laboratory fire.jpg|thumb|left|An 1874 engraving showing a probably apocryphal account of Newton's lab fire.

[[English crown|The English Crown]], also fearing the potential devaluation of gold because of the creation of fake gold, made penalties for alchemy very severe. In some cases the punishment for unsanctioned alchemy would include the public hanging of an offender on a gilded scaffold while adorned with tinsel and other unspecified items.<ref name=\"Nova\" />\n\nHe needed to be discreet about alchemy since: alchemy was a vector of heretical ideas and mobs were lynching heretics; alchemy provided technical knowledge about counterfeiting money. So, alchemy was considered dangerous.<ref>''Newton: The Dark Heretic'', BBC, 2003.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the question of the nature and degree of influence of alchemy on Newton\u2019s main works, \u201c[[Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy]]\u201d and \u201cOptics\u201d has been actively discussed. At present, the understanding that there is a connection between the alchemical and natural science views of Newton has become generally accepted. Some historians of science express an opinion on the decisive nature of the influence of alchemy, occultism and hermetism on the theory of forces and gravity. A discussion of Newton's alchemical studies had a significant impact on the understanding of the [[scientific revolution]].\n\n==Writings==\nDue to the threat of punishment and the potential scrutiny he feared from his peers within the scientific community, Newton may have deliberately left his work on alchemical subjects unpublished. Newton was well known as being highly sensitive to criticism, such as the numerous instances when he was criticized by [[Robert Hooke]], and his admitted reluctance to publish any substantial information regarding [[calculus]] before 1693. A perfectionist by nature, Newton also refrained from publication of material that he felt was incomplete, as evident from a 38-year gap from Newton's conception of calculus in 1666 and its final full publication in 1704, which would ultimately lead to the infamous [[Leibniz\u2013Newton calculus controversy]].\n\nMost of the scientist\u2019s manuscript heritage after his death passed to [[John Conduitt]], the husband of his niece [[Catherine Barton|Catherine]]<ref>For more information on Newton\u2019s archive, see ''Iliffe, 1998''{{sfn|Iliffe|1998|pp=137\u2014158}}.</ref>. To evaluate the manuscripts, physician Thomas Pellet was involved, who decided that only \u201c[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended|the Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms]]\u201d, an unreleased fragment of \u201c[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]\u201d, \"Obsevations upon the Prophesies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John\" and \"Paradoxical Questions Concerning the Morals and Actions of Athanasius and His Followers\" were suitable for publication. The remaining manuscripts, according to Pellet, were \"foul draughts of the Prophetic stile\" and were not suitable for publication. After the death of J. Conduitt in 1737, manuscripts were transferred to Catherine, who unsuccessfully tried to publish theological notes of her uncle. She consulted with Newton's friend, the theologian [[Arthur Ashley Sykes]] (1684\u20141756). Sykes kept 11 manuscripts for himself, and the rest of the archive passed into the family of Catherine's daughter, who married the [[John Wallop, Viscount Lymington]], and was then owned by the [[Earl of Portsmouth|Earls of Portsmouth]]. Sykes' documents after his death came to the Rev.

Until the mid-19th century, few had access to the Portsmouth collection, including David Brewster, a renowned physicist and biographer of Newton. In 1872, the fifth Earl of Portsmouth transferred part of the manuscripts (mainly of a physical and mathematical nature) to [[Cambridge University]].\n\nIn 1936, a collection of Isaac Newton's unpublished works were auctioned by [[Sotheby's]] on behalf of [[Gerard Wallop, 9th Earl of Portsmouth]]. Known as the \"Portsmouth Papers\", this material consisted of 329 lots of Newton's manuscripts, over a third of which were filled with content that appeared to be alchemical in nature. At the time of Newton's death this material was considered \"unfit to publish\" by Newton's estate, and consequently fell into obscurity until their somewhat sensational reemergence in 1936.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newman\n |first       = William R.\n |title       = Newton and Alchemy\n |publisher   = The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |accessdate  = 12 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070807181322/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/about.do\n |archivedate = 7 August 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nAt the auction many of these documents, along with Newton's [[death mask]], were purchased by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who throughout his life collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.<ref name=\"Gleick2004\">{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|authorlink=James Gleick|title=Isaac Newton|url={{Google books|t2-KDQAAQBAJ|page=188|plainurl=yes}}|year=2004|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3295-2|page=188}}</ref> Much of the Keynes collection later passed to eccentric document collector [[Abraham Yahuda]], who was himself a vigorous collector of Isaac Newton's original manuscripts.\n\nMany of the documents collected by Keynes and Yahuda are now in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] in Jerusalem.{{Citation needed|reason=Newton Project says King's College|date=December 2016}} In recent years, several projects have begun to gather, catalogue, and transcribe the fragmented collection of Newton's work on alchemical subjects and make them freely available for on-line access.

Most notably are documents entitled ''Artephius his secret Book'', followed by ''The Epistle of Iohn Pontanus, wherein he beareth witness of ye book of Artephius''; these are themselves a collection of excerpts from another work entitled ''Nicholas Flammel, His Exposition of the Hieroglyphicall Figures'' which he caused to be painted upon an Arch in St Innocents Church-yard in Paris. Together with ''The secret Booke of Artephius, And the Epistle of Iohn Pontanus: Containing both the Theoricke and the Practicke of the Philosophers Stone''. This work may also have been referenced by Newton in its Latin version found within [[Lazarus Zetzner]]'s ''[[Theatrum Chemicum]]'', a volume often associated with the ''[[Turba Philosophorum]]'' and other early European alchemical manuscripts. [[Nicolas Flamel]], one subject of the aforementioned work, was a notable, though mysterious figure, often associated with the discovery of the philosopher's stone, hieroglyphical figures, early forms of [[tarot]], and occultism. [[Artephius]], and his \"secret book\", were also subjects of interest to 17th-century alchemists.\n\nAlso in the 1936 auction of Newton's collection was ''The Epitome of the treasure of health written by Edwardus Generosus Anglicus innominatus who lived Anno Domini 1562''. This is a twenty-eight-page treatise on the philosopher's stone, the Animal or [[Angelicall Stone]], the Prospective stone or magical stone of Moses, and the vegetable or the growing stone.  The treatise concludes with an alchemical poem.\n\n===== The Principia =====\nMany of the discoveries and mathematical formula found within Newton's ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' can be linked, often very directly, to his occult and alchemical studies.  Much of his research into the movement of heavenly bodies was influenced by his belief that there are invisible, occult forces at work in the orbits of celestial bodies. Other natural philosophers, most notably Descartes, tended to object to this notion and insisted instead that action depended on physical contact, proposing that celestial objects were moved about by a great many small particles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Newton: The Making of a Genius|last=Fara|first=Patricia|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780231128063|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/newtonmakingofge00fara}}</ref>\n\nThe second book of the Principia has not withstood the test of time.\u00a0Much of the work within this volume revolved around measuring air resistance on the motion of pendulums and spheres.\u00a0 Some believe that the main corpus of this work was ultimately an effort to refute Descartes\u2019s Cartesian theory of Vortices, according to which, planetary motion was produced by whirling fluid vortices that filled interplanetary space. This motion supposedly carried the planets with them.\u00a0 As a spiritual man, and as an alchemist, Newton was determined that the motion of heavenly bodies was motivated by invisible forces, that natural phenomena were motivated by forces spiritual, not merely physical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton|last=Westfall|first=R.S.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1980|isbn=978-0521274357|location=UK|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/neveratrestbiogr00west}}</ref>\n\n===== \"The Key\" a.k.a ''Newton's Clavis'' =====\nA fragmentary alchemical text which, in 1975, became \"generally accepted as\" to be penned by Newton.  Its authorship was immediately questioned by Karin Figala, and in 1988 William Newman conclusively proved it to be a composition by George Starkey; this fact has been repeated in a dozen publications since, and no scholar now thinks the \"Key\" is Newton's.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=P.H.|date=2005|title=The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton|url=|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|volume=Vol.38(iss.138).|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n===== Other works =====\nWilliam Newman, a leading scholar of the history of science, has collected many of Newton's alchemical writings.\n\nNewton's various surviving alchemical notebooks clearly show that he made no distinctions between alchemy and what we today consider science. The very same pages in which we find the recordings of his legendary optics experiments we also find various recipes culled from arcane sources. \"Alongside sober explanations of optical and physical phenomena such as freezing and boiling,\" Newman says, \"we find 'Neptune's Trident', 'Mercury's Caducean Rod' and the 'Green Lion', all symbolising alchemical substances.\"\n\nDetermining that many of Newton's acclaimed scientific discoveries were influenced by his research of the occult and obscure has not been the simplest of tasks.  Newton did not always record his chemical experiments in the most transparent way. Alchemists were notorious for veiling their writings in impenetrable jargon, and Newton made matters even worse by inventing symbols and systems of his own. That is part of the reason why, despite Newton's reputation, many of his manuscripts have still not been properly edited and interpreted. \"They are in a state of considerable disorder,\" Newman says.\n\nEven where the text can be deciphered this only gets you so far. \"Although we can make educated guesses about his chymical work from reading,\" Newman says, \"there are often too many variables in chemical research to make it possible to predict an exact outcome from Newton's notes.\" So Newman and his colleagues set out to repeat the experiments Newton described - using exactly the same conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|date=2006|title=Newtons Curse|url=|journal=New Scientist|volume=Vol.190(iss.2546)|pages=|via=ProQuest Database}}</ref>\n\n== Biblical studies ==\nIn a manuscript from 1704, Newton describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible and estimates that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this, he said, \"This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail.\"<ref>{{cite news\n |title=Papers Show Isaac Newton's Religious Side, Predict Date of Apocalypse \n |work=The Christian Post \n |date=19 June 2007 \n |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton%27s_Religious_Side%2C_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm \n |accessdate=28 May 2018 \n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070629231937/http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton's_Religious_Side,_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm \n |archivedate=29 June 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Newton's studies of the Temple of Solomon ===\n[[File:Isaac Newton's Temple of Solomon.jpg|thumb|right|Isaac Newton's diagram of part of the [[Temple of Solomon]], taken from Plate 1 of [[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]] (published London, 1728)]]\nNewton extensively studied and wrote about the [[Temple of Solomon]], dedicating an entire chapter of ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' to his observations of the temple. Newton's primary source for information was the description of the structure given within [[1 Kings]] of the Hebrew Bible, which he translated himself from [[hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=\"TempleInstitute\">{{cite web | last =Richman | first =Rabbi Chaim |author2=Temple Institute | title =Temple Institute: Isaac Newton and the Holy Temple | publisher =Temple Institute | date =1991\u20132008 | url =http://www.templeinstitute.org/isaac_newton_holy_temple.htm | accessdate =1 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to scripture, Newton also relied upon various ancient and contemporary sources while studying the temple.  He believed that many ancient sources were endowed with sacred wisdom<ref name=\"Nova\" /> and that the [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s of many of their temples were in themselves sacred. This belief would lead Newton to examine many architectural works of Hellenistic [[ancient Greece|Greece]], as well as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources such as [[Vitruvius]], in a search for their occult knowledge. This concept, often termed ''[[prisca sapientia]]'' (sacred wisdom and also the ancient wisdom that was revealed to Adam and Moses directly by God), was a common belief of many scholars during Newton's lifetime.<ref name=\"Christianson\">{{Cite book | last =Christianson | first =Gale E. | publicationdate =2005 | title =Isaac Newton | publisher =Oxford University Press US | page =[https://archive.org/details/isaacnewton00chri_0/page/n165 144] | isbn =978-0-19-530070-3 | url =https://archive.org/details/isaacnewton00chri_0 | url-access =registration | accessdate = 4 July 2008 | date =2005 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref>\n\nA more contemporary source for Newton's studies of the temple was [[Juan Bautista Villalpando]], who just a few decades earlier  had published an influential manuscript entitled ''In Ezechielem explanationes et apparatus urbis, ac templi Hierosolymitani'' (1596-1605), in which Villalpando comments on the visions of the biblical prophet [[Ezekiel]], including within this work his own interpretations and elaborate reconstructions of Solomon's Temple.

He noted that the temple's measurements given in the Bible are mathematical problems, related to solutions for <math>\\pi</math> and [[Sphere|the volume of a hemisphere]], <math>V = (2/3)\\pi r^3</math>, and in a larger sense that they were references to the size of the [[Earth]] and man's place and proportion to it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nNewton believed that the temple was designed by [[King Solomon]] with privileged eyes and divine guidance.

He believed that these men had hidden their knowledge in a complex code of symbolic and mathematical language that, when deciphered, would reveal an unknown knowledge of how nature works.<ref name=\"Christianson\" />\n\nIn 1675 Newton annotated a copy of ''Manna \u2013 a disquisition of the nature of alchemy'', an anonymous treatise which had been given to him by his fellow scholar [[Ezekiel Foxcroft]]. In his annotation Newton reflected upon his reasons for examining Solomon's Temple by writing:\n\n{{quote|This philosophy, both speculative and active, is not only to be found in the volume of nature, but also in the sacred scriptures, as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Job|Job]], Psalms, Isaiah and others. In the knowledge of this philosophy, God made Solomon the greatest philosopher in the world.<ref name=\"TheShadowofSolomon\" />}}\n\nDuring Newton's lifetime, there was great interest in the Temple of Solomon in Europe, due to the success of [[Juan Bautista Villalpando|Villalpando]]'s publications, and augmented by a vogue for detailed [[engraving]]s and [[physical model]]s presented in various galleries for public viewing. In 1628, [[Judah Leon Templo]] produced a model of the temple and surrounding Jerusalem, which was popular in its day. Around 1692, Gerhard Schott produced a highly detailed model of the temple for use in an opera in Hamburg composed by Christian Heinrich Postel. This immense {{convert|13|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} and {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-around}} model was later sold in 1725 and was exhibited in London as early as 1723, and then later temporarily installed at the London [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] from 1729 to 1730, where it could be viewed for [[Half crown (British coin)|half-a-crown]]. Isaac Newton's most comprehensive work on the temple, found within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', was published posthumously in 1728, only adding to the public interest in the temple.<ref>{{cite web | last =Crawley | first =W.

Although he never wrote a cohesive body of work on prophecy, Newton's belief led him to write several treatises on the subject, including an unpublished guide for prophetic interpretation entitled ''Rules for interpreting the words & language in Scripture''. In this manuscript he details the necessary requirements for what he considered to be the proper interpretation of the Bible.\n\nIn addition, Newton would spend much of his life seeking and revealing what could be considered a [[Bible Code]]. He placed a great deal of emphasis upon the interpretation of the [[Book of Revelation]], writing generously upon this book and authoring several manuscripts detailing his interpretations. Unlike a [[prophet]] in the true sense of the word, Newton relied upon existing Scripture to prophesy for him, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the face of what he considered to be \"so little understood\".<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Newton\n |first       = Isaac\n |title       = The First Book Concerning the Language of the Prophets\n |publisher   = The Newton Project\n |date        = 5 April 2007\n |url         = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |accessdate  = 15 August 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210637/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00005&mode=normalized\n |archivedate = 8 November 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'' would be published, and although it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to be just one popular misunderstanding of Scripture.\n\nAlthough Newton's approach to these studies could not be considered a scientific approach, he did write as if his findings were the result of evidence-based research.\n\n=== 2060 ===\nIn late February and early March 2003, a large amount of media attention circulated around the globe regarding largely unknown and unpublished documents, evidently written by Isaac Newton, indicating that he believed the world would end no earlier than 2060. The story garnered vast amounts of public interest and found its way onto the front page of several widely distributed newspapers, including the UK's [[Daily Telegraph]], Canada's [[National Post]], Israel's [[Maariv]] and [[Yediot Aharonot]], and was also featured in an article in the scientific journal ''[[Canadian Journal of History]]''.<ref name=\"Snobelen\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Snobelen\n  | first = Stephen D\n  | title = A time and times and the dividing of time: Isaac Newton, the Apocalypse and A.D. 2060.\n  | journal = The Canadian Journal of History\n  | volume= 38 (December 2003)\n  | pages = 537\u2013551\n  | url = http://www.isaac-newton.org/newton_2060.htm\n  | accessdate = 15 August 2007 }}</ref> Television and internet stories in the following weeks heightened the exposure and ultimately would include the production of several documentary films focused upon the topic of the 2060 prediction and some of Newton's lesser known beliefs and practices.\n\nThe two documents detailing this prediction are currently housed within the Jewish National and University Library in Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" /> Both were believed to be written toward the end of Newton's life, circa 1705, a time frame most notably established by the use of the full title of ''Sir'' Isaac Newton within portions of the documents.\n\nThese documents do not appear to have been written with the intention of publication and Newton expressed a strong personal dislike for individuals who provided specific dates for the [[Apocalypse]] purely for sensational value. Furthermore, he at no time provides a specific date for the end of the world in either of these documents.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />\n\nTo understand the reasoning behind the 2060 prediction, an understanding of Newton's theological beliefs should be taken into account, particularly his apparent [[antitrinitarian]] beliefs and his Protestant views on the [[Papacy]].  Both of these lay essential to his calculations, which ultimately would provide the 2060 time frame.  See [[Isaac Newton's religious views]] for more details.\n\nThe first document, part of the Yahuda collection,<ref>Yahuda MS 7.3o, f. 8r</ref> is a small letter slip, on the back of which is written haphazardly in Newton's hand:\n{{quote|\nProp. 1.

This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fancifull men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, & by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. Christ comes as a thief in the night, & it is not for us to know the times & seasons wch God hath put into his own breast.<ref name=\"Snobelen\" />}}\n\nClearly Newton's mathematical prediction of the end of the world is one derived from his interpretation of not only scripture, but also one based upon his theological viewpoint regarding specific chronological dates and events as he saw them.\n\nNewton may not have been referring to the post 2060 event as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the globe and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world, as he saw it, was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian and [[Islamic theology]] this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.  In a separate manuscript,<ref>Yahuda MS 7.2a, f. 31r</ref> Isaac Newton paraphrases Revelation 21 and 22 and relates the post 2060 events by writing:\n{{quote|A new heaven & new earth. New Jerusalem comes down from heaven prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband. The marriage supper. God dwells with men wipes away all tears from their eyes, gives them of ye fountain of living water & creates all thin things new saying, It is done.

In 1728 ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'', an approximately 87,000-word composition that details the rise and history of various ancient kingdoms was published. The publication date of this work occurred after his death, although the majority of it had been reviewed for publication by Newton himself shortly before he died. As such, this work represents one of his last known personally reviewed publications. Sometime around 1701 he also produced a thirty page unpublished treatise entitled \"The Original of Monarchies\" detailing the rise of several monarchs throughout antiquity and tracing them back to the biblical figure of [[Noah]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Newton | first = Isaac | title = The Original of Monarchies | url = http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | accessdate = 19 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071108210642/http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00040&mode=normalized | archivedate = 8 November 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nNewton's chronological writing is [[Eurocentric]], with the earliest records focusing upon [[Greece]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Levant]]. Many of Newton's dates do not correlate with current historical knowledge. While Newton mentions several pre-historical events found within the Bible, the oldest actual historical date he provides is 1125 BC. In this entry he mentions [[Mephres]], a ruler over [[Upper Egypt]] from the territories of Syene to [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and his successor [[Misphragmuthosis]]. However, during 1125 BC the Pharaoh of Egypt is now understood to be [[Ramesses IX]].\n\nAlthough some of the dates Newton provides for various events are accurate by 17th century standards, [[archaeology]] as a form of modern science did not exist in Newton's time. In fact, the majority of the conclusionary dates which Newton cites are based on the works of [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Plutarch]], [[Homer]], and various other classical historians, authors, and poets; themselves often citing secondary sources and oral records of uncertain date. Newton's approach to chronology was focused upon gathering historical information from various sources found throughout antiquity and cataloguing them according to their appropriate date by his contemporary understanding, standards, and available source material.\n\n=== Newton's Atlantis ===\nFound within ''The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended'', are several passages that directly mention the land of [[Atlantis]]. The first such passage is part of his ''Short Chronicle'' which indicates his belief that Homer's [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] left the island of [[Ogygia]] in 896 BC. In [[Greek mythology]], Ogygia was home to [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]], the daughter of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (after whom Atlantis was named). Some scholars have suggested that Ogygia and Atlantis are locationally connected, or possibly the same island. From his writings it appears Newton may have shared this belief. Newton also lists Cadis or Cales as possible candidates for Ogygia, though does not cite his reasons for believing so.\n\n== Newton and secret societies ==\nIsaac Newton has often been associated with various [[secret societies]] and [[fraternal orders]] throughout history.  Due to the secretive nature of such organizations, lack of supportive publicized material, and dubious motives for claiming Newton's participation in these groups, it is difficult to establish his actual membership in any specific organization.<ref name=\"NEWTONSFREEMASONRY\">{{Cite book | last =Bauer | first =Alain | publicationdate =2007 | title = Isaac Newton's Freemasonary: The Alchemy of Science and Mysticism | location = Originally published as: Aux origines de la franc-ma\u00e7onnerie: Newton et les Newtoniens by Editions Dervy (2003)| publisher =Inner Traditions | pages =Book Excerpt \u2013 from Chapter 3 | isbn =978-1-59477-172-9 | doi = | oclc = | url =http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/book_bauer.html | accessdate =25 June 2008 | nopp =true | date =2007 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref>\nIn particular, Isaac Newton is believed to have been a 33-degree [[Scottish Rite]] Freemason since he was one of the 1717 founders of the [[Ancient Grand Lodge of England|Lodge of England]],<ref>{{cite web | first1= F. | last1 = Millikan | url = http://freemasoninformation.com/tag/isaac-newton | title = Dr. Bro.

It is unclear if these associations were a result of his being a well established and prominently publicized scholar, an early member and sitting [[President of the Royal Society]] (1703\u20131727), a prominent figure of State and [[Master of the Mint]], a recognized [[Knight]], or if Newton actually sought active membership within these esoteric organizations himself.  Considering the nature and legality of alchemical practices during his lifetime, as well as his possession of various materials and manuscripts pertaining to alchemical research, Newton may very well have been a member of a group of like minded thinkers and colleagues. The organized level of this group (if in fact any existed), the level of their secrecy, as well as the depth of Newton's involvement within them, remains unclear.\n\nAlthough Newton was largely considered a reclusive personality and not prone to socializing, during his lifetime being a member of \"Societies\" or \"Clubs\" was a very popular form of interpersonal networking. Considering his esteemed social status, it is probable that Newton would have had a least some contact with such groups at various levels. He was most certainly a member of [[The Royal Society]] of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge and the [[Spalding Gentlemen's Society]],<ref name=\"Stukeley\">{{cite book|last=Stukeley|first=William|authorlink=William Stukeley|editor=Rob Iliffe |editor2=Scott Mandelbrote |title=Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's life|origyear= 1752 |url=http://www.newtonproject.sussex.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00001|edition=transcript|date=2010|publisher=The Newton Project|location=University of Sussex|type=AHRC Newton Papers Project, Ms. 142, The Royal Society Library, London}}</ref><ref name=\"SPALDING\">{{cite web | title =Spalding Gentlemen's Society | url =http://www.spalding-gentlemens-society.org | accessdate =25 June 2008 }}</ref> however, these are considered [[learned societies]], not [[secret societies|esoteric societies]]. Newton's membership status within any particular secret society remains verifiably allusive and largely speculative, however, it still lends itself to popular sensationalism.\n\n=== Newton and the Rosicrucians ===\nPerhaps the movement which most influenced Isaac Newton was [[Rosicrucianism]].<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\">{{Cite book | last =White | first =Michael| publicationdate = | date =1999 | title =Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer | publisher =Da Capo Press | page =117 | isbn =978-0-7382-0143-6 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=l2C3NV38tM0C | accessdate =25 June 2008 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> Although the Rosicrucian movement had caused a great deal of excitement within Europe's scholarly community during the early seventeenth century, by the time Newton had reached maturity the movement had become less sensationalized. However, the Rosicrucian movement still would have a profound influence upon Newton, particularly in regard to his alchemical work and philosophical thought.\n\nThe Rosicrucian belief in being specially chosen for the ability to communicate with angels or spirits is echoed in Newton's prophetic beliefs. Additionally, the Rosicrucians proclaimed to have the ability to live forever through the use of the ''[[Elixir of Life|elixir vitae]]'' and the ability to produce limitless amounts of time and gold from the use of the [[philosopher's stone]], which they claimed to have in their possession. Like Newton, the Rosicrucians were deeply religious, avowedly Christian, anti-Catholic, and highly politicised. Isaac Newton would have a deep interest in not just their alchemical pursuits, but also their belief in esoteric truths of the ancient past and the belief in enlightened individuals with the ability to gain insight into nature, the physical universe, and the spiritual realm.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nAt the time of his death, Isaac Newton had 169 books on the topic of alchemy in his personal library, and was believed to have considerably more books on this topic during his Cambridge years, though he may have sold them before moving to London in 1696. For its time, his was considered one of the finest alchemical libraries in the world. In his library, Newton left behind a heavily annotated personal copy of ''The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity R.C.'', by [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] which represents an English translation of [[Rosicrucian Manifestos|The Rosicrucian Manifestos]]. Newton also possessed copies of ''[[Themis Aurea]]'' and ''[[Symbola Aurea Mensae Duodecium]]'' by the learned alchemist [[Michael Maier]], both of which are significant early books about the Rosicrucian movement. These books were also extensively annotated by Newton.<ref name=\"LASTSORCERER\" />\n\nNewton's ownership of these materials by no means denotes membership within any early Rosicrucian order. Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership. However, in religious terms, the fact that a saint might have 'found God' would not preclude others from the search \u2013 quite the opposite. The Ancient & Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater.<ref>Lewis, H. Spencer 1981, ''Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order'', 15th edn, The Rosicrucian Press Ltd, San Jose, Calif. USA.</ref> During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yates |first=Frances A. |date=1972 |title=The Rosicrucian Enlightenment |publisher=Routledge |location=London}}</ref> Although it is not known for sure if Isaac Newton was in fact a Rosicrucian, and he never publicly identified himself as one, from his writings it does appear that he may have shared many of their sentiments and beliefs.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dobbs, Betty Jo Teeter.

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word \"plandovati\" used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means \"odmarati\", and in English means \"to rest\".\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895</ref>. In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century the Hungarian empire started it's career and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two thirds of Hungary, including Banat. After the [[Ottoman]] siege of Vienna the Ottoman empire was slowly driven back again and the history of Plandi\u0161te gets more concrete.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref>. They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* Pervan is serbian and means first, which is common at that time and area to distinct different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker doesnt't tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it's nothing more than a guess: in German it's common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Huangarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happend to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1887 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787)</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs and Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word \"plandovati\" used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means \"odmarati\", and in English means \"to rest\".\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895</ref>. In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century the Hungarian empire started it's career and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two thirds of Hungary, including Banat. After the [[Ottoman]] siege of Vienna the Ottoman empire was slowly driven back again and the history of Plandi\u0161te gets more concrete.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref>. They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* Pervan is serbian and means first, which is common at that time and area to distinct different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker doesnt't tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it's nothing more than a guess: in German it's common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Huangarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happend to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1887 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787)</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe</ref> (19,5 ha) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs and Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got it's present name Plandi\u0161te. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].

For the architectural theory, see [[Form follows function]].}}\n{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=August 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Utilitarianism|expanded=all}}\n'''Utilitarianism''' is a family of [[consequentialist]] ethical theories that promotes actions that maximize happiness and [[well-being]] for the affected individuals.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/utilitarianism-philosophy</ref>At its core is a simple equation between 'the good', and 'happiness' or pleasure.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robertson|first=David|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Politics|publisher=Taylor and Francis group|year=2004|isbn=0-415-32377-0|location=|pages=pp;page=494}}</ref> Although different varieties of utilitarianism admit different characterizations, the basic idea behind all of them is to in some sense maximize [[utility]], which is often defined in terms of well-being or related concepts. For instance, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as \"that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness...[or] to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered.\" Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], utilitarianism considers the interests of all humans [[Equal consideration of interests|equally]].\n\nProponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of points, such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results ([[act utilitarianism]]) or whether [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]] should conform to rules that maximize utility ([[rule utilitarianism]]). There is also disagreement as to whether total ([[Average and total utilitarianism|total utilitarianism]]), average ([[Average and total utilitarianism#Average utilitarianism|average utilitarianism]]) or minimum<ref>{{Citation|last=White|first=Stuart|title=Social Minimum|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/social-minimum/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> utility should be maximized.\n\nThough the seeds of the theory can be found in the [[hedonism|hedonists]] [[Aristippus]] and [[Epicurus]], who viewed happiness as the only good, the tradition of utilitarianism properly began with Bentham, and has included [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[R.

''Trait\u00e9 de legislation civile et p\u00e9nale'' was published in 1802 and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as ''The Theory of Legislation'', although by this time significant portions of Dumont's work had already been retranslated and incorporated into Sir [[John Bowring]]'s edition of Bentham's works, which was issued in parts between 1838 and 1843.\n\nBentham's work opens with a statement of the principle of utility:<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation |series=Dover Philosophical Classics |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2009 |page=1 |isbn=978-0486454528}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure.

I say of every action whatsoever, and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of government.}}\n\nIn Chapter IV, Bentham introduces a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains, which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus. Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain, considered by itself, can be measured according to its intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness. In addition, it is necessary to consider \"the tendency of any act by which it is produced\" and, therefore, to take account of the act's fecundity, or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity, or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind. Finally, it is necessary to consider the extent, or the number of people affected by the action.\n\nPerhaps aware that Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they \"appear'd useless, and were disagreeable to some readers\",<ref name=\"HutchesonIntroduction\">An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, Francis Hutcheson, Introduction, 1726</ref> Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method, for \"in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind, wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest, is perfectly conformable to.\"\n\nRosen warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear \"little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and [[J. S. Mill]]\" and can be more \"a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a [[straw man]] to be attacked and rejected.\"<ref>Rosen, Frederick (2003) Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill. Routledge, p. 32</ref> It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules. His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words \"Pleasures then, and the avoidance of pains, are the ends that the legislator has in view.\" In Chapter VII, Bentham says: \"The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding... In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness, in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious, will be the demand it creates for punishment.\"\n\nThe question then arises as to when, if at all, it might be legitimate to break the law. This is considered in ''The Theory of Legislation'', where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second orders. Those of the first order are the more immediate consequences; those of the second are when the consequences spread through the community causing \"alarm\" and \"danger\".\n\n<blockquote>It is true there are cases in which, if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? ... It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bentham |first1=Jeremy |last2=Dumont |first2=Etienne |last3=Hildreth | first3=R |title=Theory of Legislation: Translated from the French of Etienne Dumont |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |date=November 2005 |pages=58 |isbn=978-1402170348}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===John Stuart Mill===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\nMill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halevy|first=Elie|title=The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism|year=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-19-101020-0|pages=282\u201384}}</ref> Mill's book ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' first appeared as a series of three articles published in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1861 and was reprinted as a single book in 1863.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory|last=Hinman|first=Lawrence|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2012|isbn=978-1133050018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John Stuart|orig-year=1863|last=Mill|date=2010|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TnYZ4tO5640C&pg=PA33 |title=Utilitarianism - Ed.

Utility, within the context of utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\n\nMill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility, but as the directive rule of moral human conduct. The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society. This view of pleasure was hedonistic, as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life. This concept was adopted by Bentham and can be seen in his works. According to Mill, good actions result in pleasure, and that there is no higher end than pleasure. Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good [[Moral character|character]]. Better put, the justification of character, and whether an action is good or not, is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility. In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct. In the last chapter of Utilitarianism, Mill concludes that justice, as a classifying factor of our actions (being just or unjust) is one of the certain moral requirements, and when the requirements are all regarded collectively, they are viewed as greater according to this scale of \"social utility\" as Mill puts it.\n\nHe also notes that, contrary to what its critics might say, there is \"no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect... a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation.\" However, he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages, i.e. \"greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, &c.\" Instead, Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others.\n\nThe accusation that hedonism is a \"doctrine worthy only of swine\" has a long history. In ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 1 Chapter 5), [[Aristotle]] says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts. The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God; the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence. Mill's approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures.\n\n<blockquote>Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs... A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question...<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Crisp |title=Utilitarianism |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |pages=56\u201357 |isbn=978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMill argues that if people who are \"competently acquainted\" with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and \"would not resign it for any quantity of the other\", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these \"competent judges\" will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that \"many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher.\" Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for there is no other way of measuring \"the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations.\" \"It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect.\"<ref>John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism, Chapter 2</ref>\n\nMill also thinks that \"intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the amount of contentment or pleasure (the mental state) that they produce\".<ref>Brink, David. \"Mill Moral and Political Philosophy\". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political [accessed 27 April 2018].</ref> Mill also says that people should pursue these grand ideals, because if they choose to have gratification from petty pleasures, \"some displeasure will eventually creep in.

Whereas, intellectual pursuits give long-term happiness because they provide the individual with constant opportunities throughout the years to improve his life, by benefiting from accruing knowledge. Mill views intellectual pursuits as \"capable of incorporating the 'finer things' in life\" while petty pursuits do not achieve this goal.<ref>Saunders, Ben. \"J. S. Mill's Conception of Utility.\" Utilitas 22, no. 1 (March 2010): 52-69. https://search.proquest.com/docview/200183451 [accessed 27 April 2018]</ref> Mill is saying that intellectual pursuits give the individual the opportunity to escape the constant depression cycle since these pursuits allow them to achieve their ideals, while petty pleasures do not offer this. Although debate persists about the nature of Mill's view of gratification, this suggests bifurcation in his position.\n\n==== Mill's 'proof' of the principle of utility ====\nIn Chapter Four of ''Utilitarianism'', Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility.

Mill anticipates the objection that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a ''means'' to happiness, eventually, it becomes part of someone's happiness and is then desired as an end in itself.\n\n{{quote|The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any given exemption from pain, as for example health, are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness, and to be desired on that account.

E. Moore]]. In ''Ethics'' (1912), Moore rejected a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argued that there is a range of values that might be maximized. Moore's strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good. He says that such an assumption:<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\">Moore, G. E. (1912).  ''Ethics'', London: Williams and Norgate, Ch. 7</ref>\n{{quote|involves our saying, for instance, that a world in which absolutely nothing except pleasure existed\u2014no knowledge, no love, no enjoyment of beauty, no moral qualities\u2014must yet be intrinsically better\u2014better worth creating\u2014provided only the total quantity of pleasure in it were the least bit greater, than one in which all these things existed as well as pleasure.\n\nIt involves our saying that, even if the total quantity of pleasure in each was exactly equal, yet the fact that all the beings in the one possessed, in addition knowledge of many different kinds and a full appreciation of all that was beautiful or worthy of love in their world, whereas none of the beings in the other possessed any of these things, would give us no reason whatever for preferring the former to the latter.}}\n\nMoore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way, but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world. He adds that, if a person was to take the contrary view, then \"I think it is self-evident that he would be wrong.\"<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\"/>\n\n=== Act and rule utilitarianism ===\nIn the mid-twentieth century a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thinking.<ref>Bayles, M. D., ed. (1968) Contemporary Utilitarianism, Anchor Books, Doubleday</ref> It was already accepted that it is necessary to use rules to help you choose the right action because the problems of calculating the consequences on each and every occasion would almost certainly result in you frequently choosing something less than the best course of action. Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says:<ref>{{cite book |last = Mill | first = John Stuart |editor-first= Roger |editor-last= Crisp |title = Utilitarianism |publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1998 |page = 70 |isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|It is truly a whimsical supposition that, if mankind were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality, they would remain without any agreement as to what is useful, and would take no measures for having their notions on the subject taught to the young, and enforced by law and opinion... to consider the rules of morality as improvable, is one thing; to pass over the intermediate generalisations entirely, and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first principle, is another... The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal... Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy, because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack. Being rational creatures, they go to sea with it ready calculated; and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the common questions of right and wrong.}}\n\nHowever, rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms, particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism, and through this debate the theory we now call rule utilitarianism was created. In an introduction to an anthology of these articles, the editor was able to say: \"The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation, criticism, reply and reformulation; the record of this process well illustrates the co-operative development of a philosophical theory.\"<ref>Bayles, M.

[[Act utilitarianism]] maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.\n\nIn 1956, Urmson published an influential article<ref>{{cite journal |last=Urmson |first=J.

From then on, articles have debated this interpretation of Mill. In all probability, it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed. A collection of Mill's writing published in 1977 includes a letter in which he says:<ref>Mill, John Stuart, The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill. Gen. Ed. John M. Robson. 33 vols.

However, it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature.\n\nIt has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism, because for any given rule, in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility, the rule can be refined by the addition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception.<ref>David Lyons, ''Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism'', 1965</ref> This process holds for all cases of exceptions, and so the \"rules\" have as many \"sub-rules\" as there are exceptional cases, which, in the end, makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility.<ref>Allen Habib (2008), ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises/ Promises]'', in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].</ref>\n\n=== Two-level utilitarianism ===\n{{Main|Two-level utilitarianism}}\nIn ''Principles'' (1973),<ref name=\"HareRM\">{{cite journal | last = Hare | first = R.

M. Hare]] accepts that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism but claims that this is a result of allowing the rules to be \"as specific and un-general as we please.\" He argues that one of the main reasons for introducing rule utilitarianism was to do justice to the general rules that people need for moral education and character development and he proposes that \"a difference between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism can be introduced by limiting the specificity of the rules, i.e., by increasing their generality.\"<ref name=\"HareRM\"/>{{rp|14}} This distinction between a \"specific rule utilitarianism\" (which collapses into act utilitarianism) and \"general rule utilitarianism\" forms the basis of Hare's two-level utilitarianism.\n\nWhen we are \"playing God or the ideal observer\", we use the specific form, and we will need to do this when we are deciding what general principles to teach and follow. When we are \"inculcating\" or in situations where the biases of our human nature are likely to prevent us doing the calculations properly, then we should use the more general rule utilitarianism.\n\nHare argues that in practice, most of the time, we should be following the general principles:<ref name=\"HareRM\"/>{{rp|17}}\n\n{{quote|One ought to abide by the general principles whose general inculcation is for the best; harm is more likely to come, in actual moral situations, from questioning these rules than from sticking to them, unless the situations are very extra-ordinary; the results of sophisticated felicific calculations are not likely, human nature and human ignorance being what they are, to lead to the greatest utility.}}\n\nIn ''Moral Thinking'' (1981), Hare illustrated the two extremes. The \"archangel\" is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do; the \"prole\" is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and, of necessity, has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation.<ref name=\"Hare 1981 b\">{{cite book | last = Hare | first = R.M. | author-link = R.

However, the critical moral thinking underpins and informs the more intuitive moral thinking. It is responsible for formulating and, if necessary, reformulating the general moral rules. We also switch to critical thinking when trying to deal with unusual situations or in cases where the intuitive moral rules give conflicting advice.\n\n=== Preference utilitarianism ===\n{{Main|Preference utilitarianism}}\nThe concept of preference utilitarianism was first proposed in 1977 by [[John Harsanyi]] in ''Morality and the theory of rational behaviour'',<ref name=\"Harsanyi\">{{citation |last=Harsanyi |first=John C. |author-link=John Harsanyi |contribution=Morality and the theory of rational behaviour |editor-last1=Sen |editor-first1 = Amartya |editor-last2=Williams |editor-first2=Bernard |editor-link1=Amartya Sen |editor-link2=Bernard Williams |title=Utilitarianism and beyond |pages=39\u201362 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1982 |isbn=9780511611964 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}:''Originally printed as'': {{cite journal |last=Harsanyi |first=John C. |author-link=John Harsanyi |title=Morality and the theory of rational behavior |journal=Social Research |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=623\u201356 |date=Winter 1977 |jstor=40971169 |ref=harv }}</ref> but preference utilitarianism is more commonly associated with [[R.

He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because \"it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that people's only purpose in life is to have 'mental states of intrinsic worth'.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|54}}\n\nAccording to Harsanyi, \"preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy. By this I mean the principle that, in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual, the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}}\n\nHarsanyi adds two caveats. People sometimes have irrational preferences. To deal with this, Harsanyi distinguishes between \"manifest\" preferences and \"true\" preferences. The former are those \"manifested by his observed behaviour, including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs,{{clarify|date=September 2016}} or on careless logical analysis, or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice\" whereas the latter are \"the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information, always reasoned with the greatest possible care, and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}} It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy.\n\nThe second caveat is that antisocial preferences, such as sadism, envy and resentment, have to be excluded. Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community:\n{{quote|Utilitarian ethics makes all of us members of the same moral community. A person displaying ill will toward others does remain a member of this community, but not with his whole personality. That part of his personality that harbours these hostile antisocial feelings must be excluded from membership, and has no claim for a hearing when it comes to defining our concept of social utility.<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|56}}}}\n\n== More varieties of utilitarianism ==\n\n===Negative utilitarianism===\n{{Main|Negative utilitarianism}}\nIn ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1945), [[Karl Popper]] argued that the principle \"maximize pleasure\" should be replaced by \"minimize pain\". He thought \"it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people, since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 2|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278423|page=339}}</ref> He claimed that:<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284\u201385}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure...

A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula \"Maximize pleasure\" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale that lets us treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all...}}\n\nThe actual term ''negative utilitarianism'' was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R.

Consequently, Knutsson argues:\n\n{{quote|The world destruction argument is not a reason to reject negative utilitarianism in favour of these other forms of consequentialism, because there are similar arguments against such theories that are at least as persuasive as the world destruction argument is against negative utilitarianism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=Simon|date=2019-08-29|title=The world destruction argument|journal=Inquiry|volume=0|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631|issn=0020-174X}}</ref></blockquote>}}\n\nFurthermore, Knutsson notes that one could argue that other forms of consequentialism, such as classical utilitarianism, in some cases have less plausible implications than negative utilitarianism, such as in scenarios where classical utilitarianism implies it would be right to kill everyone and replace them in a manner that creates more suffering, but also more well-being such that the sum, on the classical utilitarian calculus, is net positive. Negative utilitarianism, in contrast, would not allow such killing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=Simon|date=2019-08-29|title=The world destruction argument|journal=Inquiry|volume=0|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631|issn=0020-174X}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome versions of negative utilitarianism, negative ''total'' utilitarianism, tolerate suffering that can be compensated within the same person.<ref>Fricke Fabian (2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, p. 14</ref><ref>Arrhenius Gustav (2000), Future Generations, A Challenge for Moral Theory, FD-Diss., Uppsala University, Dept. of Philosophy, Uppsala: University Printers, p. 100</ref>\n\nNegative ''preference'' utilitarianism avoids the problem of moral killing with reference to existing preferences that such killing would violate, while it still demands a justification for the creation of new lives.<ref>Fricke Fabian (2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, pp. 20\u201322</ref> A possible justification is the reduction of the average level of preference-frustration.<ref>{[[Roger Chao|Chao]], \"[http://www.philosophyoflife.org/jpl201204.pdf Negative Average Preference Utilitarianism\"], ''Journal of Philosophy of Life'', 2012; 2(1): 55\u201366</ref>\n\nOthers see negative utilitarianism as a branch within modern hedonistic utilitarianism, which assigns a higher weight to the avoidance of suffering than to the promotion of happiness.<ref>Fricke Fabian(2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, p. 14</ref> The moral weight of suffering can be increased by using a \"compassionate\" utilitarian metric, so that the result is the same as in [[prioritarianism]].<ref>Broome John (1991), Weighing Goods, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, p. 222</ref>\n\nPessimistic representatives of negative utilitarianism can be found in the environment of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Bruno Contestabile: ''Negative Utilitarianism and Buddhist Intuition''.

Similarly, [[R. M. Hare|Hare]] refers to \"the crude caricature of act utilitarianism which is the only version of it that many philosophers seem to be acquainted with.\"<ref>Hare, R. M. (1981) Moral Thinking. Oxford Univ. Press, p. 36</ref> Given what Bentham says about second order evils<ref>Bentham, Jeremy (2009) Theory of Legislation.

Nevertheless, whether they would agree or not, this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory. A classic version of this criticism was given by [[H. J. McCloskey]] in 1957:<ref name=McCloskey1957/>\n{{quote|Suppose that a sheriff were faced with the choice either of framing a Negro for a rape that had aroused hostility to the Negroes (a particular Negro generally being believed to be guilty but whom the sheriff knows not to be guilty)\u2014and thus preventing serious anti-Negro riots which would probably lead to some loss of life and increased hatred of each other by whites and Negroes\u2014or of hunting for the guilty person and thereby allowing the anti-Negro riots to occur, while doing the best he can to combat them. In such a case the sheriff, if he were an extreme utilitarian, would appear to be committed to framing the Negro.}}\n\nBy \"extreme\" utilitarian, McCloskey is referring to what later came to be called \"act\" utilitarianism. He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule: \"do not punish an innocent person\". Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities.\n\nIn a later article, McCloskey says:<ref>McCloskey, H.J. (1963) A Note on Utilitarian Punishment, in Mind, 72, 1963, p. 599</ref>\n{{quote|Surely the utilitarian must admit that whatever the facts of the matter may be, it is logically possible that an 'unjust' system of punishment\u2014e.g. a system involving collective punishments, retroactive laws and punishments, or punishments of parents and relations of the offender\u2014may be more useful than a 'just' system of punishment?}}\n\nAn older form of this argument was presented by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in his book ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. In it, Ivan challenges his brother Alyosha, a utilitarian, to answer his question: <blockquote>Tell me straight out, I call on you\u2014answer me: imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale, of giving them peace and rest at last, but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature, [one child], and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tears\u2014would you agree to be the architect on such conditions?. . . And can you admit the idea that the people for whom you are building would agree to accept their happiness on the unjustified blood of a tortured child, and having accepted it, to remain forever happy?<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/the_dostoevsky_dilemma_for_religious_ethics/ | title=The Dostoevsky Dilemma for Religious Ethics &#124; Center for Inquiry| date=2011-02-15}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Predicting consequences ===\nSome argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. [[Daniel Dennett]] describes this as the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] effect.<ref>Dennett, Daniel (1995), ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Simon & Schuster, p. 498 {{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}}.</ref> Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.\n\nRussell Hardin rejects such arguments. He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is \"to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these\") from our ability to correctly apply rational principles that, among other things, \"depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Russell |title=Morality within the Limits of Reason |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=May 1990 |page=3 |isbn=978-0226316208}}</ref> The fact that the latter is limited and can change doesn't mean that the former has to be rejected. \"If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics. The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant, but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding.\"<ref name=\"Hardin 1990 4\"/>\n\nFrom the beginning, utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the ''tendencies'' of actions to bring about consequences. [[G. E. Moore]], writing in 1903, said:<ref>{{cite book |last=Moore |first=G.

Mill said, \"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/> Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. \"What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last=Chappell |title=The Problem of Moral Demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=151 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> As Shelly Kagan says, \"Given the parameters of the actual world, there is no question that ...(maximally)... promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity...a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kagan |first=Shelly |title=The Limits of Morality |series=Oxford Ethics Series |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1991 |page=360 |isbn=978-0198239161}}</ref>\n\nHooker describes two aspects to the problem: act utilitarianism requires ''huge'' sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only ''slightly'' increased.<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\">{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |title=Ideal Code, Real World: A Rule-Consequentialist Theory of Morality |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=2002 |page=152 |isbn=978-0199256570}}</ref> Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism, \"there is no such thing as morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty.\"<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\"/> Mill was quite clear about this, \"A sacrifice which does not increase, or tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/>\n\nOne response to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: \"No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do, and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |title=Practical Ethics |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011 |pages=202\u20133 |isbn=978-0521707688}}</ref>\n\nOthers argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last= Chappell |title=The problem of moral demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=148 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that \"a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements\" and, secondly, that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that \"the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodin |first=Robert E. |title=Utilitarianism as a Public Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1995 |page=66 |isbn=978-0521468060}}</ref>\n\nGandjour specifically considers market situations and analyses whether individuals who act in markets may produce a utilitarian optimum.

This means that utilitarianism, if correctly interpreted, will yield a moral code with a standard of acceptable conduct very much below the level of highest moral perfection, leaving plenty of scope for supererogatory actions exceeding this minimum standard.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Harsanyi |first= John C. |title= Can the Maximin Principle Serve as a Basis for Morality?

The concept is also important in [[animal rights]] advocate [[Richard D. Ryder|Richard Ryder]]'s rejection of utilitarianism, in which he talks of the \"boundary of the individual\", through which neither pain nor pleasure may pass.<ref>Ryder, Richard D. ''Painism: A Modern Morality''. Centaur Press, 2001. pp. 27\u201329</ref> However, a similar objection was noted in 1970 by [[Thomas Nagel]] (who claimed that consequentialism \"treats the desires, needs, satisfactions, and dissatisfactions of distinct persons as if they were the desires, etc., of a mass person\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nagel |first=Thomas |title=The Possibility of Altruism |publisher=Princeton University Press |edition=New |year=2012 |page=134 |isbn= 978-0691020020}}</ref>), and even earlier by David Gauthier, who wrote that utilitarianism supposes \"that mankind is a super-person, whose greatest satisfaction is the objective of moral action. . . . But this is absurd. Individuals have wants, not mankind; individuals seek satisfaction, not mankind. A person's satisfaction is not part of any greater satisfaction.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Gauthier |first=David |title=Practical Reasoning: The Structure and Foundations of Prudential and Moral Arguments and Their Exemplification in Discourse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1963 |page=126 |isbn= 978-0198241904}}</ref> Thus, the aggregation of utility becomes futile as both pain and happiness are intrinsic to and inseparable from the consciousness in which they are felt, rendering impossible the task of adding up the various pleasures of multiple individuals.\n\nA response to this criticism is to point out that whilst seeming to resolve some problems it introduces others. Intuitively, there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account. As Alastair Norcross has said, \"suppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the building...it is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number, precisely because it is a larger number...

He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures. There isn't five times more loss of happiness or pleasure when five die: who would be feeling this happiness or pleasure? \"Each person's potential loss has the same significance to me, only as a loss to that person alone. because, by hypothesis, I have an equal concern for each person involved, I am moved to give each of them an equal chance to be spared his loss\" (p.&nbsp;307).

Mill responded that there had been ample time to calculate the likely effects:<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill2.htm |title=Utilitarianism, Chapter 2 |author=Mill, John Stuart |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n{{quote|...namely, the whole past duration of the human species. During all that time, mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions; on which experience all the prudence, as well as all the morality of life, are dependent...It is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones. To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination, is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way. The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal, or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another. Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject, which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment.}}\n\nMore recently, Hardin has made the same point. \"It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously. Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense.

For example, if we were given the choice between saving two random people or our mother, most would choose to save their mothers. According to utilitarianism, such a natural action is immoral. The first to respond to this was an early utilitarian and friend of [[Jeremy Bentham]] named [[William Godwin]], who held in his work ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' that such personal needs should be disregarded in favour of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. He wrote, <blockquote>Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife, my mother or my benefactor. That would not alter the truth of the proposition. The life of two would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid; and justice- pure, unadulterated justice- would still have preferred that which was most valuable.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Godwin/pj22.html | title=Godwin, \"Political Justice,\" Book 2, Chap. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Criticisms of utilitarian value theory===\n\nUtilitarianism's assertion that well-being is the only thing with intrinsic moral value has been attacked by various critics.\n\n[[Karl Marx]], in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', criticises Bentham's utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts:<ref>[[s:Das Kapital/Chapter 24#endnote 50|Das Kapital Volume 1, Chapter 24, endnote 50]]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>With the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and future. The Christian religion, e.g., is \"useful,\" \"because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law.\" Artistic criticism is \"harmful,\" because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of [[Martin Tupper]], etc. With such rubbish has the brave fellow, with his motto, \"nulla dies sine linea [no day without a line]\", piled up mountains of books.</blockquote>\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]], following his [[Personalism|personalist philosophy]], argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons, just as much as things, the object of use. \"Utilitarianism,\" he wrote, \"is a civilization of production and of use, a civilization of things and not of persons, a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405033300/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |archivedate=5 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Duty-based criticisms===\n\n[[Roger Scruton]] is a deontologist, and believes that utilitarianism does not give duty the place that it needs inside our ethical judgements.

Scruton wrote, \"Suppose Anna were to reason that it is better to satisfy two healthy young people and frustrate one old one than to satisfy one old person and frustrate two young ones, by a factor of 2.5 to 1: ergo I am leaving.

His explanation that baby farming undermines attitudes of care and concern for the very young, can be applied to babies and the unborn (both 'non-persons' who may be killed, on his view) and contradicts positions that he adopts elsewhere in his work.\n\n== Additional considerations ==\n\n===Average v. total happiness===\n{{Main|Average and total utilitarianism}}\nIn ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', [[Henry Sidgwick]] asked, \"Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum?\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=xxxvi |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref><ref name=\"Sidgwick 1981 415\">{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=415 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref> Paley notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, \"the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions\" and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people.

For example, bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act; aside from this, the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average, as this would raise the average happiness.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |pages=31\u201335 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Shaw suggests that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, \"utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children. However, if you have decided to have a child, then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |page=34 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\n===Motives, intentions, and actions===\nUtilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from [[intention]] and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, \"from every kind of motive, may proceed actions that are good, others that are bad, and others that are indifferent.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation |series=Dover Philosophical Classics |publisher=Dover Publications |date=January 2009 |page=102 |isbn=978-0486454528}}</ref> Mill makes a similar point<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=John |editor-last=Robson |title=Collected Works, volume 31 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1981 |page=51 |chapter=Autobiography |isbn=978-0-7100-0718-6}}</ref> and explicitly says that \"motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent.

In a footnote printed in the second edition of ''Utilitarianism'', Mill says: \"the morality of the action depends entirely upon the intention\u2014that is, upon what the agent wills to do.\"<ref name=\"Mill 1998 65\"/> Elsewhere, he says, \"Intention, and motive, are two very different things. But it is the intention, that is, the foresight of consequences, which constitutes the moral rightness or wrongness of the act.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=John |editor-last=Robson |title=Collected Works, volume 31 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1981 |pages=252\u201353 |chapter=Comments upon James Mill's Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind |isbn= 978-0-7100-0718-6}} and as quoted by {{cite journal |last1=Ridge |first1=Michael |year=2002 |title=Mill's Intentions and Motives |journal=Utilitas |volume=14 |pages=54\u201370 |doi= 10.1017/S0953820800003393|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/11822135/Mill_s_Intentions_and_Motives.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe correct interpretation of Mill's footnote is a matter of some debate. The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why, since it is consequences that matter, intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not. One possibility \"involves supposing that the 'morality' of the act is one thing, probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent, and its rightness or wrongness another.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\">{{cite journal |last1=Dancy |first1=Jonathan |year=2000 |title=Mill's Puzzling Footnote |journal=Utilitas |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=219\u201322 |doi= 10.1017/S095382080000279X}}</ref> [[Jonathan Dancy]] rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent.\n\nAn interpretation given by [[Roger Crisp]] draws on a definition given by Mill in ''[[A System of Logic]]'', where he says that an \"intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |title=A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive |series=Classic Reprint |publisher=Forgotten Books |date=February 2011 |page=51 |isbn=978-1440090820}}</ref> Accordingly, whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention. Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not.\n\nA third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action. Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy, he recognizes that this might not have been Mill's own view, for Mill \"would not even allow that 'p & q' expresses a complex proposition. He wrote in his ''System of Logic'' I iv. 3, of 'Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive', that 'we might as well call a street a complex house, as these two propositions a complex proposition'.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\"/>\n\nFinally, whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action, this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness.\n\n== Humans alone, or other sentient beings? ==\n\n=== Nonhuman animals ===\n{{further|Speciesism|Animal welfare}}\n[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peter Singer]]]]\nIn ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' Bentham wrote \"the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\"<ref name=\"BenthamIntroductiontothePrinciples\">An Introduction to the Principals of Morals and Legislation, Jeremy Bentham, 1789 (\"printed\" in 1780, \"first published\" in 1789, \"corrected by the Author\" in 1823.) See Chapter I: Of the Principle of Utility.  For Bentham on animals, see Ch. XVII Note 122.</ref> Mill's distinction between [[Utilitarianism#Higher and lower pleasures|higher and lower pleasures]] might suggest that he gave more status to humans. However, in his essay \"Whewell on Moral Philosophy\", Mill defends Bentham's position, calling it a 'noble anticipation', and writing: \"Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral', let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mill |first1=J. S. |title=Whewell on Moral Philosophy |url=http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/mill01.pdf | journal=Collected Works |volume=10 | pages = 185\u201387 }}</ref>\n\n[[Henry Sidgwick]] also considers the implications of utilitarianism for nonhuman animals. He writes: \"We have next to consider who the 'all' are, whose happiness is to be taken into account. Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle ... it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of any sentient being.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=414 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref>\n\nAmong contemporary utilitarian philosophers, Peter Singer is especially known for arguing that the well-being of all [[sentience|sentient]] beings ought to be given [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]]. Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creature's self-awareness, regardless of their species. He adds that humans tend to be [[speciesism|speciesist]] (discriminatory against non-humans) in ethical matters, and argues that, on utilitarianism, speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals; all suffering ought to be reduced. Singer writes: \"The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case ... Most human beings are speciesists.\"<ref>Peter Singer, ''Animal Liberation'', Chapter I, pp. 7\u20138, 2nd edition, 1990.</ref>\n\nIn his 1990 edition of ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', Peter Singer said that he no longer ate oysters and mussels, because although the creatures might not suffer, there was a possibility they may and it was easy to avoid eating them in any case.<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm Animal Liberation, Second Edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205080909/http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm |date=5 December 2010 }}, Singer, Peter, 1975, 1990, excerpt, pp. 171\u201374, main passage on oysters, mussels, etc. p. 174 (last paragraph of this excerpt). And in a footnote in the actual book, Singer writes \"My change of mind about mollusks stems from conversations with R.I. Sikora.\"</ref>\n\nThis view still might be contrasted with [[deep ecology]], which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature, whether currently assumed to be sentient or not. According to utilitarianism, the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status, because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer. Singer writes:\n<blockquote>The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering\u2014in so far as rough comparisons can be made\u2014of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.</blockquote>\n\nThus, the moral value of one-celled organisms, as well as some multi-cellular organisms, and natural entities like a river, is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings. Similarly, utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on [[biodiversity]], although the benefits that biodiversity bring to sentient beings may mean that, on utilitarianism, biodiversity ought to be maintained in general.\n\nIn John Stuart Mill's essay \"On Nature\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mill's \"On Nature\"|url = http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/users/philosophy/texts/mill_on.htm|website = www.lancaster.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-09|date = 1904}}</ref> he argues that the [[wild animal suffering|welfare of wild animals]] is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments. [[Tyler Cowen]] argues that, if individual animals are carriers of utility, then we should consider limiting the predatory activity of carnivores relative to their victims: \"At the very least, we should limit current subsidies to nature's carnivores.\"<ref name=\"Cowen2003\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowen | first1 = T. | title = Policing Nature | editor1-last = c.

The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Optimal Taxation of Height: A Case Study of Utilitarian Income Redistribution|author1=N.

Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking.<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism Peter Singer: The why and how of effective altruism | Talk Video].

For instance, [[Jeremy Bentham]], the founder of utilitarianism, described utility as \"that property in any object, whereby it tends to produce benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness...[or] to prevent the happening of mischief, pain, evil, or unhappiness to the party whose interest is considered.\" Utilitarianism is a version of consequentialism, which states that the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong. Unlike other forms of consequentialism, such as [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]], utilitarianism considers the interests of all humans [[Equal consideration of interests|equally]].\n\nProponents of utilitarianism have disagreed on a number of points, such as whether actions should be chosen based on their likely results ([[act utilitarianism]]) or whether [[Agency (philosophy)|agents]] should conform to rules that maximize utility ([[rule utilitarianism]]). There is also disagreement as to whether total ([[Average and total utilitarianism|total utilitarianism]]), average ([[Average and total utilitarianism#Average utilitarianism|average utilitarianism]]) or minimum<ref>{{Citation|last=White|first=Stuart|title=Social Minimum|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/social-minimum/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> utility should be maximized.\n\nThough the seeds of the theory can be found in the [[hedonism|hedonists]] [[Aristippus]] and [[Epicurus]], who viewed happiness as the only good, the tradition of utilitarianism properly began with Bentham, and has included [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Henry Sidgwick]], [[R. M. Hare]], [[David Braybrooke]] and [[Peter Singer]]. It has been applied to social welfare economics, the crisis of global poverty, the [[ethics of eating meat|ethics of raising animals for food]] and the importance of avoiding [[Global catastrophic risk|existential risks]] to humanity.\n\n==Etymology==\nBenthamism, the utilitarian philosophy founded by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was substantially modified by his successor [[John Stuart Mill]], who popularized the word 'Utilitarianism'.<ref name=\"Habibi 2001 89, 112\">{{cite book | last=Habibi | first=Don | title=John Stuart Mill and the Ethic of Human Growth | publisher=Springer Netherlands | location=Dordrecht | year=2001 | isbn=978-90-481-5668-9 |chapter=Chapter 3, Mill's Moral Philosophy | pages=89\u201390, 112| doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2010-6_3 }}</ref> In 1861, Mill acknowledged in a footnote that, though \"believing himself to be the first person who brought the word 'utilitarian' into use, he did not invent it. Rather, he adopted it from a passing expression in\" [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]]'s 1821 novel ''[[Annals of the Parish]]''.<ref>[[John Stuart Mill]] (1861) ''[[s:Utilitarianism|Utilitarianism]]'', footnote 1.</ref> Mill seems to have been unaware that Bentham had used the term 'utilitarian' in his 1781 letter to George Wilson and his 1802 letter to [[\u00c9tienne Dumont]].<ref name=\"Habibi 2001 89, 112\"/><!--source needed for: in Bentham's 1802 letter to Dumont he had claimed that 'Utilitarian' was the proper name for his new creed.-->\n\n==Historical background==\n\n{{see also|Hedonism}}\n\nThe importance of [[happiness]] as an end for humans has long been recognized. Forms of [[hedonism]] were put forward by [[Aristippus]] and [[Epicurus]]; [[Aristotle]] argued that [[eudaimonia]] is the highest human good and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote that \"all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness.\" Happiness was also explored in depth by [[Aquinas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2001.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Man's last end (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 1)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2002.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Things in which man's happiness consists (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 2)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: What is happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 3)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2004.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: Things that are required for happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 4)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2005.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGICA: The attainment of happiness (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 5)|work=newadvent.org}}</ref> Different varieties of consequentialism also existed in the ancient and medieval world, like the [[state consequentialism]] of [[Mohism]] or the political philosophy of [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]. Mohist consequentialism advocated communitarian moral goods including political stability, population growth, and wealth, but did not support the utilitarian notion of maximizing individual happiness.<ref name=\"Fraser\">{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Chris|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F06FKmKKIXwC&pg=PA62|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-532899-8|page=62}}</ref> Utilitarianism as a distinct ethical position only emerged in the eighteenth century.\n\nAlthough utilitarianism is usually thought to start with [[Jeremy Bentham]], there were earlier writers who presented theories that were strikingly similar. \n\n[[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] first introduced a key utilitarian phrase. In ''An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue'' (1725), Hutcheson says<ref>{{cite book |last= Hutcheson |first= Francis |editor-first= J.

In the same way, moral [[evil]], or [[vice]], is proportionate to the number of people made to suffer. The best action is the one that procures the greatest happiness of the greatest numbers\u2014and the worst is the one that causes the most misery.\n\nIn the first three editions of the book, Hutcheson included various mathematical algorithms \"...to compute the Morality of any Actions.\" In this, he pre-figured the [[Felicific calculus|hedonic calculus]] of Bentham.\n\nSome claim that [[John Gay (philosopher)|John Gay]] developed the first systematic theory of utilitarian ethics.<ref>Ashcraft, Richard (1991) John Locke: Critical Assessments (Critical assessments of leading political philosophers), Routledge, p. 691</ref> In ''Concerning the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality'' (1731), Gay argues that:<ref>{{cite book |last= Gay |first= John |editor-first= J.

To ask why I pursue happiness, will admit of no other answer than an explanation of the terms.}}\n\nThis pursuit of happiness is given a theological basis:<ref>{{cite book |last= Gay |first= John |editor-first= J.

I am to do whatever lies in my power towards promoting the happiness of mankind.}}\n\n[[File:Modern Utiitarianism by Birks.png|thumb|''Modern Utilitarianism'' by [[Thomas Rawson Birks]] 1874]]In ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'', 1751, [[David Hume]] writes:<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Philosophy from Montaigne to Kant|last=Hume|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0521003049|editor-last=Schneewind|editor-first=J.

It has been claimed that Paley was not a very original thinker and that the philosophical part of his treatise on ethics is \"an assemblage of ideas developed by others and is presented to be learned by students rather than debated by colleagues.\"<ref name=\"Schneewind 2002 446\">{{cite book |last=Schneewind |first=J.

He writes:<ref>{{cite book |last= Paley |first= William |editor-first= J.

Whatever is expedient, is right. It is the utility of any moral rule alone, which constitutes the obligation of it.\n\nBut to all this there seems a plain objection, viz. that many actions are useful, which no man in his senses will allow to be right. There are occasions, in which the hand of the assassin would be very useful... The true answer is this; that these actions, after all, are not useful, and for that reason, and that alone, are not right.\n\nTo see this point perfectly, it must be observed that the bad consequences of actions are twofold, particular and general. The particular bad consequence of an action, is the mischief which that single action directly and immediately occasions. The general bad consequence is, the violation of some necessary or useful general rule...\n\nYou cannot permit one action and forbid another, without showing a difference between them. Consequently, the same sort of actions must be generally permitted or generally forbidden. Where, therefore, the general permission of them would be pernicious, it becomes necessary to lay down and support the rule which generally forbids them.}}\n\n==Classical utilitarianism==\n\n===Jeremy Bentham===\n{{Main|Jeremy Bentham}}\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]\nBentham's book ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' was printed in 1780 but not published until 1789. It is possible that Bentham was spurred on to publish after he saw the success of Paley's ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy''.<ref name=\"Rosen, Frederick 2003, p. 132\">Rosen, Frederick (2003) Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill.

(1977) Sidgwick's Ethics and Victorian Moral Philosophy, Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 122</ref> but his ideas were spread further when [[Pierre \u00c9tienne Louis Dumont]] translated edited selections from a variety of Bentham's manuscripts into French. ''Trait\u00e9 de legislation civile et p\u00e9nale'' was published in 1802 and then later retranslated back into English by Hildreth as ''The Theory of Legislation'', although by this time significant portions of Dumont's work had already been retranslated and incorporated into Sir [[John Bowring]]'s edition of Bentham's works, which was issued in parts between 1838 and 1843.\n\nBentham's work opens with a statement of the principle of utility:<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation |series=Dover Philosophical Classics |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2009 |page=1 |isbn=978-0486454528}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do... By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever according to the tendency it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action whatsoever, and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of government.}}\n\nIn Chapter IV, Bentham introduces a method of calculating the value of pleasures and pains, which has come to be known as the hedonic calculus. Bentham says that the value of a pleasure or pain, considered by itself, can be measured according to its intensity, duration, certainty/uncertainty and propinquity/remoteness. In addition, it is necessary to consider \"the tendency of any act by which it is produced\" and, therefore, to take account of the act's fecundity, or the chance it has of being followed by sensations of the same kind and its purity, or the chance it has of not being followed by sensations of the opposite kind. Finally, it is necessary to consider the extent, or the number of people affected by the action.\n\nPerhaps aware that Hutcheson eventually removed his algorithms for calculating the greatest happiness because they \"appear'd useless, and were disagreeable to some readers\",<ref name=\"HutchesonIntroduction\">An Inquiry into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue, Francis Hutcheson, Introduction, 1726</ref> Bentham contends that there is nothing novel or unwarranted about his method, for \"in all this there is nothing but what the practice of mankind, wheresoever they have a clear view of their own interest, is perfectly conformable to.\"\n\nRosen warns that descriptions of utilitarianism can bear \"little resemblance historically to utilitarians like Bentham and [[J. S. Mill]]\" and can be more \"a crude version of act utilitarianism conceived in the twentieth century as a [[straw man]] to be attacked and rejected.\"<ref>Rosen, Frederick (2003) Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill. Routledge, p. 32</ref> It is a mistake to think that Bentham is not concerned with rules. His seminal work is concerned with the principles of legislation and the hedonic calculus is introduced with the words \"Pleasures then, and the avoidance of pains, are the ends that the legislator has in view.\" In Chapter VII, Bentham says: \"The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding... In proportion as an act tends to disturb that happiness, in proportion as the tendency of it is pernicious, will be the demand it creates for punishment.\"\n\nThe question then arises as to when, if at all, it might be legitimate to break the law. This is considered in ''The Theory of Legislation'', where Bentham distinguishes between evils of the first and second orders. Those of the first order are the more immediate consequences; those of the second are when the consequences spread through the community causing \"alarm\" and \"danger\".\n\n<blockquote>It is true there are cases in which, if we confine ourselves to the effects of the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon the evil of the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? ... It is not on account of the evil of the first order that it is necessary to erect these actions into offences, but on account of the evil of the second order.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bentham |first1=Jeremy |last2=Dumont |first2=Etienne |last3=Hildreth | first3=R |title=Theory of Legislation: Translated from the French of Etienne Dumont |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |date=November 2005 |pages=58 |isbn=978-1402170348}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===John Stuart Mill===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\nMill was brought up as a Benthamite with the explicit intention that he would carry on the cause of utilitarianism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halevy|first=Elie|title=The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism|year=1966|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-19-101020-0|pages=282\u201384}}</ref> Mill's book ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]'' first appeared as a series of three articles published in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1861 and was reprinted as a single book in 1863.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ethics: A Pluralistic Approach to Moral Theory|last=Hinman|first=Lawrence|publisher=Wadsworth|year=2012|isbn=978-1133050018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=John Stuart|orig-year=1863|last=Mill|date=2010|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TnYZ4tO5640C&pg=PA33 |title=Utilitarianism - Ed.

It would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone.}}\n\nThe word utility is used to mean general well-being or happiness, and Mill's view is that utility is the consequence of a good action. Utility, within the context of utilitarianism, refers to people performing actions for social utility. With social utility, he means the well-being of many people. Mill's explanation of the concept of utility in his work, Utilitarianism, is that people really do desire happiness, and since each individual desires their own happiness, it must follow that all of us desire the happiness of everyone, contributing to a larger social utility. Thus, an action that results in the greatest pleasure for the utility of society is the best action, or as Jeremy Bentham, the founder of early Utilitarianism put it, as the greatest happiness of the greatest number.\n\nMill not only viewed actions as a core part of utility, but as the directive rule of moral human conduct. The rule being that we should only be committing actions that provide pleasure to society. This view of pleasure was hedonistic, as it pursued the thought that pleasure is the highest good in life. This concept was adopted by Bentham and can be seen in his works. According to Mill, good actions result in pleasure, and that there is no higher end than pleasure. Mill says that good actions lead to pleasure and define good [[Moral character|character]]. Better put, the justification of character, and whether an action is good or not, is based on how the person contributes to the concept of social utility. In the long run the best proof of a good character is good actions; and resolutely refuse to consider any mental disposition as good, of which the predominant tendency is to produce bad conduct. In the last chapter of Utilitarianism, Mill concludes that justice, as a classifying factor of our actions (being just or unjust) is one of the certain moral requirements, and when the requirements are all regarded collectively, they are viewed as greater according to this scale of \"social utility\" as Mill puts it.\n\nHe also notes that, contrary to what its critics might say, there is \"no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect... a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation.\" However, he accepts that this is usually because the intellectual pleasures are thought to have circumstantial advantages, i.e. \"greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, &c.\" Instead, Mill will argue that some pleasures are intrinsically better than others.\n\nThe accusation that hedonism is a \"doctrine worthy only of swine\" has a long history. In ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book 1 Chapter 5), [[Aristotle]] says that identifying the good with pleasure is to prefer a life suitable for beasts. The theological utilitarians had the option of grounding their pursuit of happiness in the will of God; the hedonistic utilitarians needed a different defence. Mill's approach is to argue that the pleasures of the intellect are intrinsically superior to physical pleasures.\n\n<blockquote>Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures; no intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs... A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence... It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question...<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=Roger |editor-last=Crisp |title=Utilitarianism |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |pages=56\u201357 |isbn=978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMill argues that if people who are \"competently acquainted\" with two pleasures show a decided preference for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and \"would not resign it for any quantity of the other\", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these \"competent judges\" will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, the judgment of the majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that \"many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher.\" Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for there is no other way of measuring \"the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations.\" \"It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect.\"<ref>John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism, Chapter 2</ref>\n\nMill also thinks that \"intellectual pursuits have value out of proportion to the amount of contentment or pleasure (the mental state) that they produce\".<ref>Brink, David. \"Mill Moral and Political Philosophy\". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill-moral-political [accessed 27 April 2018].</ref> Mill also says that people should pursue these grand ideals, because if they choose to have gratification from petty pleasures, \"some displeasure will eventually creep in. We will become bored and depressed.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0953820811000264|title = No Philosophy for Swine: John Stuart Mill on the Quality of Pleasures| journal=Utilitas| volume=23| issue=4| pages=428\u2013446|year = 2011|last1 = Hauskeller|first1 = Michael| hdl=10871/9381}}</ref> Mill claims that gratification from petty pleasures only gives short-term happiness and, subsequently, worsens the individual who may feel that his life lacks happiness, since the happiness is transient. Whereas, intellectual pursuits give long-term happiness because they provide the individual with constant opportunities throughout the years to improve his life, by benefiting from accruing knowledge. Mill views intellectual pursuits as \"capable of incorporating the 'finer things' in life\" while petty pursuits do not achieve this goal.<ref>Saunders, Ben. \"J. S. Mill's Conception of Utility.\" Utilitas 22, no. 1 (March 2010): 52-69. https://search.proquest.com/docview/200183451 [accessed 27 April 2018]</ref> Mill is saying that intellectual pursuits give the individual the opportunity to escape the constant depression cycle since these pursuits allow them to achieve their ideals, while petty pleasures do not offer this. Although debate persists about the nature of Mill's view of gratification, this suggests bifurcation in his position.\n\n==== Mill's 'proof' of the principle of utility ====\nIn Chapter Four of ''Utilitarianism'', Mill considers what proof can be given for the principle of utility. He says:<ref>{{cite book |last = Mill | first = John Stuart |editor-first= Roger |editor-last= Crisp |title = Utilitarianism |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page = 81 |isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref>\n{{quote|The only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is that people actually see it.

No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness... we have not only all the proof which the case admits of, but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons.}}\n\nIt is usual<ref name=\"Popkin, Richard H. 1950, p. 66\">{{cite journal |last=Popkin |first=Richard H. |year=1950 |title=A Note on the 'Proof' of Utility in J. S. Mill |journal=Ethics |volume=61 |page=66 |doi=10.1086/290751}}</ref> to say that Mill is committing a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the [[naturalistic fallacy]], because he is trying to deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of [[equivocation]], because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the [[fallacy of composition]], because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.\n\nSuch allegations began to emerge in Mill's lifetime, shortly after the publication of ''Utilitarianism'', and persisted for well over a century, though the tide has been turning in recent discussions.\n\nA defence of Mill against all three charges, with a chapter devoted to each, can be found in Necip Fikri Alican's ''Mill's Principle of Utility: A Defense of John Stuart Mill's Notorious Proof'' (1994). This is the first, and remains{{when|date=January 2019}} the only, book-length treatment of the subject matter. Yet the alleged fallacies in the proof continue to attract scholarly attention in journal articles and book chapters.\n\nHall<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Everett W. |year=1949 |title=The 'Proof' of Utility in Bentham and Mill |journal=Ethics |volume=60 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1086/290691}}</ref> and Popkin<ref>{{cite journal |last=Popkin |first=Richard H. |year=1950 |title=A Note on the 'Proof' of Utility in J.

Mill anticipates the objection that people desire other things such as virtue. He argues that whilst people might start desiring virtue as a ''means'' to happiness, eventually, it becomes part of someone's happiness and is then desired as an end in itself.\n\n{{quote|The principle of utility does not mean that any given pleasure, as music, for instance, or any given exemption from pain, as for example health, are to be looked upon as means to a collective something termed happiness, and to be desired on that account. They are desired and desirable in and for themselves; besides being means, they are a part of the end.

E. Moore]]. In ''Ethics'' (1912), Moore rejected a purely hedonistic utilitarianism and argued that there is a range of values that might be maximized. Moore's strategy was to show that it is intuitively implausible that pleasure is the sole measure of what is good. He says that such an assumption:<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\">Moore, G. E. (1912).  ''Ethics'', London: Williams and Norgate, Ch. 7</ref>\n{{quote|involves our saying, for instance, that a world in which absolutely nothing except pleasure existed\u2014no knowledge, no love, no enjoyment of beauty, no moral qualities\u2014must yet be intrinsically better\u2014better worth creating\u2014provided only the total quantity of pleasure in it were the least bit greater, than one in which all these things existed as well as pleasure.\n\nIt involves our saying that, even if the total quantity of pleasure in each was exactly equal, yet the fact that all the beings in the one possessed, in addition knowledge of many different kinds and a full appreciation of all that was beautiful or worthy of love in their world, whereas none of the beings in the other possessed any of these things, would give us no reason whatever for preferring the former to the latter.}}\n\nMoore admits that it is impossible to prove the case either way, but he believed that it was intuitively obvious that even if the amount of pleasure stayed the same a world that contained such things as beauty and love would be a better world. He adds that, if a person was to take the contrary view, then \"I think it is self-evident that he would be wrong.\"<ref name=\"Moore, G. E. 1912\"/>\n\n=== Act and rule utilitarianism ===\nIn the mid-twentieth century a number of philosophers focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thinking.<ref>Bayles, M. D., ed. (1968) Contemporary Utilitarianism, Anchor Books, Doubleday</ref> It was already accepted that it is necessary to use rules to help you choose the right action because the problems of calculating the consequences on each and every occasion would almost certainly result in you frequently choosing something less than the best course of action. Paley had justified the use of rules and Mill says:<ref>{{cite book |last = Mill | first = John Stuart |editor-first= Roger |editor-last= Crisp |title = Utilitarianism |publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 1998 |page = 70 |isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|It is truly a whimsical supposition that, if mankind were agreed in considering utility to be the test of morality, they would remain without any agreement as to what is useful, and would take no measures for having their notions on the subject taught to the young, and enforced by law and opinion... to consider the rules of morality as improvable, is one thing; to pass over the intermediate generalisations entirely, and endeavour to test each individual action directly by the first principle, is another... The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal... Nobody argues that the art of navigation is not founded on astronomy, because sailors cannot wait to calculate the Nautical Almanack. Being rational creatures, they go to sea with it ready calculated; and all rational creatures go out upon the sea of life with their minds made up on the common questions of right and wrong.}}\n\nHowever, rule utilitarianism proposes a more central role for rules that was thought to rescue the theory from some of its more devastating criticisms, particularly problems to do with justice and promise keeping. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, articles were published both for and against the new form of utilitarianism, and through this debate the theory we now call rule utilitarianism was created. In an introduction to an anthology of these articles, the editor was able to say: \"The development of this theory was a dialectical process of formulation, criticism, reply and reformulation; the record of this process well illustrates the co-operative development of a philosophical theory.\"<ref>Bayles, M.

[[Act utilitarianism]] maintains that an action is right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.\n\nIn 1956, Urmson published an influential article<ref>{{cite journal |last=Urmson |first=J.

From then on, articles have debated this interpretation of Mill. In all probability, it was not a distinction that Mill was particularly trying to make and so the evidence in his writing is inevitably mixed. A collection of Mill's writing published in 1977 includes a letter in which he says:<ref>Mill, John Stuart, The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill. Gen. Ed. John M. Robson. 33 vols.

However, it is not clear that this distinction is made in the academic literature.\n\nIt has been argued that rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism, because for any given rule, in the case where breaking the rule produces more utility, the rule can be refined by the addition of a sub-rule that handles cases like the exception.<ref>David Lyons, ''Forms and Limits of Utilitarianism'', 1965</ref> This process holds for all cases of exceptions, and so the \"rules\" have as many \"sub-rules\" as there are exceptional cases, which, in the end, makes an agent seek out whatever outcome produces the maximum utility.<ref>Allen Habib (2008), ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/promises/ Promises]'', in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].</ref>\n\n=== Two-level utilitarianism ===\n{{Main|Two-level utilitarianism}}\nIn ''Principles'' (1973),<ref name=\"HareRM\">{{cite journal | last = Hare | first = R.

The \"archangel\" is the hypothetical person who has perfect knowledge of the situation and no personal biases or weaknesses and always uses critical moral thinking to decide the right thing to do; the \"prole\" is the hypothetical person who is completely incapable of critical thinking and uses nothing but intuitive moral thinking and, of necessity, has to follow the general moral rules they have been taught or learned through imitation.<ref name=\"Hare 1981 b\">{{cite book | last = Hare | first = R.M. | author-link = R.

He also rejects ideal utilitarianism because \"it is certainly not true as an empirical observation that people's only purpose in life is to have 'mental states of intrinsic worth'.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|54}}\n\nAccording to Harsanyi, \"preference utilitarianism is the only form of utilitarianism consistent with the important philosophical principle of preference autonomy. By this I mean the principle that, in deciding what is good and what is bad for a given individual, the ultimate criterion can only be his own wants and his own preferences.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}}\n\nHarsanyi adds two caveats. People sometimes have irrational preferences. To deal with this, Harsanyi distinguishes between \"manifest\" preferences and \"true\" preferences. The former are those \"manifested by his observed behaviour, including preferences possibly based on erroneous factual beliefs,{{clarify|date=September 2016}} or on careless logical analysis, or on strong emotions that at the moment greatly hinder rational choice\" whereas the latter are \"the preferences he would have if he had all the relevant factual information, always reasoned with the greatest possible care, and were in a state of mind most conducive to rational choice.\"<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|55}} It is the latter that preference utilitarianism tries to satisfy.\n\nThe second caveat is that antisocial preferences, such as sadism, envy and resentment, have to be excluded. Harsanyi achieves this by claiming that such preferences partially exclude those people from the moral community:\n{{quote|Utilitarian ethics makes all of us members of the same moral community. A person displaying ill will toward others does remain a member of this community, but not with his whole personality. That part of his personality that harbours these hostile antisocial feelings must be excluded from membership, and has no claim for a hearing when it comes to defining our concept of social utility.<ref name=\"Harsanyi\"/>{{rp|56}}}}\n\n== More varieties of utilitarianism ==\n\n===Negative utilitarianism===\n{{Main|Negative utilitarianism}}\nIn ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1945), [[Karl Popper]] argued that the principle \"maximize pleasure\" should be replaced by \"minimize pain\". He thought \"it is not only impossible but very dangerous to attempt to maximize the pleasure or the happiness of the people, since such an attempt must lead to totalitarianism.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 2|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415278423|page=339}}</ref> He claimed that:<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper|first=Karl|title=The Open Society and Its Enemies: Volume 1: The Spell of Plato|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415237314|pages=284\u201385}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure... In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula \"Maximize pleasure\" is that it assumes a continuous pleasure-pain scale that lets us treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number, one should demand, more modestly, the least amount of avoidable suffering for all...}}\n\nThe actual term ''negative utilitarianism'' was introduced by [[Ninian Smart|R.

Smart]] as the title to his 1958 reply to Popper<ref name=Smart1958>{{cite journal |last=Smart |first=R.N. |title=Negative Utilitarianism |journal=Mind |volume=67 |issue=268 |date=October 1958 |pages=542\u201343 |jstor=2251207 |doi=10.1093/mind/lxvii.268.542}}</ref> in which he argued that the principle would entail seeking the quickest and least painful method of killing the entirety of humanity.\n\nIn response to Smart's argument, Simon Knutsson has argued that classical utilitarianism and similar consequentialist views are roughly equally likely to entail killing the entirety of humanity, as they would seem, in theory, to imply that one should kill existing beings and replace them with happier beings if possible. Consequently, Knutsson argues:\n\n{{quote|The world destruction argument is not a reason to reject negative utilitarianism in favour of these other forms of consequentialism, because there are similar arguments against such theories that are at least as persuasive as the world destruction argument is against negative utilitarianism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=Simon|date=2019-08-29|title=The world destruction argument|journal=Inquiry|volume=0|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631|issn=0020-174X}}</ref></blockquote>}}\n\nFurthermore, Knutsson notes that one could argue that other forms of consequentialism, such as classical utilitarianism, in some cases have less plausible implications than negative utilitarianism, such as in scenarios where classical utilitarianism implies it would be right to kill everyone and replace them in a manner that creates more suffering, but also more well-being such that the sum, on the classical utilitarian calculus, is net positive. Negative utilitarianism, in contrast, would not allow such killing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Knutsson|first=Simon|date=2019-08-29|title=The world destruction argument|journal=Inquiry|volume=0|pages=1\u201320|doi=10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631|issn=0020-174X}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome versions of negative utilitarianism, negative ''total'' utilitarianism, tolerate suffering that can be compensated within the same person.<ref>Fricke Fabian (2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, p. 14</ref><ref>Arrhenius Gustav (2000), Future Generations, A Challenge for Moral Theory, FD-Diss., Uppsala University, Dept. of Philosophy, Uppsala: University Printers, p. 100</ref>\n\nNegative ''preference'' utilitarianism avoids the problem of moral killing with reference to existing preferences that such killing would violate, while it still demands a justification for the creation of new lives.<ref>Fricke Fabian (2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, pp. 20\u201322</ref> A possible justification is the reduction of the average level of preference-frustration.<ref>{[[Roger Chao|Chao]], \"[http://www.philosophyoflife.org/jpl201204.pdf Negative Average Preference Utilitarianism\"], ''Journal of Philosophy of Life'', 2012; 2(1): 55\u201366</ref>\n\nOthers see negative utilitarianism as a branch within modern hedonistic utilitarianism, which assigns a higher weight to the avoidance of suffering than to the promotion of happiness.<ref>Fricke Fabian(2002), Verschiedene Versionen des negativen Utilitarismus, Kriterion, vol.15, no.1, p. 14</ref> The moral weight of suffering can be increased by using a \"compassionate\" utilitarian metric, so that the result is the same as in [[prioritarianism]].<ref>Broome John (1991), Weighing Goods, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, p. 222</ref>\n\nPessimistic representatives of negative utilitarianism can be found in the environment of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Bruno Contestabile: ''Negative Utilitarianism and Buddhist Intuition''.

Ray Briggs writes in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'':<ref>{{citation|last1=Briggs|first1=Rachael |title=Normative Theories of Rational Choice: Expected Utility |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/rationality-normative-utility/ |year=2017 |edition=Spring 2017 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|One objection to this interpretation of utility is that there may not be a single good (or indeed any good) which rationality requires us to seek. But if we understand \"utility\" broadly enough to include all potentially desirable ends\u2014pleasure, knowledge, friendship, health and so on\u2014it's not clear that there is a unique correct way to make the tradeoffs between different goods so that each outcome receives a utility. There may be no good answer to the question of whether the life of an ascetic monk contains more or less good than the life of a happy libertine\u2014but assigning utilities to these options forces us to compare them.}}\n\nUtility understood this way is a [[#Preference utilitarianism|personal preference]], in the absence of any objective measurement.\n\n===Utility ignores justice===\nAs Rosen<ref name=\"Rosen, Frederick 2003, p. 132\"/> has pointed out, claiming that act utilitarians are not concerned about having rules is to set up a \"straw man\". Similarly, [[R. M. Hare|Hare]] refers to \"the crude caricature of act utilitarianism which is the only version of it that many philosophers seem to be acquainted with.\"<ref>Hare, R. M. (1981) Moral Thinking. Oxford Univ. Press, p. 36</ref> Given what Bentham says about second order evils<ref>Bentham, Jeremy (2009) Theory of Legislation. General Books LLC, p. 58</ref> it would be a serious misrepresentation to say that he and similar act utilitarians would be prepared to punish an innocent person for the greater good. Nevertheless, whether they would agree or not, this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory. A classic version of this criticism was given by [[H. J. McCloskey]] in 1957:<ref name=McCloskey1957/>\n{{quote|Suppose that a sheriff were faced with the choice either of framing a Negro for a rape that had aroused hostility to the Negroes (a particular Negro generally being believed to be guilty but whom the sheriff knows not to be guilty)\u2014and thus preventing serious anti-Negro riots which would probably lead to some loss of life and increased hatred of each other by whites and Negroes\u2014or of hunting for the guilty person and thereby allowing the anti-Negro riots to occur, while doing the best he can to combat them. In such a case the sheriff, if he were an extreme utilitarian, would appear to be committed to framing the Negro.}}\n\nBy \"extreme\" utilitarian, McCloskey is referring to what later came to be called \"act\" utilitarianism. He suggests one response might be that the sheriff would not frame the innocent negro because of another rule: \"do not punish an innocent person\". Another response might be that the riots the sheriff is trying to avoid might have positive utility in the long run by drawing attention to questions of race and resources to help address tensions between the communities.\n\nIn a later article, McCloskey says:<ref>McCloskey, H.J. (1963) A Note on Utilitarian Punishment, in Mind, 72, 1963, p. 599</ref>\n{{quote|Surely the utilitarian must admit that whatever the facts of the matter may be, it is logically possible that an 'unjust' system of punishment\u2014e.g. a system involving collective punishments, retroactive laws and punishments, or punishments of parents and relations of the offender\u2014may be more useful than a 'just' system of punishment?}}\n\nAn older form of this argument was presented by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in his book ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. In it, Ivan challenges his brother Alyosha, a utilitarian, to answer his question: <blockquote>Tell me straight out, I call on you\u2014answer me: imagine that you yourself are building the edifice of human destiny with the object of making people happy in the finale, of giving them peace and rest at last, but for that you must inevitably and unavoidably torture just one tiny creature, [one child], and raise your edifice on the foundation of her unrequited tears\u2014would you agree to be the architect on such conditions?. . . And can you admit the idea that the people for whom you are building would agree to accept their happiness on the unjustified blood of a tortured child, and having accepted it, to remain forever happy?<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/the_dostoevsky_dilemma_for_religious_ethics/ | title=The Dostoevsky Dilemma for Religious Ethics &#124; Center for Inquiry| date=2011-02-15}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Predicting consequences ===\nSome argue that it is impossible to do the calculation that utilitarianism requires because consequences are inherently unknowable. [[Daniel Dennett]] describes this as the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] effect.<ref>Dennett, Daniel (1995), ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Simon & Schuster, p. 498 {{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}}.</ref> Dennett points out that not only is it impossible to assign a precise utility value to the incident, it is impossible to know whether, ultimately, the near-meltdown that occurred was a good or bad thing. He suggests that it would have been a good thing if plant operators learned lessons that prevented future serious incidents.\n\nRussell Hardin rejects such arguments. He argues that it is possible to distinguish the moral impulse of utilitarianism (which is \"to define the right as good consequences and to motivate people to achieve these\") from our ability to correctly apply rational principles that, among other things, \"depend on the perceived facts of the case and on the particular moral actor's mental equipment.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardin |first=Russell |title=Morality within the Limits of Reason |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=May 1990 |page=3 |isbn=978-0226316208}}</ref> The fact that the latter is limited and can change doesn't mean that the former has to be rejected. \"If we develop a better system for determining relevant causal relations so that we are able to choose actions that better produce our intended ends, it does not follow that we then must change our ethics. The moral impulse of utilitarianism is constant, but our decisions under it are contingent on our knowledge and scientific understanding.\"<ref name=\"Hardin 1990 4\"/>\n\nFrom the beginning, utilitarianism has recognized that certainty in such matters is unobtainable and both Bentham and Mill said that it was necessary to rely on the ''tendencies'' of actions to bring about consequences. [[G. E. Moore]], writing in 1903, said:<ref>{{cite book |last=Moore |first=G. E. |title=Principia Ethica |publisher=Prometheus Books UK |year=1903 |pages=203\u20134 |isbn=978-0879754983}}</ref>\n{{quote|We certainly cannot hope directly to compare their effects except within a limited future; and all the arguments, which have ever been used in Ethics, and upon which we commonly act in common life, directed to shewing that one course is superior to another, are (apart from theological dogmas) confined to pointing out such probable immediate advantages...\n\nAn ethical law has the nature not of a scientific law but of a scientific ''prediction'': and the latter is always merely probable, although the probability may be very great.}}\n\n===Demandingness objection===\nAct utilitarianism not only requires everyone to do what they can to maximize utility, but to do so without any favouritism. Mill said, \"As between his own happiness and that of others, utilitarianism requires him to be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/> Critics say that this combination of requirements leads to utilitarianism making unreasonable demands. The well-being of strangers counts just as much as that of friends, family or self. \"What makes this requirement so demanding is the gargantuan number of strangers in great need of help and the indefinitely many opportunities to make sacrifices to help them.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last=Chappell |title=The Problem of Moral Demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=151 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> As Shelly Kagan says, \"Given the parameters of the actual world, there is no question that ...(maximally)... promoting the good would require a life of hardship, self-denial, and austerity...a life spent promoting the good would be a severe one indeed.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Kagan |first=Shelly |title=The Limits of Morality |series=Oxford Ethics Series |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=1991 |page=360 |isbn=978-0198239161}}</ref>\n\nHooker describes two aspects to the problem: act utilitarianism requires ''huge'' sacrifices from those who are relatively better off and also requires sacrifice of your own good even when the aggregate good will be only ''slightly'' increased.<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\">{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |title=Ideal Code, Real World: A Rule-Consequentialist Theory of Morality |publisher=Clarendon Press |date=2002 |page=152 |isbn=978-0199256570}}</ref> Another way of highlighting the complaint is to say that in utilitarianism, \"there is no such thing as morally permissible self-sacrifice that goes above and beyond the call of duty.\"<ref name=\"Hooker 2002 152\"/> Mill was quite clear about this, \"A sacrifice which does not increase, or tend to increase, the sum total of happiness, it considers as wasted.\"<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\"/>\n\nOne response to the problem is to accept its demands. This is the view taken by Peter Singer, who says: \"No doubt we do instinctively prefer to help those who are close to us. Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do, and it is difficult to see any sound moral justification for the view that distance, or community membership, makes a crucial difference to our obligations.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |title=Practical Ethics |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011 |pages=202\u20133 |isbn=978-0521707688}}</ref>\n\nOthers argue that a moral theory that is so contrary to our deeply held moral convictions must either be rejected or modified.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hooker |first=Brad |editor-first=Timothy |editor-last= Chappell |title=The problem of moral demandingness: new philosophical essays |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |date=2011 |page=148 |chapter=Chapter 8: The Demandingness Objection |isbn=9780230219403}}</ref> There have been various attempts to modify utilitarianism to escape its seemingly over-demanding requirements.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

Kagan suggests that such a procedure might be justified on the grounds that \"a general requirement to promote the good would lack the motivational underpinning necessary for genuine moral requirements\" and, secondly, that personal independence is necessary for the existence of commitments and close personal relations and that \"the value of such commitments yields a positive reason for preserving within moral theory at least some moral independence for the personal point of view.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kagan|first= Shelly |title=Does Consequentialism Demand too Much?

He suggests that many of the problems arise under the traditional formulation because the conscientious utilitarian ends up having to make up for the failings of others and so contributing more than their fair share.<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodin |first=Robert E. |title=Utilitarianism as a Public Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1995 |page=66 |isbn=978-0521468060}}</ref>\n\nGandjour specifically considers market situations and analyses whether individuals who act in markets may produce a utilitarian optimum.

Intuitively, there are many cases where people do want to take the numbers involved into account. As Alastair Norcross has said, \"suppose that Homer is faced with the painful choice between saving Barney from a burning building or saving both Moe and Apu from the building...it is clearly better for Homer to save the larger number, precisely because it is a larger number...

He argues that each person can only lose one person's happiness or pleasures.

Mill responded that there had been ample time to calculate the likely effects:<ref name=\"Mill, John Stuart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill2.htm |title=Utilitarianism, Chapter 2 |author=Mill, John Stuart |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>\n{{quote|...namely, the whole past duration of the human species. During all that time, mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions; on which experience all the prudence, as well as all the morality of life, are dependent...It is a strange notion that the acknowledgment of a first principle is inconsistent with the admission of secondary ones. To inform a traveller respecting the place of his ultimate destination, is not to forbid the use of landmarks and direction-posts on the way. The proposition that happiness is the end and aim of morality, does not mean that no road ought to be laid down to that goal, or that persons going thither should not be advised to take one direction rather than another. Men really ought to leave off talking a kind of nonsense on this subject, which they would neither talk nor listen to on other matters of practical concernment.}}\n\nMore recently, Hardin has made the same point. \"It should embarrass philosophers that they have ever taken this objection seriously. Parallel considerations in other realms are dismissed with eminently good sense.

For example, if we were given the choice between saving two random people or our mother, most would choose to save their mothers. According to utilitarianism, such a natural action is immoral. The first to respond to this was an early utilitarian and friend of [[Jeremy Bentham]] named [[William Godwin]], who held in his work ''[[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'' that such personal needs should be disregarded in favour of the greatest good for the greatest number of people. He wrote, <blockquote>Supposing the chambermaid had been my wife, my mother or my benefactor. That would not alter the truth of the proposition. The life of two would still be more valuable than that of the chambermaid; and justice- pure, unadulterated justice- would still have preferred that which was most valuable.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Godwin/pj22.html | title=Godwin, \"Political Justice,\" Book 2, Chap. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Criticisms of utilitarian value theory===\n\nUtilitarianism's assertion that well-being is the only thing with intrinsic moral value has been attacked by various critics.\n\n[[Karl Marx]], in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', criticises Bentham's utilitarianism on the grounds that it does not appear to recognise that people have different joys in different socioeconomic contexts:<ref>[[s:Das Kapital/Chapter 24#endnote 50|Das Kapital Volume 1, Chapter 24, endnote 50]]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>With the driest naivete he takes the modern shopkeeper, especially the English shopkeeper, as the normal man. Whatever is useful to this queer normal man, and to his world, is absolutely useful. This yard-measure, then, he applies to past, present, and future. The Christian religion, e.g., is \"useful,\" \"because it forbids in the name of religion the same faults that the penal code condemns in the name of the law.\" Artistic criticism is \"harmful,\" because it disturbs worthy people in their enjoyment of [[Martin Tupper]], etc. With such rubbish has the brave fellow, with his motto, \"nulla dies sine linea [no day without a line]\", piled up mountains of books.</blockquote>\n\n[[Pope John Paul II]], following his [[Personalism|personalist philosophy]], argued that a danger of utilitarianism is that it tends to make persons, just as much as things, the object of use. \"Utilitarianism,\" he wrote, \"is a civilization of production and of use, a civilization of things and not of persons, a civilization in which persons are used in the same way as things are used.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405033300/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_02021994_families_en.html |archivedate=5 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Duty-based criticisms===\n\n[[Roger Scruton]] is a deontologist, and believes that utilitarianism does not give duty the place that it needs inside our ethical judgements. He asks us to consider the dilemma of [[Anna Karenina]], who had to choose between her love of Vronsky and her duty towards her husband and her son. Scruton wrote, \"Suppose Anna were to reason that it is better to satisfy two healthy young people and frustrate one old one than to satisfy one old person and frustrate two young ones, by a factor of 2.5 to 1: ergo I am leaving. What would we think, then, of her moral seriousness?\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scruton |first1=Roger |author-link=Roger Scruton |title=On Human Nature |publisher=Princeton |date=2017 |pages=96 |isbn=978-0-691-18303-9}}</ref>\n\n===Baby farming===\n\nA critic of utilitarianism, in ''Innocence and Consequentialism'' [[Jacqueline Laing]] argued in 1996 that utilitarianism has insufficient conceptual apparatus to comprehend the very idea of innocence, a feature central to any comprehensive ethical theory.<ref>Laing, Jacqueline A.

His explanation that baby farming undermines attitudes of care and concern for the very young, can be applied to babies and the unborn (both 'non-persons' who may be killed, on his view) and contradicts positions that he adopts elsewhere in his work.\n\n== Additional considerations ==\n\n===Average v. total happiness===\n{{Main|Average and total utilitarianism}}\nIn ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', [[Henry Sidgwick]] asked, \"Is it total or average happiness that we seek to make a maximum?\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=xxxvi |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref><ref name=\"Sidgwick 1981 415\">{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=415 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref> Paley notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, \"the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions\" and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people. Consequently, \"the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmoral08palegoog/page/n4 |title=The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy |last=Paley |first=William |year=1785 |accessdate =1 July 2012}}</ref> A similar view was expressed by Smart, who argued that, all other things being equal, a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smart |first1=J.

In other words, according to the theory, it is a moral good to breed more people on the world for as long as total happiness rises.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parfit |first=Derek |title=Reasons and Persons |publisher=Oxford Paperbacks |date=January 1986 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reasonspersons00parf/page/388 388] |isbn=978-0198249085 |url=https://archive.org/details/reasonspersons00parf/page/388 }}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, measuring the utility of a population based on the average utility of that population avoids [[Derek Parfit|Parfit's]] repugnant conclusion but causes other problems. For example, bringing a moderately happy person into a very happy world would be seen as an immoral act; aside from this, the theory implies that it would be a moral good to eliminate all people whose happiness is below average, as this would raise the average happiness.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |pages=31\u201335 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Shaw suggests that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, \"utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children. However, if you have decided to have a child, then you have an obligation to give birth to the happiest child you can.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=William |title=Contemporary Ethics: Taking Account of Utilitarianism |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=November 1998 |page=34 |isbn=978-0631202943}}</ref>\n\n===Motives, intentions, and actions===\nUtilitarianism is typically taken to assess the rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just the consequences of that action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from [[intention]] and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, \"from every kind of motive, may proceed actions that are good, others that are bad, and others that are indifferent.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation |series=Dover Philosophical Classics |publisher=Dover Publications |date=January 2009 |page=102 |isbn=978-0486454528}}</ref> Mill makes a similar point<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |editor-first=John |editor-last=Robson |title=Collected Works, volume 31 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1981 |page=51 |chapter=Autobiography |isbn=978-0-7100-0718-6}}</ref> and explicitly says that \"motive has nothing to do with the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent.

The difficulty in interpretation centres around trying to explain why, since it is consequences that matter, intentions should play a role in the assessment of the morality of an action but motives should not. One possibility \"involves supposing that the 'morality' of the act is one thing, probably to do with the praiseworthiness or blameworthiness of the agent, and its rightness or wrongness another.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\">{{cite journal |last1=Dancy |first1=Jonathan |year=2000 |title=Mill's Puzzling Footnote |journal=Utilitas |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=219\u201322 |doi= 10.1017/S095382080000279X}}</ref> [[Jonathan Dancy]] rejects this interpretation on the grounds that Mill is explicitly making intention relevant to an assessment of the act not to an assessment of the agent.\n\nAn interpretation given by [[Roger Crisp]] draws on a definition given by Mill in ''[[A System of Logic]]'', where he says that an \"intention to produce the effect, is one thing; the effect produced in consequence of the intention, is another thing; the two together constitute the action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |title=A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive |series=Classic Reprint |publisher=Forgotten Books |date=February 2011 |page=51 |isbn=978-1440090820}}</ref> Accordingly, whilst two actions may outwardly appear to be the same they will be different actions if there is a different intention. Dancy notes that this does not explain why intentions count but motives do not.\n\nA third interpretation is that an action might be considered a complex action consisting of several stages and it is the intention that determines which of these stages are to be considered part of the action. Although this is the interpretation favoured by Dancy, he recognizes that this might not have been Mill's own view, for Mill \"would not even allow that 'p & q' expresses a complex proposition. He wrote in his ''System of Logic'' I iv. 3, of 'Caesar is dead and Brutus is alive', that 'we might as well call a street a complex house, as these two propositions a complex proposition'.\"<ref name=\"Mill's Puzzling Footnote\"/>\n\nFinally, whilst motives may not play a role in determining the morality of an action, this does not preclude utilitarians from fostering particular motives if doing so will increase overall happiness.\n\n== Humans alone, or other sentient beings? ==\n\n=== Nonhuman animals ===\n{{further|Speciesism|Animal welfare}}\n[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peter Singer]]]]\nIn ''An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation'' Bentham wrote \"the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\"<ref name=\"BenthamIntroductiontothePrinciples\">An Introduction to the Principals of Morals and Legislation, Jeremy Bentham, 1789 (\"printed\" in 1780, \"first published\" in 1789, \"corrected by the Author\" in 1823.)

XVII Note 122.</ref> Mill's distinction between [[Utilitarianism#Higher and lower pleasures|higher and lower pleasures]] might suggest that he gave more status to humans. However, in his essay \"Whewell on Moral Philosophy\", Mill defends Bentham's position, calling it a 'noble anticipation', and writing: \"Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man; is that practice moral or immoral? And if, exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness, they do not with one voice answer 'immoral', let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mill |first1=J.

He writes: \"We have next to consider who the 'all' are, whose happiness is to be taken into account. Are we to extend our concern to all the beings capable of pleasure and pain whose feelings are affected by our conduct? or are we to confine our view to human happiness? The former view is the one adopted by Bentham and Mill, and (I believe) by the Utilitarian school generally: and is obviously most in accordance with the universality that is characteristic of their principle ... it seems arbitrary and unreasonable to exclude from the end, as so conceived, any pleasure of any sentient being.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |title=Methods of Ethics |publisher=Hackett Publishing Co |edition=7th |date=1981 |page=414 |isbn=978-0915145287}}</ref>\n\nAmong contemporary utilitarian philosophers, Peter Singer is especially known for arguing that the well-being of all [[sentience|sentient]] beings ought to be given [[equal consideration of interests|equal consideration]]. Singer suggests that rights are conferred according to the level of a creature's self-awareness, regardless of their species. He adds that humans tend to be [[speciesism|speciesist]] (discriminatory against non-humans) in ethical matters, and argues that, on utilitarianism, speciesism cannot be justified as there is no rational distinction that can be made between the suffering of humans and the suffering of nonhuman animals; all suffering ought to be reduced. Singer writes: \"The racist violates the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own race, when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race. Similarly the speciesist allows the interests of his own species to override the greater interests of members of other species. The pattern is the same in each case ... Most human beings are speciesists.\"<ref>Peter Singer, ''Animal Liberation'', Chapter I, pp. 7\u20138, 2nd edition, 1990.</ref>\n\nIn his 1990 edition of ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'', Peter Singer said that he no longer ate oysters and mussels, because although the creatures might not suffer, there was a possibility they may and it was easy to avoid eating them in any case.<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm Animal Liberation, Second Edition] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205080909/http://www.wesleyan.edu/wsa/warn/singer_fish.htm |date=5 December 2010 }}, Singer, Peter, 1975, 1990, excerpt, pp. 171\u201374, main passage on oysters, mussels, etc. p. 174 (last paragraph of this excerpt). And in a footnote in the actual book, Singer writes \"My change of mind about mollusks stems from conversations with R.I. Sikora.\"</ref>\n\nThis view still might be contrasted with [[deep ecology]], which holds that an intrinsic value is attached to all forms of life and nature, whether currently assumed to be sentient or not. According to utilitarianism, the forms of life that are unable to experience anything akin to either enjoyment or discomfort are denied moral status, because it is impossible to increase the happiness or reduce the suffering of something that cannot feel happiness or suffer. Singer writes:\n<blockquote>The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering\u2014in so far as rough comparisons can be made\u2014of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.</blockquote>\n\nThus, the moral value of one-celled organisms, as well as some multi-cellular organisms, and natural entities like a river, is only in the benefit they provide to sentient beings. Similarly, utilitarianism places no direct intrinsic value on [[biodiversity]], although the benefits that biodiversity bring to sentient beings may mean that, on utilitarianism, biodiversity ought to be maintained in general.\n\nIn John Stuart Mill's essay \"On Nature\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mill's \"On Nature\"|url = http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/users/philosophy/texts/mill_on.htm|website = www.lancaster.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-08-09|date = 1904}}</ref> he argues that the [[wild animal suffering|welfare of wild animals]] is to be considered when making utilitarian judgments.

The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy is the best way to make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Optimal Taxation of Height: A Case Study of Utilitarian Income Redistribution|author1=N.

Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking.<ref>[http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism Peter Singer: The why and how of effective altruism | Talk Video].
