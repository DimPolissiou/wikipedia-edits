It is, along with the [[District of Columbia Army National Guard]], an element of the [[District of Columbia National Guard]].\n\nAs militia units, the units in the District of Columbia Air National Guard are not in [[United States Air Force]] chain of command unless federalized by the president.  As a federal district, the units of the DC ANG are under the direct jurisdiction of the [[President of the United States]] through the office of the [[state adjutant general|Commanding General\nDistrict of Columbia National Guard]] unless activated.  The District of Columbia Air National Guard is headquartered in Washington D.C. The commander of the [[District of Columbia National Guard]] is  Major General [[William J. Walker]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe District of Columbia Air National Guard is unique among the [[United States Air National Guard]]. Because Washington, D.C. lacks an Air Force installation with a runway, DC Air National Guard units are stationed at nearby [[Joint Base Andrews]] in [[Maryland]].\n\nUnder the \"Total Force\" concept, District of Columbia Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF).  District of Columbia ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a [[Major Command of the USAF]] if federalized.  In addition, the District of Columbia Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and [[Air Force Reserve]] counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window.\n\nAlong with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the District of Columbia ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Mayor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense.\n\n==Components==\nThe District of Columbia Air National Guard consists of the following major unit:\n* [[113th Wing]]\n: Established 10 April 1941 (as: [[121st Observation Squadron]]); operates: [[F-16C/D Fighting Falcon]], C-38A and C-40C\n: Stationed at: [[Joint Base Andrews]], Camp Springs, Maryland\n: Gained by: [[Air Combat Command]]\n\n==History==\nThe District of Columbia Air National Guard origins date to 10 April 1941 with the establishment of the '''121st Observation Squadron''' and is oldest unit of the District of Columbia Air National Guard. It is one of the [[List of United States Army National Guard Observation Squadrons|29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons]] of the [[United States Army National Guard]] formed before [[World War II]].  The 121st Observation Squadron was ordered into active service on 1 September 1941 as part of the buildup of the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] prior to the United States entry into World War II.\n\nOn 24 May 1946, the [[United States Army Air Forces]], in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President [[Harry S. Truman]], allocated inactive unit designations to the [[National Guard Bureau]] for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units.<ref name=\"ang60\">[http://www.ang.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080527-040.pdf  Rosenfeld, Susan and Gross, Charles J (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History.

It was equipped with F-51D Mustangs and its mission was the air defense of Washington, D.C.  On 2 November 1946 the '''113th Fighter Group''' was allotted by the National Guard Bureau, extended federal recognition and activated.  The 121st was assigned to the 113th as its operational squadron.  18 September 1947, however, is considered the District of Columbia Air National Guard's official birth concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act.<ref name=\"ang60\"/>\n\nOn February 1, 1952, the 8205th Air Base Squadron was activated as part of the DC ANG. The unit's mission was to receive, maintain, and store equipment as well as provide trained personnel for the soon-to-be formed 231st Airways and Air Communications Squadron (Mobile) (which was to be stationed at Camp Simms, Washington, DC). However, the unit was discontinued on August 26, 1952, when it merged with the 231st AACS (Mobile). Under a variety of names, since 1986 the [[231st Combat Communications Squadron]], the 231st remained active with the DC ANG into the twenty-first century.\n\nToday, the District of Columbia Air National Guard primary mission is training of air combat and operational airlift crews for national defense. The 113th also provides a ready response force of fighters for the defense of the District of Columbia area 24/7. Members of the 113th also assist local and federal law enforcement agencies in combating drug trafficking in the District of Columbia on a case by case basis.\n\nAfter the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States]], elements of every Air National Guard unit of the DC ANG were activated in support of the [[Global War on Terrorism]]. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in [[Operation Noble Eagle]] (ONE) air defense overflights of major United States cities.  On 11 September 2001, the wing was given authorization for its pilots to shoot down threatening aircraft over Washington DC.\n\nDuring one of those missions, on 11 May 2005 the squadron scrambled to intercept an aircraft that wandered into the no-fly zone around the [[White House]]. Customs officials had also scrambled a Sikorsky [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopter and a [[UC-35B Cessna Citation]] jet at 11:47&nbsp;a.m. to intercept the plane. The Customs aircraft gave way when the F-16s arrived flew on the wing tips of the little plane. They dipped their wings - a pilot's signal to \u2018follow me\u2019 - and tried to raise the pilot on the radio. But the Cessna didn't change course and it was flying too slow for the F-16s. The frustrated pilots had to take turns dropping flares, breaking away and returning to drop more flares. One senior Bush administration counter-terrorism official said it was \u2018a real finger-biting period\u2019 because they came very close to ordering a shot against a general aircraft. Finally, when the Cessna came within three miles of the White House - just a few minutes flying time - it altered course\n\nAlso, DC ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Northern and Southern Watch,  [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in Iraq as well as other locations as directed.\n\n==Special Recognition==\nD.C. Air Guard's 231st CMBTCS won the Air National Guard Mission Support Trophy for the year 1995. The trophy is given annually to the number one non-flying unit in the Air National Guard. It was estimated at the time that 600 Air National Guard units were eligible for the award. The Mission Support Trophy is the equivalent of the Spaatz Trophy for Air National Guard flying units.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n*[[National Capital Wing Civil Air Patrol]]\n\n==References==\n{{AFHRA}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Gross, Charles J (1996), The Air National Guard and the American Military Tradition, United States Dept. of Defense, {{ISBN|0160483026}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101101165443/http://states.ng.mil/sites/dc/Pages/DCNationalGuard.aspx District of Columbia Air National Guard website]\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|District of Columbia Air National Guard}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090531035102/http://states.ng.mil/sites/DC/Pages/DCNationalGuard.aspx District of Columbia National Guard]\n* [http://www.113wg.ang.af.mil/ 113th Wing]\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/113wg.htm GlobalSecurity.org: 113th Wing]\n\n{{Air National Guard}}\n{{US Air Force navbox}}\n{{NGbystate}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:District Of Columbia Air National Guard}}\n[[Category:United States Air National Guard]]\n[[Category:Military in Washington, D.C.]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name= District of Columbia Air National Guard\n|image= File:District of Columbia Air National Guard emblem.png\n|image_size = 220px\n|caption= Shield of the District of Columbia Air National Guard\n|dates= 10 April 1941 - present\n|country={{flag|United States of America|23px}}\n|allegiance={{flag|United States of America|23px}}<br/>{{flag|District of Columbia|23px}}\n|branch= {{flag|United States Air Force}}\n|type=\n|role= \"To meet district and federal mission responsibilities.\"\n|size=\n|command_structure= [[File:US-AirNationalGuard-2007Emblem.svg|35px]] [[Air National Guard]]<br/>[[File:JFHQ-DC_National_Guard_Emblem.png|35px]] [[District of Columbia National Guard]]\n|garrison=  District of Columbia Air National Guard,  2001 East Capital St, SE, Washington DC 20003\n|garrison_label=\n|nickname=\n|patron=\n|motto=\n|colors=\n|colors_label=\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|battles=\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1= President [[Donald Trump]]<br />'''''(Commander-in-Chief)'''''<br />[[Barbara Barrett]]<br />'''''(Secretary of the Air Force)''''''\n|commander1_label= Civilian leadership\n|commander2= [[Major General]] William J.

Its principal activity is the [[Electricity supply|supply of electricity]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] to businesses and consumers in the United Kingdom, Ireland and North America.\n\nIt is the largest supplier of gas to domestic customers in the United Kingdom, and one of the largest suppliers of electricity, operating under the trading names [[Scottish Gas]] in Scotland and [[British Gas]] in England and Wales. It owns [[Bord Gais Energy|Bord G\u00e1is Energy]] in Ireland.

Over the next 137 years, it grew by acquisition of other gas companies to become the primary supplier of gas to [[Greater London]]. In 1949, under the [[Gas Act 1948]] the ownership of the company transferred to a government agency, [[North Thames Gas Board]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=1167&inst_id=14 |title=Gas, Light and Coke Company |last= |first= |date= |work=Archives in the M25 area |publisher=AIM25 |accessdate=}}</ref> The various area [[gas board]]s were merged into the national [[British Gas Corporation]] in 1973.

The single \"Under Pressure\", Queen's collaboration with David Bowie which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'', also topped the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nAs of October 2019, ''Greatest Hits'' has spent 868 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified [[BPI certification|20\u00d7 platinum]] with sales of over 6 million copies, making it the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album of all time in the UK]]. Among the [[Billboard 200#Most weeks on the chart|longest charting albums in the US]], as of April 2020, it has spent 380 weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|8\u00d7 platinum]] in the US, 15\u00d7 platinum in Australia, 10\u00d7 platinum in New Zealand, and 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada. Following the release of the Queen biopic ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'' in 2018, it re-entered the charts of countries worldwide.\n\n== Release ==\nThere was no universal track listing or cover art for the ''Greatest Hits'' album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some cases, despite the band's popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\" and \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\", neither was released as a single in any country, but appear on some regions' ''1981 Hits'' release. In the UK and the US, where solid numbers could be collected, the album included only top 20 hits.\n\nThe US ended up with its original edit of Queen's first single release, \"[[Keep Yourself Alive]]\", which had been re-released in the US in 1975 (original release was 1973) after the success of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". The US version also added \"[[Under Pressure]]\", Queen's collaboration with [[David Bowie]], which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'' and subsequently topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reached the top ten in many charts around the world. However, the song was not included on the European versions of ''Greatest Hits'' \u2013 according to Queen's business manager Jim Beach, this was because the longer manufacturing time required to press records in Europe meant that several hundred thousand copies of the album had already been pressed up before the song had been recorded.<ref name=\"Billboard19811017\">{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Grein |title=Row over Rent-Only Plan for Queen Vid |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |pages=3 & 84 |date=17 October 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same list of UK Greatest Hits minus \"[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]\", and including \"Love of My Life\" ([[Live Killers]] version). CD version is the same as the British.\n\nThe cover photo that appeared on the UK and US release was taken by [[Lord Snowdon]] at his home studio using only natural light. For the 1981 release the photo was skewed but later presented as it was originally taken for the 2011 re-release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbjan17a.html#05|title=January 2017|website=www.brianmay.com|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/greatest-hits/|title=Greatest Hits|website=Queen official website|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Queen sought to issue a [[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|second ''Greatest Hits'']] collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to [[Hollywood Records]], who were keen on a massive promotion of the band's back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood's US licensee). Hollywood Records decided to not release ''Greatest Hits II'' to the US market, but instead created their own collection, ''[[Classic Queen]]'' (1992), peaking at number four.<ref name=\":0\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=hxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=queen+waynes+world#v=onepage Billboard 25 Jul 1992] p.8.

Commonly referred to as the ''Red Greatest Hits'', it features most of the '70s tracks absent from ''Classic Queen'' (including \"Another One Bites the Dust\" [1980], \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Killer Queen\").

There was no universal track listing or cover art for the album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles had been released there and which were successful. In 1991, the US version of the album ''[[Classic Queen]]'' was released following the band's rekindled in popularity in the nation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Greatest Hits'' was a commercial success worldwide with sales of over 25 million copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]]. It reached number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], spending four weeks at the top and sold consistently well throughout the 1980s, becoming the fourth-biggest selling album of the decade. The single \"Under Pressure\", Queen's collaboration with David Bowie which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'', also topped the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nAs of October 2019, ''Greatest Hits'' has spent 868 weeks on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified [[BPI certification|20\u00d7 platinum]] with sales of over 6 million copies, making it the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling album of all time in the UK]]. Among the [[Billboard 200#Most weeks on the chart|longest charting albums in the US]], as of April 2020, it has spent 380 weeks on the ''Billboard'' 200. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|8\u00d7 platinum]] in the US, 15\u00d7 platinum in Australia, 10\u00d7 platinum in New Zealand, and 3\u00d7 platinum in Canada. Following the release of the Queen biopic ''[[Bohemian Rhapsody (film)|Bohemian Rhapsody]]'', it re-entered the charts of countries worldwide.\n\n== Release ==\nThere was no universal track listing or cover art for the ''Greatest Hits'' album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some cases, despite the band's popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\" and \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\", neither was released as a single in any country, but appear on some regions' ''1981 Hits'' release. In the UK and the US, where solid numbers could be collected, the album included only top 20 hits.\n\nThe US ended up with its original edit of Queen's first single release, \"[[Keep Yourself Alive]]\", which had been re-released in the US in 1975 (original release was 1973) after the success of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". The US version also added \"[[Under Pressure]]\", Queen's collaboration with [[David Bowie]], which was released the same week as ''Greatest Hits'' and subsequently topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] and reached the top ten in many charts around the world. However, the song was not included on the European versions of ''Greatest Hits'' \u2013 according to Queen's business manager Jim Beach, this was because the longer manufacturing time required to press records in Europe meant that several hundred thousand copies of the album had already been pressed up before the song had been recorded.<ref name=\"Billboard19811017\">{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Grein |title=Row over Rent-Only Plan for Queen Vid |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |pages=3 & 84 |date=17 October 1981}}</ref>\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same list of UK Greatest Hits minus \"[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]\", and including \"Love of My Life\" ([[Live Killers]] version). CD version is the same as the British.\n\nThe cover photo that appeared on the UK and US release was taken by [[Lord Snowdon]] at his home studio using only natural light. For the 1981 release the photo was skewed but later presented as it was originally taken for the 2011 re-release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbjan17a.html#05|title=January 2017|website=www.brianmay.com|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/greatest-hits/|title=Greatest Hits|website=Queen official website|access-date=14 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Queen sought to issue a [[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|second ''Greatest Hits'']] collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to [[Hollywood Records]], who were keen on a massive promotion of the band's back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood's US licensee). Hollywood Records decided to not release ''Greatest Hits II'' to the US market, but instead created their own collection, ''[[Classic Queen]]'' (1992), peaking at number four.<ref name=\":0\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=hxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8&dq=queen+waynes+world#v=onepage Billboard 25 Jul 1992] p.8.

Commonly referred to as the ''Red Greatest Hits'', it features most of the '70s tracks absent from ''Classic Queen'' (including \"Another One Bites the Dust\" [1980], \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Killer Queen\"). In 2004, to promote the Las Vegas production of the musical ''We Will Rock You'', Hollywood Records released ''Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition'' which was the UK ''Greatest Hits'' with three bonus tracks.\n\n== ''Greatest Flix'' and ''Greatest Pix'' ==\nThe release of ''Greatest Hits'' was accompanied simultaneously by ''Greatest Flix'', a 60-minute compilation released on [[VHS]] video and [[LaserDisc]] of all the videos Queen had made up until that point in chronological order, and ''Greatest Pix'', a 96-page paperback book edited by [[Jacques Lowe]] which featured photos of the band taken by [[Neal Preston]].<ref name=\"Billboard19811017\" /> Although ''Greatest Flix'' only listed 17 videos on its sleeve, it contained two videos for \"We Will Rock You\".

Les immediately suspected Christian Habgood, Denise's tutor at Charnham College. However, when entering the car of local taxi driver [[Graham Harker]] ([[Lee Warburton]]) Denise suspected him of the crime based only on her recollections of the smell of his aftershave and his usage of the phrase \"Scout's honour\". The police questioned Harker, but no forensic evidence could be found to link him to the crime and they were forced to release him due to lack of evidence. Denise persisted with her desire to see him arrested, and eventually learned the true identity of her attacker.\n\nShortly after this Denise discovered that Les had been to see prostitutes on a number of occasions.

After the Boulters had settled into the area and purchased the corner cafe previously owned by [[Roy Farmer]] until his death in a fire at the same premises in November 2003, Kelly had made some friends in local teenage girls [[Lucy Day]] and [[Melanie Costello]].\n\nIn July 2004, Kelly gave birth to a baby girl, Susie, named after Justin's mother. Justin and Kelly later became engaged.Throughout the rest of the year, Kelly was involved in several family dramas including the break-up of Brendan's marriage to Melanie following a revelation that Brendan was bisexual; and Denise's rape.\n\nIn early 2005, Kelly and Justin were horrified when they were accused of abusing Susie, after she had suffered severe head injuries. The Boulters and MacKenzies were under surveillance from social workers for several months until a judge at a hearing was satisfied that nobody was at fault but ordered a review every three months.\n\nIn August 2005, after Denise had left Les, Kelly wasn't too far behind as her relationship with Justin fell apart after he'd slept with a friend of hers from College; Scarlet Anderson.

Les found out but eventually forgave Denise. Further shocks were to come when Les discovered Brendan wasn't his son, but Brendan reassured Les that he considered him his dad.\n\nThings went from bad to worse between Les and Denise. Les became jealous of Denise spending so much time with her tutor at Charnahm College, Christian Habgood. One night in December, Denise was [[raped]] while walking through an alleyway.\n\nWhen cab driver Graham Harker moved into Stanley Street, Denise immediately recognised his voice. After months of high drama and Graham's arrest for kidnapping Denise and holding her daughter-in-law [[Melanie Costello|Melanie]] against her will in his flat, Les and Denise tried to get things back to normal but the damage had been done.\n\nLes began seeing prostitutes on two occasions, despite hesitating.

Les immediately suspected Christian Habgood, Denise's tutor at Charnham College. However, when entering the car of local taxi driver [[Graham Harker]] ([[Lee Warburton]]) Denise suspected him of the crime based only on her recollections of the smell of his aftershave and his usage of the phrase \"Scout's honour\". The police questioned Harker, but no forensic evidence could be found to link him to the crime and they were forced to release him due to lack of evidence. Denise persisted with her desire to see him arrested, and eventually learned the true identity of her attacker.\n\nShortly after this Denise discovered that Les had been to see prostitutes on a number of occasions.

Justin and Kelly later became engaged.Throughout the rest of the year, Kelly was involved in several family dramas including the break-up of Brendan's marriage to Melanie following a revelation that Brendan was bisexual; and Denise's rape.\n\nIn early 2005, Kelly and Justin were horrified when they were accused of abusing Susie, after she had suffered severe head injuries. The Boulters and MacKenzies were under surveillance from social workers for several months until a judge at a hearing was satisfied that nobody was at fault but ordered a review every three months.\n\nIn August 2005, after Denise had left Les, Kelly wasn't too far behind as her relationship with Justin fell apart after he'd slept with a friend of hers from College; Scarlet Anderson.

Les found out but eventually forgave Denise. Further shocks were to come when Les discovered Brendan wasn't his son, but Brendan reassured Les that he considered him his dad.\n\nThings went from bad to worse between Les and Denise. Les became jealous of Denise spending so much time with her tutor at Charnahm College, Christian Habgood. One night in December, Denise was [[raped]] while walking through an alleyway.\n\nWhen cab driver Graham Harker moved into Stanley Street, Denise immediately recognised his voice. After months of high drama and Graham's arrest for kidnapping Denise and holding her daughter-in-law [[Melanie Costello|Melanie]] against her will in his flat, Les and Denise tried to get things back to normal but the damage had been done.\n\nLes began seeing prostitutes on two occasions, despite hesitating.
