In 1537, they established the city of [[Asunci\u00f3n]],<ref>\"Paraguay: c\u00f3mo Asunci\u00f3n se convirti\u00f3 en \"madre\" de m\u00e1s de 70 ciudades de Sudam\u00e9rica hace 480 a\u00f1os\".

Paraguay was the center of the [[Reductions|Jesuit Missions]], where the [[Guaran\u00ed people]] were educated and introduced to [[Christianity]] and European culture under the direction of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Jesuit reduction]]s, mainly during the 17th century.<ref>Caraman, Philip (1976): \"The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America\", New York: Seabury Press.</ref> However, after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following [[Independence of Paraguay|independence from Spain]] at the beginning of the 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments who generally implemented [[nationalist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies. This period ended with the disastrous [[Paraguayan War]], during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25\u201333% of its territory to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict \u2013 the [[Chaco War]] \u2013 against Bolivia, from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious. Afterwards, the country entered a period of military dictatorships, ending with the 35 year regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of the \"democratic era\" of Paraguay.\n\nWith around seven million inhabitants, Paraguay is a founding member of [[Mercosur]], an original member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Lima Group]]. Also, the city of [[Luque]], in Asuncion's Metropolitan Area, is the seat of the [[CONMEBOL]]. The Guarani culture is very influential and more than 90% of the people speak different forms of the Guarani language in addition to Spanish. Paraguayans are known for being a very happy and easy-living people and many times the country has topped the \"world's happiest place\" charts because of the \"positive experiences\" lived and expressed by the population.<ref>{{cite news|title=World's Happiest Country?

One of the most common explanations is that it means \"water of the [[Payagua]] (a native tribe)\". Another meaning links the [[Guarani language|Guarani]] words ''para'' (\"river\") and ''guai'' (\"crown\"), meaning \"crowned river\". A third meaning may be ''para'' (\"river\"), ''gua'' (\"from\"), ''y'' (\"water\") meaning \"water that comes from the river\", referring to the bog in the north of the country, which is actually in Brazil.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Paraguay}}\n\n=== Pre-Columbian era ===\nThe [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guaran\u00ed]] had been living in eastern Paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. Western Paraguay, the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The Paraguay River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The Guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.\n\n=== Colonization ===\nThe first Europeans in the area were Spanish explorers in 1516.<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref> The Spanish explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial province of Paraguay]].\n\nAn attempt to create an autonomous Christian Indian nation<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\">{{cite web |url={{wdl|2581}} |title=Paraguariae Provinciae Soc.

Novissima Descriptio |language=Latin |trans-title=A Current Description of the Province of the Society of Jesus in Paraguay with Neighboring Areas |work=World Digital Library |date=1732 }}</ref> was undertaken by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missions and settlements in this part of South America in the eighteenth century, which included portions of Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. They developed [[Jesuit reduction]]s to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the [[Bandeirantes]], in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century [[Jesuit Missions of La Sant\u00edsima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1 and Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\"/>\n\nIn western Paraguay, Spanish settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n=== Independence and rule of Francia===\n{{main|Independence of Paraguay}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], Paraguay's first dictator.]]\nParaguay overthrew the local Spanish administration on 14 May 1811. Paraguay's first dictator was [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]] who ruled Paraguay from 1814 until his death in 1840, with very little outside contact or influence. He intended to create a [[utopian]] society based on the French theorist [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|''Social Contract'']].<ref>[http://warofthepacific.com/warofthetriplealliance.htm War of The Triple Alliance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807073919/http://warofthepacific.com/warofthetriplealliance.htm |date=7 August 2014 }}, War of the Pacific.

On his sixth attempt to re-enter the country in 1986, La\u00edno returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former United States ambassador to Paraguay, and a group of Uruguayan and Argentine congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred La\u00edno's return.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted La\u00edno to return to Asunci\u00f3n. La\u00edno took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''m\u00edtines rel\u00e1mpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the police.\n\nIn response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating \"sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law\". He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. [[Hermes Rafael Saguier]], another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. La\u00edno and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours.

In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost forty years, in what international observers deemed free and fair elections.\n\nWith support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and other countries in the region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.\n\nOviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election. However, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Ra\u00fal Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis Mar\u00eda Arga\u00f1a]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters.

The eastern region (Regi\u00f3n Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Regi\u00f3n Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. The country lies between latitudes [[19th parallel south|19\u00b0]] and [[28th parallel south|28\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54\u00b0]] and [[63rd meridian west|63\u00b0W]].\nThe terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Paraguay}}\nThe overall climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. Like most lands in the region, Paraguay has only wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay's weather: between October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the north, while the period between May and August brings cold winds from the Andes.\n\nThe absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as {{convert|161|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees F).\n\nRainfall varies dramatically across the country, with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions, and semi-arid conditions in the far west. The far eastern forest belt receives an average of {{convert|170|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of rain annually, while the western Chaco region typically averages no more than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year. The rains in the west tend to be irregular and evaporate quickly, contributing to the aridity of the area.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Paraguay |Human rights in Paraguay|Foreign relations of Paraguay}}\nParaguay is a [[representative democratic]] republic, with a multi-party system and [[separation of powers]] in three branches.

Both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Guarani language|Guaran\u00ed]] are official languages. The Guaran\u00ed language is a remarkable trace of the indigenous Guaran\u00ed culture that has endured in Paraguay. Guaran\u00ed claims its place as one of the last surviving and thriving of South American indigenous national languages. In 2015, Spanish was spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaran\u00ed is spoken by more than 90%, or slightly more than 5.8 million speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaran\u00ed. While Guaran\u00ed is still widely spoken, Spanish is generally given a preferential treatment in government, business, media and education as one of South America's [[lingua franca]]s.<ref name=\"ethnologue-list\">[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/gug Paraguayan Guaran\u00ed], Ethnologue</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Paraguay |url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/PY-language.htm |title=The Languages spoken in Paraguay |publisher=Studycountry.com |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitparaguay.net/paraguay-guide/languages-paraguay.html |title=Languages of Paraguay |publisher=VisitParaguay.net |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Romero|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html |title=In Paraguay, Indigenous Language With Unique Staying Power |work=The New York Times |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages of Paraguay\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Languages\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] |Orange|90}}\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|Blue| 87}} \n}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Largest cities===\n{{Largest cities of Paraguay}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Music of Paraguay|Cinema of Paraguay}}\nParaguay's cultural heritage can be traced to the extensive [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] between the original male Spanish settlers and indigenous [[Guarani people|Guaran\u00ed]] women. Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaran\u00ed. More than 93% of Paraguayans are ''[[mestizos]]'', making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the indigenous language, [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. [[Jopara]], a mixture of Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, is also widely spoken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival]]\nThis cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (''ao po'\u00ed'') and [[Nanduti|lace making]] (''\u00f1andut\u00ed''). The [[music of Paraguay]], which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy ''galopas,'' and languid ''[[Guarania (music)|guaranias]]'' is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain [[manioc]], a local staple crop similar to the [[Cassava|yuca]] also known as Cassava root found in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is ''[[sopa paraguaya]]'', similar to a thick [[corn bread]]. Another notable food is ''[[chipa]]'', a [[bagel]]-like bread made from [[cornmeal]], manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the time of the birth of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Maz\u00f3]], [[Roque Vallejos]], and Nobel Prize nominee [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Several [[Cinema of Paraguay|Paraguayan films]] have been made.\n\nInside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, [[godparent]]s have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/29.htm|title=Paraguay \u2013 Ritual Kinship|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Paraguay}}\nSport in Paraguay is an important part of the country's national culture.

In 1537, they established the city of [[Asunci\u00f3n]],<ref>\"Paraguay: c\u00f3mo Asunci\u00f3n se convirti\u00f3 en \"madre\" de m\u00e1s de 70 ciudades de Sudam\u00e9rica hace 480 a\u00f1os\".

Paraguay was the center of the [[Reductions|Jesuit Missions]], where the [[Guaran\u00ed people]] were educated and introduced to [[Christianity]] and European culture under the direction of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Jesuit reduction]]s, mainly during the 17th century.<ref>Caraman, Philip (1976): \"The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America\", New York: Seabury Press.</ref> However, after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following [[Independence of Paraguay|independence from Spain]] at the beginning of the 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments who generally implemented [[nationalist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies. This period ended with the disastrous [[Paraguayan War]], during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25\u201333% of its territory to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict \u2013 the [[Chaco War]] \u2013 against Bolivia, from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious. Afterwards, the country entered a period of military dictatorships, ending with the 35 year regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of the \"democratic era\" of Paraguay.\n\nWith around seven million inhabitants, Paraguay is a founding member of [[Mercosur]], an original member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Lima Group]]. Also, the city of [[Luque]], in Asuncion's Metropolitan Area, is the seat of the [[CONMEBOL]]. The Guarani culture is very influential and more than 90% of the people speak different forms of the Guarani language in addition to Spanish. Paraguayans are known for being a very happy and easy-living people and many times the country has topped the \"world's happiest place\" charts because of the \"positive experiences\" lived and expressed by the population.<ref>{{cite news|title=World's Happiest Country?

One of the most common explanations is that it means \"water of the [[Payagua]] (a native tribe)\". Another meaning links the [[Guarani language|Guarani]] words ''para'' (\"river\") and ''guai'' (\"crown\"), meaning \"crowned river\". A third meaning may be ''para'' (\"river\"), ''gua'' (\"from\"), ''y'' (\"water\") meaning \"water that comes from the river\", referring to the bog in the north of the country, which is actually in Brazil.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Paraguay}}\n\n=== Pre-Columbian era ===\nThe [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guaran\u00ed]] had been living in eastern Paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. Western Paraguay, the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The Paraguay River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The Guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.\n\n=== Colonization ===\nThe first Europeans in the area were Spanish explorers in 1516.<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref> The Spanish explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial province of Paraguay]].\n\nAn attempt to create an autonomous Christian Indian nation<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\">{{cite web |url={{wdl|2581}} |title=Paraguariae Provinciae Soc. Jesu cum Adiacentibg. Novissima Descriptio |language=Latin |trans-title=A Current Description of the Province of the Society of Jesus in Paraguay with Neighboring Areas |work=World Digital Library |date=1732 }}</ref> was undertaken by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] missions and settlements in this part of South America in the eighteenth century, which included portions of Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil. They developed [[Jesuit reduction]]s to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the [[Bandeirantes]], in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century [[Jesuit Missions of La Sant\u00edsima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1 and Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\"/>\n\nIn western Paraguay, Spanish settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n=== Independence and rule of Francia===\n{{main|Independence of Paraguay}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], Paraguay's first dictator.]]\nParaguay overthrew the local Spanish administration on 14 May 1811.

On his sixth attempt to re-enter the country in 1986, La\u00edno returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former United States ambassador to Paraguay, and a group of Uruguayan and Argentine congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred La\u00edno's return.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted La\u00edno to return to Asunci\u00f3n. La\u00edno took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''m\u00edtines rel\u00e1mpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the police.\n\nIn response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating \"sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law\". He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. [[Hermes Rafael Saguier]], another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. La\u00edno and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours.

In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost forty years, in what international observers deemed free and fair elections.\n\nWith support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and other countries in the region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.\n\nOviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election. However, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Ra\u00fal Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis Mar\u00eda Arga\u00f1a]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters.

The eastern region (Regi\u00f3n Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Regi\u00f3n Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. The country lies between latitudes [[19th parallel south|19\u00b0]] and [[28th parallel south|28\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54\u00b0]] and [[63rd meridian west|63\u00b0W]].\nThe terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Paraguay}}\nThe overall climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. Like most lands in the region, Paraguay has only wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay's weather: between October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the north, while the period between May and August brings cold winds from the Andes.\n\nThe absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as {{convert|161|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees F).\n\nRainfall varies dramatically across the country, with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions, and semi-arid conditions in the far west. The far eastern forest belt receives an average of {{convert|170|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of rain annually, while the western Chaco region typically averages no more than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year. The rains in the west tend to be irregular and evaporate quickly, contributing to the aridity of the area.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Paraguay |Human rights in Paraguay|Foreign relations of Paraguay}}\nParaguay is a [[representative democratic]] republic, with a multi-party system and [[separation of powers]] in three branches.

Both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Guarani language|Guaran\u00ed]] are official languages. The Guaran\u00ed language is a remarkable trace of the indigenous Guaran\u00ed culture that has endured in Paraguay. Guaran\u00ed claims its place as one of the last surviving and thriving of South American indigenous national languages. In 2015, Spanish was spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaran\u00ed is spoken by more than 90%, or slightly more than 5.8 million speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaran\u00ed. While Guaran\u00ed is still widely spoken, Spanish is generally given a preferential treatment in government, business, media and education as one of South America's [[lingua franca]]s.<ref name=\"ethnologue-list\">[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/gug Paraguayan Guaran\u00ed], Ethnologue</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Paraguay |url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/PY-language.htm |title=The Languages spoken in Paraguay |publisher=Studycountry.com |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitparaguay.net/paraguay-guide/languages-paraguay.html |title=Languages of Paraguay |publisher=VisitParaguay.net |date= |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Simon|last=Romero|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/world/americas/in-paraguay-indigenous-language-with-unique-staying-power.html |title=In Paraguay, Indigenous Language With Unique Staying Power |work=The New York Times |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages of Paraguay\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Languages\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] |Orange|90}}\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|Blue| 87}} \n}}\n{{-}}\n\n===Largest cities===\n{{Largest cities of Paraguay}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Music of Paraguay|Cinema of Paraguay}}\nParaguay's cultural heritage can be traced to the extensive [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] between the original male Spanish settlers and indigenous [[Guarani people|Guaran\u00ed]] women. Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaran\u00ed. More than 93% of Paraguayans are ''[[mestizos]]'', making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the indigenous language, [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. [[Jopara]], a mixture of Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, is also widely spoken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival]]\nThis cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (''ao po'\u00ed'') and [[Nanduti|lace making]] (''\u00f1andut\u00ed''). The [[music of Paraguay]], which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy ''galopas,'' and languid ''[[Guarania (music)|guaranias]]'' is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain [[manioc]], a local staple crop similar to the [[Cassava|yuca]] also known as Cassava root found in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is ''[[sopa paraguaya]]'', similar to a thick [[corn bread]]. Another notable food is ''[[chipa]]'', a [[bagel]]-like bread made from [[cornmeal]], manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the time of the birth of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Maz\u00f3]], [[Roque Vallejos]], and Nobel Prize nominee [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Several [[Cinema of Paraguay|Paraguayan films]] have been made.\n\nInside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, [[godparent]]s have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/29.htm|title=Paraguay \u2013 Ritual Kinship|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Paraguay}}\nSport in Paraguay is an important part of the country's national culture.

Many laws already forbid fetal sex determination throughout countries in Asia, including China, but still continues to be a problem. Establishing responsibility to those performing illegal acts such as abortion is one step closer to ensuring a healthy, family oriented society. Holding doctors, clinics and establishments accountable by law is believed to make astounding differences in the sex preference.<ref>All-China Women's Federation Laws and regulations.

It is primarily important to spread public awareness though campaigns, media, and posters including advantages of females. The results of many campaigns such as the \"Care for Girls\" campaign on China, by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, encourages female births and requests participation from many neighboring countries. In one of the participating counties in Shanxi providence, the sex ratio birth was reduced from 135 in the year 2003 to 117 just three years later.<ref>Li SZ, Yan SH.

Population and Family Planning 2008;10:23\u20134</ref> The country must implement a less traditional form of gender approach and encourage women for higher status positions in society. The Chinese government is essential in improving their gender and social rights. In 1992, the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women ensured women equal rights among politics, culture, education, work property rights and even marriage. Evidence shows that a country who supports higher status of women leads to a less traditional view of gender and lowers the level of son preference. All these socioeconomic improvements have led to a steer away from traditional views of women to a more modern approach, working to end the gender gap in entirety.\n\n=== Change in attitudes ===\nAlthough China's sex ratio at birth is still one of the highest in the world, growing evidence has shown that son preference in China is declining.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  In recent interviews, many young Chinese adults expressed the view that they do not care about the gender of their future child, even though son preference was common in their parents' generation.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  A recent study showed that among the 66% claiming to be gender indifferent, 13% (10% urban 16% rural) prefer a boy, and 21% (22% urban and 18% rural) want a girl.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" /> Hesketh points out that with the consideration of advantages of raising girls, including that they are easier to care for, easier to find a spouse for, and take good care of aging parents, gender indifference and girl preference increase in comparison with previous son preference.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abortion in China]]\n* [[Female infanticide in China]]\n* [[Feminism in China]]\n* [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio]]\n* [[One-child policy]]\n* [[Prostitution in China]]\n* [[Rural society in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Sex trafficking in China]]\n* [[Urban society in the People's Republic of China]] \n* [[Women's healthcare in the People's Republic of China]]\n\n===General===\n* [[Sex-selective abortion]]\n* [[Women in China]]\n* [[Missing women of Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in China]]\n[[Category:Sex selection in China]]\n", "text_old": "'''Missing women of China''' is a widely known phenomenon referring to the unusual shortfall of female population resulting from cultural influences and government policy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Xuefeng|first1=Chen|title=The Social Impact of China's One-child Policy|url=http://web.mit.edu/lipoff/www/hapr/summer03_security/CHEN.pdf|publisher=Harvard Asia Pacific Review|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref> The term \"[[missing women]]\" was coined by economist [[Amartya Sen]], winner of the 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, to describe a distorted population sex ratio in which the number of males far outweighs the number of females.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Siwan |authorlink1=Siwan Anderson |last2=Ray |first2=Debraj |authorlink2=Debraj Ray (economist) |title=Missing women: age and disease.|journal=The Review of Economic Studies |volume=77 |issue=4 |date=2010 |pages=1262\u20131300 |jstor=40836647 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-937X.2010.00609.x |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3f8983075355f4cc26b2d4eed8335d5fbf9f1c61 }}</ref> Female disadvantages in child survival throughout China reflects a long pattern of sex-based discrimination.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2006;103: 13271\u20135</ref> According to the Canadian Medical Association, it is crucial to both outlaw sex selection and fix the primary issue of son preference. Many laws already forbid fetal sex determination throughout countries in Asia, including China, but still continues to be a problem. Establishing responsibility to those performing illegal acts such as abortion is one step closer to ensuring a healthy, family oriented society. Holding doctors, clinics and establishments accountable by law is believed to make astounding differences in the sex preference.<ref>All-China Women's Federation Laws and regulations.

It is primarily important to spread public awareness though campaigns, media, and posters including advantages of females. The results of many campaigns such as the \"Care for Girls\" campaign on China, by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, encourages female births and requests participation from many neighboring countries. In one of the participating counties in Shanxi providence, the sex ratio birth was reduced from 135 in the year 2003 to 117 just three years later.<ref>Li SZ, Yan SH. A special study on \"care for girls\" campaign [article in Chinese]. Population and Family Planning 2008;10:23\u20134</ref> The country must implement a less traditional form of gender approach and encourage women for higher status positions in society. The Chinese government is essential in improving their gender and social rights. In 1992, the Law on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women ensured women equal rights among politics, culture, education, work property rights and even marriage. Evidence shows that a country who supports higher status of women leads to a less traditional view of gender and lowers the level of son preference. All these socioeconomic improvements have led to a steer away from traditional views of women to a more modern approach, working to end the gender gap in entirety.\n\n=== Change in attitudes ===\nAlthough China's sex ratio at birth is still one of the highest in the world, growing evidence has shown that son preference in China is declining.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  In recent interviews, many young Chinese adults expressed the view that they do not care about the gender of their future child, even though son preference was common in their parents' generation.<ref name=\"Zhou, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Li, & Hesketh\" />  A recent study showed that among the 66% claiming to be gender indifferent, 13% (10% urban 16% rural) prefer a boy, and 21% (22% urban and 18% rural) want a girl.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" /> Hesketh points out that with the consideration of advantages of raising girls, including that they are easier to care for, easier to find a spouse for, and take good care of aging parents, gender indifference and girl preference increase in comparison with previous son preference.<ref name=\"Hesketh, 2011\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Abortion in China]]\n* [[Female infanticide in China]]\n* [[Feminism in China]]\n* [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio]]\n* [[One-child policy]]\n* [[Prostitution in China]]\n* [[Rural society in the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Sex trafficking in China]]\n* [[Urban society in the People's Republic of China]] \n* [[Women's healthcare in the People's Republic of China]]\n\n===General===\n* [[Sex-selective abortion]]\n* [[Women in China]]\n* [[Missing women of Asia]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights in China]]\n[[Category:Sex selection in China]]\n", "name_user": "Vli66", "label": "safe", "comment": "edited the summary so it reads better", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_women_of_China"}
