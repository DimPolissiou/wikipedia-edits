In the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the highest goal is ''[[Buddhahood]]'',  in which there is no abiding in Nirvana. Buddha helps liberate beings from ''sa\u1e43s\u0101ra'' by teaching the Buddhist path. There is no rebirth for Buddha or people who attain Nirvana. But his teachings remain in the world for a certain time as a guidance to attain Nirvana.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''nirvana'' describes a state of freedom from suffering and rebirth,{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}} but different Buddhist traditions have interpreted the concept in different ways.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}{{refn|group=quote|Buswell: \"It is found in dictionaries as an English word, nirvana, and has acquired a patina that makes many assume its meaning is obvious.

Technically, in the religious traditions of India, the term denotes the process of accomplishing and experiencing freedom from the unquenchable thirst of desire and the pains of repeated births, lives, and deaths.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}}}\n\nThe term ''nirvana'' in the [[Soteriology|soteriological]] sense of \"blown out, extinguished\" state of liberation does not appear in the [[Veda]]s nor in the pre-Buddhist [[Upanishad]]s. According to [[Steven Collins (Buddhist studies scholar)|Collins]], \"the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it ''nirvana''.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-57054-1|pages=137\u2013138}}</ref> However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, is found in ancient texts of non-Buddhist Indian traditions, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] of Hinduism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Max M\u00fcller |title=Theosophy Or Psychological Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjiD_XWea7cC |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-07326-4 |pages=307\u2013310 }}</ref>\n\n===Extinction===\nThe prevalent interpretation of nirvana as \"extinction\" is based on the etymology of ''nir\u221av\u0101'' to \"blow out\".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=10}} ''Nir'' is a negative, while ''va'' is commonly taken to refer to \"to blow\".{{sfn|Swanson|1997|p=10}}\n\nThe term ''nirvana'' is part of an extensive metaphorical structure that was probably established at a very early age in Buddhism. According to Gombrich, the number of three fires alludes to the three fires which a Brahmin had to keep alight, and thereby symbolise life in the world, as a family-man.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Hwang|2006|p=12}} The meaning of this metaphor was lost in later Buddhism,{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66}}{{refn|group=quote|Gombrich: \"I hope it is not too farfetched to suggest that this may have contributed to an important development in the Mahayana: that it came to separate nirvana from bodhi, 'awakening' to the truth, Enlightenment, and to put a lower value on the former (Gombrich, 1992d). Originally nirvana and bodhi refer to the same thing; they merely use different metaphors for the experience. But the Mahayana tradition separated them and considered that nirvana referred only to the extinction of craving, with the resultant escape from the cycle of rebirth.

According to Lindtner, this lead him to taking a \"paradoxical\" stance, for instance regarding nirvana, rejecting any positive description.{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}\n\nReferring to this view, Alexander Wynne holds that there is no evidence in the [[Sutta Pitaka]] that the Buddha held this view, at best it only shows that \"some of the early Buddhists were influenced by their Brahminic peers\".<ref name=\":22\">Wynne, 2007, p. 101</ref> Wynne concludes that the Buddha rejected the views of the [[Vedas]] and that his teachings present a radical departure from these [[Historical Vedic religion|brahminical]] beliefs.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n===''Nirvana'' with and without remainder of fuel===\n[[File:Loriya Tangai Nirvana of the Buddha.jpg|thumb|250px|Buddhist sculpture of the final nirvana of the Buddha in [[Greco-Buddhist art|greco-buddhist]] [[Gandharan Buddhism|Gandharan]] style from [[Loriyan Tangai]].]]\nThere are two stages in ''nirvana'', one in life, and one final nirvana upon death; the former is imprecise and general, the latter is precise and specific.<ref name=\"Steven Collins 1982, page 2072\">Steven Collins, ''Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism.''

The Buddha explained that the disciplined way of life he recommended to his students (''dhamma-vinaya'') is a [[gradual training]] extending often over a number of years. To be committed to this path already requires that a seed of wisdom is present in the individual. This wisdom becomes manifest in the experience of awakening (''[[bodhi]]'').

The [[Sarvastivada]] Abhidharma compendium, the ''[[Mahavibhasa]]sastra,'' says of nirvana: <blockquote>As it is the cessation of [[Defilement (Buddhism)|defilements]] (klesanirodha), it is called nirvana. As it is the extinction of the triple fires, it is called nirvana. As it is the tranquility of [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]], it is called nirvana. As there is separation (viyoga) from bad odor (durgandha), it is called nirvana. As there is separation from destinies (gati), it is called nirvana. Vana means forest and nir means escape. As it is the escape from the forest of the [[Skandha|aggregates]], it is called nirvana. Vana means weaving and nir means negation. As there is no weaving, it is called nirvana. In a way that one with thread can easily be woven while one without that cannot be woven, in that way one with action ([[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]) and defilements (klesa) can easily be woven into life and death while an asaiksa who is without any action and defilements cannot be woven into life and death. That is why it is called nirvana. Vana means [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|new birth]] and nir means negation. As there is no more new birth, it is called nirvana. Vana means bondage and nir means separation. As it is separation from bondage, it is called nirvana. Vana means all discomforts of life and death and nir means passing beyond. As it passes beyond all discomforts of life and death, it is called nirvana.<ref>Hwang, 2006, pp. 11-12.</ref></blockquote>According to Soonil Hwang, the [[Sarvastivada]] school held that there were two kinds of nirodha (extinction), extinction without knowledge (''apratisamkhyanirodha'') and extinction through knowledge (''pratisamkhyanirodha''), which is the equivalent of nirvana.<ref>Hwang, 2006, p. 38.</ref> In the Sarvastivada [[Abhidharma]], extinction through knowledge was equivalent to nirvana, and was defined by its intrinsic nature (''[[svabhava]]''), \u2018all extinction which is disjunction (''visamyoga'')\u2019.<ref name=\":3\">Hwang, 2006, p. 40.</ref> This dharma is defined by the [[Abhidharmako\u015bak\u0101rik\u0101|''Abhidharmakosha'']] as \"a special understanding, the penetration (''pratisamkhyana'') of suffering and the other noble truths.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Soonil explains the Sarvastivada view of nirvana as \"the perpetual separation of an impure dharma from a series of aggregates through the antidote, \u2018acquisition of disjunction\u2019 (''visamyogaprapti'').\"<ref name=\":4\">Hwang, 2006, p. 41.</ref> Because the Sarvastivadins held that all dharmas exist in the three times, they saw the destruction of defilements as impossible and thus \"the elimination of a defilement is referred to as a \u2018separation\u2019 from the series.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Soonil adds:<blockquote>That is to say, the acquisition of the defilement is negated, or technically \u2018disjoined\u2019 (''visamyoga''), through the power of knowledge that terminates the junction between that defilement and the series of aggregates. By reason of this separation, then, there arises \u2018the acquisition of disjunction\u2019 (''visamyogaprapti'') that serves as an antidote (''pratipaksa''), which henceforward prevents the junction between the defilement and this series.<ref name=\":4\" /> </blockquote>The Sarvastivadins also held that nirvana was a real existent (''dravyasat'') which perpetually protects a series of dharmas from defilements in the past, present and future.<ref>Hwang, 2006, p. 42, 96.</ref> Their interpretation of nirvana became an issue of debate between them and the [[Sautr\u0101ntika|Sautrantika]] school. For the Sautrantikas, nirvana \"was not a real existent but a mere designation (''praj\u00f1aptisat'') and was non-existence succeeding existence (''pascadabhava'').\"<ref>Hwang, 2006, p. 77.</ref> It is something merely spoken of conventionally, without an intrinsic nature (''[[svabhava]]'').<ref name=\":5\">Hwang, 2006, p. 91.</ref> The ''Abhidharmakosha'', explaining the Sautrantika view of nirvana, states:<blockquote>The extinction through knowledge is, when latent defilements (''anusaya'') and life (''janman'') that have already been produced are extinguished, non-arising of further such by the power of knowledge (''pratisamkhya'').<ref name=\":5\" /> </blockquote>Thus for the Sautrantikas, nirvana was simply the \"non-arising of further latent defilement when all latent defilements that have been produced have already been extinguished.\"<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Pudgalavada]] school interpreted nirvana as the single Absolute truth which constitutes \"the negation, absence, cessation of all that constitutes the world in which we live, act and suffer\".<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Thi\u1ec7n Ch\u00e2u, for the Pudgalavadins, nirvana is seen as totally different than the compounded realm, since it the uncompounded (''asamskrta'') realm where no compounded things exist, and it is also beyond reasoning and expression.<ref name=\":2\" /> One of the few surviving Pudgalavada texts defines nirvana as:<blockquote>Absolute truth is the definitive cessation of all activities of speech (vac) and of all thoughts (citta).

There are those like the [[Gelug]] school, who argue that ''tath\u0101gatagarbha'' is just emptiness (described either as ''[[dharmadhatu]]'', the nature of phenomena, or a nonimplicative negation).{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}} Then there are those who see it as the non-dual union of the mind's unconditioned emptiness and conditioned lucidity (the view of [[Gorampa]] of the [[Sakya]] school).<ref>Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part, The ''Uttaratantra'' and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Snow Lion, Boston & London, 2014, page 76.</ref> Others such as the [[Jonang]] school and some [[Kagyu]] figures, see ''tath\u0101gatagarbha'' as a kind of Absolute which \"is empty of adventitious defilements which are intrinsically other than it, but is not empty of its own inherent existence\".{{sfn|Williams|1994|p=108}}\n\n=== ''Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra'' ===\nAccording to some scholars, the language used in the ''tath\u0101gatagarbha'' genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language. Kosho Yamamoto translates the explanation of nirvana in the ''[[Mah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra]]'' (c. 100-220 CE) as follows: \n{{quote|\"O good man! We speak of \"Nirvana\". But this is not \"Great\" \"Nirvana\". Why is it \"Nirvana\", but not \"Great Nirvana\"? This is so when one cuts away defilement without seeing the Buddha-Nature. That is why we say Nirvana, but not Great Nirvana. When one does not see the Buddha-Nature, what there {{not a typo|is| is}} the non-Eternal and the non-Self. All that there {{not a typo|is| is}} but Bliss and Purity. Because of this, we cannot have Mahaparinirvana, although defilement has been done away with. When one sees well the Buddha-Nature and cuts away defilement, we then have Mahaparinirvana. Seeing the Buddha-Nature, we have the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and the Pure. Because of this, we can have Mahaparinirvana, as we cut away defilement.\"<br>\n\"O good man! \"Nir\" means \"not\"; \"va\" means \"to extinguish\". Nirvana means \"non- extinction\".

Technically, in the religious traditions of India, the term denotes the process of accomplishing and experiencing freedom from the unquenchable thirst of desire and the pains of repeated births, lives, and deaths.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=600}}}}\n\nThe term ''nirvana'' in the [[Soteriology|soteriological]] sense of \"blown out, extinguished\" state of liberation does not appear in the [[Veda]]s nor in the pre-Buddhist [[Upanishad]]s.

Originally nirvana and bodhi refer to the same thing; they merely use different metaphors for the experience. But the Mahayana tradition separated them and considered that nirvana referred only to the extinction of craving, with the resultant escape from the cycle of rebirth. This interpretation ignores the third fire, delusion: the extinction of delusion is of course in the early texts identical with what can be positively expressed as gnosis, Enlightenment.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=66-67}}}} and other explanations of the word ''nirvana'' were sought.

The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 119.</ref> Jayatilleke writes that despite the definition of nirvana as 'extinction', this does not mean that it is a kind of annihilation or a state of dormant nonentity, for this contradicts the statements of the Buddha that reject this interpretation.<ref>Jayatilleke, K.N. The message of the Buddha, The Free Press, p. 121.</ref> Jayatilleke holds that the early texts clearly proclaim that nothing can be said about the state of the Buddha after ''[[Parinirvana|paranibbana]]'' (the end of his psycho-physical personality) because \"we do not have the concepts or words to describe adequately the state of the emancipated person.\" <ref>Jayatilleke, K.N.

Ultimate however, \"there is only a succession of mental and physical phenomena arising and dissolving.\" For this reason, Mahasi Sayadaw holds that although for an arahant \"cessation means the extinction of the successive rise and fall of the aggregates\" this is not the view of annihilation (''uccheda-di\u1e6d\u1e6dhi'') since there is ultimately no individual to be annihilated.<ref>Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibb\u0101na, Buddha S\u0101san\u0101nuggaha Organisation Mah\u0101si Translation Committee, Rangoon, p. 13.</ref> Mahasi further notes that \"feeling [<nowiki/>[[Vedan\u0101|''vedana'']]] ceases with the parinibb\u0101na of the Arahant\" and also that \"the cessation of [[Ayatana|senses]] is nibb\u0101na\" (citing the ''Pa\u00f1cattaya Sutta'').<ref>Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibb\u0101na, Buddha S\u0101san\u0101nuggaha Organisation Mah\u0101si Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 41, 53.</ref> Mahasi also affirms that even though nibbana is the \"cessation of mind, matter, and mental formations\" and even the cessation of \"formless consciousness\", it is not nothing, but it is an \"absolute reality\" and he also affirms that \"the peace of nibbana is real.\"<ref>Mah\u0101si Say\u0101daw, U Htin Fatt (trans.), Bhikkhu Pesala (ed.), On the Nature of Nibb\u0101na, Buddha S\u0101san\u0101nuggaha Organisation Mah\u0101si Translation Committee, Rangoon, pp. 60, 94.</ref>\n\n=== Unorthodox interpretations, ''nibbana'' as ''citta'', ''vi\u00f1\u00f1ana'' or ''atta'' ===\nIn [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Theravada]], as well as among some modern Theravada scholars, there are alternative interpretations which differ from the traditional orthodox Theravada view.

The [[Sarvastivada]] Abhidharma compendium, the ''[[Mahavibhasa]]sastra,'' says of nirvana: <blockquote>As it is the cessation of [[Defilement (Buddhism)|defilements]] (klesanirodha), it is called nirvana. As it is the extinction of the triple fires, it is called nirvana. As it is the tranquility of [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]], it is called nirvana. As there is separation (viyoga) from bad odor (durgandha), it is called nirvana. As there is separation from destinies (gati), it is called nirvana. Vana means forest and nir means escape. As it is the escape from the forest of the [[Skandha|aggregates]], it is called nirvana. Vana means weaving and nir means negation. As there is no weaving, it is called nirvana. In a way that one with thread can easily be woven while one without that cannot be woven, in that way one with action ([[Karma in Buddhism|karma]]) and defilements (klesa) can easily be woven into life and death while an asaiksa who is without any action and defilements cannot be woven into life and death. That is why it is called nirvana. Vana means [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|new birth]] and nir means negation. As there is no more new birth, it is called nirvana. Vana means bondage and nir means separation. As it is separation from bondage, it is called nirvana. Vana means all discomforts of life and death and nir means passing beyond.

On the one hand\u2014with respect to his own personal interests (''svakartham'')\u2014he is fully endowed with superior wisdom (''adhipraj\u00f1a'') and is thus not subject to the afflictions (''klesa'') while on the other hand\u2014with respect to the interests of other beings (''parartham'')\u2014he is fully endowed with great compassion (''mahakaruna'') and thus never ceases to dwell in the world of death and re-birth (''samsara'').<ref name=\":7\" />  </blockquote>According to Sponberg, in Yogacara, the Buddha's special wisdom that allows participation in both nirvana and samsara, termed non-discriminating cognition (''nirvikalpaka-j\u00f1ana)'' has various aspects: a negative aspect which is free from discrimination that binds one to samsara and positive and dynamic aspects which intuitively cognize the Absolute and give a Buddha \"access to the Absolute without yielding efficacy in the relative.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Paths to Buddhahood ===\nMost sutras of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na tradition, states Jan Nattier, present three alternate goals of the path: [[Arhat]]ship, [[Pratyekabuddha]]hood, and [[Buddhahood]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5mWcbAXqb0C|title=The Bodhisattva Path: Based on the Ugraparip\u1e5bcch\u0101, a Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btra|author=Jan Nattier|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|year=2007|isbn=978-81-208-2048-7|pages=7\u20138}}</ref> However, according an influential Mah\u0101y\u0101na text called the [[Lotus Sutra]], while the lesser attainment of individual ''nirvana'' is taught as a skillful means by the Buddha in order to help beings of lesser capacities; ultimately, the highest and ''only'' goal is the attainment of [[Buddhahood]].{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=540}}{{sfn|Baroni|2002|p=36}}{{sfn|Kornberg Greenberg|2008|p=88}} The Lotus sutra further states that, although these three paths are ''seemingly'' taught by Buddhas as separate vehicles (''yana''), they are really all just [[Upaya|skillful ways]] (''upaya'') of teaching a single path (''ekayana''), which is the bodhisattva path to full Buddhahood.<ref>Suguro, Shinjo; Nichiren Buddhist International Center, trans. (1998), Introduction to the Lotus Sutra, Jain Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0875730787}}, pp. 34-35.</ref> Thus, these three separate goals are not really different at all, the 'lesser' paths are actually just clever teaching devices used by Buddhas to get people to practice, eventually though, they will be led to the one and only path of Mah\u0101y\u0101na and full Buddhahood.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=228-229}}\n\nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na commentary the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]'' presents the path of the bodhisattva as a progressive formula of [[Five Paths|''Five Paths'' (''pa\u00f1cam\u0101rga'').]] A practitioner on the ''Five Paths'' advances through a progression of ten stages, referred to as the bodhisattva ''[[Bh\u016bmi (Buddhism)|bh\u016bmis]]'' (grounds or levels).\n\n===Omniscience===\nThe end stage practice of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na removes the imprints of [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|delusions]], the obstructions to [[omniscience]] (''sarv\u0101k\u0101raj\u00f1at\u0101''), which prevent simultaneous and direct knowledge of all phenomena. Only Buddhas have overcome these obstructions and, therefore, only Buddhas have omniscience knowledge, which refers to the power of a being in some way to have \"simultaneous knowledge of all things whatsoever\".<ref>McClintock, Sara L. Omniscience and the Rhetoric of Reason: Santaraksita and Kamalasila on Rationality, Argumentation, and Religious Authority, 2010, p. 37.\n\n</ref> From the Mah\u0101y\u0101na point of view, an arhat who has achieved the nirvana of the [[Hinayana|Lesser Vehicle]] will still have certain subtle obscurations that prevent the arhat from realizing complete omniscience. When these final obscurations are removed, the practitioner will attain ''aprati\u1e63\u1e6dhita-nirvana'' and achieve full omniscience.{{refn|group=quote|Contemporary translator Jeffrey Hopkins provides the following analogy:\"If you put garlic in a vessel, it deposits some of its odor in the vessel itself; Thus when you seek to clean the vessel, it is necessary to first remove the garlic.<br>Similarly, a [[Avidy\u0101 (Buddhism)#Uprooting avidya|consciousness conceiving inherent existence]], like garlic, deposits predispositions in the mind that produce the ''appearance'' of inherent existence; Thus, there is no way to cleanse the mind of those predispositions, which are like the flavor of garlic left in the vessel of the mind, until one removes all consciousnesses conceiving of inherent existence from the mind. First, the garlic must be removed; then, its odor can be removed.<br>For this reason, according to the [[prasangika|Consequence School]], until one has utterly removed all the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|afflictive obstructions]], one cannot begin to remove the obstructions to omniscience. Since this is the case, a practitioner cannot begin overcoming the obstructions to omniscience on any of the seven first [[Bhumi (Buddhism)|bodhisattva grounds]], which are called \"impure\" because one still has afflictive obstructions to be abandoned.<br>Rather, one begins abandoning the obstructions to omniscience on the eighth bodhisattva ground, and continues to do so on the ninth and tenth, these three being called the 'three pure grounds\" because the afflictive obstructions have been abandoned.\"<ref>Jeffery Hopkins (author). \"The Dalai Lama at Harvard: Lectures on the Buddhist Path to Peace.\" Snow Lion Publications.</ref>}}\n\n===Buddhahood's bodies===\n{{See also|Trikaya}}\n[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|228px|The ''[[Garbhadhatu]]'' [[mandala]] of the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]] representing multiple manifestations of the [[Dharmakaya]], the Buddha [[Vairocana]].]]\nSome Mah\u0101y\u0101na traditions see the Buddha in [[Docetism|docetic]] terms, viewing his visible manifestations as projections from its nirvanic state.

Lamotte writes of the Buddhas:{{quote|They are born, reach enlightenment, set turning the Wheel of Dharma, and enter nirvana.

This doctrine is interpreted in different ways by the different Mah\u0101y\u0101na traditions.

He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director.

Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}\n\nFrom the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name=\"Biskind19697\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196\u201397 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.<ref name=\"Gentry65\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref><ref name=\"Abb173\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)</ref><ref name=\"Pascal235\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]])</ref> He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,<ref name=\"Intp678\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67\u201368 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref> considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.<ref name=\"Intp678\" /><ref name=\"Intp91\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)</ref> Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not \"so much that it insults their intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Intp60\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, \"Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward.

As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.<ref name=\"McGilligan, p. 108\" />\n\nOn July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 64.<ref name=\"McGilligan192\" /> The death, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92.

These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring [[cultural icon]] of [[masculinity]].<ref name=\"Fischer, Landy & Smith\">Fischer, Landy & Smith, p. 43.</ref><ref>Kitses, p. 307.</ref>\n\nFor his work in the Western film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992) and the sports drama ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], as well as receiving nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

[[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery.

He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director.

Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}\n\nFrom the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name=\"Biskind19697\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196\u201397 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.<ref name=\"Gentry65\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref><ref name=\"Abb173\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)</ref><ref name=\"Pascal235\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]])</ref> He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,<ref name=\"Intp678\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67\u201368 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref> considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.<ref name=\"Intp678\" /><ref name=\"Intp91\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)</ref> Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not \"so much that it insults their intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Intp60\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, \"Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward.

As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.<ref name=\"McGilligan, p. 108\" />\n\nOn July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 64.<ref name=\"McGilligan192\" /> The death, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92.

Lasting only a few months, the war had several army columns crisscross the [[Texas Panhandle]] in an effort to locate, harass, and capture highly mobile Native American bands. Most of the engagements were small skirmishes in which neither side suffered many casualties. The war wound down over the last few months of 1874, as fewer and fewer Indian bands had the strength and supplies to remain in the field. Though the last significantly sized group did not surrender until mid-1875, the war marked the end of free-roaming Indian populations on the southern Great Plains.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Map of the Great Plains.png|thumb|300px|right|Region of the Great Plains in North America]]\nPrior to the arrival of [[English American]] settlers on the [[Great Plains]], the southern Plains tribes had evolved into a nomadic pattern of existence. Beginning in the 1830s, significant numbers of permanent settlements were established in what had previously been the exclusive territory of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Attacks, raids, and counter-raids occurred frequently. Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the U.S. Army was only sporadically involved in these frontier conflicts, manning forts, but limited to a handful of larger expeditions due to manpower limitations. During the Civil War, the Regular Army withdrew almost completely, and Indian raids increased dramatically. Texas, as part of the [[Confederate States of America]], lacked the military resources to fight both the Union and the tribes.<ref>Gwynne, S.C. 2010, ''Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History'', p. 207-221</ref>\n \nAfter the war, the military began reasserting itself along the frontier. The [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]], signed near present-day Medicine Lodge, Kansas, in 1867, called for two reservations to be set aside in Indian Territory, one for the Comanche and Kiowa and one for the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho. According to the treaty, the government would provide the tribes with housing, agricultural training, and food and other supplies. In exchange, the Indians agreed to cease raiding and attacking settlements. Dozens of chiefs endorsed the treaty and some tribal members moved voluntarily to the reservations, but it was never officially ratified and several groups of Indians still on the Plains did not attend the negotiations.\n \nIn 1870, a new technique for tanning [[American bison|buffalo]] hides became commercially available.<ref>Cronon, William. \"Nature's Metropolis\". W. W. Norton & Company, 1992, p. 216</ref> In response, commercial hunters began systematically targeting buffalo for the first time. Once numbering in the tens of millions, the buffalo population plummeted. By 1878, they were all but extinct.\n \nThe destruction of the buffalo herds was a disaster for the Plains Indians, on and off the reservations. The entire nomadic way of life had been based around the animals. They were used for food, fuel, and construction materials. Without abundant buffalo, the southern Plains Indians had no means of self-support.\n \nBy the winter of 1873-1874, the southern Plains Indians were in crisis. The reduction of the buffalo herds combined with increasing numbers of new settlers and more aggressive military patrols had put them in an unsustainable position.\n\n==War==\nDuring the winter, a spiritual leader named [[Isa-tai]] emerged among the Quahadi Band of Comanches. Isa-tai claimed to have the power to render himself and others invulnerable to their enemies, including to bullets, and was able to rally an enormous number of Indians for large raids. Also, a shift occurred within the political structure of the Kiowa, bringing the war faction (influenced by the head chief [[Lone Wolf the Elder|Guipago]], or Gunnjsnnjkdsv nks; vkn;svskje.nvefskjb typoi-pah-gho, sometimes known, by modern people, as Lone Wolf \"the Elder\" to prevent confusion with Mamay-dayte, later named [[Lone Wolf the Younger|Lone Wolf \"the Younger\"]]) into a greater position of influence than they had held previously.\n \n===Early engagements===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Adobe Walls}}\n[[File:Captain Pratt Native Americans.jpg|thumb|left|Native American prisoners of the Red River War, [[Fort Marion]], Florida 1875: The inscription on the back of the original stereograph says: L to R:[[Lone Wolf the Elder|Lone Wolf]], Double Vision, [[White Horse (chief)|White Horse]], [[Woman's Heart]], [[Mamante (Owl Prophet)]] - Kiowas. Officer left is Capt. [[Richard Henry Pratt|Richard H. Pratt]]]]\n\nOn 27 June 1874, Isa-tai and Comanche chief [[Quanah Parker]] led about 250 warriors in an attack on a small outpost of buffalo hunters in the [[Texas Panhandle]] called [[Adobe Walls, Texas|Adobe Walls]]. The encampment consisted of just a few buildings and was occupied by only 28 men and one woman. Though a few whites were killed in the opening moments of the Second Battle of Adobe Walls (the first had been [[First Battle of Adobe Walls|in 1864]]), the majority was able to barricade themselves indoors and hold off the attack. Using large-caliber buffalo guns, the hunters could fire on the warriors from much greater range than the Indians had expected, and the attack failed.<ref>Gwynne, S.C. 2010, ''Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History'', p. 267-271</ref>\n \nA second engagement involving the Kiowa took place in Texas. Warriors led by Lone Wolf attacked a patrol of Texas Rangers in July. The Lost Valley fight had light casualties on both sides, but it served to raise tensions along the frontier and push the Army into an aggressive response.\n \nThe explosion of violence took the government by surprise. The \"peace policy\" of the Grant administration was deemed a failure, and the Army was authorized to subdue the southern Plains tribes with whatever force necessary. At this time, roughly 1,800 Cheyennes, 2,000 Comanches, and 1,000 Kiowas remained at large. Combined, they mounted about 1,200 warriors.<ref>Utley, Robert M. 1973, ''Frontier Regulars the United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891'' [https://www.questia.com/library/book/frontier-regulars-the-united-states-army-and-the-indian-1866-1891-by-robert-m-utley.jsp online edition]\n p 211</ref>\n\n===Army response===\n[[File:Texas Panhandle.PNG|thumb|Area comprising locations of the battles in the Texas Panhandle]]\n\nGeneral [[Phillip Sheridan]] ordered five army columns to converge on the general area of the Texas Panhandle and specifically upon the upper tributaries of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. The strategy was to deny the Indians any safe haven and attack them unceasingly until they went permanently to the reservations.\n \nThree of the five columns were under the command of Colonel [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]]. The [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Tenth Cavalry]], under Lieutenant Colonel John W. Davidson, came due west from [[Fort Sill]]. The [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Eleventh Infantry]], under Lieutenant Colonel [[George P. Buell]], moved northwest from [[Fort Griffin]]. Mackenzie himself led the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Fourth Cavalry]] north from [[Fort Concho]].\n \nThe fourth column, consisting of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment|Sixth Cavalry]] and [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Fifth Infantry]], was commanded by Colonel [[Nelson A. Miles]] and came south from [[Fort Dodge (US Army Post)|Fort Dodge]]. The fifth column, the [[8th Cavalry Regiment|Eighth Cavalry]] commanded by Major William R. Price, a total of 225 officers and men, plus six Indian scouts and two guides originated from [[Fort Union National Monument|Fort Union]],<ref>Leo E. Oliva: ''Fort Union and the Frontier Army in the Southwest \u2212 A Historic Resource Study''. Division of History \u2212 National Park Service, Santa Fe, New Mexico 1993, [http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/foun/chap7.htm chapter 7]</ref> marched east via [[Fort Bascom]] in New Mexico.<ref>Gwynne, S.C. 2010 ''Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History'' p. 275-276</ref> The plan called for the converging columns to maintain a continuous offensive until a decisive defeat had been inflicted on the Indians.\n \nAs many as 20 engagements took place across the Texas Panhandle. The Army, consisting entirely of soldiers and scouts, sought to engage the Indians at any opportunity. The Indians, traveling with women, children, and elderly, mostly attempted to avoid them. When the two did encounter one another, the Indians usually tried to escape before the Army could force them to surrender. However, even a successful escape could be disastrously costly if horses, food, and equipment had to be left behind. By contrast, the Army and its Indian scouts had access to essentially limitless supplies and equipment, they frequently burned anything they captured from retreating Indians, and were capable of continuing operations indefinitely.

At dawn on September 28, Mackenzie's troops attacked down a steep canyon wall. The Indians were caught by surprise and did not have time to gather their horses or supplies before retreating. Sergeant John Charlton wrote of the battle:\n \n<blockquote>The warriors held their ground for a time, fighting desperately to cover the exit of their squaws and pack animals, but under the persistent fire of the troops, they soon began falling back.<ref>Gwynne, S.C. 2010 ''Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History'', p. 281</ref></blockquote>\n \nOnly four Indians were killed, but the loss was devastating. Mackenzie's men burned over 450 lodges and destroyed countless pounds of buffalo meat. They also took 1,400 horses, most of which were subsequently shot to prevent the Indians from recapturing them.\n \nExcept for its unusually large size, the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon was typical of the war. Most encounters produced few or no casualties, but the Indians could not afford the constant loss of food and mounts.

Lasting only a few months, the war had several army columns crisscross the [[Texas Panhandle]] in an effort to locate, harass, and capture highly mobile Native American bands. Most of the engagements were small skirmishes in which neither side suffered many casualties. The war wound down over the last few months of 1874, as fewer and fewer Indian bands had the strength and supplies to remain in the field. Though the last significantly sized group did not surrender until mid-1875, the war marked the end of free-roaming Indian populations on the southern Great Plains.\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Map of the Great Plains.png|thumb|300px|right|Region of the Great Plains in North America]]\nPrior to the arrival of [[English American]] settlers on the [[Great Plains]], the southern Plains tribes had evolved into a nomadic pattern of existence. Beginning in the 1830s, significant numbers of permanent settlements were established in what had previously been the exclusive territory of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Attacks, raids, and counter-raids occurred frequently. Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the U.S. Army was only sporadically involved in these frontier conflicts, manning forts, but limited to a handful of larger expeditions due to manpower limitations. During the Civil War, the Regular Army withdrew almost completely, and Indian raids increased dramatically. Texas, as part of the [[Confederate States of America]], lacked the military resources to fight both the Union and the tribes.<ref>Gwynne, S.C. 2010, ''Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History'', p. 207-221</ref>\n \nAfter the war, the military began reasserting itself along the frontier. The [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]], signed near present-day Medicine Lodge, Kansas, in 1867, called for two reservations to be set aside in Indian Territory, one for the Comanche and Kiowa and one for the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho. According to the treaty, the government would provide the tribes with housing, agricultural training, and food and other supplies. In exchange, the Indians agreed to cease raiding and attacking settlements. Dozens of chiefs endorsed the treaty and some tribal members moved voluntarily to the reservations, but it was never officially ratified and several groups of Indians still on the Plains did not attend the negotiations.\n \nIn 1870, a new technique for tanning [[American bison|buffalo]] hides became commercially available.<ref>Cronon, William. \"Nature's Metropolis\". W. W. Norton & Company, 1992, p. 216</ref> In response, commercial hunters began systematically targeting buffalo for the first time. Once numbering in the tens of millions, the buffalo population plummeted. By 1878, they were all but extinct.\n \nThe destruction of the buffalo herds was a disaster for the Plains Indians, on and off the reservations. The entire nomadic way of life had been based around the animals. They were used for food, fuel, and construction materials. Without abundant buffalo, the southern Plains Indians had no means of self-support.\n \nBy the winter of 1873-1874, the southern Plains Indians were in crisis. The reduction of the buffalo herds combined with increasing numbers of new settlers and more aggressive military patrols had put them in an unsustainable position.\n\n==War==\nDuring the winter, a spiritual leader named [[Isa-tai]] emerged among the Quahadi Band of Comanches. Isa-tai claimed to have the power to render himself and others invulnerable to their enemies, including to bullets, and was able to rally an enormous number of Indians for large raids. Also, a shift occurred within the political structure of the Kiowa, bringing the war faction (influenced by the head chief [[Lone Wolf the Elder|Guipago]], or Gui-pah-gho, sometimes known, by modern people, as Lone Wolf \"the Elder\" to prevent confusion with Mamay-dayte, later named [[Lone Wolf the Younger|Lone Wolf \"the Younger\"]]) into a greater position of influence than they had held previously.\n \n===Early engagements===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Adobe Walls}}\n[[File:Captain Pratt Native Americans.jpg|thumb|left|Native American prisoners of the Red River War, [[Fort Marion]], Florida 1875: The inscription on the back of the original stereograph says: L to R:[[Lone Wolf the Elder|Lone Wolf]], Double Vision, [[White Horse (chief)|White Horse]], [[Woman's Heart]], [[Mamante (Owl Prophet)]] - Kiowas. Officer left is Capt. [[Richard Henry Pratt|Richard H. Pratt]]]]\n\nOn 27 June 1874, Isa-tai and Comanche chief [[Quanah Parker]] led about 250 warriors in an attack on a small outpost of buffalo hunters in the [[Texas Panhandle]] called [[Adobe Walls, Texas|Adobe Walls]]. The encampment consisted of just a few buildings and was occupied by only 28 men and one woman. Though a few whites were killed in the opening moments of the Second Battle of Adobe Walls (the first had been [[First Battle of Adobe Walls|in 1864]]), the majority was able to barricade themselves indoors and hold off the attack. Using large-caliber buffalo guns, the hunters could fire on the warriors from much greater range than the Indians had expected, and the attack failed.<ref>Gwynne, S.C. 2010, ''Empire of the Summer Moon: Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the Most Powerful Indian Tribe in American History'', p. 267-271</ref>\n \nA second engagement involving the Kiowa took place in Texas. Warriors led by Lone Wolf attacked a patrol of Texas Rangers in July. The Lost Valley fight had light casualties on both sides, but it served to raise tensions along the frontier and push the Army into an aggressive response.\n \nThe explosion of violence took the government by surprise. The \"peace policy\" of the Grant administration was deemed a failure, and the Army was authorized to subdue the southern Plains tribes with whatever force necessary. At this time, roughly 1,800 Cheyennes, 2,000 Comanches, and 1,000 Kiowas remained at large. Combined, they mounted about 1,200 warriors.<ref>Utley, Robert M. 1973, ''Frontier Regulars the United States Army and the Indian, 1866-1891'' [https://www.questia.com/library/book/frontier-regulars-the-united-states-army-and-the-indian-1866-1891-by-robert-m-utley.jsp online edition]\n p 211</ref>\n\n===Army response===\n[[File:Texas Panhandle.PNG|thumb|Area comprising locations of the battles in the Texas Panhandle]]\n\nGeneral [[Phillip Sheridan]] ordered five army columns to converge on the general area of the Texas Panhandle and specifically upon the upper tributaries of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. The strategy was to deny the Indians any safe haven and attack them unceasingly until they went permanently to the reservations.\n \nThree of the five columns were under the command of Colonel [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]]. The [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Tenth Cavalry]], under Lieutenant Colonel John W. Davidson, came due west from [[Fort Sill]]. The [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Eleventh Infantry]], under Lieutenant Colonel [[George P. Buell]], moved northwest from [[Fort Griffin]]. Mackenzie himself led the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Fourth Cavalry]] north from [[Fort Concho]].\n \nThe fourth column, consisting of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment|Sixth Cavalry]] and [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)|Fifth Infantry]], was commanded by Colonel [[Nelson A. Miles]] and came south from [[Fort Dodge (US Army Post)|Fort Dodge]]. The fifth column, the [[8th Cavalry Regiment|Eighth Cavalry]] commanded by Major William R.

The Army, consisting entirely of soldiers and scouts, sought to engage the Indians at any opportunity. The Indians, traveling with women, children, and elderly, mostly attempted to avoid them. When the two did encounter one another, the Indians usually tried to escape before the Army could force them to surrender. However, even a successful escape could be disastrously costly if horses, food, and equipment had to be left behind. By contrast, the Army and its Indian scouts had access to essentially limitless supplies and equipment, they frequently burned anything they captured from retreating Indians, and were capable of continuing operations indefinitely.

She also served as an accompanist to her father, who participated in a series of conferences concerning singing.{{sfn|Gourret|1987|p=153}} At the suggestion of [[Pierre-Barth\u00e9lemy Gheusi]] (later director of the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]]) she took up singing, studying with both her father and her mother.{{sfn|Kutsch|Riemens|2012|p=1730}}\n\nShe made her debut at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in the role of Charlotte in Massenet\u2019s ''[[Werther]]'' on 16 September 1933 and became one of the company's central  performers.{{sfn|Gourret|1987|p=153}} Among her roles there were Bizet's [[Carmen]], Santuzza in Mascagni's ''[[Cavalleria Rusticana]]'', Toinette in [[Xavier Leroux]]'s ''Le Chemineau'', Dulcin\u00e9e in Massenet's ''[[Don Quichotte]]'', Jacqueline in Gounod's ''[[Le m\u00e9decin malgr\u00e9 lui]]'', the mother in Charpentier's ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'', the title role in ''[[Mignon]]'' by [[Ambroise Thomas]], Genevi\u00e8ve in Debussy's ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]'', Panttasil\u00e9e in Xavier Leroux's ''[[La reine Fiammette]]'', Rosette in Massenet's ''[[Manon]]'', Margared in Lalo's ''[[Le roi d\u2019Ys]]'', the title role in Puccini's ''[[Tosca]]'', Salud in de Falla's ''[[La vida breve]]'', and Popp\u00e9e in a French-language version of Monteverdi's ''[[L\u2019incoronazione di Poppea]]''.{{sfn|Kutsch|Riemens|2012|volume=4|p=1730}}\n\nShe participated in six world premieres, among them Magdeleine in [[Antoine Mariotte]]\u2019s ''Gargantua'', Ninon in Hector Fraggi's ''A quoi r\u00eaent les jeunes filles'', and the title role in [[Darius Milhaud]]\u2019s ''Esther de Carpentras''.{{sfn|Gourret|1987|p=153}}\n\nShe made her debut with the [[Paris Opera]] at the Palais Garnier on 13 October 1936 in the title role of Massenet's ''[[Herodiade]]''.
