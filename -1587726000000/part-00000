This has been also the case with the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, who have successfully claimed restitution against many States where their property had been confiscated. Whenever possible [[restitutio in integrum]] (complete restitution, restoration to the previous condition) should be granted, so as to re-establish the situation that existed before the violation occurred.

While it was never ratified, there can be found individuals, historians, organisations, or politicians that share the thoughts of Henry C. Theriault (Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Massachusetts) specializing in social and political philosophy; he thinks:\n<blockquote>...some of its elements retain the force of law and the treaty itself is not superseded by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. In particular, the fixing of the proper borders of an Armenian state was undertaken pursuant to the treaty and determined by a '''binding arbitral award'''. Regardless of whether the treaty was ultimately ratified, ''the committee process determining the arbitral award was agreed to by the parties to the treaty'' and, according to international law, the resulting determination has legal force regardless of the ultimate fate of the treaty. This means that, under international law, the \u201cWilsonian boundaries\u201d are the proper boundaries of the Armenian state that should exist in Asia Minor today.<ref name=\"Theriault\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Treaties of Alexandropol and Kars===\n{{Main|Treaty of Alexandropol|Treaty of Kars}}\n\nThe Treaty of S\u00e8vres was superseded by the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War]] of 1920.<ref name=\"Atlas\">[http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Armenia/turkarwar.htm Dr. Andrew Andersen, Ph.D., ''Atlas of Conflicts: Turkish-Armenian War'']</ref> The following Treaty of Alexandropol stipulated that Armenia renounce the terms of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres and its associated promises of awarding land from the region of \"[[Western Armenia]]\" to the Republic of Armenia, and declared the Treaty of S\u00e8vres to be null and void.<ref name=\"Chorbajian1994\">{{cite book|author=Levon Chorbajian|title=The Caucasian Knot: The History & Geopolitics of Nagorno-Karabagh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUlnYdOHJ3wC&pg=PA132|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-288-1|page=132}}</ref> Because of the Soviet invasion of Armenia before the signing of the Treaty of Alexandropol, the Armenian parliament never had the chance to ratify it.

The report includes the very innovative option of allowing Turkey to retain political sovereignty over the lands in question but demilitarizing them and allowing Armenians to join present inhabitants with full political protection and business and residency rights.<ref name=\"Theriault\"/>\n\n==The issues of \"holding responsible\"==\n\nIn the sense of responsibility for the Genocide the issue can be separated into 2 major concepts: personal and state.\n\n===The issue of personal responsibility and \u201cpunishment\u201d===\n\nIt is an accepted principle of law, that criminal cases may be brought against living people only. In this scope criminal proceedings of this kind are currently impossible as the perpetrators are already dead. In this regard the possibility of involvement by [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) seems impossible not only because of that, but also that by its regulations it has no retroactive jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\">{{cite book | last = Hovannisian | first = Richard | title = The Armenian Genocide and International Law | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xtWMAOYXyKsC&lpg=PA149&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate = June 19, 2010 | pages = 146\u201353 | isbn = 9781412827676 | year = 2003}}</ref>\n\nThis kind of proceeding already took place. The perpetrators were found guilty in the [[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919\u20131920]] in [[War Crimes]] and [[Crime against humanity]], but the main culprits had been helped to escape and the process was halted because there was no international legal framework at that time. From the [[Malta exiles]] taken by the Allied forces headed by Britain that included more than 140 people in the aftermath of World War I, several suspected criminals were never tried. In 1921 some were returned in exchange for British POW. Right after that, most of the detainees were released after negotiations between Britain and the newly formed Ankara government of Ataturk. The trials were halted with the emergence of the [[Turkish National Movement]] and afterwards the new Kemalist government pardoned those who were serving their sentences in 1923.\n\n===The issue of \"punishment\" of the responsible state===\n\nIn the modern International Law, however, the idea of criminal liability of states is affirmed. This way the Article 19 of the initial draft articles on state responsibility adopted by the [[International Law Commission]] (ILC) genocide was listed among the international crimes. Such an assertion opens the way for an international \"punishment\" of the state to which genocidal acts are attributed. This could be the case with Turkey if it is held responsible for the Armenian Genocide.<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\"/> Despite this in the general frames of this draft the mechanisms, the level of responsibility and other factors are quite vague which explains the final deletion of the word \"crime\" from the draft of ILC and makes mention of an unclear \"serious breach of an obligation arising under a pre-emptory norm of general international law\".<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\"/>\n\nAccording to some, there does not exist a proper mechanism to hold Turkey responsible for the damage caused to Armenians by the genocide. In this scope, according to Professor [[Richard Hovannisian]], this kind of process is possible by the consent of the parties, and such an agreement or treaty between Armenia and Turkey does not exist. Neither does the exchange of optional clauses of compulsory jurisdiction in accordance with the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). And so there is no institution or court, except for the [[European Court for Human Rights]] (ECHR), Turkey could be brought before without its own consent. The latter is an international but not an interstate court. It is established to decide the individual claims against the states on issues of [[European convention on human rights]], which is not helpful in the issue of reparations. Turkey has a current offer to establish an international committee of historians to research and make a decision on the events of 1915.<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\"/>\n\n==Dealing with the reparations==\n\n===Grounds in International Law===\n\nThe United Nations [[Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law]] provide in part:\n<blockquote>Reparation may be claimed individually and where appropriate collectively, by the direct victims of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, the immediate family, dependants or other persons or groups of persons closely connected with the direct victims.<ref name=\"UNHCR\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile current members of Turkish society cannot be blamed morally for the destruction of Armenians, the present-day [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]], as the [[successor state]] to the Ottoman Empire and as beneficiary of the wealth and land expropriations brought forth through the genocide, is responsible for reparations.<ref name=\"Theriault\"/>\nProfessor de Zayas states the following:\n<blockquote>The lands, buildings, bank accounts and other property of the Armenian communities in Turkey were systematically confiscated. Should there be no restitution for this act of mass theft, accompanying, as it did, the ultimate crime of genocide?</blockquote>\nPr. de Zayas states that the restitution of confiscated Armenian property remains a continuing State responsibility also because of Turkey's current human rights obligations under international treaty law, particularly the corpus of international human rights law.<ref name=\"Alfred de Zayas\"/>\n\nParticularly important are Principles 9 and 12 that state that civil claims relating to reparations for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law shall not be subject to statutes of limitations (article 9), and that restitution shall be provided to re-establish the situation that existed prior to the violations of human rights or international humanitarian law. The restitution requires, ''inter alia'' - return to one's place of residence and restoration of property.<ref name=\"UNHCR\">{{Cite web|authorlink=COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS |title=QUESTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL PERSONS SUBJECTED TO ANY FORM OF DETENTION OR IMPRISONMENT |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/b3111e1e8f4a9278c125660f004e5fcf?Opendocument |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523165111/http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/b3111e1e8f4a9278c125660f004e5fcf?Opendocument |archivedate=2013-05-23 }}</ref><ref>Commission on Human Rights, fifty-third session, Doc.

While it was never ratified, there can be found individuals, historians, organisations, or politicians that share the thoughts of Henry C. Theriault (Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Massachusetts) specializing in social and political philosophy; he thinks:\n<blockquote>...some of its elements retain the force of law and the treaty itself is not superseded by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. In particular, the fixing of the proper borders of an Armenian state was undertaken pursuant to the treaty and determined by a '''binding arbitral award'''. Regardless of whether the treaty was ultimately ratified, ''the committee process determining the arbitral award was agreed to by the parties to the treaty'' and, according to international law, the resulting determination has legal force regardless of the ultimate fate of the treaty.

The report includes the very innovative option of allowing Turkey to retain political sovereignty over the lands in question but demilitarizing them and allowing Armenians to join present inhabitants with full political protection and business and residency rights.<ref name=\"Theriault\"/>\n\n==The issues of \"holding responsible\"==\n\nIn the sense of responsibility for the Genocide the issue can be separated into 2 major concepts: personal and state.\n\n===The issue of personal responsibility and \u201cpunishment\u201d===\n\nIt is an accepted principle of law, that criminal cases may be brought against living people only. In this scope criminal proceedings of this kind are currently impossible as the perpetrators are already dead. In this regard the possibility of involvement by [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) seems impossible not only because of that, but also that by its regulations it has no retroactive jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\">{{cite book | last = Hovannisian | first = Richard | title = The Armenian Genocide and International Law | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xtWMAOYXyKsC&lpg=PA149&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q&f=false | accessdate = June 19, 2010 | pages = 146\u201353 | isbn = 9781412827676 | year = 2003}}</ref>\n\nThis kind of proceeding already took place. The perpetrators were found guilty in the [[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919\u20131920]] in [[War Crimes]] and [[Crime against humanity]], but the main culprits had been helped to escape and the process was halted because there was no international legal framework at that time. From the [[Malta exiles]] taken by the Allied forces headed by Britain that included more than 140 people in the aftermath of World War I, several suspected criminals were never tried. In 1921 some were returned in exchange for British POW. Right after that, most of the detainees were released after negotiations between Britain and the newly formed Ankara government of Ataturk. The trials were halted with the emergence of the [[Turkish National Movement]] and afterwards the new Kemalist government pardoned those who were serving their sentences in 1923.\n\n===The issue of \"punishment\" of the responsible state===\n\nIn the modern International Law, however, the idea of criminal liability of states is affirmed. This way the Article 19 of the initial draft articles on state responsibility adopted by the [[International Law Commission]] (ILC) genocide was listed among the international crimes. Such an assertion opens the way for an international \"punishment\" of the state to which genocidal acts are attributed. This could be the case with Turkey if it is held responsible for the Armenian Genocide.<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\"/> Despite this in the general frames of this draft the mechanisms, the level of responsibility and other factors are quite vague which explains the final deletion of the word \"crime\" from the draft of ILC and makes mention of an unclear \"serious breach of an obligation arising under a pre-emptory norm of general international law\".<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\"/>\n\nAccording to some, there does not exist a proper mechanism to hold Turkey responsible for the damage caused to Armenians by the genocide. In this scope, according to Professor [[Richard Hovannisian]], this kind of process is possible by the consent of the parties, and such an agreement or treaty between Armenia and Turkey does not exist. Neither does the exchange of optional clauses of compulsory jurisdiction in accordance with the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). And so there is no institution or court, except for the [[European Court for Human Rights]] (ECHR), Turkey could be brought before without its own consent. The latter is an international but not an interstate court. It is established to decide the individual claims against the states on issues of [[European convention on human rights]], which is not helpful in the issue of reparations. Turkey has a current offer to establish an international committee of historians to research and make a decision on the events of 1915.<ref name=\"Hovannisian TAGIL\"/>\n\n==Dealing with the reparations==\n\n===Grounds in International Law===\n\nThe United Nations [[Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law]] provide in part:\n<blockquote>Reparation may be claimed individually and where appropriate collectively, by the direct victims of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, the immediate family, dependants or other persons or groups of persons closely connected with the direct victims.<ref name=\"UNHCR\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile current members of Turkish society cannot be blamed morally for the destruction of Armenians, the present-day [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]], as the [[successor state]] to the Ottoman Empire and as beneficiary of the wealth and land expropriations brought forth through the genocide, is responsible for reparations.<ref name=\"Theriault\"/>\nProfessor de Zayas states the following:\n<blockquote>The lands, buildings, bank accounts and other property of the Armenian communities in Turkey were systematically confiscated. Should there be no restitution for this act of mass theft, accompanying, as it did, the ultimate crime of genocide?</blockquote>\nPr. de Zayas states that the restitution of confiscated Armenian property remains a continuing State responsibility also because of Turkey's current human rights obligations under international treaty law, particularly the corpus of international human rights law.<ref name=\"Alfred de Zayas\"/>\n\nParticularly important are Principles 9 and 12 that state that civil claims relating to reparations for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law shall not be subject to statutes of limitations (article 9), and that restitution shall be provided to re-establish the situation that existed prior to the violations of human rights or international humanitarian law.

The city gave its name to the [[Angora wool]] shorn from [[Angora rabbit]]s, the long-haired [[Angora goat]] (the source of [[mohair]]), and the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]. The area is also known for its pears, honey and [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] grapes.

As of 2016, Ankara Province has a population of 5,346,518.<ref>Turkish Statistical Institute, 1 Feb. 2019 data</ref>\n\nWhen Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.\n\nNevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[G\u00fczelkent, Etimesgut|G\u00fczelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.\n\n\u00c7orum and Yozgat, which are located in Central Anatolia and whose population is decreasing, are the provinces with the highest net migration to Ankara.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110920035746/http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2=&report=turkiye_il_koy_sehir.RDF&p_il1=6&p_kod=2&p_yil=2008&desformat=html&ENVID=adnksdb2Env</ref> About half of the Central Anatolia population of 15,608,868 people resides in Ankara.\n\nThe population of Ankara has a higher education level than the country average. According to 2008 data, 15-years-higher literacy rate creates 88% of the total provincial population (91% in men and 86% in women). This ratio was 83% for Turkey (88% males, 79% females). This difference is particularly evident in the university educated segment of the population. The ratio of university and high school graduates to total population is 10.6% in Ankara, while 5.4% in Turkey.<ref>http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2=&report=il_cinsiyet_yasgrp_egitim_top.RDF&p_kod=2&p_il1=6&p_xkod=egitim_kod&p_yil=2008&desformat=html&ENVID=adnksdb2Env</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n{{Main|History of Ankara|Timeline of Ankara}}\n[[File:MuseumOfAnatolianCivilizationsHittiteArtifacts.jpg|thumb|[[Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck bronze standards|Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck bronze standard]] on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]]\n[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230\u2013220&nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]]. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late 3rd century BC, at the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]\n\nThe region's history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]], which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygia]]ns, and later by the [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and finally republican [[Turkey]]).\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe oldest settlements in and around the city center of Ankara belonged to the [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]] which existed during the [[Bronze Age]] and was gradually absorbed c. 2000\u20131700 BC by the [[Hittite language|Indo-European]] [[Hittites]]. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000&nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1., \"Ancyra was actually older even than that.\"''</ref>\n\nPhrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].\n\nAnother important expansion took place under the [[Pontic Greeks|Greeks]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]] who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name \u1f0c\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 (''\u00c1nkyra'', meaning ''[[anchor]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) which, in slightly modified form, provides the modern name of ''Ankara''.\n\n===Celtic history===\n\nIn 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a [[Celts|Celt]]ic group, the [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers, the headquarters of the [[Tectosages]] tribe.<ref>[[Livy]], xxxviii. 16</ref> Other centers were [[Pessinus|Pessinos]], today's ''Balhisar'', for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the ''Tolstibogii'' tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]].\n\n===Roman history===\n[[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman province|province]] with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25&nbsp;BC.]]\n\nThe city was subsequently passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. In 25 BC, Emperor [[Augustus]] raised it to the status of a ''[[polis]]'' and made it the capital city of the [[Roman province]] of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]].<ref name=\"TIB\">{{cite book|last=Belke|first=Klaus|title=Tabula Imperii Byzantini, Band 4: Galatien und Lykaonien|chapter=Ankyra|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tabulaimperiibyz0000unse/page/126 126\u2013130]|location=Vienna|publisher=Verlag der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|year=1984|language=German|isbn=978-3-7001-0634-0|url=https://archive.org/details/tabulaimperiibyz0000unse/page/126}}</ref> Ankara is famous for the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (''Temple of Augustus and Rome'') which contains the official record of the ''Acts of Augustus'', known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments. Two other Galatian tribal centers, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.\n\n[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 AD, just before his death, by the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved on the walls of the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]]\n[[File:AnkaraRomanBaths1.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] were constructed by the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (212\u2013217) in honor of [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine, and built around three principal rooms: the ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and the ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath) in a typically laid-out {{convert|80|x|120|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} classical complex.]]\n\nAn estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the [[Ankara River|Ankara \u00c7ay\u0131]], ran through the center of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. \u00c7ankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the \u00c7ankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gen\u00e7lik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAncyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north\u2013south and east\u2013west intersected, giving it major strategic importance for Rome's eastern frontier.<ref name=\"TIB\"/> The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of Palmyrean empress [[Zenobia]] in the [[Syrian Desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.\n\nThe town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284\u2013305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eski\u015fehir]]).\n\nIn its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town.\n\n===Byzantine history===\nThe city is well known during the 4th century as a centre of Christian activity (see also [[#Ecclesiastical history|below]]), due to frequent imperial visits, and through the letters of the pagan scholar [[Libanius]].<ref name=\"TIB\"/> Bishop [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] and [[Basil of Ancyra]] were active in the theological controversies of their day, and the city was the site of no less than three church synods in [[Synod of Ancyra|314]], 358 and 375, the latter two in favour of [[Arianism]].<ref name=\"TIB\"/> The city was visited by Emperor [[Constans I]] (r. 337\u2013350) in 347 and 350, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (r. 361\u2013363) during his Persian campaign in 362, and Julian's successor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] (r. 363\u2013364) in winter 363/364 (he entered his [[Roman consul|consulship]] while in the city). After Jovian's death soon after, [[Valentinian I]] (r. 364\u2013375) was acclaimed emperor at Ancyra, and in the next year his brother [[Valens]] (r. 364\u2013378) used Ancyra as his base against the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]].<ref name=\"TIB\"/> When the province of Galatia was divided sometime in 396/99, Ancyra remained the civil capital of Galatia I, as well as its ecclesiastical centre ([[metropolitan see]]).<ref name=\"TIB\"/> Emperor [[Arcadius]] (r. 395\u2013408) frequently used the city as his summer residence, and some information about the ecclesiastical affairs of the city during the early 5th century is found in the works of [[Palladius of Galatia]] and Nilus of Galatia.<ref name=\"TIB\"/>\n\nIn 479, the rebel [[Marcian (usurper)|Marcian]] attacked the city, without being able to capture it.<ref name=\"TIB\"/> In 610/11, [[Comentiolus (brother of Phocas)|Comentiolus]], brother of Emperor [[Phocas]] (r. 602\u2013610), launched his own unsuccessful rebellion in the city against [[Heraclius]] (r. 610\u2013641).<ref name=\"TIB\"/> Ten years later, in 620 or more likely 622, it was captured by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns during the [[Byzantine\u2013Sassanid War of 602\u2013628]].

Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''[[Ahis|Ahiler]]'' chose Angora as their independent city-state in 1290.

In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Angora in 1920. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was won and the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Angora had officially replaced Constantinople as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Ankara</ref>, and Republican officials declared that the city's name is Ankara.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/mar28/istanbul-not-constantinople/ |title=Istanbul, not Constantinople |last=Society |date=2014-03-04 |website=National Geographic Society |language=en |access-date=2019-03-28 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called ''Ulus'', and a new section, called ''Yeni\u015fehir''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered on [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Meydan\u0131|K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital in 1923, when it was \"a small town of no importance\".<ref>Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer</ref> In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781. Ankara continued to grow rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century and eventually outranked [[Izmir]] as Turkey's second largest city, after [[Istanbul]].

In the 280s we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.\n\n[[File:Teodot Ankirski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|St. Theodotus of Ancyra]]]]\nAs in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ancyra|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off I\u015f\u0131klar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint.\n\nHowever, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of [[Synod of Ancyra|an important council]] of the [[Early Christianity|early church]];{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession (religion)|Sacrament of Penance]]. {{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} The synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of ''[[Lapsi (Christianity)|lapsi]]''\u2014Christians who had given in to forced [[paganism]] (sacrifices) to avoid [[martyrdom]] during these persecutions.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}}\n[[File:AnkaraColumnFar c.JPG|thumb|The ''Column of Julian'' (362) was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra.|281x281px]]\n\nThough paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.{{sfn|Parvis|2006|pp=325\u2013345}}\n\nIn 362\u2013363, the Emperor Julian passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men.<ref name=gibbon>{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]|authorlink=Edward Gibbon|page=Chapter 23}}</ref> The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as \"Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations\", can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]].\n\nIn the late 4th century, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408\u2013450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there.\n\nThe [[Metropolis of Ancyra]] continued to be a residential [[episcopal see|see]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] until the 20th century, with about 40,000 faithful, mostly Turkish-speaking, but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]. The earlier [[Armenian Genocide]] put an end to the residential eparchy of Ancyra of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], which had been established in 1850.<ref name=\"Bull Universi Dominici gregis\">[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51627x/f401.image Bull ''Universi Dominici gregis''], in Giovanni Domenico Mansi, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio'', vol.

The last incumbent died in 1976.\n\n==== Saint Clement Church ====\n\nThe [[Clement of Ancyra|Saint Clement]] Church is the only structure survived from the [[Byzantine]] era in Ankara. \nThe church is believed to have been built between the 4th and 9th centuries.\nAt the time of the Ottoman Sultan [[Murad II]], a mosque and [[madrasah]] were built on top of the church.

The high population within \u00c7ankaya, as well as [[Yenimahalle]] to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district. Overall, the AKP enjoys the most support throughout the city. The electorate of Ankara thus tend to vote in favour of the political right, far more so than the other main cities of [[Istanbul]] and [[\u0130zmir]].

There is also the newly expanded ''[[ANKAmall]]'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region. In 2014 a few more shopping malls were open in Ankara. They are ''Next Level'' and ''Taurus'' on the Boulevard of [[Mevlana]] (also known as [[Konya]] Road).\n\n==Culture==\n\n=== The arts ===\n[[File:TurkishStateTheatresHeadOfficeInAnkara.JPG|thumb|The historic Evkaf Apartment (1929) is the headquarters of the [[Turkish State Theatres]].

Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.\n\nThey mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)\n\nEyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The [[Cat coat genetics#White spotting and epistatic white|W gene]] which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.\n\nEars are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.\n\n===Angora rabbit===\n{{Main|Angora rabbit}}\n[[File:Joey Giant Angora Buck.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Angora rabbit]]]]\n\nThe [[Angora rabbit]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara tav\u015fan\u0131}}) is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]] and [[Angora goat]]. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long [[Angora wool]], which may be removed by [[sheep shearing|shear]]ing, combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|pluck]]ing (gently pulling loose wool.)\n\nAngoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called \"wool block\" is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |title=Angora Rabbit Breeds \u2013 How to Care for Your Angora Rabbit |accessdate=29 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125215910/http://joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |archivedate=25 January 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.\n\n===Angora goat===\n{{Main|Angora goat}}\n[[File:Quebec angora goat.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Angora goat]]]]\n\nThe [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara ke\u00e7isi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.<ref name=\"Ekarius\">{{cite book|author=Carol Ekarius|title=Storey's Illustrated Breed Guide to Sheep, Goats, Cattle, and Pigs: 163 Breeds from Common to Rare|date=10 September 2008|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=978-1-60342-037-2|page=150}}</ref>\n\nThis breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |accessdate=29 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703174935/http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |archivedate=3 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.\n\nThe [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between {{convert|5|and|8|kg|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The United States, [[Turkey]], and South Africa are the top producers of mohair.\n\nFor a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.\n\nAngora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938\u20131952.<ref>[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]    {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=3 June 2009 }}.

The [[Government of Turkey|government]] is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, located at the centre of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the [[Angora wool]] shorn from [[Angora rabbit]]s, the long-haired [[Angora goat]] (the source of [[mohair]]), and the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]. The area is also known for its pears, honey and [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] grapes.

As of 2016, Ankara Province has a population of 5,346,518.<ref>Turkish Statistical Institute, 1 Feb. 2019 data</ref>\n\nWhen Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.\n\nNevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[G\u00fczelkent, Etimesgut|G\u00fczelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.\n\n\u00c7orum and Yozgat, which are located in Central Anatolia and whose population is decreasing, are the provinces with the highest net migration to Ankara.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110920035746/http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2=&report=turkiye_il_koy_sehir.RDF&p_il1=6&p_kod=2&p_yil=2008&desformat=html&ENVID=adnksdb2Env</ref> About half of the Central Anatolia population of 15,608,868 people resides in Ankara.\n\nThe population of Ankara has a higher education level than the country average. According to 2008 data, 15-years-higher literacy rate creates 88% of the total provincial population (91% in men and 86% in women). This ratio was 83% for Turkey (88% males, 79% females). This difference is particularly evident in the university educated segment of the population. The ratio of university and high school graduates to total population is 10.6% in Ankara, while 5.4% in Turkey.<ref>http://report.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2=&report=il_cinsiyet_yasgrp_egitim_top.RDF&p_kod=2&p_il1=6&p_xkod=egitim_kod&p_yil=2008&desformat=html&ENVID=adnksdb2Env</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n{{Main|History of Ankara|Timeline of Ankara}}\n[[File:MuseumOfAnatolianCivilizationsHittiteArtifacts.jpg|thumb|[[Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck bronze standards|Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck bronze standard]] on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]]\n[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230\u2013220&nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]]. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late 3rd century BC, at the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]\n\nThe region's history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]], which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygia]]ns, and later by the [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and finally republican [[Turkey]]).\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe oldest settlements in and around the city center of Ankara belonged to the [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]] which existed during the [[Bronze Age]] and was gradually absorbed c. 2000\u20131700 BC by the [[Hittite language|Indo-European]] [[Hittites]]. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000&nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1., \"Ancyra was actually older even than that.\"''</ref>\n\nPhrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].\n\nAnother important expansion took place under the [[Pontic Greeks|Greeks]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]] who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name \u1f0c\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 (''\u00c1nkyra'', meaning ''[[anchor]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) which, in slightly modified form, provides the modern name of ''Ankara''.\n\n===Celtic history===\n\nIn 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a [[Celts|Celt]]ic group, the [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers, the headquarters of the [[Tectosages]] tribe.<ref>[[Livy]], xxxviii. 16</ref> Other centers were [[Pessinus|Pessinos]], today's ''Balhisar'', for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the ''Tolstibogii'' tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]].\n\n===Roman history===\n[[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman province|province]] with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25&nbsp;BC.]]\n\nThe city was subsequently passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. In 25 BC, Emperor [[Augustus]] raised it to the status of a ''[[polis]]'' and made it the capital city of the [[Roman province]] of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]].<ref name=\"TIB\">{{cite book|last=Belke|first=Klaus|title=Tabula Imperii Byzantini, Band 4: Galatien und Lykaonien|chapter=Ankyra|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tabulaimperiibyz0000unse/page/126 126\u2013130]|location=Vienna|publisher=Verlag der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|year=1984|language=German|isbn=978-3-7001-0634-0|url=https://archive.org/details/tabulaimperiibyz0000unse/page/126}}</ref> Ankara is famous for the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (''Temple of Augustus and Rome'') which contains the official record of the ''Acts of Augustus'', known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments. Two other Galatian tribal centers, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.\n\n[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 AD, just before his death, by the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved on the walls of the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]]\n[[File:AnkaraRomanBaths1.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] were constructed by the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (212\u2013217) in honor of [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine, and built around three principal rooms: the ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and the ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath) in a typically laid-out {{convert|80|x|120|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} classical complex.]]\n\nAn estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the [[Ankara River|Ankara \u00c7ay\u0131]], ran through the center of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. \u00c7ankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the \u00c7ankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gen\u00e7lik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nAncyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north\u2013south and east\u2013west intersected, giving it major strategic importance for Rome's eastern frontier.<ref name=\"TIB\"/> The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of Palmyrean empress [[Zenobia]] in the [[Syrian Desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.\n\nThe town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284\u2013305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eski\u015fehir]]).\n\nIn its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town.\n\n===Byzantine history===\nThe city is well known during the 4th century as a centre of Christian activity (see also [[#Ecclesiastical history|below]]), due to frequent imperial visits, and through the letters of the pagan scholar [[Libanius]].<ref name=\"TIB\"/> Bishop [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] and [[Basil of Ancyra]] were active in the theological controversies of their day, and the city was the site of no less than three church synods in [[Synod of Ancyra|314]], 358 and 375, the latter two in favour of [[Arianism]].<ref name=\"TIB\"/> The city was visited by Emperor [[Constans I]] (r. 337\u2013350) in 347 and 350, [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (r. 361\u2013363) during his Persian campaign in 362, and Julian's successor [[Jovian (emperor)|Jovian]] (r. 363\u2013364) in winter 363/364 (he entered his [[Roman consul|consulship]] while in the city).

Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''[[Ahis|Ahiler]]'' chose Angora as their independent city-state in 1290. [[Orhan I]], the second [[Bey]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], captured the city in 1356.

In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Angora in 1920. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was won and the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Angora had officially replaced Constantinople as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Ankara</ref>, and Republican officials declared that the city's name is Ankara.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/mar28/istanbul-not-constantinople/ |title=Istanbul, not Constantinople |last=Society |date=2014-03-04 |website=National Geographic Society |language=en |access-date=2019-03-28 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called ''Ulus'', and a new section, called ''Yeni\u015fehir''.

The new section, now centered on [[K\u0131z\u0131lay Meydan\u0131|K\u0131z\u0131lay Square]], has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital in 1923, when it was \"a small town of no importance\".<ref>Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer</ref> In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781. Ankara continued to grow rapidly during the latter half of the 20th century and eventually outranked [[Izmir]] as Turkey's second largest city, after [[Istanbul]].

In the 280s we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.\n\n[[File:Teodot Ankirski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|St. Theodotus of Ancyra]]]]\nAs in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ancyra|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off I\u015f\u0131klar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint.\n\nHowever, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of [[Synod of Ancyra|an important council]] of the [[Early Christianity|early church]];{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession (religion)|Sacrament of Penance]]. {{sfn|Rockwell|1911}} The synod also considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of ''[[Lapsi (Christianity)|lapsi]]''\u2014Christians who had given in to forced [[paganism]] (sacrifices) to avoid [[martyrdom]] during these persecutions.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911}}\n[[File:AnkaraColumnFar c.JPG|thumb|The ''Column of Julian'' (362) was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra.|281x281px]]\n\nThough paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.{{sfn|Parvis|2006|pp=325\u2013345}}\n\nIn 362\u2013363, the Emperor Julian passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men.<ref name=gibbon>{{cite book|last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]|authorlink=Edward Gibbon|page=Chapter 23}}</ref> The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as \"Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations\", can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]].\n\nIn the late 4th century, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408\u2013450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there.\n\nThe [[Metropolis of Ancyra]] continued to be a residential [[episcopal see|see]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] until the 20th century, with about 40,000 faithful, mostly Turkish-speaking, but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]. The earlier [[Armenian Genocide]] put an end to the residential eparchy of Ancyra of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], which had been established in 1850.<ref name=\"Bull Universi Dominici gregis\">[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51627x/f401.image Bull ''Universi Dominici gregis''], in Giovanni Domenico Mansi, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio'', vol.

The titular see has had a single occupant:\n* Mikail Ners\u00e8s S\u00e9tian (3 July 1981 \u2013 death 9 September 2002), as Apostolic Exarch of United States of America and Canada of the Armenians (USA) (3 July 1981 \u2013 retired 18 September 1993) and as emeritate.\n\n==== Latin titular archbishopric ====\nNo later than 1696, the Catholic Church also established a [[Latin Rite]] [[Ancyra (Catholic titular see)|titular archbishopric of Ancyra]]. The last incumbent died in 1976.\n\n==== Saint Clement Church ====\n\nThe [[Clement of Ancyra|Saint Clement]] Church is the only structure survived from the [[Byzantine]] era in Ankara. \nThe church is believed to have been built between the 4th and 9th centuries.\nAt the time of the Ottoman Sultan [[Murad II]], a mosque and [[madrasah]] were built on top of the church.

The [[Ankara Province|province of Ankara]] is divided into 25 districts. The CHP's key and almost only political stronghold in Ankara lies within the central area of [[\u00c7ankaya, Ankara (district)|\u00c7ankaya]], which is the city's most populous district. While the CHP has always gained between 60 and 70% of the vote in \u00c7ankaya since 2002, political support elsewhere throughout Ankara is minimal. The high population within \u00c7ankaya, as well as [[Yenimahalle]] to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district.

''Bak\u0131rc\u0131lar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131'' (Bazaar of Coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Up the hill to the castle gate, there are many shops selling a huge and fresh collection of spices, [[dried fruit]]s, nuts, and other produce.\n\nModern shopping areas are mostly found in [[K\u0131z\u0131lay, Ankara|K\u0131z\u0131lay]], or on Tunal\u0131 Hilmi Avenue, including the modern mall of [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum]] (named after the ancient [[Assyria]]n merchant colonies called [[K\u00fcltepe#K\u00e2rum Kane\u0161|''K\u00e2rum'']] that were established in [[Central Anatolia Region|central]] [[Anatolia]] at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium BC]]) which is located towards the end of the Avenue; and in [[\u00c7ankaya, Ankara|\u00c7ankaya]], the quarter with the highest elevation in the city.

The symbol of the [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Armada Shopping Mall]] is an [[anchor]], and there's a large anchor monument at its entrance, as a reference to the ancient Greek name of the city, \u1f0c\u03b3\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1 (\u00c1nkyra), which means anchor. Likewise, the anchor monument is also related with the Spanish name of the mall, Armada, which means [[naval fleet]].\n\nAs Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities began to rise along the western highway, also known as the [[Eski\u015fehir]] Road. The ''Armada'', ''CEPA'' and ''Kentpark'' malls on the highway, the ''Galleria'', ''Arcadium'' and ''Gordion'' in \u00dcmitk\u00f6y, and a huge mall, ''Real'' in Bilkent Center, offer North American and European style shopping opportunities (these places can be reached through the Eski\u015fehir Highway.) There is also the newly expanded ''[[ANKAmall]]'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region. In 2014 a few more shopping malls were open in Ankara. They are ''Next Level'' and ''Taurus'' on the Boulevard of [[Mevlana]] (also known as [[Konya]] Road).\n\n==Culture==\n\n=== The arts ===\n[[File:TurkishStateTheatresHeadOfficeInAnkara.JPG|thumb|The historic Evkaf Apartment (1929) is the headquarters of the [[Turkish State Theatres]].

Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.\n\nThey mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)\n\nEyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The [[Cat coat genetics#White spotting and epistatic white|W gene]] which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.\n\nEars are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.\n\n===Angora rabbit===\n{{Main|Angora rabbit}}\n[[File:Joey Giant Angora Buck.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Angora rabbit]]]]\n\nThe [[Angora rabbit]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara tav\u015fan\u0131}}) is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]] and [[Angora goat]]. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long [[Angora wool]], which may be removed by [[sheep shearing|shear]]ing, combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|pluck]]ing (gently pulling loose wool.)\n\nAngoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called \"wool block\" is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |title=Angora Rabbit Breeds \u2013 How to Care for Your Angora Rabbit |accessdate=29 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125215910/http://joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |archivedate=25 January 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.\n\n===Angora goat===\n{{Main|Angora goat}}\n[[File:Quebec angora goat.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Angora goat]]]]\n\nThe [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara ke\u00e7isi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.<ref name=\"Ekarius\">{{cite book|author=Carol Ekarius|title=Storey's Illustrated Breed Guide to Sheep, Goats, Cattle, and Pigs: 163 Breeds from Common to Rare|date=10 September 2008|publisher=Storey Publishing|isbn=978-1-60342-037-2|page=150}}</ref>\n\nThis breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |accessdate=29 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703174935/http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |archivedate=3 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abd\u00fclmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.\n\nThe [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between {{convert|5|and|8|kg|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The United States, [[Turkey]], and South Africa are the top producers of mohair.\n\nFor a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.\n\nAngora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938\u20131952.<ref>[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]    {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=3 June 2009 }}.
