It is sometimes referred to as '''queer culture''' (indicating people who are [[queer]]), while the term '''gay culture''' may be used to mean \"LGBT culture\" or to refer specifically to homosexual culture.\n\nLGBT culture varies widely by geography and the identity of the participants. Elements common to cultures of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and [[intersex]] people include:\n* Works by [[List of famous gay, lesbian, or bisexual people|famous gay, lesbian, bisexual]], and [[List of transgender people|transgender]] people, including:\n**Contemporary LGBT artists and political figures\n**Historical figures identified as LGBT, although identifying historical figures with modern terms for sexual identity is controversial (see [[History of sexuality]]).

Such LGBT communities organize special events in addition to pride parades celebrating their culture such as the [[Gay Games]] and [[Southern Decadence]].\n\n== Gay male culture ==\n{{main category|Male homosexuality}}\nAccording to Herdt, \"[[homosexuality]]\" was the main term used until the late 1950s and early 1960s; after that, a new \"gay\" culture emerged. \"This new gay culture increasingly marks a full spectrum of social life: not only same-sex desires but gay selves, gay neighbors, and gay social practices that are distinctive of our affluent, postindustrial society\".<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Gilbert|editor-last=Herdt|title=Gay Culture in America: Essays from the Field|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=1992|isbn=978-0807079157|url=https://archive.org/details/gaycultureinamer00bost}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, gay culture was largely underground or coded, relying on in-group symbols and codes woven into ostensibly [[heterosexuality|straight]] appearances. Gay influence in early America was more often visible in [[high culture]], where it was nominally safer to be out. The association of gay men with [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[haute couture|couture]], fine [[cuisine]], [[musical theater]], the Golden Age of [[Hollywood]] and [[interior design]] began with wealthy homosexual men using the straight themes of these media to send their own signals. In the [[heteroce'''''Italic text'''''ntric]] [[Marilyn Monroe]] film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', a musical number features [[Jane Russell]] singing \"Anyone Here for Love\" in a gym while muscled men dance around her. The men's costumes were designed by a man, the dance was choreographed by a man and the dancers (as gay screenwriter [[Paul Rudnick]] points out) \"seem more interested in each other than in Russell\"; however, her presence gets the sequence past the [[censors]] and works it into an overall [[heterocentric]] theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202085421/http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |archivedate=2010-02-02 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1969 [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall uprising]] in [[LGBT culture in New York City|New York City]] was covered on the mainstream news channels, showing images of gay men rioting in the streets, gay male culture among the working classes, people of color, street people, radical political activists and hippies became more visible to mainstream America. Groups such as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] formed in New York City, and the [[Mattachine Society]], which had been in existence and doing media since 1950, gained more visibility as they addressed the crowds and media in the wake of the uprisings in [[Greenwich Village]]. On June 28, 1970 the first [[Christopher Street Liberation Day]] was held, marking the beginning of annual [[Gay Pride]] marches. \n\nIn 1980 a group of seven gay men formed [[The Violet Quill]] in New York City, a literary club focused on writing about the gay experience as a normal plotline instead of a \"naughty\" sideline in a mostly straight story. An example is the novel ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]'' by [[Edmund White]]. In this first volume of a trilogy, White writes as a young [[homophilic]] narrator growing up with a corrupt and remote father. The young man learns bad habits from his straight father, applying them to his gay existence.\n\nFemale celebrities such as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Bette Midler]] spent a significant amount of their social time with urban gay men (who were now popularly viewed as sophisticated and stylish by the [[jet set]]), and more male celebrities (such as [[Andy Warhol]]) were open about their relationships. Such openness was still limited to the largest and most progressive urban areas (such as New York City, [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Seattle]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New Orleans]]), however, until AIDS forced several popular celebrities out of the closet due to their illness with what was known at first as the \"gay cancer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebody.com//www.thebodypro.com/article/timeline-25-milestones-time-aids|title=Timeline: 25 Milestones in Our Time With AIDS &#124; TheBody|website=www.thebody.com}}</ref>\n\nElements identified more closely with gay men than with other groups include:\n*Pop-culture [[gay icon]]s who have had a traditionally gay-male following (for example, [[disco]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Cher]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kesha]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Diana Ross]])\n*Familiarity with aspects of romantic, sexual and social life common among gay men (for example, [[Polari]], [[poppers]], [[camp (style)|camp]], [[fag hag]]s and\u2014in [[South Asia]]n [[LGBTQ+]] culture\u2014\"evening people\")<ref>Ratti, Rakesh (Ed.)

There are also subcultures with an historically large gay-male population, such as [[leather subculture|leather]] and [[sadomasochism|SM]]. Gay critic Michael Musto opined, \"I am a harsh critic of the gay community because I feel that when I first came out I thought I would be entering a world of nonconformity and individuality and, ''au contraire'', it turned out to be a world of clones in a certain way.

His characters have recently been updated and moved to the Web. Although primarily humorous, the comic sometimes addressed issues such as [[gay-bashing]], [[HIV]], and [[spousal abuse]].\n\nAn Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 discovered how some gay men felt like they were expected to be hyper-sexual. Participants reported how other gay men would automatically assume that any interaction had sexual motivations. Furthermore, if it was then clarified that this is not the case then these gay men would suddenly feel excluded and ignored by the other gay men with which they had been interacting with. They felt that they could not obtain purely platonic friendships with other gay men. One participant reported feeling alienated and disregarded as a person if they were not deemed by other gay men as sexually attractive. This presumption and attitude of hypersexuality is damaging, for it enforces preconceived ideals upon people, who are then ostracised if they do not meet these ideals.<ref>{{cite journal|title=James Roffee & Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | issue=4 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190\u2013201 | year=2016 | last1 = Roffee | first1 = James A.}}</ref>\n\n=== Online culture and communities ===\nA number of online social websites for gay men have been established. Initially, these concentrated on sexual contact or titillation; typically, users were afforded a profile page, access to other members' pages, member-to-member messaging and instant-message chat. Smaller, more densely connected websites concentrating on social networking without a focus on sexual contact have been established.

Members held public demonstrations, spoke to the media, and published a newsletter. \n\nPrimarily associated with lesbians in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, lesbian culture has often involved large, predominantly lesbian \"women's\" events such as the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]]<ref>Lo, Malinda [http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/2005/4/michigan.html Behind the Scenes at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813004815/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/2005/4/michigan.html |date=2008-08-13 }} April 20, 2005 [[AfterEllen]]</ref> (closed after 2015) and the [[Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend]].<ref>[http://palmsprings.gaycities.com/events/17945-dinah-shore-weekend-2011-the-official-club-skirts-event#org_desc] Ficera, Kim [http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/column/2006/2/quote-dinah.html Don't Quote Me: Dinah Shore Weekend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326191505/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/column/2006/2/quote-dinah.html|date=2008-03-26}} February 22, 2006 [[AfterEllen]]</ref><ref>Downs, Maggie [http://www.mydesert.com/article/20100328/EVENTS23/3280342/Dinah%20Shore%20events%20began%20with%20a%20round%20of%20golf Dinah Shore events part of celebration that began with a round of golf] March 28, 2010 The Desert Sun</ref> Lesbian culture has its own icons, such as [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[k.d. lang]] ([[Butch and femme|butch]]), [[Ellen DeGeneres]] ([[androgynous]]) and [[Portia de Rossi]] (femme).

Identity-based sports teams have also been associated with lesbian culture, particularly with the rise of lesbian softball teams and leagues in the 1980s and 1990s.

Many of the transgender youth that are placed in homeless shelters do not get the type of help they need and often experience discrimination and systemic barriers that include sex-segregated programs in institutional practices that refuse to understand their gender. Many transgender youths have problems acquiring shelters because of certain policies like binary gender rules, dress codes, and room assignments (Thaler et al., 2009). Problems with classification happen when the procedures or policies of a shelter require the youth to be segregated based on their assigned sex rather than what they classify themselves as. As a result, many of the LGBT youth end up on the street instead of shelters which are meant to protect them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shelton|first=Jama|date=December 2015|title=Transgender youth homelessness: Understanding programmatic barriers through the lens of cisgenderism|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=59|pages=10\u201318|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.10.006}}</ref>\n\nLGBT youth also have a higher suicide rate in the U.S. Those who identify with the LGBT community are four times as likely to attempt suicide than those who do not.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Dustin T.|last2=Hatzenbuehler|first2=Mark L.|date=February 2014|title=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Hate Crimes and Suicidality Among a Population-Based Sample of Sexual-Minority Adolescents in Boston|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=104|issue=2|pages=272\u2013278|doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301424|pmid=24328619|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3935714}}</ref> There was a study that was done to look into the difference of rates between gay high school students and their straight peers.

The two largest are [[Atlanta Black Pride]] and [[D.C. Black Pride]]. \n\n'''Movements and politics''' {{Main|LGBT social movements|LGBT conservatism}}\nLGBT social movements are [[social movements]] that advocate for LGBT people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. \n\n[[LGBT conservatism]] is a socio-political movement which embraces and promotes the ideology of [[conservatism]] within an [[LGBT]] context. \n\n=={{anchor|Criticism and dissent}}Criticism==\nCriticism of LGBTQ+ culture comes from a variety of sources. Some, like [[Michael Musto]], view the culture as conforming to caricatures or stereotypes that alienate \"fringe\" members of the community. [[Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore]] and movements like [[Gay Shame]] have argued that LGBT culture has been depoliticized by a tiny minority of relatively privileged queer people, who participate in \"institutions of oppression\" at the expense of the vast majority of LGBT people.<ref name=\"bernstein-sycamore\">{{Cite web|url=https://truthout.org/articles/transgender-troops-should-be-an-oxymoron/|title=\"Transgender Troops\" Should Be an Oxymoron|first=Mattilda Bernstein|last=Sycamore|website=Truthout}}</ref> Some consider the very notion of \"separatism\", or a group lifestyle, alienating (including of LGBTQ+ members in the broader society).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAnother problem is that [[bisexual]] and [[transsexual]]/[[transgender]] individuals experience social pressure to identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]], and may face ostracism and discrimination from the mainstream LGBTQ+ culture. For bisexuals, this pressure is known as [[bisexual erasure]]. [[New York University School of Law]] professor [[Kenji Yoshino]] has written, \"Gays de-legitimatize bisexuals...the lesbian and gay community abounds with negative images of bisexuals as fence-sitters, traitors, cop-outs, closet cases, people whose primary goal in life is to retain 'heterosexual privilege'\".<ref>Yoshino, Kenji (2000).

In particular, labels that LGBTQ+ members use to describe themselves vary widely; some simply prefer to identify as loving a particular gender. Some believe that the LGBTQ+-community concept is alienating; the term itself implies estrangement from straight people as a separate group. Further, including three groups involved with ''sexuality'' and one group exploring transsexual/transgender ''identity'' (a broader phenomenon) is artificial.<ref>Prosser, J (1998) Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality. New York: Columbia University Press p. 59</ref>\n\nMattilda Berstein Sycamore argues that the single-issue focus of LGBT politics, which ignores all [[intersectionality|intra-group differences]], has naturally led to a movement and culture focused on the needs of white, middle-class gay cisgender men, which alienates anyone who does not fit that description.<ref name=\"bernstein-sycamore\"/>\n\n=== Cultural focus on promiscuity ===\n{{See also|slut shaming|homonormativity|respectability politics}}\nSome gay male commentators who are in [[monogamy|monogamous relationships]] argue that mainstream gay culture's disdain of monogamy and its promotion of [[promiscuity]] has harmed efforts to legalize [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaypatriot.net/2008/06/20/gay-groups-ignore-monogamy-when-discussing-marriage/|title=Gay Groups Ignore Monogamy when Promoting Marriage|date=June 20, 2008}}</ref> Yuvraj Joshi argues that efforts to legalize same-sex marriage have emphasized the sameness of gay people to heterosexuals, while privatizing their queer differences.<ref>{{cite journal\n |url         = http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/hrlr_journal/43.2/Joshi.pdf\n |title       = Respectable Queerness\n |first       = Yuvraj\n |last        = Joshi\n |date        = May 2012\n |publisher   = Columbia Human Rights Law Review\n |volume      = 43\n |issue       = 2\n |pages       = 415\u2013467\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523070719/http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/hrlr_journal/43.2/Joshi.pdf\n |archivedate = 2012-05-23\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Racism ===\n{{Main|Racism in the LGBT community}}\n\nBritish journalist [[Mark Simpson (journalist)|Mark Simpson's]] 1996 book, ''Anti-Gay'', describes forms of intolerance by the mainstream gay community towards subgroups.

It is sometimes referred to as '''queer culture''' (indicating people who are [[queer]]), while the term '''gay culture''' may be used to mean \"LGBT culture\" or to refer specifically to homosexual culture.\n\nLGBT culture varies widely by geography and the identity of the participants. Elements common to cultures of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and [[intersex]] people include:\n* Works by [[List of famous gay, lesbian, or bisexual people|famous gay, lesbian, bisexual]], and [[List of transgender people|transgender]] people, including:\n**Contemporary LGBT artists and political figures\n**Historical figures identified as LGBT, although identifying historical figures with modern terms for sexual identity is controversial (see [[History of sexuality]]).

Such LGBT communities organize special events in addition to pride parades celebrating their culture such as the [[Gay Games]] and [[Southern Decadence]].\n\n== Gay male culture ==\n{{main category|Male homosexuality}}\nAccording to Herdt, \"[[homosexuality]]\" was the main term used until the late 1950s and early 1960s; after that, a new \"gay\" culture emerged. \"This new gay culture increasingly marks a full spectrum of social life: not only same-sex desires but gay selves, gay neighbors, and gay social practices that are distinctive of our affluent, postindustrial society\".<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Gilbert|editor-last=Herdt|title=Gay Culture in America: Essays from the Field|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=1992|isbn=978-0807079157|url=https://archive.org/details/gaycultureinamer00bost}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, gay culture was largely underground or coded, relying on in-group symbols and codes woven into ostensibly [[heterosexuality|straight]] appearances. Gay influence in early America was more often visible in [[high culture]], where it was nominally safer to be out. The association of gay men with [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[haute couture|couture]], fine [[cuisine]], [[musical theater]], the Golden Age of [[Hollywood]] and [[interior design]] began with wealthy homosexual men using the straight themes of these media to send their own signals. In the [[heteroce'''''Italic text'''''ntric]] [[Marilyn Monroe]] film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', a musical number features [[Jane Russell]] singing \"Anyone Here for Love\" in a gym while muscled men dance around her. The men's costumes were designed by a man, the dance was choreographed by a man and the dancers (as gay screenwriter [[Paul Rudnick]] points out) \"seem more interested in each other than in Russell\"; however, her presence gets the sequence past the [[censors]] and works it into an overall [[heterocentric]] theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202085421/http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |archivedate=2010-02-02 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1969 [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall uprising]] in [[LGBT culture in New York City|New York City]] was covered on the mainstream news channels, showing images of gay men rioting in the streets, gay male culture among the working classes, people of color, street people, radical political activists and hippies became more visible to mainstream America. Groups such as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] formed in New York City, and the [[Mattachine Society]], which had been in existence and doing media since 1950, gained more visibility as they addressed the crowds and media in the wake of the uprisings in [[Greenwich Village]]. On June 28, 1970 the first [[Christopher Street Liberation Day]] was held, marking the beginning of annual [[Gay Pride]] marches. \n\nIn 1980 a group of seven gay men formed [[The Violet Quill]] in New York City, a literary club focused on writing about the gay experience as a normal plotline instead of a \"naughty\" sideline in a mostly straight story. An example is the novel ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]'' by [[Edmund White]]. In this first volume of a trilogy, White writes as a young [[homophilic]] narrator growing up with a corrupt and remote father. The young man learns bad habits from his straight father, applying them to his gay existence.\n\nFemale celebrities such as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Bette Midler]] spent a significant amount of their social time with urban gay men (who were now popularly viewed as sophisticated and stylish by the [[jet set]]), and more male celebrities (such as [[Andy Warhol]]) were open about their relationships. Such openness was still limited to the largest and most progressive urban areas (such as New York City, [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Seattle]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New Orleans]]), however, until AIDS forced several popular celebrities out of the closet due to their illness with what was known at first as the \"gay cancer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebody.com//www.thebodypro.com/article/timeline-25-milestones-time-aids|title=Timeline: 25 Milestones in Our Time With AIDS &#124; TheBody|website=www.thebody.com}}</ref>\n\nElements identified more closely with gay men than with other groups include:\n*Pop-culture [[gay icon]]s who have had a traditionally gay-male following (for example, [[disco]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Cher]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kesha]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Diana Ross]])\n*Familiarity with aspects of romantic, sexual and social life common among gay men (for example, [[Polari]], [[poppers]], [[camp (style)|camp]], [[fag hag]]s and\u2014in [[South Asia]]n [[LGBTQ+]] culture\u2014\"evening people\")<ref>Ratti, Rakesh (Ed.)

There are also subcultures with an historically large gay-male population, such as [[leather subculture|leather]] and [[sadomasochism|SM]]. Gay critic Michael Musto opined, \"I am a harsh critic of the gay community because I feel that when I first came out I thought I would be entering a world of nonconformity and individuality and, ''au contraire'', it turned out to be a world of clones in a certain way.

His characters have recently been updated and moved to the Web. Although primarily humorous, the comic sometimes addressed issues such as [[gay-bashing]], [[HIV]], and [[spousal abuse]].\n\nAn Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 discovered how some gay men felt like they were expected to be hyper-sexual. Participants reported how other gay men would automatically assume that any interaction had sexual motivations. Furthermore, if it was then clarified that this is not the case then these gay men would suddenly feel excluded and ignored by the other gay men with which they had been interacting with. They felt that they could not obtain purely platonic friendships with other gay men. One participant reported feeling alienated and disregarded as a person if they were not deemed by other gay men as sexually attractive. This presumption and attitude of hypersexuality is damaging, for it enforces preconceived ideals upon people, who are then ostracised if they do not meet these ideals.<ref>{{cite journal|title=James Roffee & Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | issue=4 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190\u2013201 | year=2016 | last1 = Roffee | first1 = James A.}}</ref>\n\n=== Online culture and communities ===\nA number of online social websites for gay men have been established.

Participants' reported online sociorelational benefits largely contradict recent research indicating that online use may lead to negative mental health outcomes.<ref>Etengoff, C. & Daiute, C. (2015).

Members held public demonstrations, spoke to the media, and published a newsletter. \n\nPrimarily associated with lesbians in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, lesbian culture has often involved large, predominantly lesbian \"women's\" events such as the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]]<ref>Lo, Malinda [http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/2005/4/michigan.html Behind the Scenes at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813004815/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/2005/4/michigan.html |date=2008-08-13 }} April 20, 2005 [[AfterEllen]]</ref> (closed after 2015) and the [[Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend]].<ref>[http://palmsprings.gaycities.com/events/17945-dinah-shore-weekend-2011-the-official-club-skirts-event#org_desc] Ficera, Kim [http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/column/2006/2/quote-dinah.html Don't Quote Me: Dinah Shore Weekend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326191505/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/column/2006/2/quote-dinah.html|date=2008-03-26}} February 22, 2006 [[AfterEllen]]</ref><ref>Downs, Maggie [http://www.mydesert.com/article/20100328/EVENTS23/3280342/Dinah%20Shore%20events%20began%20with%20a%20round%20of%20golf Dinah Shore events part of celebration that began with a round of golf] March 28, 2010 The Desert Sun</ref> Lesbian culture has its own icons, such as [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[k.d. lang]] ([[Butch and femme|butch]]), [[Ellen DeGeneres]] ([[androgynous]]) and [[Portia de Rossi]] (femme).

Identity-based sports teams have also been associated with lesbian culture, particularly with the rise of lesbian softball teams and leagues in the 1980s and 1990s.

For example, in many cultures people who are attracted to people of the same sex\u2014that is, those who in contemporary Western culture would identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual\u2014are classed as a [[third gender]] with people who would (in the West) be classified as transgender.\n\nIn the contemporary West there are different groups of transgender and transsexual people, such as groups for transsexual people who want [[sex reassignment surgery]], male, heterosexual-only [[Cross-dressing|cross-dressers]] and [[Trans man|Trans men's]] groups. Groups encompassing all transgender people, both trans men, [[Trans woman|trans women]], and non-binary people, have appeared in recent years.\n\nSome transgender or transsexual women and men, however, do not identify as part of a specific \"trans\" culture. A distinction may be made between transgender and transsexual people who make their past known to others and those who wish to live according to their gender identity and not reveal their past (believing that they should be able to live normally in their true gender role, and control to whom they reveal their past).<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Anneliese A.

The two largest are [[Atlanta Black Pride]] and [[D.C.

Some, like [[Michael Musto]], view the culture as conforming to caricatures or stereotypes that alienate \"fringe\" members of the community. [[Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore]] and movements like [[Gay Shame]] have argued that LGBT culture has been depoliticized by a tiny minority of relatively privileged queer people, who participate in \"institutions of oppression\" at the expense of the vast majority of LGBT people.<ref name=\"bernstein-sycamore\">{{Cite web|url=https://truthout.org/articles/transgender-troops-should-be-an-oxymoron/|title=\"Transgender Troops\" Should Be an Oxymoron|first=Mattilda Bernstein|last=Sycamore|website=Truthout}}</ref> Some consider the very notion of \"separatism\", or a group lifestyle, alienating (including of LGBTQ+ members in the broader society).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAnother problem is that [[bisexual]] and [[transsexual]]/[[transgender]] individuals experience social pressure to identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]], and may face ostracism and discrimination from the mainstream LGBTQ+ culture.

[[New York University School of Law]] professor [[Kenji Yoshino]] has written, \"Gays de-legitimatize bisexuals...the lesbian and gay community abounds with negative images of bisexuals as fence-sitters, traitors, cop-outs, closet cases, people whose primary goal in life is to retain 'heterosexual privilege'\".<ref>Yoshino, Kenji (2000).

In particular, labels that LGBTQ+ members use to describe themselves vary widely; some simply prefer to identify as loving a particular gender.

Further, including three groups involved with ''sexuality'' and one group exploring transsexual/transgender ''identity'' (a broader phenomenon) is artificial.<ref>Prosser, J (1998) Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality.

Hobbes served as a tutor and secretary to both men. The 1st Earl's younger brother, Charles Cavendish, had two sons who were patrons of Hobbes. The elder son, [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|William Cavendish]], later 1st Duke of Newcastle, was a leading supporter of Charles I during the [[English civil war|civil war]] personally financing an army for the king, having been governor to the [[Prince of Wales]], Charles James, Duke of Cornwall. It was to this William Cavendish that Hobbes dedicated his ''Elements of Law''.<ref name=Sommerville/> \n\nHobbes became a companion to the younger William and they both took part in a [[Grand Tour|grand tour]] of Europe between 1610 and 1615. Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour, in contrast to the [[scholastic philosophy]] that he had learned in Oxford. In Venice, Hobbes made the acquaintance of [[Fulgenzio Micanzio]], an associate of [[Paolo Sarpi]], a Venetian scholar and statesman.<ref name=Sommerville/> His scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classic Greek and Latin authors, the outcome of which was, in 1628, his great translation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', the first translation of that work into English from a Greek manuscript. It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as ''Horea Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses'' also represent the work of Hobbes from this period.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=Three Discourses: A Critical Modern Edition of Newly Identified Work of the Young Hobbes |editor-last=Reynolds |editor-first=Noel B. |editor-link=Noel B.

Thereafter, he again found work with the Cavendish family, tutoring [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]], the eldest son of his previous pupil. Over the next seven years, as well as tutoring, he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy, awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates. He visited [[Galileo Galilei]] in [[Florence]] while he was under house arrest upon [[Galileo affair|condemnation]], in 1636, and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by [[Marin Mersenne]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nHobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum. Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in [[physics]]. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants. Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally, he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if people were not to fall back into \"brutishness and misery\". Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man, and the State.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===In England===\nHobbes came home, in 1637, to a country riven with discontent, which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan. However, by the end of the [[Short Parliament]] in 1640, he had written a short treatise called ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic''. It was not published and only circulated as a manuscript among his acquaintances. A pirated version, however, was published about ten years later. Although it seems that much of ''The Elements of Law'' was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament, there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis. Nevertheless, many (though not all) elements of Hobbes's political thought were unchanged between ''The Elements of Law'' and ''Leviathan,'' which demonstrates that the events of the [[English Civil War]] had little effect on his [[contractarian]] methodology. However, the arguments in ''Leviathan'' were modified from ''The Elements of Law'' when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation. Namely, Hobbes wrote in ''The Elements of Law'' that Patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the [[consent of the governed]], while in ''Leviathan'' he argued that they were. This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbes's thoughts about the [[engagement controversy]] or of his reaction to treatises published by [[Patriarchalism|Patriarchalists]], such as [[Sir Robert Filmer]], between 1640 and 1651.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nWhen in November 1640 the [[Long Parliament]] succeeded the Short, Hobbes felt that he was in disfavour due to the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris. He did not return for 11 years. In Paris, he rejoined the coterie around Mersenne and wrote a critique of the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' of [[Descartes]], which was printed as third among the sets of \"Objections\" appended, with \"Replies\" from Descartes, in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two.\n\nHobbes also extended his own works in a way, working on the third section, ''[[De Cive]]'', which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received, and included lines of argumentation that were repeated a decade later in ''Leviathan''. He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except a short treatise on optics (''Tractatus opticus'') included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as ''Cogitata physico-mathematica'' in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, [[Gilles de Roberval]] and others to referee the controversy between [[John Pell]] and [[Longomontanus]] over the problem of [[squaring the circle]].\n\n===Civil War Period (1642\u20131651)===\nThe [[English Civil War]] began in 1642,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/english-civil-wars |title=English Civil Wars |access-date=9 August 2018 |website=[[History.com]] |publisher=[[A&E Television Networks, LLC.]]}}</ref> and when the [[Cavalier|royalist]] cause began to decline in mid-1644,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml |title=British History in depth: Oliver Cromwell |author=Professor Morrill |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=9 August 2018 |website=[[BBC History]] |publisher=BBC}}</ref> some of the king's supporters fled to Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/choosingsides_01.shtml |title=Choosing Sides in the English Civil War |first=Dr Mike |last=Stoyle |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=9 August 2018 |website=[[BBC History]] |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Many came to Paris and were known to Hobbes.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} This revitalised Hobbes's political interests and the ''De Cive'' was republished and more widely distributed.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The printing began in 1646 by [[Samuel de Sorbiere]] through the [[House of Elzevir|Elsevier press]] in [[Amsterdam]] with a new preface and some new notes in reply to objections.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1647, Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], who had come to Paris from [[Jersey]] around July.

Hobbes compared the State to a monster ([[leviathan]]) composed of men, created under pressure of human needs and dissolved by civil strife due to human passions. The work closed with a general \"Review and Conclusion\", in response to the war, which answered the question: Does a subject have the right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect is irrevocably lost?{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nDuring the years of composing ''Leviathan'', Hobbes remained in or near Paris.

''De Homine'' consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision. The remainder of the treatise dealt cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the ''Human Nature'' and the ''Leviathan''. In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics and physics, Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works. From the time of the [[The Restoration|Restoration]], he acquired a new prominence; \"Hobbism\" became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce. The young king, Hobbes' former pupil, now Charles II, remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of \u00a3100.\n\nThe king was important in protecting Hobbes when, in 1666, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness. That same year, on 17 October 1666, it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred \"should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy and profaneness... in particular... the book of Mr. Hobbes called the ''Leviathan''\".<ref>{{cite web|title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8|website=[[British History Online]] |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26780|accessdate=14 January 2005}}</ref> Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic, and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers. At the same time, he examined the actual state of the law of [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an ''Appendix'' to his ''Latin translation of Leviathan'', published in Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, Hobbes aimed to show that, since the [[Court of High Commission|High Court of Commission]] had been put down, there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the [[Nicene Creed]], which, he maintained, ''Leviathan'' did not do.\n\nThe only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct. The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censor's licence for its publication in England. Other writings were not made public until after his death, including ''Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662''. For some time, Hobbes was not even allowed to respond, whatever his enemies tried. Despite this, his reputation abroad was formidable.\n\nHis final works were an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672, and a translation of four books of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' into \"rugged\" English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''Odyssey'' in 1675.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Tomb of Thomas Hobbes - geograph.org.uk - 1592556.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Thomas Hobbes in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall]] in [[Derbyshire]]]]\n\nIn October 1679 Hobbes suffered a [[bladder disorder]], and then a [[paralytic stroke]], from which he died on 4 December 1679, aged 91.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bedside Book of Final Words |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=zgHCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT20 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |date=25 November 2014 |page=20 |isbn=9781445644646 |first=Eric |last=Grounds |first2=Bill |last2=Tidy |author2-link=Bill Tidy |first3=Richard |last3=Stilgoe |author3-link=Richard Stilgoe}}</ref> His last words were said to have been \"A great leap in the dark\", uttered in his final conscious moments.<ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p. 687</ref> His body was interred in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall]], in Derbyshire.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael L. |last=Coulter |first2=Richard S. |last2=Myers |first3=Joseph A. |last3=Varacalli |author3-link=Joseph A.

From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent. This particular view owes its significance to it being first developed in the 1630s when [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had sought to raise revenues without the consent of Parliament, and therefore of his subjects.<ref name=Sommerville/>\n\n===''Leviathan''===\n{{Main|Leviathan (Hobbes book)}}\n[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Leviathan'']]\n\nIn ''Leviathan'', Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of [[State (polity)|states]] and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.\n\nBeginning from a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the [[state of nature]]. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a \"war of all against all\" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). The description contains what has been called one of the best-known passages in English philosophy, which describes the natural state humankind would be in, were it not for political community:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gaskin|chapter=Introduction|title=Human Nature and De Corpore Politico|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=xxx|ref=harv}}</ref>\n{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII.: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html|ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nIn such a state, people fear death and lack both the things necessary to [[wikt:commodious|commodious]] living, and the hope of being able to obtain them. So, in order to avoid it, people accede to a [[social contract theory|social contract]] and establish a [[civil society]]. According to Hobbes, society is a population and a [[wikt:sovereign|sovereign]] [[authority]], to whom all individuals in that society cede some right<ref>Part I, ''Chapter XIV.

The same may be sayd of Wounds, and Chayns, and Imprisonment\".</ref> for the sake of protection. Power exercised by this authority cannot be resisted, because the protector's sovereign power derives from individuals' surrendering their own sovereign power for protection.

Hobbes duly replied, but not for publication. However, a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with \"an extravagantly laudatory epistle\".<ref name=\"wikisource1911\">{{cite web |last1=Robertson |first1=George Croome |title=Hobbes, Thoms |volume=13 |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop\u00e6dia_Britannica/Hobbes,_Thomas |website=Encyclopedia Britannica, 1911 |accessdate=27 December 2018}}</ref>  Bramhall countered in 1655, when he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of ''A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity''). In 1656, Hobbes was ready with ''The Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance'', in which he replied \"with astonishing force\"<ref name=\"wikisource1911\"/> to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes's own two pieces were important in the history of the [[Free will|free-will]] controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with ''Castigations of Mr Hobbes's Animadversions'', and also included a bulky appendix entitled ''The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale''.\n\n===John Wallis===\n{{details|Hobbes\u2013Wallis controversy}}\nHobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements, and assailed the system of the original universities in ''Leviathan''. He went on to publish ''[[De Corpore]]'', which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics but also an erroneous proof of the [[squaring of the circle]]. This all led mathematicians to target him for [[polemics]] and sparked [[John Wallis]] to become one of his most persistent opponents. From 1655, the publishing date of ''De Corpore'', Hobbes and Wallis went round after round trying to disprove each other's positions. After years of debate, the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that it has become one of the most infamous feuds in mathematical history.\n\n==Religious views==\n\nHobbes was accused of [[atheism]] by several contemporaries; Bramhall accused him of teachings that could lead to atheism. This was an important accusation, and Hobbes himself wrote, in his answer to Bramhall's ''The Catching of Leviathan'', that \"atheism, impiety, and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible\".<ref>p. 282 of Molesworth's edition.</ref> Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martinich|first=A. P.|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|location=Cambridge|publisher=Blackwell|date=1995|page=35}}</ref> In more recent times also, much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and [[J. G. A. Pocock]], but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbes's unusual views on religion.\n\nAs Martinich has pointed out, in Hobbes's time the term \"atheist\" was often applied to people who believed in God but not in [[divine providence]], or to people who believed in God but also maintained other beliefs that were inconsistent with such belief. He says that this \"sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the [[early modern period]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Martinich|first=A. P.|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|location=Cambridge|publisher=Blackwell|date=1995|page=31}}</ref>  In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did take positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example, he argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that \"though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity\".<ref>''Human Nature'' I.XI.5.</ref> (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following [[Tertullian]].) Like [[John Locke]], he also stated that true [[revelation]] can never disagree with human reason and experience,<ref>''Leviathan'' III.xxxii.2. \"...we are not to renounce our Senses, and Experience; nor (that which is undoubted Word of God) our naturall Reason\".</ref> although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign, in order to avoid war.\n\nWhile in Venice on tour, Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio, a close associate of Paolo Sarpi, who had written against the pretensions of the papacy to temporal power in response to the [[Venetian Interdict|Interdict]] of [[Pope Paul V]] against [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], which refused to recognise papal prerogatives. James I had invited both men to England in 1612. Micanzio and Sarpi had argued that God willed human nature, and that human nature indicated the autonomy of the state in temporal affairs. When he returned to England in 1615, William Cavendish maintained correspondence with Micanzio and Sarpi, and Hobbes translated the latter's letters from Italian, which were circulated among the Duke's circle.<ref name=Sommerville/>\n\n==Works (bibliography)==\n* 1602.

Hobbes served as a tutor and secretary to both men. The 1st Earl's younger brother, Charles Cavendish, had two sons who were patrons of Hobbes. The elder son, [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|William Cavendish]], later 1st Duke of Newcastle, was a leading supporter of Charles I during the [[English civil war|civil war]] personally financing an army for the king, having been governor to the [[Prince of Wales]], Charles James, Duke of Cornwall. It was to this William Cavendish that Hobbes dedicated his ''Elements of Law''.<ref name=Sommerville/> \n\nHobbes became a companion to the younger William and they both took part in a [[Grand Tour|grand tour]] of Europe between 1610 and 1615. Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour, in contrast to the [[scholastic philosophy]] that he had learned in Oxford. In Venice, Hobbes made the acquaintance of [[Fulgenzio Micanzio]], an associate of [[Paolo Sarpi]], a Venetian scholar and statesman.<ref name=Sommerville/> His scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classic Greek and Latin authors, the outcome of which was, in 1628, his great translation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', the first translation of that work into English from a Greek manuscript. It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as ''Horea Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses'' also represent the work of Hobbes from this period.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hobbes |first=Thomas |title=Three Discourses: A Critical Modern Edition of Newly Identified Work of the Young Hobbes |editor-last=Reynolds |editor-first=Noel B. |editor-link=Noel B.

Thereafter, he again found work with the Cavendish family, tutoring [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]], the eldest son of his previous pupil. Over the next seven years, as well as tutoring, he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy, awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates. He visited [[Galileo Galilei]] in [[Florence]] while he was under house arrest upon [[Galileo affair|condemnation]], in 1636, and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by [[Marin Mersenne]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nHobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum. Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in [[physics]]. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants. Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally, he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if people were not to fall back into \"brutishness and misery\". Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man, and the State.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===In England===\nHobbes came home, in 1637, to a country riven with discontent, which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan. However, by the end of the [[Short Parliament]] in 1640, he had written a short treatise called ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic''. It was not published and only circulated as a manuscript among his acquaintances. A pirated version, however, was published about ten years later. Although it seems that much of ''The Elements of Law'' was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament, there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis. Nevertheless, many (though not all) elements of Hobbes's political thought were unchanged between ''The Elements of Law'' and ''Leviathan,'' which demonstrates that the events of the [[English Civil War]] had little effect on his [[contractarian]] methodology. However, the arguments in ''Leviathan'' were modified from ''The Elements of Law'' when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation. Namely, Hobbes wrote in ''The Elements of Law'' that Patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the [[consent of the governed]], while in ''Leviathan'' he argued that they were. This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbes's thoughts about the [[engagement controversy]] or of his reaction to treatises published by [[Patriarchalism|Patriarchalists]], such as [[Sir Robert Filmer]], between 1640 and 1651.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nWhen in November 1640 the [[Long Parliament]] succeeded the Short, Hobbes felt that he was in disfavour due to the circulation of his treatise and fled to Paris. He did not return for 11 years. In Paris, he rejoined the coterie around Mersenne and wrote a critique of the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' of [[Descartes]], which was printed as third among the sets of \"Objections\" appended, with \"Replies\" from Descartes, in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two.\n\nHobbes also extended his own works in a way, working on the third section, ''[[De Cive]]'', which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received, and included lines of argumentation that were repeated a decade later in ''Leviathan''. He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except a short treatise on optics (''Tractatus opticus'') included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as ''Cogitata physico-mathematica'' in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, [[Gilles de Roberval]] and others to referee the controversy between [[John Pell]] and [[Longomontanus]] over the problem of [[squaring the circle]].\n\n===Civil War Period (1642\u20131651)===\nThe [[English Civil War]] began in 1642,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.com/topics/british-history/english-civil-wars |title=English Civil Wars |access-date=9 August 2018 |website=[[History.com]] |publisher=[[A&E Television Networks, LLC.]]}}</ref> and when the [[Cavalier|royalist]] cause began to decline in mid-1644,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/cromwell_01.shtml |title=British History in depth: Oliver Cromwell |author=Professor Morrill |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=9 August 2018 |website=[[BBC History]] |publisher=BBC}}</ref> some of the king's supporters fled to Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/civil_war_revolution/choosingsides_01.shtml |title=Choosing Sides in the English Civil War |first=Dr Mike |last=Stoyle |date=17 February 2011 |access-date=9 August 2018 |website=[[BBC History]] |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Many came to Paris and were known to Hobbes.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} This revitalised Hobbes's political interests and the ''De Cive'' was republished and more widely distributed.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The printing began in 1646 by [[Samuel de Sorbiere]] through the [[House of Elzevir|Elsevier press]] in [[Amsterdam]] with a new preface and some new notes in reply to objections.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1647, Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], who had come to Paris from [[Jersey]] around July.

Hobbes compared the State to a monster ([[leviathan]]) composed of men, created under pressure of human needs and dissolved by civil strife due to human passions.

''De Homine'' consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision. The remainder of the treatise dealt cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the ''Human Nature'' and the ''Leviathan''. In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics and physics, Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works. From the time of the [[The Restoration|Restoration]], he acquired a new prominence; \"Hobbism\" became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce. The young king, Hobbes' former pupil, now Charles II, remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of \u00a3100.\n\nThe king was important in protecting Hobbes when, in 1666, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness. That same year, on 17 October 1666, it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred \"should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy and profaneness... in particular... the book of Mr. Hobbes called the ''Leviathan''\".<ref>{{cite web|title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8|website=[[British History Online]] |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26780|accessdate=14 January 2005}}</ref> Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic, and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers. At the same time, he examined the actual state of the law of [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an ''Appendix'' to his ''Latin translation of Leviathan'', published in Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, Hobbes aimed to show that, since the [[Court of High Commission|High Court of Commission]] had been put down, there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the [[Nicene Creed]], which, he maintained, ''Leviathan'' did not do.\n\nThe only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct. The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censor's licence for its publication in England. Other writings were not made public until after his death, including ''Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662''. For some time, Hobbes was not even allowed to respond, whatever his enemies tried. Despite this, his reputation abroad was formidable.\n\nHis final works were an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672, and a translation of four books of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' into \"rugged\" English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''Odyssey'' in 1675.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Tomb of Thomas Hobbes - geograph.org.uk - 1592556.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Thomas Hobbes in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall]] in [[Derbyshire]]]]\n\nIn October 1679 Hobbes suffered a [[bladder disorder]], and then a [[paralytic stroke]], from which he died on 4 December 1679, aged 91.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bedside Book of Final Words |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=zgHCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT20 |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited |date=25 November 2014 |page=20 |isbn=9781445644646 |first=Eric |last=Grounds |first2=Bill |last2=Tidy |author2-link=Bill Tidy |first3=Richard |last3=Stilgoe |author3-link=Richard Stilgoe}}</ref> His last words were said to have been \"A great leap in the dark\", uttered in his final conscious moments.<ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p. 687</ref> His body was interred in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall]], in Derbyshire.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael L. |last=Coulter |first2=Richard S. |last2=Myers |first3=Joseph A. |last3=Varacalli |author3-link=Joseph A.

From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent. This particular view owes its significance to it being first developed in the 1630s when [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] had sought to raise revenues without the consent of Parliament, and therefore of his subjects.<ref name=Sommerville/>\n\n===''Leviathan''===\n{{Main|Leviathan (Hobbes book)}}\n[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Leviathan'']]\n\nIn ''Leviathan'', Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of [[State (polity)|states]] and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.\n\nBeginning from a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the [[state of nature]]. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a \"war of all against all\" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). The description contains what has been called one of the best-known passages in English philosophy, which describes the natural state humankind would be in, were it not for political community:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gaskin|chapter=Introduction|title=Human Nature and De Corpore Politico|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=xxx|ref=harv}}</ref>\n{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII.: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html|ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nIn such a state, people fear death and lack both the things necessary to [[wikt:commodious|commodious]] living, and the hope of being able to obtain them.

In 1656, Hobbes was ready with ''The Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance'', in which he replied \"with astonishing force\"<ref name=\"wikisource1911\"/> to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes's own two pieces were important in the history of the [[Free will|free-will]] controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with ''Castigations of Mr Hobbes's Animadversions'', and also included a bulky appendix entitled ''The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale''.\n\n===John Wallis===\n{{details|Hobbes\u2013Wallis controversy}}\nHobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements, and assailed the system of the original universities in ''Leviathan''. He went on to publish ''[[De Corpore]]'', which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics but also an erroneous proof of the [[squaring of the circle]]. This all led mathematicians to target him for [[polemics]] and sparked [[John Wallis]] to become one of his most persistent opponents. From 1655, the publishing date of ''De Corpore'', Hobbes and Wallis went round after round trying to disprove each other's positions. After years of debate, the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that it has become one of the most infamous feuds in mathematical history.\n\n==Religious views==\n\nHobbes was accused of [[atheism]] by several contemporaries; Bramhall accused him of teachings that could lead to atheism. This was an important accusation, and Hobbes himself wrote, in his answer to Bramhall's ''The Catching of Leviathan'', that \"atheism, impiety, and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible\".<ref>p. 282 of Molesworth's edition.</ref> Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martinich|first=A. P.|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|location=Cambridge|publisher=Blackwell|date=1995|page=35}}</ref> In more recent times also, much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and [[J. G. A. Pocock]], but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbes's unusual views on religion.\n\nAs Martinich has pointed out, in Hobbes's time the term \"atheist\" was often applied to people who believed in God but not in [[divine providence]], or to people who believed in God but also maintained other beliefs that were inconsistent with such belief. He says that this \"sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the [[early modern period]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Martinich|first=A. P.|title=A Hobbes Dictionary|location=Cambridge|publisher=Blackwell|date=1995|page=31}}</ref>  In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did take positions that strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example, he argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that \"though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity\".<ref>''Human Nature'' I.XI.5.</ref> (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following [[Tertullian]].) Like [[John Locke]], he also stated that true [[revelation]] can never disagree with human reason and experience,<ref>''Leviathan'' III.xxxii.2. \"...we are not to renounce our Senses, and Experience; nor (that which is undoubted Word of God) our naturall Reason\".</ref> although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign, in order to avoid war.\n\nWhile in Venice on tour, Hobbes made the acquaintance of Fulgenzio Micanzio, a close associate of Paolo Sarpi, who had written against the pretensions of the papacy to temporal power in response to the [[Venetian Interdict|Interdict]] of [[Pope Paul V]] against [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], which refused to recognise papal prerogatives. James I had invited both men to England in 1612. Micanzio and Sarpi had argued that God willed human nature, and that human nature indicated the autonomy of the state in temporal affairs.
