He was also known as '''Magiau''' and ruled from 1640 to 1657. His reign saw intermittent hostilities with Tidore's traditional rival, the [[Sultanate of Ternate]], which included interference in an anti-Dutch rebellion in Ternate and [[Ambon]] and attempts to increase Tidorese territory in Maluku.\n\n==Power struggles and succession==\n\nSaidi was a son of Sultan [[Ngarolamo]] who was deposed by his rival [[Gorontalo of Tidore|Gorontalo]] in 1634. He stayed with his father and 200 loyal retainers in exile on [[Ternate Island]] until 1639, when Ngarolamo was killed because of his secret deliberations with the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], the traditional allies of the Tidore Sultans. This murder was soon followed by another one in August 1639, when Gorontalo was killed by a Spanish officer for treacherous collusion with the Ternatans.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1890) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. II. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 380-3.</ref> Now Tidore was split between two camps; one favoured Gorontalo's son [[Saifuddin of Tidore|Kaicili Golofino]] while another wanted Saidi. The succession dispute lasted into 1640 but was finally resolved in favour of Saidi, who was the Spanish candidate. Ternate's ally, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) preferred to stay out of this dispute.<ref>W.P. Coolhaas, ed. (1964) ''Generale missiven van Gouverneurs-Generaal en Raden aan Heren XVII der Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', Deel II. 's-Gravenhage: M. Nijhoff, p. 105.</ref>\n\n==Uneasy relationship with the Spanish==\n\nAt his accession Saidi had to promise to fulfill a number of points. He should provide military assistance to the Spanish establishments in Maluku when needed, he was only to sell [[cloves]] to the Spaniards, and he must allow anyone who so desired to become a Catholic. According to Spanish opinions he failed in all these commitments. On the contrary he strove to manage the spice trade in Tidore's own interests and forbade his subjects to sell the cloves to Spanish buyers. Saidi also interfered in the affairs of the [[Sangihe Islands]] north of Maluku, vassals under the [[Spanish Philippines]], where he supported a Muslim rebel with soldiers and Islamic preachers against the Christian ruler of Kalongan. He even had the rebel chief consecrated as ruler in the mosque of Tidore and, in the Spanish interpretation, reserved for himself the role of emperor.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1981) \"The 'Discurso politico del gobierno Maluco' of Fr. Francisco Comb\u00e9s and its historical impact\", ''Philippine Studies'' 29, p. 328.</ref> The precarious situation of the Spanish in Maluku nevertheless forced them to maintain the Tidore alliance, since Saidi was their only potential supporter in the region.\n\n==Continuing struggles against Ternate and the VOC==\n\nThe ongoing war between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] was matched by hostilities in Maluku where Spain and Tidore stood against the VOC and Ternate.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1984) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. III. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 2-6.</ref> The Dutch actively tried to prevent any attempts to make a separate peace between Ternate and Tidore. The VOC noted that Saidi was a political man who was no great friend of Spain but who strove to secure Tidore's position within the power balance between the Europeans.<ref>W.P. Coolhaas, ed. (1964), p. 589.</ref> Several clashed nevertheless took place during the 1640s. Tidore turned out to be the more successful \"due to its greater carefulness and bravery\"<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. III. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 443.</ref> Foodstuff was brought to Tidore from its vassals in [[Halmahera]] and even from the [[Raja Ampat|Papuan Islands]], where Tidorese influence had been established by this time. One of Saidi's helpers was the chief Gurabesi whom later traditions associate with the origins of Tidore rule in the Papuan lands.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895), p. 444.</ref> In 1649 a number of battles and mutual raids took place, culminating in a Tidore-Spanish invasion in Ternate where the Dutch were defeated with considerable losses. Before the VOC were able to stage a counter-attack, news of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] reached the East Indies, and hostilities were cancelled.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895), p. 444-6.</ref>\n\n==Interference in anti-VOC rebellion==\n\nShortly after this, the VOC-backed Sultan of Ternate, [[Mandar Syah]], was opposed by his brothers and part of the Ternatan elite. The Dutch commander Arnold de Vlamingh van Outshoorn suppressed an attempt to replace Mandar Syah, and the Ternatans had to agree on a treaty in 1652 where they were stipulated to extirpate clove trees in their dominions.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 167-8.</ref> This would ensure VOC monopoly on the spice trade, but the treaty was insufficient as long as Tidore sold its cloves to other buyers. Since Saidi actively supported the rebels in Ternate without Spanish approval, De Vlamingh van Outshoorn declared war on Tidore, hoping to eliminate the Tidorese clove production. In order not to antagonize the Spanish, [[Tidore Island]] was not attacked; rather, an expedition under Simon Cos was dispatched to worst Tidore's vassals in Halmahera and the Papuan Islands. The expedition was not particularly successful, and in the meantime the Papuan Raja of [[Salawati]] raided in [[Ambon]] on behalf of Sultan Saidi.<ref>P.J.B.C.

He was however soon set free again, and peace with the VOC followed.<ref>A. Haga (1884) ''Nederlandsch Nieuw Guinea en de Papoesche eilanden. Historische bijdrage, 1500-1883''.

His demise immediately triggered a succession war. He sired two sons called Weda (alias Mole) and Duko, and a daughter who had been betrothed to Mandar Syah in 1651 though the engagement was broken due to the war.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''.

He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for [[Truman Capote]], took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.<ref name=Y>{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/allan-carr-rise-fall-hollywood-hedonist-014130665.html|title=Allan Carr: The rise and fall of a Hollywood hedonist|author=Taggart, Frankie|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management career==\nIn 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Peter Sellers]],<ref name=Y/> [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Melina Mercouri]], and [[Marlo Thomas]].  Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced, [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], \"Mama\" [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]], and [[Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]],<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].

He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for [[Truman Capote]], took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.<ref name=Y>{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/allan-carr-rise-fall-hollywood-hedonist-014130665.html|title=Allan Carr: The rise and fall of a Hollywood hedonist|author=Taggart, Frankie|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management career==\nIn 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Peter Sellers]],<ref name=Y/> [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Melina Mercouri]], and [[Marlo Thomas]].  Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced, [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], \"Mama\" [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]], and [[Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]],<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy.

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study].

In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nRegarding the above, please note, \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came after the defeated Cambodia's \n\nKhmer Rouge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html|title=Khmer Rouge Topple Dominates Cambodian Politics 40 Years On|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|a genocidal regime supported by the United States.]] Subsequently, in a petty display, after having lost twice to Vietnam:\n\n\"[The United States].... employed its ''de facto'' veto at the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank in order to block all multilateral financial lending to [Vietnam].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.

''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' combined government planning with [[free-market]] incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including [[Foreign direct investment|foreign-owned enterprises]].

30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to [[deforestation in Vietnam|dwindling forests]], Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam's [[fishing]] industry, which has abundant resources given the country's long coastline and [[rivers in Vietnam|extensive network of rivers and lakes]], has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by [[shrimp]] farms in the South and \"catfish\", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered [[antidumping]] complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/why-cant-vietnam-grow-better-rice/ |title=Why Can't Vietnam Grow Better Rice? |last1=Rosen |first1=Elisabeth |date=24 April 2014 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee, trailing behind Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/coffee-exports-country/|title=World's Top Exports - Coffee Exports by Country|work=World's Top Exports|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Energy, mining and minerals===\n{{Main|Energy in Vietnam}}\n\n[[Petroleum]] is the main source of energy, followed by [[coal]], which contributes about 25% of the country's energy (excluding [[biomass]]). Vietnam's oil reserves are in the range of 270\u2013500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to {{convert|403300|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually.\n\nIn 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports. Also mined are [[antimony]], [[bauxite]], [[chromium]], [[gold]], [[iron]], natural [[phosphates]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]].<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nCrude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/vnm/all/show/1996/?prod_class=hs4&details_treemap=2&disable_widgets=false&disable_search=false&node_size=none&queryActivated=true&highlight=&yaxis=complexity|title=What did Viet Nam export in 1996? - The Atlas Of Economic Complexity|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity.

Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam's potential [[natural gas]] reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. [[Hydroelectric]] power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 1 Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]]  with [[Rosatom|Russian assistance]],<ref name=\"cp\"/> and a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 2 Nuclear Power Plant|second]] by a Japanese group.\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\n{{Main|Manufacturing in Vietnam}}\n\nAlthough the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy.

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study].

In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nRegarding the above, please note, \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came after the defeated oCambodia'snruling g Khmer Rouge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html|title=Khmer Rouge Topple Dominates Cambodian Politics 40 Years On|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|a genocidal regime supported by the United States.]] Subsequently, in a petty display, after having lost twice to Vietnam:\n\n\"[The United States].... employed its ''de facto'' veto at the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank in order to block all multilateral financial lending to [Vietnam].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.

''\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi'' combined government planning with [[free-market]] incentives and encouraged the establishment of private businesses and foreign investment, including [[Foreign direct investment|foreign-owned enterprises]].

30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to [[deforestation in Vietnam|dwindling forests]], Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam's [[fishing]] industry, which has abundant resources given the country's long coastline and [[rivers in Vietnam|extensive network of rivers and lakes]], has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by [[shrimp]] farms in the South and \"catfish\", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered [[antidumping]] complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/why-cant-vietnam-grow-better-rice/ |title=Why Can't Vietnam Grow Better Rice? |last1=Rosen |first1=Elisabeth |date=24 April 2014 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee, trailing behind Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/coffee-exports-country/|title=World's Top Exports - Coffee Exports by Country|work=World's Top Exports|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Energy, mining and minerals===\n{{Main|Energy in Vietnam}}\n\n[[Petroleum]] is the main source of energy, followed by [[coal]], which contributes about 25% of the country's energy (excluding [[biomass]]). Vietnam's oil reserves are in the range of 270\u2013500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to {{convert|403300|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually.\n\nIn 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports. Also mined are [[antimony]], [[bauxite]], [[chromium]], [[gold]], [[iron]], natural [[phosphates]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]].<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nCrude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/vnm/all/show/1996/?prod_class=hs4&details_treemap=2&disable_widgets=false&disable_search=false&node_size=none&queryActivated=true&highlight=&yaxis=complexity|title=What did Viet Nam export in 1996? - The Atlas Of Economic Complexity|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity.

Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam's potential [[natural gas]] reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. [[Hydroelectric]] power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 1 Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]]  with [[Rosatom|Russian assistance]],<ref name=\"cp\"/> and a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 2 Nuclear Power Plant|second]] by a Japanese group.\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\n{{Main|Manufacturing in Vietnam}}\n\nAlthough the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth.

Although the United States and Vietnam reached a landmark bilateral agreement in December 2001, which helped increase Vietnam's exports to the United States, disagreements over textile and catfish exports are hindering full implementation of the agreement. Further disrupting the economic relations between the two countries were efforts in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to link non-humanitarian aid to Vietnam's [[human rights]] record. Barriers to trade and [[intellectual property]] are also within the purview of bilateral discussions.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nGiven neighboring China's rapid economic ascendancy, Vietnam highly values its economic relationship with China. Following the resolution of most territorial disputes, trade with China is growing rapidly, and in 2004, Vietnam imported more products from China than from any other country. In November 2004, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), of which Vietnam is a member, and China announced plans to establish the world's largest free-trade area by 2010.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on January 11, 2007.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn December 2015, Vietnam joined the [[ASEAN Economic Community]] along with the 9 other ASEAN members.

Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam.

In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It premiered on [[10 Peach]] in Australia and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2020. The episode was written by series producer [[Jason Herbison]] and directed by Tony Gardiner ACS. The episode is mainly a two-hander between [[Finn Kelly]] ([[Rob Mills]]) and [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]). It serves as part of the conclusion to Finn's storyline, in which he retains the memories he lost after being pushed off a cliff by Susan, resulting in a deadly revenge during the 35th anniversary week. \n\n==Plot==\n[[Finn Kelly]] ([[Rob Mills]]) returns to [[Ramsay Street]] after killing [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]), kidnapping [[Aster Conway]] (Isla Goulas), and setting fire to [[Pierce Greyson]]'s ([[Tim Robards]]) island. He lies to [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that her niece [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]) is waiting for them at a log cabin in the [[Snowy Mountains]] while Aster's mother [[Elly Conway]] ([[Jodi Anasta]]) has elected to remain on Pierce's island. Despite the late hour, Susan agrees to go with Finn in her car.\n\nWhile on the way to the cabin, Susan discovers Aster in the backseat of the car and confronts Finn about his true intentions. Finn confesses that he wants to start a new life with her, Aster and his friend [[Harry Sinclair]] ([[Paul Dawber]]). Finn also reveals that his memories of the evil he committed during the first time he lived on Ramsay Street have returned and that he wanted both Bea and Elly out of the way after the former was in the way of a relationship with Elly and the latter refused to come with him. Susan subsequently tells Finn that he is not well, needs help and that the other residents of Ramsay street would understand his situation. Finn manipulates Susan by telling her that she is more like a mother to him than his real mother ever was and that she does not need her husband [[Karl Kennedy]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]).\n\nAfter arriving at the cabin, Finn sets Aster down to rest and becomes violent and aggressive towards Susan, forcing her to stay with him despite her suspicions. As they lie down to sleep, Finn tells Susan about his dark childhood memories where his mother [[Claudia Watkins]] (Kate Raison) berated him for being mean to his younger brother [[Shaun Watkins]] (Brad Moller), although he was just playing with him. This results in Finn breaking down in tears, and Susan comforts him. Susan later wakes up in the middle of the night, trying to escape the cabin, and picks up a piece of a vase she had accidentally broken earlier, contemplating whether to attack Finn with it. She tells Finn that she thought Harry had returned, and Finn once again becomes aggressive, inadvertently waking up Aster.\n\nThe next morning, Finn wakes up and pretends to have a shower. As he is doing this, Susan picks up her phone and attempts to call emergency services. However, Finn soon catches her in the act and realises that she has been doubting him and does not want to start a new life with him. Enraged, he ties Susan to a chair as she shouts at him to confess to what he has really done to Bea and Elly. Finn eventually reveals that he has pushed Bea down a mineshaft on the island, abandoned Elly there as well and killed Gary with an arrow. He then leaves the cabin to dig a hole to eliminate Susan with the help of a water pipe to soften the earth. Susan then screams for help, while trying to free herself as Finn informs her that no one can hear her, waking up Aster.\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\nIn December 2019, Mills confirmed that he had left ''[[Neighbours]]'' and that his final scenes would air in early 2020.<ref name=\"FByrne\">{{cite news|url=https://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/fiona-byrne/rob-mills-reveals-key-to-budding-romance/news-story/1549ac590ad5faf4df47f00aa3adaf69|title=Rob Mills and girlfriend Georgie Tunny reveal key to romance|last=Byrne|first=Fiona|date=29 December 2019|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=29 December 2019}}{{subscription}}</ref>.

They are joined by two guest celebrities who assist the teams for all but the third segment of the show, attempting to identify the names of popular culture subjects like celebrities, fictional characters, place names, or film and television titles.\n\nIn the first two rounds, each team is assigned one of the celebrities, who then will switch teams for the second round. Each of the three-member teams are presented with a category containing ten names. One person will give clues, trying to get the other two to guess the names. Successful guesses earn money. An illegal clue (saying the name or part of the name, spelling the name, or rhyming the name) voids that name. Each turn lasts for 45 seconds. In the first round, one team is chosen to play first, and chooses one of two categories presented, leaving the second team to play the remaining category. In the second round, the second team plays first and chooses the first category.\n\nIn round one, the celebrity gives the clues while turning back and forth to alternately face each contestant, and each correct answer is worth $100, up to $1,000 total. In round two, one of the two contestants gives clues while alternately facing either the remaining partner or the assigned celebrity, and each answer is worth $200, up to $2,000 total.\n\nIn the third round, the contestants go head to head while Denyer gives the clues to names under a specific category. The contestants buzz in to make a guess. If neither contestant buzzes in after a while, Denyer can start giving out clues that are normally illegal, all the way up to simply saying the name. A right answer earns money for the team that answered, but a wrong answer grants the money to the opponent. The first answer is worth $100 and each successive answer increases in value by $100. Winnings in this round are added to the money accumulated in the first two rounds, and whichever team reaches $3,000 or more first is the winner, keeps the cash, and goes on to the bonus round to play for the prize of $10,000. If no team reaches $3,000 before time is called, the team in the lead at the end of the round wins the game. If the game ends in a tie, one final name is given; a team who buzzes in with a correct answer wins the game, but a wrong answer results in an automatic loss.\n\n===Bonus round===\nIn the bonus round, there is no particular category. The names of people, characters, places, shows or things are hidden behind ten numbered squares. The contestants take turns giving the clues to both celebrities. One contestant is placed in a soundproof booth while the other gives clues. The current giver starts describing when a name or picture is exposed. If the celebrity receivers get it right, the name stays revealed. Passing on a name re-conceals it. This round lasts for a total of 75 seconds, the first contestant has 45 seconds, and the second has 30 seconds. If the first clue giver provides an illegal clue to a name, that name is replaced by a different one for the second clue giver. Any illegal clue by the second clue giver, however, ends the round immediately. Getting all ten increases the team's total winnings to $10,000. If the first contestant correctly guesses all ten names within 45 seconds or less, the second portion of the round is not played. Otherwise, the team takes home only the amount they had earned by the end of Round 3.\n\n==Production and broadcast==\n''Celebrity Name Game'' airs in a 6:00 pm timeslot and is broadcast five nights a week from Mondays to Fridays. The show is filmed at [[Network 10]]'s [[TEN (TV Station)#Studio facilities|studios]] in Pyrmont, Sydney as of 2019.<ref name=CelebNameGameLaunch/><ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity Name Game Audience

He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew members on the ship before the accident. Lister survived the accident, as he was in stasis for smuggling an unquarantined cat on board. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on [[Fiji]] (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\">Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 19\u201324.</ref> He likes [[Indian food]], especially chicken [[vindaloo]], which is a recurring theme in the series.\n* [[Arnold Rimmer|Arnold Judas Rimmer]] Bsc Ssc (\"Bronze swimming certificate\" and \"Silver swimming certificate\"), played by [[Chris Barrie]], was the second-lowest-ranking member of the crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, [[bureaucratic]], [[neuroticism|neurotic]] coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself) except Lister. Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 24\u201330.</ref> because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become his swashbuckling dimensional counterpart, Ace Rimmer. Along with the ''Red Dwarf'' ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with [[Death (personification)|Death]] at the end of the series, whom he kicks in the groin. From ''Back to Earth'' onwards, he is once again a hologram, although to what circumstances lead to this is never elaborated.\n[[File:Red Dwarf cast.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], and [[Kryten]] as they appeared in 2009's ''Back to Earth'']]\n* The [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], played by [[Danny John-Jules]], is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating, and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew in early episodes. He becomes more influenced by his human companions over time, and begins to resemble a stylish, self-centred human.

Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed \"computer senility\" before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe \"with whom he'd once fallen madly in love\".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 35\u201338.</ref> Following an absence in series VI and the majority of series VII, Holly is back as his original male persona, being reset by the [[Nanarchy|nanobots who stole ''Red Dwarf'']]. From ''Back to Earth'' to series XII, Holly is absent once again due to Lister's bath overflowing [[offscreen]], caused by him rushing out when hearing Kochanski had left, which got into Holly's circuity causing him to malfunction and go offline.\n* [[Kristine Kochanski]] (originally portrayed by [[Clare Grogan]] before [[Chlo\u00eb Annett]] took on the role from series VII) was initially a ''Red Dwarf'' navigation officer whom Lister had a crush on (later retroactively altered to be his ex-girlfriend) and whose memory he had cherished ever since.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\"/> In one [[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|episode]], the crew happens upon an alternative dimension where Kochanski survived the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident. She joins Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapses.<ref name=\"Series VII review at DVD Active\"/> By the first episode of the ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'' specials, Lister believes her dead, but it is later revealed that Kryten (the sole witness to her \"death\") had lied to Lister. Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her. Lister is advised by fans of the television series to find her in \"the next series\" and to make amends. Despite not making an appearance in the immediate series, she is mentioned at various points by Lister with hopes of reuniting with her.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Trojan |episode-link=Trojan (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |city= |date=4 October 2012 |season= |series-no=X |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe first series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1988.

Many visual and character elements bear similarities to the Trident nuclear submarine BBC documentary ''Defence of the Realm''.

The increasing science-fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes, referencing other television series, films and books.

The series VII episode titled \"[[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|Ouroboros]]\" derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the [[Ouroboros|same name]]. The third episode of series VI \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\" was based on the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe series explores many science-fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the [[grandfather paradox]]), the question of [[determinism]] and [[free will]] (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near-certainty of the human species' [[extinction]] some time in the far future.\n\n[[Extraterrestrial life|Aliens]] do not feature in the series, as Grant and Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually addressed with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' ([[GELF]]), an artificially created creature.

These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos: for series III (the first-ever release), \"Bodyswap\" and \"Timeslides\" were swapped round, so that the latter could receive top billing on the second VHS volume; for the second VHS volume of series I, \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being \"Waiting for God\" which shared its name with the title of [[Waiting for God (TV series)|another comedy series]] (set in a retirement home); and for series V, \"[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]\" and \"[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]\" were given top billing on their respective video release, which completely re-organised the order of episodes from that in which they were originally broadcast.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf series V Aftermath\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath |title=Red Dwarf series V Aftermath |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230342/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=5&subsectionID=aftermath |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context.

According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/>\n\nThe studio executives were not entirely happy with the pilot, especially the casting, but decided to give the project another chance with Grant and Naylor in charge.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 227.</ref> The intention was to shoot a \"promo video\" for the show in a small studio described by the writers as \"a garage\".<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> New cast members were hired for the roles of Cat (now depicted as female) and Rimmer,<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] and Anthony Fusco, respectively.<ref name=\"Resume\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |title=Red Dwarf (1992) |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218085224/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |archivedate=18 February 2017}}</ref> This meant that, unlike the original British series, the cast was all Caucasian, which Charles referred to as \"White Dwarf\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |title=Red Dwarf USA unaired pilot |date=February 2010 |website=The Red Dwarf Section |accessdate=28 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909061544/http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |archivedate=9 September 2016}}</ref> Chris Barrie was asked to play Rimmer in the second pilot, but he declined. With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes, to give an idea of the basic plot and character dynamics, alongside proposed future episodes, remakes of episodes from the original show.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Llewellyn did not participate in the re-shoot, though clips from the British version were used to show the character. Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Farrell found work almost immediately afterwards with ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', in which she was cast as [[Jadzia Dax]]. Similarly, one year later [[Jane Leeves]] was cast in ''[[Frasier]]'' as [[Daphne Moon]].\n\nThe cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of ''Red Dwarf USA'', particularly the part of Lister, who is portrayed in the British version as a likeable slob, but in the U.S. version as somewhat clean-cut.

He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew members on the ship before the accident. Lister survived the accident, as he was in stasis for smuggling an unquarantined cat on board. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on [[Fiji]] (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\">Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 19\u201324.</ref> He likes [[Indian food]], especially chicken [[vindaloo]], which is a recurring theme in the series.\n* [[Arnold Rimmer|Arnold Judas Rimmer]] Bsc Ssc (\"Bronze swimming certificate\" and \"Silver swimming certificate\"), played by [[Chris Barrie]], was the second-lowest-ranking member of the crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, [[bureaucratic]], [[neuroticism|neurotic]] coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself) except Lister. Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 24\u201330.</ref> because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become his swashbuckling dimensional counterpart, Ace Rimmer. Along with the ''Red Dwarf'' ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with [[Death (personification)|Death]] at the end of the series, whom he kicks in the groin. From ''Back to Earth'' onwards, he is once again a hologram, although to what circumstances lead to this is never elaborated.\n[[File:Red Dwarf cast.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], and [[Kryten]] as they appeared in 2009's ''Back to Earth'']]\n* The [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], played by [[Danny John-Jules]], is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating, and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew in early episodes. He becomes more influenced by his human companions over time, and begins to resemble a stylish, self-centred human. It is later revealed that, unlike his human companions, he has a \"cool\" sounding pulse, six nipples, and colour-coordinated internal organs.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 30\u201334.</ref>\n* [[Kryten]], full name Kryten 2X4B-523P (played by [[Robert Llewellyn]] from series III onwards, and as a one-off appearance in series II by [[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]), was rescued by the crew from the crashed spaceship ''Nova 5'' in series II, upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years.

Holly has a functional [[IQ]] of 6000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs. Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed \"computer senility\" before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe \"with whom he'd once fallen madly in love\".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 35\u201338.</ref> Following an absence in series VI and the majority of series VII, Holly is back as his original male persona, being reset by the [[Nanarchy|nanobots who stole ''Red Dwarf'']]. From ''Back to Earth'' to series XII, Holly is absent once again due to Lister's bath overflowing [[offscreen]], caused by him rushing out when hearing Kochanski had left, which got into Holly's circuity causing him to malfunction and go offline.\n* [[Kristine Kochanski]] (originally portrayed by [[Clare Grogan]] before [[Chlo\u00eb Annett]] took on the role from series VII) was initially a ''Red Dwarf'' navigation officer whom Lister had a crush on (later retroactively altered to be his ex-girlfriend) and whose memory he had cherished ever since.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\"/> In one [[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|episode]], the crew happens upon an alternative dimension where Kochanski survived the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident. She joins Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapses.<ref name=\"Series VII review at DVD Active\"/> By the first episode of the ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'' specials, Lister believes her dead, but it is later revealed that Kryten (the sole witness to her \"death\") had lied to Lister. Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her. Lister is advised by fans of the television series to find her in \"the next series\" and to make amends. Despite not making an appearance in the immediate series, she is mentioned at various points by Lister with hopes of reuniting with her.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Trojan |episode-link=Trojan (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |city= |date=4 October 2012 |season= |series-no=X |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe first series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1988.

Many visual and character elements bear similarities to the Trident nuclear submarine BBC documentary ''Defence of the Realm''.

With the main characters routinely displaying their cowardice, incompetence and laziness, while exchanging insulting and sarcastic dialogue, the series provided a humorous antidote to the fearless and morally upright space explorers typically found in science-fiction series,<ref name=\"screenonline: Red Dwarf\"/> with its main characters acting bravely only when there was no other possible alternative. The increasing science-fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes, referencing other television series, films and books. These have included references to the likes of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968),<ref name=\"2001: A Space Odyssey parody\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=2&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing |title=Red Dwarf series II Writing |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=17 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421163512/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=2&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=writing |archivedate=21 April 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986),<ref name=\"Top Gun influences\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=4&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=music |title=Red Dwarf: Series IV music |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=17 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230251/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=4&subsectionID=music |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1942), ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984),<ref name=\"GreatDebate\"/> ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), Isaac Asimov's ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series (1939\u20131985) and the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe writers based the whole theme of some episodes on the plots of feature films.

The series VII episode titled \"[[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|Ouroboros]]\" derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the [[Ouroboros|same name]]. The third episode of series VI \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\" was based on the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe series explores many science-fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the [[grandfather paradox]]), the question of [[determinism]] and [[free will]] (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near-certainty of the human species' [[extinction]] some time in the far future.\n\n[[Extraterrestrial life|Aliens]] do not feature in the series, as Grant and Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually addressed with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' ([[GELF]]), an artificially created creature.

These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos: for series III (the first-ever release), \"Bodyswap\" and \"Timeslides\" were swapped round, so that the latter could receive top billing on the second VHS volume; for the second VHS volume of series I, \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being \"Waiting for God\" which shared its name with the title of [[Waiting for God (TV series)|another comedy series]] (set in a retirement home); and for series V, \"[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]\" and \"[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]\" were given top billing on their respective video release, which completely re-organised the order of episodes from that in which they were originally broadcast.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf series V Aftermath\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath |title=Red Dwarf series V Aftermath |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230342/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=5&subsectionID=aftermath |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context.

According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/>\n\nThe studio executives were not entirely happy with the pilot, especially the casting, but decided to give the project another chance with Grant and Naylor in charge.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 227.</ref> The intention was to shoot a \"promo video\" for the show in a small studio described by the writers as \"a garage\".<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> New cast members were hired for the roles of Cat (now depicted as female) and Rimmer,<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] and Anthony Fusco, respectively.<ref name=\"Resume\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |title=Red Dwarf (1992) |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218085224/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |archivedate=18 February 2017}}</ref> This meant that, unlike the original British series, the cast was all Caucasian, which Charles referred to as \"White Dwarf\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |title=Red Dwarf USA unaired pilot |date=February 2010 |website=The Red Dwarf Section |accessdate=28 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909061544/http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |archivedate=9 September 2016}}</ref> Chris Barrie was asked to play Rimmer in the second pilot, but he declined. With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes, to give an idea of the basic plot and character dynamics, alongside proposed future episodes, remakes of episodes from the original show.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Llewellyn did not participate in the re-shoot, though clips from the British version were used to show the character. Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Farrell found work almost immediately afterwards with ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', in which she was cast as [[Jadzia Dax]]. Similarly, one year later [[Jane Leeves]] was cast in ''[[Frasier]]'' as [[Daphne Moon]].\n\nThe cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of ''Red Dwarf USA'', particularly the part of Lister, who is portrayed in the British version as a likeable slob, but in the U.S. version as somewhat clean-cut.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province.

However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast.

Hungarian breakfast is typically an [[open sandwich]] made with fresh bread or toast, butter, cheese or different cream cheeses, ''[[t\u00far\u00f3]]'' cheese or ''[[Liptauer|k\u00f6r\u00f6z\u00f6tt]]'' (Liptauer cheese spread), cold cuts such as ham, liver [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]] (called ''[[Braunschweiger (sausage)|m\u00e1jkr\u00e9m]]'', or ''[[Liverwurst|ken\u0151m\u00e1jas]]''), bacon, [[salami]], [[beef tongue]], [[mortadella]], ''[[Head cheese|diszn\u00f3sajt]]'' ([[head cheese]]), and different Hungarian sausages or [[kolb\u00e1sz]].<ref>Gundel's Hungarian Cookbook, Karoly Gundel, p. 34</ref> Eggs (fried, scrambled or boiled), [[French toast]] called ''bund\u00e1s keny\u00e9r'' and vegetables (such as peppers, bell peppers, tomatoes, radishes, scallions, and cucumber) may also form part of a Hungarian breakfast. Sometimes a simple breakfast will consist of a cup of milk, tea, or coffee taken with one or more pastries, bread rolls (including crescent-shaped [[kifli]]), toast, other pastries with different fillings (sweet and savory), butter, jam, or honey and a [[bun]] or a [[strudel]]<ref>J\u00f3zsef Venesz {{ISBN|963-13-0219-9}}: Corvina Press 1977.</ref> or cereal like [[muesli]], [[yogurt]], [[kefir]], and perhaps fruit.\n\n===Iceland===\nA typical Icelandic breakfast for children is oatmeal porridge.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Italy===\nThe traditional breakfast in [[Italy]] simply consists of a [[latte|caff\u00e8 latte]] (hot coffee with milk) with bread or rolls, butter and jam&nbsp;\u2013 known as ''prima colazione'' or just ''colazione''. ''Fette biscottate'' (a cookie-like hard bread often eaten with hazelnut chocolate spread or butter and jam) and [[biscuit|biscotti]] (cookies) are commonly eaten. Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with [[barley]] coffee, or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt, and fruit juices are also common. If breakfast is eaten in a ''bar'' (coffee shop), it is composed of ''cappuccino'' and ''cornetto'' (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry).<ref>The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\nTypical Latvian breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches with toppings made of vegetables, fish, eggs, or cheese. As in Finland they are often buttered with margarine. Curd mixed with vegetables and salt as well as other sour milk products are very popular as well. Very often light oat porridge is eaten too.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">And the New Scandinavian Cuisine Marcus Samuelsson {{ISBN|0618109412}}</ref> In general light, sour, and salty tasting food is common for morning meal. Latvians usually drink coffee for breakfast.\n\n===Malta===\nOn the island of [[Malta]], breakfast integrates both [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine|continental]] elements. Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]]. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: ''[[hagelslag]]'' (chocolate sprinkles), ''[[Vlokken|chocoladevlokken]]'' (chocolate flakes) (both typically Dutch), and ''chocoladepasta ''([[chocolate spread]]).<ref name=\"wintle\">{{cite book|last=Wintle|first=Michael|editor=Thomas M.

On special occasions, such as Easter, Christmas, Mother's Day etc., breakfast is usually the same, but with a wider range of choices (i.e. premium cheeses, special ham, hot buns, croissants etc.).\n\nA 2012 opinion poll concluded that the Dutch believe that breakfast should be a more important meal than it is and that more time should be spent on it; almost three-quarters of those polled ate their sandwiches in less than fifteen minutes, and blame for an all-too quick breakfast was placed on \"fast\" breakfast products. A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg. The poll also concluded that men are more interested than women in having breakfast with their partner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/lifestyle/2934751/nederland-wil-ontbijt-terug-kaart.html|title=Nederland wil ontbijt terug op de kaart|date=16 October 2012|publisher=[[Nu.nl]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Norway===\n80% of Norwegians eat breakfast (''frokost'') daily, mostly at home.

[[Whole-grain]] porridges with regular milk or butter are also eaten by some. More ample breakfasts may include fish, a diverse array of cheese, eggs, bacon, breads, and hot and cold cereals eaten in various combinations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Pastries such as [[croissants]] or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' have become increasingly common since the 1990s.\n\n===Poland===\nThe traditional Polish breakfast is a large spread with a variety of sides eaten with bread or toast. Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. In recent years, Romanians have also started to serve cereal with dried fruits and milk instead of the traditional breakfast, though that is not yet very widespread.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stiripesurse.ro/micul-dejun-in-lume-unde-si-ce-se-mananca-dimineata_956272.html |location=Bucharest|work=\u0218tiri pe surse |title=Micul dejun \u00een lume - unde \u0219i ce se m\u0103n\u00e2nc\u0103 diminea\u021ba| date= 20 May 2015}}</ref> According to a 2014 study, 35% of Romanians eat cooked dishes such as omelet or fried eggs and 15% eat sandwiches.

In [[Madrid]], ''churros'' are somewhat smaller and shaped like a [[charity ribbon]].{{clarify|date=October 2015}} This meal is normally served in cafeter\u00edas but it is not a regular or usual breakfast at Madrid homes. The usual one is the same as in the rest of Spain: coffee with milk or [[Cola Cao]], orange juice, biscuits or toasts, with butter and jam.\n\nIn the North, East and West it is more common to have a cup of coffee (usually with milk) or [[Cola Cao]] and a toast with a choice of [[olive oil]] and salt, [[tomato]] and olive oil, [[butter]], jam, p\u00e2t\u00e9, ''[[jam\u00f3n serrano]]'' (cured ham), and other options like ''[[Sobrassada|sobrasada]]'' (a raw cured spiced sausage that is easy to spread),<ref>Unesco, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00394 The Mediterranean diet]</ref> and in [[Andalucia]], ''[[pring\u00e1]]''. Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

[[Indiana University Press]]. p. 331.</ref> Breakfast also often consists of open sandwiches. The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

''Fette biscottate'' (a cookie-like hard bread often eaten with hazelnut chocolate spread or butter and jam) and [[biscuit|biscotti]] (cookies) are commonly eaten. Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with [[barley]] coffee, or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt, and fruit juices are also common. If breakfast is eaten in a ''bar'' (coffee shop), it is composed of ''cappuccino'' and ''cornetto'' (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry).<ref>The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\nTypical Latvian breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches with toppings made of vegetables, fish, eggs, or cheese.

Very often light oat porridge is eaten too.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">And the New Scandinavian Cuisine Marcus Samuelsson {{ISBN|0618109412}}</ref> In general light, sour, and salty tasting food is common for morning meal. Latvians usually drink coffee for breakfast.\n\n===Malta===\nOn the island of [[Malta]], breakfast integrates both [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine|continental]] elements. Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, cheese, and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

Saut\u00e9ed in a pan with chile, onions, [[culantro]] (an herb typical to the region) and bean stock for color. It is accompanied with fried egg, cheese, and fried plantain or [[cooking plantain]]. Black coffee or coffee with milk are traditional drinks. As this is the most common breakfast of the country, in [[Lim\u00f3n Province]] they prepare gallo pinto with coconut milk instead. Another popular breakfast food is the \"chorreadas\" which are savory sweetcorn pancakes; they are usually accompanied by cheese or a type of sour cream called \"natilla\".<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Costa Rica]]</ref>\n\n===Cuba===\nBreakfast in urban areas traditionally consists of [[caf\u00e9 con leche]] that is sweetened and includes a pinch of salt. Toasted buttered [[Cuban bread]], cut into lengths, is dunked in the coffee.

Normally accompanied by orange juice and other juices of fruits typical to the region. Milk punch (milk, egg, nutmeg, and malt) boiled eggs with \"harina de negrito\" or some other type of cornstarch. Traditional breakfast bread is a water-based bread.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Rep\u00fablica Dominicana]]</ref>\n\n===Guatemala===\nIn [[Guatemala]], breakfast consists of one or two eggs either fried, scrambled, or boiled accompanied by baked/fried beans with coffee. With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.

Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].\n\nWatts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the [[KPFA]] radio station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (n\u00e9e Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;<ref>Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.</ref> and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.<ref>[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510063805/http://www.kkup.org/sched/weekly.html |date=10 May 2016 }}.

Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nThough never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962\u20131964), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|access-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802050948/http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also lectured college and university students as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s\u20131970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140803085526/http://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather \"a philosophical entertainer\".<ref name=\"NR\" />\n\n===Experimentation===\n\nSome of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay \"The New Alchemy\") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves. These neighbors accomplished this by relying on their own talents and using their own hands, as they lived in what has been called \"shared bohemian poverty\".<ref>^ Davis, Erik (May 2005).

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at [[Druid Heights]] and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.\n\nA personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]] in ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Alan|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Chungliang Al|editor1-link=Foreword|editor2-link=Once Again: A New Beginning|title=TAO: The Watercourse Way (Foreword)|date=1975|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-73311-8|pages=vii\u2013xiii|url=https://archive.org/details/taowatercoursewa00watt_0}}</ref> His son Mark Watts has prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his father's death and performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.alanwatts.com/ |title=Alan Watts Talks & Lectures}}</ref>  His father's ashes were returned to the cabin where he had died.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6wsw8Xpcds&t=4m11s Live Fully Now: Mark Watts], interview at Druid Heights cabin by Volvo Cars (posted to YouTube on Feb 22, 2017)</ref>\n\nSince Watts' death, his lectures have found posthumous popularity on the internet, specifically YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/the-dead-philosopher-injecting-spirituality-into-mass-culture-on-youtube/96746 |title=A Dead Philosopher Makes New Connections on YouTube |last=Braswell |first=Sean |date=2019-10-08 |website=www.ozy.com |access-date=2019-10-15}}\n</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===On spiritual and social identity===\n\nIn regards to his ethical outlook, Watts felt that [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]</ref> In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, \"A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away\", and referring<ref>Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.</ref> to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: \"Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave\".<ref>Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books. His son, Mark, serves as curator of his father's audio, video and film and has published content of some of his spoken lectures in print format.\n\n[[Jean Burden]], his lover and the inspiration/editor of ''Nature, Man and Woman'', remained in his thoughts to the end of his life.\n\nWatts was a heavy smoker throughout his life<ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/> and in his later years drank heavily.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|Works by Alan Watts}}\n\nNote: ISBN's for titles originally published prior to 1974 are for reprint editions.\n\n* 1932 ''An Outline of Zen Buddhism'', The Golden Vista Press (32 page pamphlet)\n* 1936 ''The Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work and Art in the Far East'', [[E.P.

Born in [[Chislehurst]], England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began [[Zen]] training in New York. He received a master's degree in [[theology]] from [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]] and became an [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to [[California]], where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]].\n\nWatts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the [[KPFA]] radio station in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging [[Counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] to ''[[The Way of Zen]]'' (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In ''Psychotherapy East and West'' (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of [[psychotherapy]]. He considered ''Nature, Man and Woman'' (1958) to be, \"from a literary point of view\u2014the best book I have ever written.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |year=1973 |title=In My Own Way: An Autobiography 1915\u20131965 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books]] |location=New York |page=280}}</ref> He also explored human consciousness and [[psychedelic]]s in works such as \"The New Alchemy\" (1958) and ''The Joyous Cosmology'' (1962).\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Alan Watts age7.JPG|thumb|upright|Watts aged 7]]\n\nWatts was born to middle-class parents in the village of [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]] (now south-east London), on 6 January 1915, living at 3 (now 5) Holbrook Lane, which was previously lived in by author [[John Hemming-Clark]] in the early 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johnhemmingclark.com/media|title=Media}}</ref> Watts' father, Laurence Wilson Watts, was a representative for the London office of the [[Michelin]] tyre company. His mother, Emily Mary Watts (n\u00e9e Buchan), was a housewife whose father had been a [[missionary]]. With modest financial means, they chose to live in pastoral surroundings and Watts, an only child, grew up playing at Brookside, learning the names of wildflowers and butterflies.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, Part 1</ref> Probably because of the influence of his mother's religious family<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 12.</ref> the Buchans, an interest in \"ultimate things\" seeped in. It mixed with Watts's own interests in storybook fables and romantic tales of the mysterious Far East.<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong, p. 22</ref>\n\nWatts also later wrote of a [[mystical]] dream he experienced while ill with a fever as a child.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 322</ref> During this time he was influenced by Far Eastern landscape paintings and embroideries that had been given to his mother by missionaries returning from China. The few Chinese paintings Watts was able to see in England riveted him, and he wrote \"I was aesthetically fascinated with a certain clarity, transparency, and spaciousness in Chinese and Japanese art. It seemed to float...\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> These works of art emphasised the participatory relationship of people in nature, a theme that stood fast throughout his life and one that he often wrote about. (See, for instance, the last chapter in ''[[The Way of Zen]]''.<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1957, Part 2, Chapter 4</ref>)\n\n===Buddhism===\n\nBy his own assessment, Watts was imaginative, headstrong, and talkative. He was sent to [[boarding school]]s (which included both academic and religious training of the \"[[Muscular Christianity|Muscular Christian]]\" sort) from early years. Of this religious training, he remarked \"Throughout my schooling my religious indoctrination was grim and maudlin.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 60</ref>\n\nWatts spent several holidays in [[France]] in his teen years, accompanied by Francis Croshaw, a wealthy [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] with strong interests in both [[Buddhism]] and exotic little-known aspects of European culture. It was not long afterward that Watts felt forced to decide between the [[Anglican]] Christianity he had been exposed to and the Buddhism he had read about in various libraries, including Croshaw's. He chose Buddhism, and sought membership in the [[London Buddhist Lodge]], which had been established by [[Theosophism|Theosophists]], and was then run by the barrister [[Christmas Humphreys]]. Watts became the organization's secretary at 16 (1931). The young Watts explored several styles of [[meditation]] during these years.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Education===\n\nWatts attended [[The King's School, Canterbury]], next door to [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. Though he was frequently at the top of his classes scholastically and was given responsibilities at school, he botched an opportunity for a [[scholarship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] by styling a crucial examination essay in a way that was read as \"presumptuous and capricious.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 102</ref>\n\nWhen he left secondary school, Watts worked in a printing house and later a bank. He spent his spare time involved with the [[Buddhist Society|Buddhist Lodge]] and also under the tutelage of a \"rascal guru\" named [[Dimitrije Mitrinovi\u0107]]. (Mitrinovi\u0107 was himself influenced by [[P. D. Ouspensky|Peter Demianovich Ouspensky]], [[George Gurdjieff|G. I. Gurdjieff]], and the varied psychoanalytical schools of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Alfred Adler|Adler]].) Watts also read widely in philosophy, history, psychology, psychiatry and Eastern wisdom.\n\nBy his own reckoning, and also by that of his biographer [[Monica Furlong]], Watts was primarily an [[autodidact]]. His involvement with the Buddhist Lodge in London afforded Watts a considerable number of opportunities for [[personal growth]]. Through Humphreys, he contacted eminent spiritual authors, e.g. the artist, scholar, and mystic [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]], and prominent theosophists like [[Alice Bailey]].\n\nIn 1936, aged 21, he attended the World Congress of Faiths at the [[University of London]], heard [[D.&nbsp;T. Suzuki]] read a paper, and afterwards was able to meet this esteemed scholar of [[Zen Buddhism]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, pp. 78\u201382</ref> Beyond these discussions and personal encounters, Watts absorbed, by studying the available scholarly literature, the fundamental [[concept]]s and [[terminology]] of the main philosophies of India and [[East Asia]].\n\n===Influences and first publication===\nWatts's fascination with the [[Zen]] (or Ch'an) tradition\u2014beginning during the 1930s\u2014developed because that tradition embodied the spiritual, interwoven with the practical, as exemplified in the subtitle of his ''Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work, and Art in the Far East''. \"Work\", \"life\", and \"art\" were not demoted due to a spiritual focus. In his writing, he referred to it as \"the great Ch'an (or Zen) synthesis of [[Taoism]], Confucianism and Buddhism after AD 700 in China.\"<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971 ''Behold the Spirit'', revised edition. New York: Random House / Vintage. p. 32</ref> Watts published his first book, ''The Spirit of Zen,'' in 1936. Two decades later, in ''The Way of Zen''<ref>Watts, Alan W., 1957, p.11</ref> he disparaged ''The Spirit of Zen'' as a \"popularisation of Suzuki's earlier works, and besides being very unscholarly it is in many respects out of date and misleading.\"\n\nWatts married Eleanor Everett, whose mother [[Ruth Fuller Sasaki|Ruth Fuller Everett]] was involved with a traditional Zen Buddhist circle in New York. Ruth Fuller later married the Zen master (or \"roshi\"), [[Sokei-an Sasaki]], who served as a sort of model and mentor to Watts, though he chose not to enter into a formal Zen training relationship with Sasaki. During these years, according to his later writings, Watts had another mystical experience while on a walk with his wife. In 1938 they left England to live in the United States. Watts became a United States citizen in 1943.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alan Wilson Watts |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Alan_Watts.aspx |publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>\n\n===Christian priest and afterwards===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n\nWatts left formal Zen training in New York because the method of the teacher did not suit him. He was not ordained as a Zen monk, but he felt a need to find a vocational outlet for his philosophical inclinations. He entered [[Seabury-Western Theological Seminary]], an Episcopal (Anglican) school in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied Christian scriptures, theology, and church history. He attempted to work out a blend of contemporary Christian worship, mystical Christianity, and Asian philosophy. Watts was awarded a master's degree in theology in response to his thesis, which he published as a popular edition under the title ''[[Behold the Spirit: A Study in the Necessity of Mystical Religion]]''.\n\nHe later published ''Myth & Ritual in Christianity'' (1953), an [[eisegesis]] of traditional [[Roman Catholic]] doctrine and ritual in Buddhist terms. However, the pattern was set, in that Watts did not hide his dislike for religious outlooks that he decided were dour, guilt-ridden, or militantly proselytizing\u2014no matter if they were found within [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], or [[Buddhism]].\n\nAs recounted in his autobiography, Alan was [[Holy orders|ordained]] as an [[Episcopal priest]] in 1945 (aged 30) and resigned the ministry by 1950, partly as a result of an extramarital affair which resulted in his wife having their marriage annulled, but also because he could no longer reconcile his Buddhist beliefs with the formal doctrine of the church. He spent the New Year getting to know [[Joseph Campbell]] and Campbell's wife, [[Jean Erdman]], as well as the composer [[John Cage]].\n\nIn early 1951, Watts moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]]. Here he taught from 1951 to 1957 alongside Sabur\u014d Hasegawa (1906\u20131957), [[Frederic Spiegelberg]], [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], [[lama]] Tada T\u014dkan (1890\u20131967), and various visiting experts and professors. Hasegawa, in particular, served as a teacher to Watts in the areas of Japanese customs, arts, primitivism, and perceptions of nature. It was during this time he met the poet, [[Jean Burden]] with whom he had a four-year love affair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/news/ga-6607_1_jean-burden/2|title=She's Well-Versed in the Art of Writing Well : Poetry: Author, editor and teacher Jean Burden shares her lifelong obsession through invitation-only workshops in her home. |last=Hudson |first=Berkley |date=1992-08-16 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nAlan credited her as an \"important influence\" in his life and gave her dedicatory cryptograph in his book \"Nature, Man and Woman\", to which he alludes in his autobiography (p.&nbsp;297). Besides teaching, Watts served for several years as the Academy's administrator. One notable student of his was [[Eugene Rose]], who later went on to become a noted [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[hieromonk]] and controversial [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|theologian]] within the Orthodox Church in America under the jurisdiction of [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia|ROCOR]]. Rose's own disciple, a fellow monastic priest published under the name Hieromonk Damascene, produced a book entitled ''Christ the Eternal Tao'', in which the author [[comparative religion|draws parallels]] between the concept of the Tao in Chinese philosophy and the concept of the ''[[Logos]]'' in classical Greek philosophy and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] theology.\n\nWatts also studied written Chinese and practiced Chinese brush calligraphy with Hasegawa as well as with some of the Chinese students who enrolled at the academy. While Watts was noted for an interest in [[Zen Buddhism]], his reading and discussions delved into [[Vedanta]], \"[[quantum physics|the new physics]]\", [[cybernetics]], [[semantics]], [[process philosophy]], [[natural history]], and the [[anthropology]] of sexuality.\n\n==Middle years==\nWatts left the faculty for a career in the mid-1950s. In 1953, he began what became a long-running weekly radio program at Pacifica Radio station [[KPFA]] in Berkeley. Like other volunteer programmers at the listener-sponsored station, Watts was not paid for his broadcasts. These weekly broadcasts continued until 1962, by which time he had attracted a \"legion of regular listeners\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/kpfafolio131paci ''KPFA Folio'', Volume 13, no. 1], 9\u201322 April 1962, p. 14.

These recordings are broadcast to this day. For example, in 1970 Watts lectures were broadcast on Sunday mornings on San Francisco radio station KSAN;<ref>Susan Krieger, ''Hip Capitalism'', 1979, Sage Publications, Beverly Hills, {{ISBN|0-8039-1263-3}} pbk., p. 170.</ref> and even today a number of radio stations continue to have an Alan Watts program in their weekly program schedules.<ref>[http://kkup.org/sched/weekly.html KKUP Program Schedule] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510063805/http://www.kkup.org/sched/weekly.html |date=10 May 2016 }}.

Besides drawing on the lifestyle and philosophical background of Zen in India and China, Watts introduced ideas drawn from [[general semantics]] (directly from the writings of [[Alfred Korzybski]]) and also from [[Norbert Wiener]]'s early work on [[cybernetics]], which had recently been published. Watts offered analogies from cybernetic principles possibly applicable to the Zen life. The book sold well, eventually becoming a modern classic, and helped widen his lecture circuit.\n\nIn 1958, Watts toured parts of Europe with his father, meeting the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] and the German psychotherapist [[Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim]].<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 321.</ref>\n\nUpon returning to the United States, Watts recorded two seasons of a television series (1959\u20131960) for [[KQED (TV)|KQED]] public television in San Francisco, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life\".<ref>Alan Watts, \"Eastern Wisdom and Modern Life, [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL772D292429735309 Season 1 (1959)\"] and [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA1C3BAC2EB58EE47 Season 2 (1960)], KQED public television series, San Francisco</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Watts became interested in how identifiable patterns in nature tend to repeat themselves from the smallest of scales to the most immense. This became one of his passions in his research and thought.<ref>Ropp, Robert S. de 1995, 2002 ''Warrior's Way: a Twentieth Century Odyssey''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, pp. 333\u2013334.</ref>\n\nThough never affiliated for long with any one academic institution, he was Professor of Comparative Philosophy at the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]] (as mentioned above), had a fellowship at [[Harvard University]] (1962\u20131964), and was a Scholar at [[San Jose State University]] (1968).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan Watts - Life and Works|url=http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|access-date=25 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802050948/http://alanwatts.com/life-and-works/|archive-date=2 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also lectured college and university students as well as the general public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deoxy Org: Alan Watts|url=http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819233823/http://deoxy.org/watts.htm|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> His lectures and books gave him influence on the American intelligentsia of the 1950s\u20131970s, but he was often seen as an outsider in academia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weidenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=Complaining about Alan Watts|url=https://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140803085526/http://berkeleycollege.academia.edu/JonathanWeidenbaum/Posts/353447/Complaining-about-Alan-Watts|url-status = dead|archive-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> When questioned sharply by students during his talk at [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], in 1970, Watts responded, as he had from the early sixties, that he was not an academic philosopher but rather \"a philosophical entertainer\".<ref name=\"NR\" />\n\n===Experimentation===\n\nSome of Watts' writings published in 1958 (e.g., his book ''Nature, Man and Woman'' and his essay \"The New Alchemy\") mentioned some of his early views on the use of psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with [[mescaline]] given to him by [[Oscar Janiger]]. He tried [[LSD]] several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried [[marijuana]] and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook.<ref name=\"Joyous 26\">''The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the Chemistry of Consciousness'' (the quote is new to the 1965/1970 edition (page 26), and not contained in the original 1962 edition of the book).</ref>\n\nHe later said about psychedelic drug use, \"If you get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope, he goes away and works on what he has seen.\"<ref name=\"Joyous 26\"/>\n\nFor a time, Watts came to prefer writing in the language of modern science and psychology (such as ''Psychotherapy East and West''), finding a parallel between mystical experiences and the theories of the material universe proposed by 20th-century physicists. He later equated mystical experience with ecological awareness, and typically emphasized whichever approach seemed best suited to the audience he was addressing.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Applied aesthetics===\n\nWatts sometimes ate with his group of neighbors in [[Druid Heights]] (near [[Mill Valley]], California) who had endeavored to combine architecture, gardening, and carpentry skills to make a beautiful and comfortable life for themselves.

He felt such teaching could improve the world, at least to a degree. He also articulated the possibilities for greater incorporation of [[aesthetics]] (for example: better architecture, more art, more fine cuisine) in American life. In his autobiography he wrote, \"\u2026 cultural renewal comes about when highly differentiated cultures mix\".<ref>Watts, Alan W. 1973, p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn his last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), Huxley mentions the religious practice of [[maithuna]] as being something like that which [[Roman Catholics]] call \"''[[coitus reservatus]]''\". A few years before, Watts had discussed the theme in his own book, ''Nature, Man and Woman'', in which he discusses the possibility of the practice being known to early Christians and of it being kept secretly by the Church.\n\n==Later years==\n\nIn his writings of the 1950s, he conveyed his admiration for the practicality in the historical achievements of [[Ch\u00e1n]] (Zen) in the Far East, for it had fostered farmers, architects, builders, folk physicians, artists, and administrators among the monks who had lived in the monasteries of its lineages. In his mature work, he presents himself as \"Zennist\" in spirit as he wrote in his last book, ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''. Child rearing, the arts, cuisine, education, law and freedom, architecture, sexuality, and the uses and abuses of technology were all of great interest to him.\n\nThough known for his discourses on Zen, he was also influenced by ancient Hindu scriptures, especially Vedanta. He spoke extensively about the nature of the divine reality which Man misses: how the contradiction of opposites is the method of life and the means of cosmic and human evolution, how our fundamental Ignorance is rooted in the exclusive nature of mind and ego, how to come in touch with the Field of Consciousness and Light, and other cosmic principles. These are discussed in great detail in dozens of hours of audio that are in part captured in the 'Out of Your Mind' series.\n\nWatts sought to resolve his feelings of alienation from the institutions of marriage and the values of American society, as revealed in his classic comments on love relationships in \"Divine Madness\" and on perception of the organism-environment in \"The Philosophy of Nature\". In looking at social issues he was quite concerned with the necessity for international peace, for tolerance and understanding among disparate cultures.\n\nWatts also came to feel acutely conscious of a growing ecological predicament. Writing, for example, in the early 1960s: \"Can any melting or burning imaginable get rid of these ever-rising mountains of ruin\u2014especially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away?\"<ref>''The Joyous Cosmology'', p. 63</ref> These concerns were later expressed in a television pilot made for [[National Educational Television|NET]] (National Educational Television) filmed at his mountain retreat in 1971 in which he noted that the single track of conscious attention was wholly inadequate for interactions with a multi-tracked world.\n\n==Death==\n\nIn October 1973, Watts returned from a European lecture tour to his cabin in [[Druid Heights]], California. Friends of Watts had been concerned about him for some time over his [[alcoholism]].<ref>''Zen Effects: The Life of Alan Watts'', by Monica Furlong</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/><ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/> On 16 November 1973, at age 58, he died in his sleep.

His ashes were split, with half buried near his library at [[Druid Heights]] and half at the Green Gulch Monastery.\n\nA personal account of Watts' last years and approach to death is given by [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]] in ''[[Tao: The Watercourse Way]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Watts|first1=Alan|editor1-last=Huang|editor1-first=Chungliang Al|editor1-link=Foreword|editor2-link=Once Again: A New Beginning|title=TAO: The Watercourse Way (Foreword)|date=1975|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-73311-8|pages=vii\u2013xiii|url=https://archive.org/details/taowatercoursewa00watt_0}}</ref> His son Mark Watts has prepared a biographical documentary that details questions surrounding his father's death and performed ritual cremation on a nearby beach.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.alanwatts.com/ |title=Alan Watts Talks & Lectures}}</ref>  His father's ashes were returned to the cabin where he had died.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6wsw8Xpcds&t=4m11s Live Fully Now: Mark Watts], interview at Druid Heights cabin by Volvo Cars (posted to YouTube on Feb 22, 2017)</ref>\n\nSince Watts' death, his lectures have found posthumous popularity on the internet, specifically YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ozy.com/good-sht/the-dead-philosopher-injecting-spirituality-into-mass-culture-on-youtube/96746 |title=A Dead Philosopher Makes New Connections on YouTube |last=Braswell |first=Sean |date=2019-10-08 |website=www.ozy.com |access-date=2019-10-15}}\n</ref>\n\n==Views==\n\n===On spiritual and social identity===\n\nIn regards to his ethical outlook, Watts felt that [[moral absolutism|absolute morality]] had nothing to do with the fundamental realization of one's deep spiritual identity. He advocated social rather than personal ethics. In his writings, Watts was increasingly concerned with ethics applied to relations between humanity and the natural environment and between governments and citizens. He wrote out of an appreciation of a racially and culturally diverse social landscape.\n\nHe often said that he wished to act as a bridge between the ancient and the modern, between East and West, and between culture and nature.\n\nWatts led some tours for Westerners to the Buddhist temples of Japan. He also studied some movements from the traditional [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial]] art [[taijiquan]], with an Asian colleague, [[Chungliang Al Huang|Al Chung-liang Huang]].\n\n===Worldview===\n\nIn several of his later publications, especially ''Beyond Theology'' and ''The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'', Watts put forward a [[worldview]], drawing on [[Hinduism]], [[Chinese philosophy]], [[pantheism]] or [[panentheism]], and modern science, in which he maintains that the whole universe consists of a cosmic Self playing hide-and-seek ([[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]]); hiding from itself ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]) by becoming all the living and non-living things in the universe and forgetting what it really is \u2013 the upshot being that we are all IT in disguise. In this worldview, Watts asserts that our conception of ourselves as an \"[[ego (spirituality)|ego]] in a bag of skin,\" or \"skin-encapsulated ego\" is a [[myth]]; the entities we call the separate \"things\" are merely aspects or features of the whole.\n\nWatts' books frequently include discussions reflecting his keen interest in patterns that occur in nature and which are repeated in various ways and at a wide range of scales \u2013 including the patterns to be discerned in the history of civilizations.<ref>De Ropp, Robert S. 2002 ''Warrior's Way''. Nevada City, CA: Gateways, p. 334.</ref><ref>Watts, Alan W. 1947/1971, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\n===Supporters and critics===\n\nWatts's explorations and teaching brought him into contact with many noted intellectuals, artists, and American teachers in the [[human potential movement]]. His friendship with poet [[Gary Snyder]] nurtured his sympathies with the budding [[environmental movement]], to which Watts gave philosophical support. He also encountered [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who credited Watts with being one of his \"Light[s] along the Way\" in the opening appreciation of ''[[Cosmic Trigger]]''. [[Werner Erhard]] attended workshops given by Alan Watts and said of him, \"He pointed me toward what I now call the distinction between Self and Mind. After my encounter with Alan, the context in which I was working shifted.\"<ref>William Warren Bartley, Werner Erhard, The Transformation of a Man</ref>\n\nWatts has been criticized by Buddhists such as [[Philip Kapleau]] and [[D. T. Suzuki]] for allegedly misinterpreting several key Zen Buddhist concepts. In particular, he drew criticism from those who believe that [[zazen]] must entail a strict and specific means of sitting, as opposed to a cultivated state of mind available at any moment in any situation. Typical of these is Kapleau's claim that Watts dismissed [[zazen]] on the basis of only half a [[koan]].<ref>Kapleau 1967, pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nIn regard to the aforementioned koan, [[Robert Baker Aitken]] reports that Suzuki told him, \"I regret to say that Mr. Watts did not understand that story.\"<ref>[[#refAitken|Aitken 1997]], p. 30. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SS-Dc6ox4hYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22original+dwelling+place%22#PPA29,M1]</ref> In his talks, Watts addressed the issue of defining zazen practice by saying, \"A cat sits until it is tired of sitting, then gets up, stretches, and walks away\", and referring<ref>Alan Watts: ''The truth of the birthless mind'', from ''Out of You Mind'', Session 8, Lecture 8.</ref> to  Zen master [[Bankei]]: \"Even when you're sitting in meditation, if there's something you've got to do, it's quite all right to get up and leave\".<ref>Peter Haskel (ed.): ''Bankei Zen: Translations from The Record of Bankei''. Grove Press, New York 1984. Page 59.</ref> \n\nHowever, Watts did have his supporters in the Zen community, including [[Shunryu Suzuki]], the founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]]. As [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] recounted in his biography of Suzuki, ''Crooked Cucumber: the Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', when a student of Suzuki's disparaged Watts by saying \"we used to think he was profound until we found the real thing\", Suzuki fumed with a sudden intensity, saying, \"You completely miss the point about Alan Watts! You should notice what he has done. He is a great [[bodhisattva]].\"<ref>Chadwick, D: ''Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki'', Broadway Books,2000</ref>\n\nWatts's biographers saw him, after his stint as an Anglican priest, as representative of no religion but as a lone-wolf thinker and social rascal. In David Stuart's warts-and-all biography of the man, Watts is seen as an unusually gifted speaker and writer driven by his own interests, enthusiasms, and demons.<ref>Stuart, David 1976 ''Alan Watts''. Pennsylvania: Chilton.</ref> Elsa Gidlow, whom Alan called \"sister\", refused to be interviewed for this work but later painted a kinder picture of Alan's life in her own autobiography, ''Elsa, I Come With My Songs''. According to critic [[Erik Davis]], his \"writings and recorded talks still shimmer with a profound and galvanizing lucidity.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=David |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Davis |year=2006 |title=The Visionary State: A Journey through California's Spiritual Landscape |publisher=Chronicle Books |isbn=0-8118-4835-3}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nWatts married three times and had seven children (five daughters and two sons). \nWatts met Eleanor Everett in 1936, when her mother, Ruth Fuller Everett, brought her to London to study piano. They met at the Buddhist Lodge, were engaged the following year and married in April 1938. A daughter, Joan, was born in November 1938 and another, Anne, was born in 1942. Their marriage ended in 1949, but Watts continued to correspond with his former mother-in-law.<ref>Stirling 2006, p. 27</ref>\nIn 1950, Watts married Dorothy DeWitt. He moved to San Francisco in early 1951 to teach. They began a family that grew to include five children: Tia, Mark, Richard, Lila, and Diane. The couple separated in the early 1960s after Watts met Mary Jane Yates King (called \"Jano\" in his circle) while lecturing in New York. After a difficult divorce he married King in 1964. The couple divided their time between [[Sausalito, California]],<ref>''The Book on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are'' (1966)</ref> where they lived on a [[houseboat]] called the ''[[Vallejo (ferry)|Vallejo]]'',<ref>Watts, Alan, 1973, pp. 300\u2013304</ref> and a secluded cabin in [[Druid Heights]], on the southwest flank of [[Mount Tamalpais]] north of San Francisco.\nSome regard Watts as having been an unfaithful husband and a poor father.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\">{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@julesevans/alan-watts-genius-or-charlatan-72313fae997d|title=Alan Watts: genius or charlatan?|last=Evans |first=Jules |date=2019-02-01|website=Medium |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"Reconsidered\">{{Cite web |url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/alan-watts-reconsidered/ |title=Alan Watts Reconsidered |last=Guy |first=David |website=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review |access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>\n\nWatts' eldest daughters, Joan and Anne, own and manage most of the copyrights to his books. His son, Mark, serves as curator of his father's audio, video and film and has published content of some of his spoken lectures in print format.\n\n[[Jean Burden]], his lover and the inspiration/editor of ''Nature, Man and Woman'', remained in his thoughts to the end of his life.\n\nWatts was a heavy smoker throughout his life<ref name=\"Reconsidered\"/> and in his later years drank heavily.<ref name=\"GeniusCharlatan\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|Works by Alan Watts}}\n\nNote: ISBN's for titles originally published prior to 1974 are for reprint editions.\n\n* 1932 ''An Outline of Zen Buddhism'', The Golden Vista Press (32 page pamphlet)\n* 1936 ''The Spirit of Zen: A Way of Life, Work and Art in the Far East'', [[E.P.
