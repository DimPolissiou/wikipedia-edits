Campus lore suggests that in 1964, Pomona math professor Donald Bentley produced a convincing mathematical proof that 47 was equal to all other integers, and that other faculty members and senior students could not disprove his equation at first sight.

Campus lore suggests that in 1964, Pomona math professor Donald Bentley produced a convincing mathematical proof that 47 was equal to all other integers, and that other faculty members and senior students could not disprove his equation at first sight. (By the 1970s oral history had grown this tale into a 1950s McCarthy-era exercise by an unnamed professor, and that it was a symbolic attack on the \"big lie\" political style of the Red-hunters of the era.) Another version \u2014 later verified by Bentley \u2014 holds that two Pomona students on a summer grant project in 1964 hypothesized that 47 occurred far more often in nature than random number distribution would explain.

There were several such religious centers, each of which was a ''serapeion'' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd}}) or, in its Latinized form, a ''serapeum''. An Egyptian name for the temple of Osiris-Apis ({{Lang-cop|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2ca5\u2c89\u2ca3\u03e9\u2c81\u2ca1\u2c93}}) was Pr-Ws\u1ec9r-\u1e24p \"House of Osiris-Apis\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trismegistos.org/place/10638|title=TM Places|website=www.trismegistos.org|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> \n\n==Egyptian Serapea==\n===Alexandria===\n[[File:The Catacombs beneath the Serapeum of Alexandria (II).jpg|thumb|The Catacombs beneath the Serapeum of Alexandria]]\nThe [[Serapeum of Alexandria]] in the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] was an [[ancient Greek temple]] built by [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]]. There are also signs of [[Harpocrates]]. It has been referred to as the daughter of the [[Library of Alexandria]]. It existed until the end of the fourth century AD.\n\n===Saqqara===\nThe [[Serapeum of Saqqara]] is located north west of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] at [[Saqqara]], a necropolis near [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in [[Lower Egypt]]. It was a burial place of the [[Apis (deity)|Apis]] bulls, [[sacred bull]]s that were incarnations of [[Ptah]]. It was believed that the bulls became immortal after death as Osiris-Apis, a name shortened to Serapis in the Hellenic period.\n\n===Canopus===\nAnother Serapeum was located at [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]], in the [[Nile Delta]] near Alexandria. This sanctuary, dedicated to [[Isis]] and her consort Serapis, became one of the most famous [[cult (religious practice)|cult centers]] of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]]. Its festivals and rites were so popular that the site became an architectural model for sanctuaries to the Egyptian gods throughout the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nAt this Graeco-Roman site, a sacred [[temenos]] enclosed the temple dedicated to the gods, which was located behind a [[propylaea]] or [[peristyle]] court.  Auxiliary shrines dedicated to other, less universal, Egyptian deities could be found here as well, including those dedicated to [[Anubis]] ([[Hermanubis]]), [[Hermes Trismegistus]], the syncretism of [[Thoth]] and [[Hermes]], Harpocrates, and others.  Ritual complexes dedicated to Isis were often built around a well or a spring, which was meant to represent the miraculous annual inundation of the Nile.  This was also the case in sanctuaries devoted to the Egyptian gods in Roman-era [[Delos]], where a central basin provided the water element central in the rites of Isis.\n\n==Serapea in Italy==\n\n===Regio tertia===\nThe ''[[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regio III]]'' within the city of Rome was named ''Isis et Serapis'' because it contained a temple dedicated to the two Egyptian deities.  The structure, originally dedicated to Isis alone, was built by [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] in the first half of the 1st century BCE to celebrate his father's victory over [[Jugurtha]].\n\nThe complex, of which only parts of the foundations remain, was originally terraced; during the [[Flavian dynasty]], it underwent major renovations, and the cult of Serapis was associated to that of Isis. The temple was finally demolished during the 6th century.\n\n===Campus Martius===\n{{Main|Temple of Isis and Serapis}}\nThis temple, dedicated to Isis and Serapis, was first dedicated by the triumvirs in 43 BCE<ref>[[Cassius Dio]]. ''Historia Romana'', XLVII, 15:4.</ref> in Rome. However, due to later tensions between Octavian (later Augustus Caesar) and Marc Antony, the temple was not built. Following the Battle at Actium, Augustus banned the religion from within the pomerium of Rome altogether.<ref>Moehring, Horst R. \u201cThe Persecution of the Jews and the Adherents of the Isis Cult at Rome AD 19\u201d Novum Testamentu 3.4 (1959): 294.</ref> The temple was finally built by Gaius Caligula on the area known as [[Campus Martius]], between the [[Saepta Julia]] and the [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|temple of Minerva]] c. 37-41 CE.<ref>Momigliano, Arnaldo. On Pagans, Jews, and Christians. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1987: 88.</ref>\n\nThe Serapeum, 240 m long and 60 m wide, was divided in three sections: a rectangular area could be accessed first by walking under monumental arches; an open square, adorned with red [[granite]] [[obelisk]]s brought to the city during the 1st century and erected in couples, followed.  The centre of the square was likely occupied by the temple dedicated to Isis, while the third section, a semicircular [[exedra]] with an [[apse]] presumably hosted the altar dedicated to Serapis.  Fragments of the obelisks, some quite large, have been found around the current church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva; some archaeologists have proposed that the obelisk facing the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] (see picture) may have been repositioned from the temple to its current location.\n\nThe building was destroyed in the great fire of the year 80 CE<ref>Cassius Dio. ''Historia Romana'', LXVI, 24:2.</ref> and rebuilt by [[Domitian]];<ref>[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]]. ''Breviarium'', VII, 23:5.</ref> further renovation was initiated by Hadrian, while [[Septimius Severus]] ordered the necessary upkeep of the temple's structure.  Written records attest to the Serapeum's existence and ritual activity until the 5th century.\n\n===Quirinal Hill===\n[[File:Palazzo Colonna - Heemskerck.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of Palazzo Colonna (1534-1536) by Marten van Heemskerck showing the remains of the ancient Temple of Serapis.]]\n[[File:Tempio di Serapide Gregoriana 6.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Remains of the ancient Temple on the Quirinal hillside.]]\nThe temple built on [[Quirinal Hill]] and dedicated to Serapis was, by most surviving accounts, the most sumptuous and architectonically ambitious of those built on the hill; its remains are still visible between [[Palazzo Colonna]] and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]].\n\nThe sanctuary, which lay between today's ''piazza della Pilotta'' and the large square facing [[Quirinal Palace]], was built by [[Caracalla]] on the western slopes of the hill, covering over 13,000 m<sup>2</sup> (3.2 acres), as its sides measured 135 m by 98 m.<ref>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epiergebnis_it?p_belegstelle=CIL+06%2C+00570&r_sortierung=Belegstelle VI, 570].</ref>  It was composed by a long courtyard (surrounded by a [[colonnade]]) and by the ritual area, where statues and obelisks had been erected.  Designed to impress its visitors, the temple boasted columns {{convert|21.17|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter, visually sitting atop a marble stairway that connected the base of the hill to the sanctuary.\n\nAn enormous fragment of [[entablature]], weighing approximately 100 tons and 34 m<sup>3</sup> in volume (the largest in Rome), belongs to the original temple, as do the statues of the Nile and the [[Tiber]], moved by [[Michelangelo]] to the [[Capitoline Hill#Michelangelo|Capitoline Hill]] in front of the Senate building.<ref>Filippo Coarelli, ''Guida archeologica di Roma'', Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Verona 1984.</ref>\n\n===Hadrian's Villa===\n[[File:Canopus vanaf serapium.jpg|thumb|left|The canopus pool of [[Hadrian's Villa]] in [[Tivoli, Lazio]].]]\nEmperor Hadrian (117-138) ordered the construction of a \"canopus\" in his [[Hadrian's Villa|villa]] in Tivoli with typical imperial grandeur: an immense rectangular tank representing a canal, 119 m long by 18 m wide was surrounded by [[portico]]es and statues, leading the way to a Serapeum.<ref>Taylor, R.

There were several such religious centers, each of which was a ''serapeion'' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd}}) or, in its Latinized form, a ''serapeum''.

There are also signs of [[Harpocrates]]. It has been referred to as the daughter of the [[Library of Alexandria]]. It existed until the end of the fourth century AD.\n\n===Saqqara===\nThe [[Serapeum of Saqqara]] is located north west of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] at [[Saqqara]], a necropolis near [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in [[Lower Egypt]]. It was a burial place of the [[Apis (deity)|Apis]] bulls, [[sacred bull]]s that were incarnations of [[Ptah]]. It was believed that the bulls became immortal after death as Osiris-Apis, a name shortened to Serapis in the Hellenic period.\n\n===Canopus===\nAnother Serapeum was located at [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]], in the [[Nile Delta]] near Alexandria. This sanctuary, dedicated to [[Isis]] and her consort Serapis, became one of the most famous [[cult (religious practice)|cult centers]] of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]]. Its festivals and rites were so popular that the site became an architectural model for sanctuaries to the Egyptian gods throughout the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nAt this Graeco-Roman site, a sacred [[temenos]] enclosed the temple dedicated to the gods, which was located behind a [[propylaea]] or [[peristyle]] court.  Auxiliary shrines dedicated to other, less universal, Egyptian deities could be found here as well, including those dedicated to [[Anubis]] ([[Hermanubis]]), [[Hermes Trismegistus]], the syncretism of [[Thoth]] and [[Hermes]], Harpocrates, and others.  Ritual complexes dedicated to Isis were often built around a well or a spring, which was meant to represent the miraculous annual inundation of the Nile.  This was also the case in sanctuaries devoted to the Egyptian gods in Roman-era [[Delos]], where a central basin provided the water element central in the rites of Isis.\n\n==Serapea in Italy==\n\n===Regio tertia===\nThe ''[[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regio III]]'' within the city of Rome was named ''Isis et Serapis'' because it contained a temple dedicated to the two Egyptian deities.  The structure, originally dedicated to Isis alone, was built by [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] in the first half of the 1st century BCE to celebrate his father's victory over [[Jugurtha]].\n\nThe complex, of which only parts of the foundations remain, was originally terraced; during the [[Flavian dynasty]], it underwent major renovations, and the cult of Serapis was associated to that of Isis. The temple was finally demolished during the 6th century.\n\n===Campus Martius===\n{{Main|Temple of Isis and Serapis}}\nThis temple, dedicated to Isis and Serapis, was first dedicated by the triumvirs in 43 BCE<ref>[[Cassius Dio]]. ''Historia Romana'', XLVII, 15:4.</ref> in Rome. However, due to later tensions between Octavian (later Augustus Caesar) and Marc Antony, the temple was not built. Following the Battle at Actium, Augustus banned the religion from within the pomerium of Rome altogether.<ref>Moehring, Horst R. \u201cThe Persecution of the Jews and the Adherents of the Isis Cult at Rome AD 19\u201d Novum Testamentu 3.4 (1959): 294.</ref> The temple was finally built by Gaius Caligula on the area known as [[Campus Martius]], between the [[Saepta Julia]] and the [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|temple of Minerva]] c. 37-41 CE.<ref>Momigliano, Arnaldo. On Pagans, Jews, and Christians. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1987: 88.</ref>\n\nThe Serapeum, 240 m long and 60 m wide, was divided in three sections: a rectangular area could be accessed first by walking under monumental arches; an open square, adorned with red [[granite]] [[obelisk]]s brought to the city during the 1st century and erected in couples, followed.  The centre of the square was likely occupied by the temple dedicated to Isis, while the third section, a semicircular [[exedra]] with an [[apse]] presumably hosted the altar dedicated to Serapis.  Fragments of the obelisks, some quite large, have been found around the current church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva; some archaeologists have proposed that the obelisk facing the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] (see picture) may have been repositioned from the temple to its current location.\n\nThe building was destroyed in the great fire of the year 80 CE<ref>Cassius Dio. ''Historia Romana'', LXVI, 24:2.</ref> and rebuilt by [[Domitian]];<ref>[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]]. ''Breviarium'', VII, 23:5.</ref> further renovation was initiated by Hadrian, while [[Septimius Severus]] ordered the necessary upkeep of the temple's structure.  Written records attest to the Serapeum's existence and ritual activity until the 5th century.\n\n===Quirinal Hill===\n[[File:Palazzo Colonna - Heemskerck.jpg|thumb|left|Sketch of Palazzo Colonna (1534-1536) by Marten van Heemskerck showing the remains of the ancient Temple of Serapis.]]\n[[File:Tempio di Serapide Gregoriana 6.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Remains of the ancient Temple on the Quirinal hillside.]]\nThe temple built on [[Quirinal Hill]] and dedicated to Serapis was, by most surviving accounts, the most sumptuous and architectonically ambitious of those built on the hill; its remains are still visible between [[Palazzo Colonna]] and the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]].\n\nThe sanctuary, which lay between today's ''piazza della Pilotta'' and the large square facing [[Quirinal Palace]], was built by [[Caracalla]] on the western slopes of the hill, covering over 13,000 m<sup>2</sup> (3.2 acres), as its sides measured 135 m by 98 m.<ref>Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, [http://compute-in.ku-eichstaett.de:8888/pls/epigr/epiergebnis_it?p_belegstelle=CIL+06%2C+00570&r_sortierung=Belegstelle VI, 570].</ref>  It was composed by a long courtyard (surrounded by a [[colonnade]]) and by the ritual area, where statues and obelisks had been erected.  Designed to impress its visitors, the temple boasted columns {{convert|21.17|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter, visually sitting atop a marble stairway that connected the base of the hill to the sanctuary.\n\nAn enormous fragment of [[entablature]], weighing approximately 100 tons and 34 m<sup>3</sup> in volume (the largest in Rome), belongs to the original temple, as do the statues of the Nile and the [[Tiber]], moved by [[Michelangelo]] to the [[Capitoline Hill#Michelangelo|Capitoline Hill]] in front of the Senate building.<ref>Filippo Coarelli, ''Guida archeologica di Roma'', Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, Verona 1984.</ref>\n\n===Hadrian's Villa===\n[[File:Canopus vanaf serapium.jpg|thumb|left|The canopus pool of [[Hadrian's Villa]] in [[Tivoli, Lazio]].]]\nEmperor Hadrian (117-138) ordered the construction of a \"canopus\" in his [[Hadrian's Villa|villa]] in Tivoli with typical imperial grandeur: an immense rectangular tank representing a canal, 119 m long by 18 m wide was surrounded by [[portico]]es and statues, leading the way to a Serapeum.<ref>Taylor, R.
