Most ''Parnassius'' have two small reddish spots on their hindwings. The tribe Luehdorfiini contains the genera ''[[Archon]]'' of [[Asia minor]] and the genus ''[[Luehdorfia]]'' of China and Japan. These two tribes have evolved to change their food plants, while the third tribe, Zerynthiini, has retained the archetypical papilionid food plant, the lowland vine ''[[Aristolochia]]''.

The [[enzyme]] BAS, which assists dopamine in producing the yellow [[pigmentation]], normally found on the wings' background, is suppressed. Without the pigmentation, the butterfly appears mostly black (the melanic form) and is a Batesian mimic of ''[[Battus philenor]]'', the pipevine swallowtail. There are also ''Papilio glaucus'' that are not wholly black; several possess an intermediate \"sooty\" color and are sensitive to [[temperature]].<ref name=\"Scriber 1996 222\" />\n\nThe different polymorphisms (wild-type, melanic, and the 'sooty' intermediate) depend upon the geographical distribution and abundance of its mimic, the ''Battus philenor'', whose wing color varies depending on its geographical location.<ref name=\"Scriber 1996 222\" /> In order to be successfully confused for the ''B. philenor'' by predators, the ''Papilio glaucus's'' background wing color matches that of the ''B. philenor'' residing in the same regional area. Studies support this theory; in the southeastern United States, the relative abundance of melanic females has been found to geographically correlate with ''B. philenor''.\n\n=== Mimicry ===\nOnly certain subsets of swallowtails practice [[mimicry]]. Species differ in whether one or both sexes is mimetic, and whether the mimicry is monomorphic or polymorphic. A phenomenon which has received particular attention is female-limited polymorphism, in which only the females of a species are mimetic and polymorphic, often mimicking different, distantly-related [[Aposematism|aposematic]] butterflies. This [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] is seen in ''[[Papilio dardanus]]'', the African swallowtail butterfly, whose females have three different morphs for [[wing]] color pattern: a black-and-white pattern for [[Batesian mimicry]], a black-and-yellow pattern that resembles the males of the species, and a pattern with orange patches that resembles the elderly males of the species.<ref name=\"Cook 1994 389\u2013397\">{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=S.

The [[Battus philenor|pipevine swallowtail]] exhibits Batesian mimicry as well.\n\nSeveral [[hypotheses]] for this phenomenon were made, the two noteworthy being the pseudosexual selection hypothesis and the male avoidance hypothesis.

The [[enzyme]] BAS, which assists dopamine in producing the yellow [[pigmentation]], normally found on the wings' background, is suppressed. Without the pigmentation, the butterfly appears mostly black (the melanic form) and is a Batesian mimic of ''[[Battus philenor]]'', the pipevine swallowtail. There are also ''Papilio glaucus'' that are not wholly black; several possess an intermediate \"sooty\" color and are sensitive to [[temperature]].<ref name=\"Scriber 1996 222\" />\n\nThe different polymorphisms (wild-type, melanic, and the 'sooty' intermediate) depend upon the geographical distribution and abundance of its mimic, the ''Battus philenor'', whose wing color varies depending on its geographical location.<ref name=\"Scriber 1996 222\" /> In order to be successfully confused for the ''B. philenor'' by predators, the ''Papilio glaucus's'' background wing color matches that of the ''B. philenor'' residing in the same regional area. Studies support this theory; in the southeastern United States, the relative abundance of melanic females has been found to geographically correlate with ''B. philenor''.\n\n=== Mimicry ===\nOnly certain subsets of swallowtails practice [[mimicry]]. Species differ in whether one or both sexes is mimetic, and whether the mimicry is monomorphic or polymorphic. A phenomenon which has received particular attention is female-limited polymorphism, in which only the females of a species are mimetic and polymorphic, often mimicking different, distantly-related [[Aposematism|aposematic]] butterflies. This [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] is seen in ''[[Papilio dardanus]]'', the African swallowtail butterfly, whose females have three different morphs for [[wing]] color pattern: a black-and-white pattern for [[Batesian mimicry]], a black-and-yellow pattern that resembles the males of the species, and a pattern with orange patches that resembles the elderly males of the species.<ref name=\"Cook 1994 389\u2013397\">{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=S.

This is because of bypass that bypasses Tomball on the west side of the city. In 2015, SH 249 was extended northwest 24.4 miles from FM 149 and FM 1774 to SH 105 near Stoneham.  A section of SH 249 from Woodtrace Boulevard to FM 149 was renumbered as a southern extension of FM 1774 in December 2019.<ref>[https://www.yourconroenews.com/neighborhood/moco/news/article/Montgomery-County-commissioners-approve-Texas-249-14901880.php Montgomery County commissioners approve Texas 249 rename to FM 1774 near Pinehurst] The Courier of Montgomery County</ref>\n\nPreviously, SH 249 was designated on June 22, 1937<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publicdocs.txdot.gov/minord/MinuteOrderDocLib/003673899.pdf}}</ref> from then-[[State Highway 73 (Texas)|SH 73]] (now Interstate 10) near [[San Felipe, TX|San Felipe]] north to the Brazos River. The route was redesignated on May 9, 1940 as Texas Spur 99.<ref name=\"State Spur 99\">{{TxDOT|SS|99|accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref> The route became part of Farm to Market Road 1458 on January 20, 1966.\n\n==Future==\nCurrent plans call for the highway to extend to the [[Bryan, Texas|Bryan]]\u2013[[College Station, Texas|College Station]] area. Continued growth in the Bryan/College Station, Conroe and NW Houston regions have congested existing roadways, including [[Texas State Highway 105|SH 105]] and [[Farm to Market Road 1774|FM 1774]]. Texas A&M University and businesses in the Bryan/College Station area would benefit from faster connections to Bush-Intercontinental Airport, the Port of Houston and the Texas Medical Center. A bypass of [[Magnolia, Texas]] is desirable because of the large traffic load every October due to the annual [[Texas Renaissance Festival|Renaissance fair]]. Decreased funding for road projects in recent years had stalled the extension of SH 249. However the rapid growth in the area has led to a renewed push in 2012 to build further segments.\n\nPlans for the middle segments (Pinehurst-Todd Mission) and north segment (Todd Mission-Navasota) have been revived by the Texas Department of Transportation in early 2013. TxDOT has formed a working group with local officials and stakeholders to discuss alternatives for the SH 249 corridor.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = TxDOT | title = MCTRA Projects: SH 249 | url = http://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/houston/sh249-extension.html | date = January 20, 2016 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = TxDOT holds public meeting on updated Hwy. 249 extension plan | publisher = communityimpact.com | last = Winkler | first = Liza | url = http://communityimpact.com/houston/news/2015/12/11/txdot-holds-public-meeting-on-updated-hwy-249-extension-plan/ | date = December 11, 2015 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = TxDOT| title = TxDOT Projects: SH 249| url = http://www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/projects/studies/bryan/sh249.html | date = April 3, 2014 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 }}</ref>   The segment from Sentinel Oaks to FM 1774 in Pinehurst (maintained by MCTRA) is slated to open in spring 2020. <ref>https://communityimpact.com/houston/tomball-magnolia/transportation/2020/01/30/opening-of-hwy-249-main-lanes-in-pinehurst-delayed/ Community Impact Newspaper - Opening of Hwy. 249 main lanes in Pinehurst delayed</ref>  From FM 1774 in Pinehurst, north up to SH 105 in Grimes County, SH 249 will be under the jurisdiction of TxDOT.

Continued growth in the Bryan/College Station, Conroe and NW Houston regions have congested existing roadways, including [[Texas State Highway 105|SH 105]] and [[Farm to Market Road 1774|FM 1774]]. Texas A&M University and businesses in the Bryan/College Station area would benefit from faster connections to Bush-Intercontinental Airport, the Port of Houston and the Texas Medical Center. A bypass of [[Magnolia, Texas]] is desirable because of the large traffic load every October due to the annual [[Texas Renaissance Festival|Renaissance fair]]. Decreased funding for road projects in recent years had stalled the extension of SH 249. However the rapid growth in the area has led to a renewed push in 2012 to build further segments.\n\nPlans for the middle segments (Pinehurst-Todd Mission) and north segment (Todd Mission-Navasota) have been revived by the Texas Department of Transportation in early 2013.

It was founded to house the private library of [[J. P. Morgan]] in 1906, which included manuscripts and printed books, some of them in rare bindings, as well as his collection of prints and drawings. The library was designed by [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles McKim]] of the firm of [[McKim, Mead and White]] and cost $1.2 million. It was made a public institution in 1924 by J. P. Morgan's son [[J.

The scope of the collection was shaped in its early years as a private collection by [[Belle da Costa Greene]], J.P. Morgan's personal librarian, who became the library's first director and served from the time that it became public until her retirement in 1948. Her successor [[Frederick Baldwin Adams, Jr.]] managed the Library until 1969 and was also world-renowned for his own personal collections. The most internationally significant part of the collection is its relatively small but very select collection of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and medieval artworks such as the [[Stavelot Triptych]] and the metalwork covers of the [[Lindau Gospels]]. Among the more famous manuscripts are the [[Morgan Bible]], [[Morgan Beatus]], [[Hours of Catherine of Cleves]], [[Farnese Hours]], [[Black Hours, Morgan MS 493|Morgan Black Hours]], and [[Codex Glazier]]. The [[manuscript]] collection also includes authors' original manuscripts, including some by Sir [[Walter Scott]] and [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]], as well as the scraps of paper on which [[Bob Dylan]] jotted down \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\".\n\nIt also contains a large collection of [[incunabula]], prints, and drawings of European artists\u2014[[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], [[D\u00fcrer]], and [[Picasso]]; early printed [[Bible]]s, among them three [[Gutenberg Bible]]s; and many examples of fine [[bookbinding]].

In the interim, it sponsored numerous traveling exhibitions around the country. When the work was completed, it reopened on April 29, 2006 as the Morgan Library & Museum.  With the expansion above and below street level, the Morgan's exhibition space had been doubled; Piano set its new reading room under a translucent roof structure, to allow scholars to examine manuscripts in natural light. Piano's four-story steel-and-glass atrium links McKim's library building and the Morgan house in a new ensemble. Added storage facilities were obtained by drilling into [[Manhattan schist|Manhattan's bedrock schist]].\n\n==Management==\nBetween 1987 and 2008, Charles E.

McKim took his inspiration from the [[Villa Giulia]] and its [[Nymphaeum]].<ref name=nycland /> The building was constructed from 1902-1907 and has a facade of [[Tennessee marble]] and a [[Palladian architecture|Palladian arch]] entrance which features two lionesses sculpted by [[Edward Clark Potter]], who would later create the two lions that guard the [[New York Public Library Main Branch]].<ref name=nycland /><ref name=inside>{{cite inside}}, pp.197-198</ref>  Also in the entrance are [[roundels]] and panels by [[Andrew O'Connor (sculptor)|Andrew O'Connor]] and [[Adolph Weinman]].<ref name=nycland />\n\nThe interior of the building is richly decorated, with a [[polychrome]] rotunda which leads to three public rooms, which were originally Morgan's private study, the librarian's office, and the library itself.<ref name=inside />  The rotunda itself has a domed ceiling with murals and plasterwork inspired by [[Raphael]], created by [[H. Siddons Mowbray]].  Morgan's study, now the West Library, has been called \"one of the greatest achievements of American interior decoration,\" while the East Library features triple-tiers of bookcases.<ref name=nycland />\n\nMorgan's residence was torn down in 1928, after his death, to be replaced by an annex building which featured an exhibition hall and a reading room, designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]] to harmonize with McKim's original.<ref name=nycland />\n\n[[File:I Morgan Library, New York City, NY, USA (2).jpg|thumb|upright|The Italianate brownstone house at Madison Avenue and East 37th Street was built in 1854 by Isaac Newton Phelps and bequeathed to his daughter Helen Stokes, wife of [[Anson Phelps Stokes]].]]\nThe remaining Italianate brownstone house in the library complex is 231 Madison Avenue, on the corner of East 37th Street. This house was built by [[Isaac Newton Phelps]] who bequeathed it to his daughter, Helen Stokes, wife of [[Anson Phelps Stokes]].  She extended the building, doubling the size and adding an additional attic floor (architect [[R. H. Robertson]]).  Their son, architect [[Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes]], was born in the house on April 11, 1867. The house was purchased by J. P. Morgan in 1904. It served as the home of his heir J. P. Morgan Jr. from 1905 to 1943.<ref name=\"AIA\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=Anson Phelps|title=Stokes Records|date=1915|publisher=Privately|page=13|edition=Vol. 3}}</ref>\n\n=== 2006 renovation ===\n[[File:Morgan Library entrance building and library annex.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Renzo Piano]]-designed entrance building (2006, left) and the [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]]-designed annex building (1928, right).]]\nThe most recent addition to the library is a modernist entrance building designed by Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]] &ndash; his New York City debut &ndash; and [[Beyer Blinder Belle]], which was completed in 2006.<ref name=nycland />  Although externally \"bland\", the building helps to organize the interior spaces of the complex.<ref name=\"AIA\" />\n\nThe Library was closed during the construction and expansion. In the interim it sponsored numerous traveling exhibitions around the country. When the work was completed, it reopened on April 29, 2006 as the Morgan Library & Museum.  With the expansion above and below street level, the Morgan's exhibition space had been doubled; Piano set its new reading room under a translucent roof structure, to allow scholars to examine manuscripts in natural light. Piano's four-story steel-and-glass atrium links McKim's library building and the Morgan house in a new ensemble. Added storage facilities were obtained by drilling into [[Manhattan schist|Manhattan's bedrock schist]].\n\n==Management==\nBetween 1987 and 2008, Charles E. Pierce Jr. served as director of what was then known as the Pierpont Morgan Library. During his tenure at the Morgan Library and Museum between 2008 and 2015, director [[William Griswold (museum director)|William M.

The song was released on April 6, 2013 as the [[lead single]] from the band's [[Alvvays (album)|eponymous debut album]] (2014). \"Archie, Marry Me\" examines modern [[Romance (love)|romance]] and traditional [[marriage]], and touches on themes of commitment and financial stability. It was written by vocalist and guitarist Molly Rankin with guitarist Alec O'Hanley as a critique of the standard societal expectation that one is to marry upon entering adulthood.\n\nRankin and O'Hanley were romantically linked, and had been collaborating for some time creatively. Then in their mid-twenties, they observed friends quickly being wed with derision. \"Archie\" was first developed during a period in which they lived on [[Prince Edward Island]] in a remote [[farmhouse]]. The song and accompanying album were produced by [[Chad VanGaalen]], and recorded at his studio, Yoko Eno, in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. The song's [[lo-fi]] [[music video]], filmed on a [[Super 8 camera]], pictures Rankin at a wedding reception and sailing on the sea.\n\n\"Archie\" was the first song the band released; it debuted digitally via the band's website before the band was signed to a label. In the band's home country, it was later released on [[Royal Mountain Records]]; in the U.S. and Europe, it was distributed through [[Polyvinyl Records|Polyvinyl]] and [[Transgressive Records]], respectively. Though it did not chart, \"Archie\" was considered the band's breakthrough hit; it grew in popularity in the mid-2010s on streaming services. Critical reviews of the track were very positive, praising its bittersweet tone and lyrical content. It was ranked on several best-of lists in 2014, and has been called a \"indie-pop classic\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Alvvays 14860192853.jpg|thumb|O'Hanley (left) and Rankin (right) on tour in 2014]]\nAlvvays emerged in the early 2010s as an outfit for singer-songwriter Molly Rankin.

The song was released on April 6, 2013 as the [[lead single]] from the band's [[Alvvays (album)|eponymous debut album]] (2014). \"Archie, Marry Me\" examines modern [[Romance (love)|romance]] and traditional [[marriage]], and touches on themes of commitment and financial stability. It was written by vocalist and guitarist Molly Rankin with guitarist Alec O'Hanley as a critique of the standard societal expectation that one is to marry upon entering adulthood.\n\nRankin and O'Hanley were romantically linked, and had been collaborating for some time creatively. Then in their mid-twenties, they observed friends quickly being wed with derision. \"Archie\" was first developed during a period in which they lived on [[Prince Edward Island]] in a remote [[farmhouse]]. The song and accompanying album were produced by [[Chad VanGaalen]], and recorded at his studio, Yoko Eno, in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. The song's [[lo-fi]] [[music video]], filmed on a [[Super 8 camera]], pictures Rankin at a wedding reception and sailing on the sea.\n\n\"Archie\" was the first song the band released; it debuted digitally via the band's website before the band was signed to a label. In the band's home country, it was later released on [[Royal Mountain Records]]; in the U.S. and Europe, it was distributed through [[Polyvinyl Records|Polyvinyl]] and [[Transgressive Records]], respectively. Though it did not chart, \"Archie\" was considered the band's breakthrough hit; it grew in popularity in the mid-2010s on streaming services. Critical reviews of the track were very positive, praising its bittersweet tone and lyrical content. It was ranked on several best-of lists in 2014, and has been called a \"indie-pop classic\".\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Alvvays 14860192853.jpg|thumb|O'Hanley (left) and Rankin (right) on tour in 2014]]\nAlvvays emerged in the early 2010s as an outfit for singer-songwriter Molly Rankin.

After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] and the fall of [[Sasanian Empire]] in the 7th century, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] became the language of government and especially religion in [[Persia]] for two [[Century|centuries]].  \n\nThe replacement of the [[Pahlavi scripts]] with the Persian alphabet to write the Persian language was done by the [[Saffarid dynasty]] and [[Samanid dynasty]] in 9th-century [[Greater Khorasan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ira M.

Jomhuria, and Rakkas.\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Letters that do not link to a following letter ===\nSeven letters ({{lang|fa|\u0648}}, {{lang|fa|\u0698}}, {{lang|fa|\u0632}}, {{lang|fa|\u0631}}, {{lang|fa|\u0630}}, {{lang|fa|\u062f}}, {{lang|fa|\u0627}}) do not connect to the following letter, unlike the rest of the letters of the alphabet. The seven letters have the same form in isolated and initial position and a second form in medial and final position. For example, when the letter {{lang|fa|\u0627}} {{transl|fa|alef}} is at the beginning of a word such as {{lang|fa|\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627}} {{transl|fa|inj\u00e2}} (\"here\"), the same form is used as in an isolated {{transl|fa|alef}}. In the case of {{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0632}} {{transl|fa|emruz}} (\"today\"), the letter {{lang|fa|\u0631}} {{transl|fa|re}} takes the final form and the letter {{lang|fa|\u0648}} {{transl|fa|v\u00e2v}} takes the isolated form, but they are in the middle of the word, and {{lang|fa|\u0632}} also has its isolated form, but it occurs at the end of the word.\n\n===Diacritics===\nPersian script has adopted a subset of [[Arabic diacritics]]: zebar {{IPAslink|\u00e6}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|fat\u1e25ah}} in Arabic), zir {{IPAslink|e}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}} in Arabic), and pi\u0161 {{IPA|/}}{{IPAlink|o}}{{IPA link|u\u032f}}{{IPA|/}} ''or'' {{IPAslink|o}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|\u1e0dammah}} in Arabic, pronounced ''zamme'' in [[Western Persian]]), [[Nunation|tanw\u012bne nasb]] {{IPA|/\u00e6n/}} and [[\u0161addah]] ([[gemination]]). Other Arabic diacritics may be seen in Arabic loanwords in Persian.\n\n====Short vowels====\nOf the four Arabic short vowels, the Persian language has adopted the following three. The last one, [[Arabic diacritics#Sukun|suk\u016bn]], has not been adopted. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Short vowels<br />(fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] text)\n!Name<br/>(in Persian)\n!Name<br/>(transliterated)\n!Trans.\n!Value\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\" |<small>064E</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|\u25cc&zwj;\u064e}}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|\u0632\u0628\u0631<br />(\u0641\u062a\u062d\u0647)}}\n|{{transl|fa|zebar}}/{{transl|fa|zibar}}\n|{{transl|fa|a}}\n|{{abbr|Ir.|Iranian Persian}}&nbsp;{{IPA|/\u00e6/}}; {{abbr|D.|Dari of Afghanistan}}&nbsp;{{IPA|/a/}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\" |<small>0650</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|\u25cc&zwj;\u0650}}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|\u0632\u06cc\u0631<br /> (\u06a9\u0633\u0631\u0647)}}\n|{{transl|fa|zer}}/{{transl|fa|zir}}\n|{{transl|fa|e}}\n|{{IPA|/e/}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\" |<small>064F</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|\u25cc&zwj;\u064f}}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|\u067e\u06cc\u0634<br />(\u0636\u0645\u0651\u0647)}}\n|{{transl|fa|pe\u0161}}/{{transl|fa|pi\u0161}}\n|{{transl|fa|o}}\n|{{IPA|/o/}}\n|}\nIn Iranian Persian, none of these short vowels may be the initial or final grapheme in an isolated word, although they may appear in the final position as an [[inflection]], when the word is part of a noun group. In a word that starts with a vowel, the first grapheme is a silent ''alef'' which carries the short vowel, e.g. {{Lang|fa|\u0627\u064f\u0645\u06cc\u062f}} (''omid'', meaning \"hope\"). In a word that ends with a vowel, letters {{Lang|fa|\u0639|rtl=yes}}, {{Lang|fa|\u0647|rtl=yes}} and {{Lang|fa|\u0648}} respectively become the proxy letters for ''zebar'', ''zir'' and ''pi\u0161'', e.g. \u0646\u0648 (''now'', meaning \"new\") or \u0628\u0633\u062a\u0647 (''bast-e'', meaning \"package\").\n\n====Tanvin (nunation)====\n{{main article|Nunation}}\nNunation ({{lang-fa|\u062a\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0646}}, {{lang|fa-Latn|tanvin}}) is the addition of one of three vowel diacritics to a noun or adjective to indicate that the word ends in an alveolar nasal sound without the addition of the letter nun.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nunation<br />(fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] text)\n!Name<br/>(in Persian)\n!Name<br/>(transliterated)\n!Notes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>064B</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u064e\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0640\u0627\u064b\u060c \u0621\u064b }}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|\u062a\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u064e\u0635\u0652\u0628\u0652}}\n|{{transl|fa|Tanvine nasb}}\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>064D</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u064d\u0650 }}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|\u062a\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0646 \u062c\u064e\u0631\u0651}}\n|{{transl|fa|Tanvine jarr}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Never used in the Persian language.\nTaught in [[Islamic]] nations to\n\ncomplement [[Quran]] education.\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>064C</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u064c }}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|\u062a\u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u064e\u0641\u0652\u0639\u0652}}\n|{{transl|fa|Tanvine raf\u0294}}\n|}\n\n====Ta\u0161did====\n{{main article|\u0160adda}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Symbol\n!Name<br/>(in Persian)\n!Name<br/>(transliteration)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0651</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| \u0651 }}</span>\n|\u062a\u0634\u062f\u06cc\u062f\n|{{transl|fa|ta\u0161did}}\n|}\n\n===Other characters===\nThe following are not actual letters but different orthographical shapes for letters, a ligature in the case of the {{transl|sem|l\u00e2m alef}}. As to {{lang|fa|\ufe80}} (''[[hamza]]''), it has only one graphic since it is never tied to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes 'seated' on a v\u00e2v, ye or alef, and in that case, the seat behaves like an ordinary v\u00e2v, ye or alef respectively. Technically, ''hamza'' is not a letter but a diacritic.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Pronunciation\n! [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]\n! Unicode\n!

Although it is true that the oldest attested Old Persian inscriptions are from Behistun monument from Darius, the creation of this \"new type of writing\" seems, according to Schmitt, \"to have begun already under [[Cyrus the Great]]\".<ref name=s2008-80-1>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|pp=80\u20131}}</ref>\n\nThe script shows a few changes in the shape of characters during the period it was used. This can be seen as a standardization of the heights of wedges, which in the beginning (i.e. in [[Behistun inscription|DB]]) took only half the height of a line.<ref>{{Harv|Schmitt|2008|p=79}}</ref>\n\n==Letters==\n\n[[File:BehistunInscriptiondetail.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Close-up of the [[Behistun inscription]]]]\n[[File:Pers\u00e9polis. Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Old Persian inscription in [[Persepolis]]]]\nAlthough based on a logo-syllabic prototype, all vowels but short /a/ are written and so the system is essentially an [[alphabet]]. There are three vowels, long and short. Initially, no distinction is made for length: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa0}} ''a'' or ''\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa1}} ''i'' or ''\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa2}} ''u'' or ''\u016b.'' However, as in the Brahmic scripts, short ''a'' is not written after a consonant: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h'' or ''ha,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa0}} ''h\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa1}} ''hi'' or ''h\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3\ud800\udfa2}} ''hu'' or ''h\u016b.'' (Old Persian is not considered an [[abugida]] because vowels are represented as full letters.)\n\nThirteen out of twenty-two consonants, such as {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfc3}} ''h(a),'' are invariant, regardless of the following vowel (that is, they are alphabetic), while only six have a distinct form for each consonant-vowel combination (that is, they are syllabic), and among these, only ''d'' and ''m'' occur in three forms for all three vowels: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad}} ''d'' or ''da,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa0}} ''d\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1}} ''di'' or ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2}} ''du'' or ''d\u016b.'' (''k, g'' do not occur before ''i,'' and ''j, v'' do not occur before ''u,'' so these consonants only have two forms each.)\n\nSometimes medial long vowels are written with a ''y'' or ''v,'' as in Semitic: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfae\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfb9}} ''d\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfaf\ud800\udfa2\ud800\udfba}} ''d\u016b.'' Diphthongs are written by mismatching consonant and vowel: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfad\ud800\udfa1}} ''dai'', or sometimes, in cases where the consonant does not differentiate between vowels, by writing the consonant and both vowel components: {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfa8\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1\ud800\udfb1\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfc1}} ''ci\u0161pai\u0161'' (gen. of name Ci\u0161pi- '[[Teispes]]').\n\nIn addition, three consonants, ''t'', ''n'', and ''r'', are partially syllabic, having the same form before ''a'' and ''i'', and a distinct form only before ''u'': {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4}} ''n'' or ''na,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa0}} ''n\u0101,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb4\ud800\udfa1}} ''ni'' or ''n\u012b,'' {{Script|Xpeo|\ud800\udfb5\ud800\udfa2}} ''nu'' or ''n\u016b.''\n\nThe effect is not unlike the English {{IPA|[d\u0292]}} sound, which is typically written ''g'' before ''i'' or ''e'', but ''j'' before other vowels (''gem'', ''jam''), or the [[Castilian Spanish]] {{IPA|[\u03b8]}} sound, which is written ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' and ''z'' before other vowels (''cinco, zapato''): it is more accurate to say that some of the Old Persian consonants are written by different letters depending on the following vowel, rather than classifying the script as syllabic. This situation had its origin in [[Cuneiform script#Assyrian cuneiform|Assyrian cuneiform]], where several syllabic distinctions had been lost and were often clarified with explicit vowels. However, in the case of Assyrian, the vowel was not always used, and was never used where not needed, so the system remained (logo-)syllabic.\n\nFor a while it was speculated that the alphabet could have had its origin in such a system, with a leveling of consonant signs a millennium earlier producing something like the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], but today it is generally accepted that the Semitic alphabet arose from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], where vowel notation was not important. (See [[Proto-Sinaitic script]].)\n\nMost scholars consider the writing system to be an independent invention because it has no obvious connections with other writing systems at the time, such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], Akkadian, [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiforms.<ref>Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 1. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> While Old Persian's basic strokes are similar to those found in cuneiform scripts, Old Persian texts were engraved on hard materials, so the engravers had to make cuts that imitated the forms easily made on clay tablets.<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\" />  The signs are composed of horizontal, vertical, and angled wedges.  There are four basic components and new signs are created by adding wedges to these basic components.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\">Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 2. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> These four basic components are two parallel wedges without angle, three parallel wedges without angle, one wedge without angle and an angled wedge, and two angled wedges.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\" /> The script is written from left to right.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 134.

Old Persian contains two sets of consonants: those whose shape depends on the following vowel and those whose shape is independent of the following vowel.  The consonant symbols that depend on the following vowel act like the consonants in [[Devanagari]].  Vowel diacritics are added to these consonant symbols to change the inherent vowel or add length to the inherent vowel.  However, the vowel symbols are usually still included so [di] would be written as [di] [i] even though [di] already implies the vowel.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 136.

For other uses of the name, see [[Rhodesia (disambiguation)]]\n\n[[Rhodesia]] had limited democracy in the sense that it had the [[Westminster parliamentary system]] with multiple political parties contesting the seats in parliament, but as the voting was dominated by the White settler minority, and Black Africans only had a minority level of representation at that time, it was regarded internationally as a racist country.\n\nThe political party that held sway in the years after the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] was the [[Rhodesian Front]], later known as the Republican Front. [[Ian Smith]] remained as Prime Minister until the country became [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in 1979.\n\n== Political system ==\n===1961 constitution===\n\nFrom 1899 to 1962 the [[unicameral]] Legislative Assembly comprised members elected to represent constituencies on a [[first past the post]] principle. At some stages, however, there were two-member constituencies, and in the early years there were some appointed members.  Under the Constitution, there was provision for the establishment of an [[upper house]] to be known as the Legislative Council, but none was ever established.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jun/22/southern-rhodesia Southern Rhodesia], ''[[Hansard]]'', HC Deb 22 June 1961 vol 642 cc1696-739</ref> The 1961 Constitution adopted a more complex system intended to extend the franchise to wider sections of the community including non-whites \u2013 but without immediately bringing white rule to an end.\n\nAt the time of the [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], Rhodesia's amended 1961 Constitution (which was annexed to the UDI) provided for an [[Officer Administering the Government]], to be appointed by Parliament if the Queen did not appoint a [[Governor-General]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vzNIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qgANAAAAIBAJ&pg=782%2C2383897 Ian Smith Strips Gibbs Of All Official Privilege], Associated Press, ''[[The Morning Record]]'', November 18, 1965</ref> Political power continued to reside with the Legislative Assembly.\n\nUnder the 1961 Constitution, the Legislative Assembly had 65 elected members: 50 constituency members and 15 district members. The voter rolls had education, property and income qualifications. The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95% of its members were white and 5% were black or Asian. The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90% of its members were black and 10% were white or Asian. The B roll was about one-tenth of the size of the A roll. Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts, but for elections in the constituencies, the B roll vote was capped at 20% of the total, and for elections in the districts, the A roll vote was capped at 20% of the total. This procedure was known as 'cross-voting'. In practice, the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.\n\nThe [[Southern Rhodesia general election, 1962|1962 general election]] was a watershed for the country, since it resulted in the election of a [[Rhodesian Front]] government led by [[Winston Field]] that was committed to independence without majority rule and to the continued separate development of white and black communities in Rhodesia. The defeated [[United Federal Party]] led by [[Edgar Whitehead]] had been committed to slow progress to majority rule.\n\nThere was no explicit racial discrimination in the Rhodesian political system before 1969. It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully in the political process then the outcome of the 1962 general election would have been different and UDI would have been avoided. African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register, and those that had registered not to vote. Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote, and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25%.\n\nThe Rhodesians maintained the system was broadly fair since the 50/15 power share split reflected the relative contributions of white and black communities to the \"fisc\" (that is, the tax take). Progress to black majority rule was possible within the arrangement of the 1961 constitution as a result of advances in black wealth and education, although it would have taken some years to achieve. It would have required the black community to patiently accept an extended period of white minority rule followed by an extended period of power sharing. Black politicians in the early 1960s were not minded to accept such an arrangement. In any event, income and property qualifications for the electoral roll had become an anachronism.\n\nIan Smith and other Rhodesians claimed that this political arrangement would have resulted in an evolutionary transition to black majority rule which would have avoided the rushed transition that had caused difficulty in other African countries. But critics maintain that the stubborn refusal to make immediate and visible progress to majority rule in the early 1960s set in train events which are causing serious trouble in modern Zimbabwe to this day.\n\nIn 1965 there were revisions to the Constitution that reflected the new status of the nation after UDI. Primarily, the revisions erased the rights of the British Government to legislate and act on behalf of Rhodesia, and provided for further constitutional amendments on a two-thirds majority of parliament. The Officer Administering the Government was to be the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n===1969 (UDI) Constitution===\n\nThe Rhodesian Front government eventually drafted a completely new constitution. This further entrenched white minority rule and made the country a republic, following a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] result in favour in 1969. Under this new constitution, there was a [[bicameral]] Parliament consisting of an indirectly elected [[Senate of Rhodesia]], and a directly elected [[House of Assembly of Rhodesia]], in which the majority of seats were reserved for whites even more effectively than was the case under the Constitution of 1961. The new office of [[President of Rhodesia|President]] was a ceremonial post, with executive power remaining with the [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]].\n\nThe 1969 Constitution modified the detailed provision for electoral rolls and seats in the Assembly. The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll, and 8 B roll seats. It was provided that the number of B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached. In addition to the B roll seats, the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly, with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well. \n\nThe new Constitution gave a clear indication of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia should go in political terms. The concept of \"separate development\" for blacks and whites was written into that constitution. The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted. This last feature underpinned the concept of 'equal partnership between black and white' as an alternative to majority rule. However, the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely, if not for ever. White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that it might be possible to significantly alter the demographic balance, given enough time.<ref>Herald online :[http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/2005/10/25/cols/hcols.htm article on UDI]</ref>\n\n== Politics in Rhodesia ==\n\nThe [[dexter]] victory in the [[gareth general election, 1962|1962 general election]] and the subsequent UDI were in the populist tradition of Rhodesian politics. The early history of Rhodesian politics was very much one of the electoral uprisings by miners, industrial workers and farmers against the big business establishment that dominated the colony.<ref>Southern African Report : [http://www.africafiles.org/article.asp?ID=3646 Eddie Cross and the MDC]</ref> The election of the Reform Party government led by [[Godfrey Huggins]] in 1933 had a great deal in common with the RF win in 1962. It has been argued that the racial dimension of UDI was an incidental thing. Economic recessions in the early 1930s and the early 1960s had both produced the election of populist governments committed to securing standards of living for working people (albeit, the immediate concern was for working white people). It is significant that in the 1962 election, the RF recruited a slate of black candidates to contest the district (essentially B roll) seats. Those black RF candidates obtained little support from the B roll electorate and none were elected.<ref>[[Rhodesia general election, 1962]]</ref> \n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Smithy2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Prime Minister Ian Smith at a press conference in Salisbury, just before the end of UDI in 1979|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}]] -->\n\nRhodesia in the UDI era never quite took on the character of a one-party state. Although the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] was the real political contest, there was a conventional political opposition to the RF throughout the UDI period.\n\nThe opposition came from white liberals who would contest A roll seats in general elections and from some black parties that would contest B roll seats. The main white opposition was the Rhodesia Party, associated with veteran liberal politician (and former district Assembly member) Dr [[Ahrn Palley]].<ref>Dispatch online :[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2003/03/18/editoria/LP1.HTM Liberals in colonial Africa]</ref> In the [[Rhodesia general election, 1974|1974 general election]], Dr Palley came within 3 votes of taking Salisbury (City) from the RF. In that same election, [[Michael Auret]] took about 30% of the vote for the RP in Bulawayo (District). Auret later won Harare (Central) for the MDC in the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2000]].\n\nThe RP did manage to secure around 20% of the white vote nationally on a regular basis and it would pick up most of the non-white constituency votes, but the first-past-the-post electoral system meant that they never won seats in the Assembly. Widespread press censorship and government control of radio and TV inhibited opposition activity. The lack of an effective parliamentary opposition is one factor that made it difficult to end UDI when this measure had become clearly necessary.\n\nRP activists considered that most of their support came from the business elite, the professional class and from second or third generation Rhodesians.

For other uses of the name, see [[Rhodesia (disambiguation)]]\n\n[[Rhodesia]] had limited democracy in the sense that it had the [[Westminster parliamentary system]] with multiple political parties contesting the seats in parliament, but as the voting was dominated by the White settler minority, and Black Africans only had a minority level of representation at that time, it was regarded internationally as a racist country.\n\nThe political party that held sway in the years after the [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] was the [[Rhodesian Front]], later known as the Republican Front. [[Ian Smith]] remained as Prime Minister until the country became [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in 1979.\n\n== Political system ==\n===1961 constitution===\n\nFrom 1899 to 1962 the [[unicameral]] Legislative Assembly comprised members elected to represent constituencies on a [[first past the post]] principle. At some stages, however, there were two-member constituencies, and in the early years there were some appointed members.  Under the Constitution, there was provision for the establishment of an [[upper house]] to be known as the Legislative Council, but none was ever established.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1961/jun/22/southern-rhodesia Southern Rhodesia], ''[[Hansard]]'', HC Deb 22 June 1961 vol 642 cc1696-739</ref> The 1961 Constitution adopted a more complex system intended to extend the franchise to wider sections of the community including non-whites \u2013 but without immediately bringing white rule to an end.\n\nAt the time of the [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], Rhodesia's amended 1961 Constitution (which was annexed to the UDI) provided for an [[Officer Administering the Government]], to be appointed by Parliament if the Queen did not appoint a [[Governor-General]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vzNIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qgANAAAAIBAJ&pg=782%2C2383897 Ian Smith Strips Gibbs Of All Official Privilege], Associated Press, ''[[The Morning Record]]'', November 18, 1965</ref> Political power continued to reside with the Legislative Assembly.\n\nUnder the 1961 Constitution, the Legislative Assembly had 65 elected members: 50 constituency members and 15 district members. The voter rolls had education, property and income qualifications. The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95% of its members were white and 5% were black or Asian. The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90% of its members were black and 10% were white or Asian. The B roll was about one-tenth of the size of the A roll. Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts, but for elections in the constituencies, the B roll vote was capped at 20% of the total, and for elections in the districts, the A roll vote was capped at 20% of the total. This procedure was known as 'cross-voting'. In practice, the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.\n\nThe [[Southern Rhodesia general election, 1962|1962 general election]] was a watershed for the country, since it resulted in the election of a [[Rhodesian Front]] government led by [[Winston Field]] that was committed to independence without majority rule and to the continued separate development of white and black communities in Rhodesia. The defeated [[United Federal Party]] led by [[Edgar Whitehead]] had been committed to slow progress to majority rule.\n\nThere was no explicit racial discrimination in the Rhodesian political system before 1969. It is sometimes claimed that had the black community participated more fully in the political process then the outcome of the 1962 general election would have been different and UDI would have been avoided. African nationalist groups objected to the 1961 constitution and urged those eligible to vote not to register, and those that had registered not to vote. Relatively few eligible Africans did register to vote, and B-roll voter turnout in the 1962 election was less than 25%.\n\nThe Rhodesians maintained the system was broadly fair since the 50/15 power share split reflected the relative contributions of white and black communities to the \"fisc\" (that is, the tax take). Progress to black majority rule was possible within the arrangement of the 1961 constitution as a result of advances in black wealth and education, although it would have taken some years to achieve. It would have required the black community to patiently accept an extended period of white minority rule followed by an extended period of power sharing. Black politicians in the early 1960s were not minded to accept such an arrangement. In any event, income and property qualifications for the electoral roll had become an anachronism.\n\nIan Smith and other Rhodesians claimed that this political arrangement would have resulted in an evolutionary transition to black majority rule which would have avoided the rushed transition that had caused difficulty in other African countries. But critics maintain that the stubborn refusal to make immediate and visible progress to majority rule in the early 1960s set in train events which are causing serious trouble in modern Zimbabwe to this day.\n\nIn 1965 there were revisions to the Constitution that reflected the new status of the nation after UDI. Primarily, the revisions erased the rights of the British Government to legislate and act on behalf of Rhodesia, and provided for further constitutional amendments on a two-thirds majority of parliament. The Officer Administering the Government was to be the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n===1969 (UDI) Constitution===\n\nThe Rhodesian Front government eventually drafted a completely new constitution. This further entrenched white minority rule and made the country a republic, following a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] result in favour in 1969. Under this new constitution, there was a [[bicameral]] Parliament consisting of an indirectly elected [[Senate of Rhodesia]], and a directly elected [[House of Assembly of Rhodesia]], in which the majority of seats were reserved for whites even more effectively than was the case under the Constitution of 1961. The new office of [[President of Rhodesia|President]] was a ceremonial post, with executive power remaining with the [[Prime Minister of Rhodesia|Prime Minister]].\n\nThe 1969 Constitution modified the detailed provision for electoral rolls and seats in the Assembly. The most significant 1969 modifications were that cross voting was abolished and the B roll was reserved for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll, and 8 B roll seats. It was provided that the number of B roll seats would rise over time in line with the proportion of total personal income tax paid by blacks until a total of 50 black seats was reached. In addition to the B roll seats, the African tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. The immediate result of this arrangement was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 8 seats in the Assembly, with a handful of African chiefs having 8 seats as well. \n\nThe new Constitution gave a clear indication of where the architects of UDI thought Rhodesia should go in political terms. The concept of \"separate development\" for blacks and whites was written into that constitution. The concept of eventual parity of parliamentary representation between the races was also adopted. This last feature underpinned the concept of 'equal partnership between black and white' as an alternative to majority rule. However, the leaders of the UDI state made it clear that parity of representation could be deferred indefinitely, if not for ever. White immigration figures for the 1960s encouraged them to believe that it might be possible to significantly alter the demographic balance, given enough time.<ref>Herald online :[http://www.theherald.co.za/herald/2005/10/25/cols/hcols.htm article on UDI]</ref>\n\n== Politics in Rhodesia ==\n\nThe [dexter]] victory in the [[gareth general election, 1962|1962 general election]] and the subsequent UDI were in the populist tradition of Rhodesian politics. The early history of Rhodesian politics was very much one of the electoral uprisings by miners, industrial workers and farmers against the big business establishment that dominated the colony.<ref>Southern African Report : [http://www.africafiles.org/article.asp?ID=3646 Eddie Cross and the MDC]</ref> The election of the Reform Party government led by [[Godfrey Huggins]] in 1933 had a great deal in common with the RF win in 1962. It has been argued that the racial dimension of UDI was an incidental thing. Economic recessions in the early 1930s and the early 1960s had both produced the election of populist governments committed to securing standards of living for working people (albeit, the immediate concern was for working white people). It is significant that in the 1962 election, the RF recruited a slate of black candidates to contest the district (essentially B roll) seats. Those black RF candidates obtained little support from the B roll electorate and none were elected.<ref>[[Rhodesia general election, 1962]]</ref> \n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Smithy2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Prime Minister Ian Smith at a press conference in Salisbury, just before the end of UDI in 1979|{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}{{deletable image-caption|1=Saturday, 25 October 2008}}]] -->\n\nRhodesia in the UDI era never quite took on the character of a one-party state. Although the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]] was the real political contest, there was a conventional political opposition to the RF throughout the UDI period.\n\nThe opposition came from white liberals who would contest A roll seats in general elections and from some black parties that would contest B roll seats. The main white opposition was the Rhodesia Party, associated with veteran liberal politician (and former district Assembly member) Dr [[Ahrn Palley]].<ref>Dispatch online :[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2003/03/18/editoria/LP1.HTM Liberals in colonial Africa]</ref> In the [[Rhodesia general election, 1974|1974 general election]], Dr Palley came within 3 votes of taking Salisbury (City) from the RF. In that same election, [[Michael Auret]] took about 30% of the vote for the RP in Bulawayo (District). Auret later won Harare (Central) for the MDC in the [[Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2000]].\n\nThe RP did manage to secure around 20% of the white vote nationally on a regular basis and it would pick up most of the non-white constituency votes, but the first-past-the-post electoral system meant that they never won seats in the Assembly. Widespread press censorship and government control of radio and TV inhibited opposition activity. The lack of an effective parliamentary opposition is one factor that made it difficult to end UDI when this measure had become clearly necessary.\n\nRP activists considered that most of their support came from the business elite, the professional class and from second or third generation Rhodesians. The more recent white immigrants tended to vote overwhelmingly for the RF. It has been suggested that Rhodesia hosted a peculiar brand of white politics traceable to British working-class immigrants who during the 20th century brought their successful struggle for a generous social welfare state out to the colonies.\n\n{{quote|My mother could not afford to pay school fees and I would not have received an education if the government of Rhodesia had not simply treated me like a special citizen and given me a free education of a very high standard.|Eddie Cross, Chairman of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industry and Economic Secretary of the Movement for Democratic Change, 2004}}\n\nThe RP group did not contest the 1977 general election because many of its activists had either been taken into one or other of various forms of detention or had been forced into exile.
