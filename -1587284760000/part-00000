It is being replaced as the [[service rifle]] of the [[Military of France|French military]] by the [[Heckler & Koch HK416|HK416F]]. It is known by French troops as ''Le Clairon'' (The [[Bugle]]) due to its distinctive shape. The FR 5.56 is recognized for its high rate of fire at 1,100 rounds per minute.\n\n==History==\nThe first French bullpup rifles were developed between 1946 and 1950 at the AME (''Atelier M\u00e9canique de Mulhouse'') and MAS, testing rounds such as [[.30 US Carbine]], [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]], [[7.65\u00d738mm]] (Made by ''Cartoucherie de Valence'') and some other intermediate calibers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Since France was engaged in the [[First Indochina War]] at the time, and was also the second-largest contributor to [[NATO]], the research budgets for new types of weapons were limited and priority was given to the modernization and production of existing service weapons. Nevertheless, approximately forty different [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] calibre prototype rifles were developed between 1952 and 1962, most notably the [[FA-MAS Type 62]]. However, the United States adoption of the [[M16 rifle]] and [[5.56\u00d745mm]] cartridge caused the French to rethink their approach, and consequently the Type 62 was not adopted.<ref>http://talks.guns.ru/forums/icons/forum_pictures/004217/4217682.jpg</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-1955 |title=French MAS Type 1955 |publisher=Forgotten Weapons |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617074513/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-1955 |archive-date=17 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-62 |title=French MAS Type 62 |publisher=Forgotten Weapons |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617074519/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-62 |archive-date=17 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.securityarms.com/20010315/galleryfiles/3000/3005.htm |title=FA-MAS Type 62 |publisher=Securityarms.com |access-date=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031951/http://www.securityarms.com/20010315/galleryfiles/3000/3005.htm |archive-date=16 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:FAMAS.jpg|thumb|left|Cutaway of the muzzle of a FAMAS F1 on display at the Weapons Department in the Museum of Art and Industry in Saint-\u00c9tienne, France.]]\nIn the 1960s, MAS began to manufacture under licence the [[Heckler & Koch G3]] [[battle rifle]] and later on the [[Heckler & Koch HK33]] [[assault rifle]] as temporary substitutes. At the same time, the French embraced the idea of developing a new 5.56&nbsp;mm automatic rifle. However, simply adopting the German-designed HK33 rifle was considered unsatisfactory for many members of the French high command. General [[Marcel Bigeard]] was also against the idea of relying on foreign weapons; while visiting the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne, he asked the engineers to develop a homemade French 5.56&nbsp;mm automatic rifle, which subsequently led to the creation and adoption of the FAMAS.\n\nThe FAMAS project began in 1967 under the direction of General Paul Telli\u00e9 (1919-2014) and the first prototype was completed in 1971, with French military evaluation of the rifle beginning in 1972.<ref name=\"modernfirearms\"/> When production problems delayed the general issue of the new rifles, and with the 1978 [[Battle of Kolwezi]] showing an immediate need for a more modern weapon, the [[French Army]] began searching for an emergency temporary rifle until the FAMAS came into full production. While the Heckler & Koch HK33 was considered, with a batch of 1,200 examples tested, it was ultimately turned down in favor of the [[SIG SG 540]], built under licence by Manurhin, until enough domestically-built FAMAS rifles were produced to issue to French forces. In late 1978, the French military accepted the FAMAS as their standard-issue rifle.\n\nAfter adoption, the FAMAS F1 replaced both the aging [[MAS 49]]/56 rifle and [[MAT-49]] [[submachine gun]]. Approximately 400,000 FAMAS F1 assault rifles were produced by MAS. While a capable rifle, the F1 had numerous problems to overcome. For instance, many plastic pieces on the rifle easily broke, including critical parts like the cheek riser on the buttstock. The FAMAS was also susceptible to malfunction on occasion because of poorly-built, or rather improperly used, magazines. The FAMAS was designed around the concept of single-use, disposable magazines; when the limited budget of the French military forced soldiers to reuse disposable magazines over and over, the FAMAS would jam and require immediate attention. MAS would eventually manufacture more durable magazines for the FAMAS that reduced malfunctions.\n\nThe F1 was followed by the G1 version that included several minor improvements, such as redesigned grips and an enlarged trigger guard for operation with gloves. However, the G1 remained conceptual and was never actually produced.\n\n===FAMAS G2===\nThe FAMAS G2 was developed in 1994 to comply with NATO standards by accepting standard [[STANAG magazine|NATO magazines]] and by employing tighter barrel rifling to accurately fire both older 5.56&nbsp;mm {{convert|55|gr|g|abbr=on}} ammunition and new standard [[5.56x45mm NATO|5.56mm NATO 62gr ammo]]. The G2 also included several other upgrades taken from the G1 model, such as an enlarged trigger guard and improved hand guards made from reinforced fiberglass instead of plastic, and also the ability to take standard brass cased ammunition as well as French made steel ammunition. The [[French Navy]] purchased the FAMAS G2 in 1995 and issued it to their [[Fusiliers Marins]] and [[Naval commandos (France)|Commandos Marine]]. However, the French army refused to purchase the G2, preferring to rely on the FAMAS F1 as their primary rifle.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Views of different versions of the FAMAS\n|width=200\n|height=100\n|lines=\n|align=center\n|File:Rifles FAMAS.jpg|FAMAS F1 with bayonet\n|File:FAMAS-G2-IMG 8894-white.jpg|FAMAS-G2 with bayonet<br/>The G2 features<br />- a larger trigger guard<br />- a redesigned magwell and magazine catch accepting [[STANAG magazine]]<br />- a small hand-guard protrusion (bump) on the front of fore-stock under the muzzle<br />- a 1/9 rifling, instead of the 1/12 rifling of the F1\n|File:Fusilier_marin_remise_des_fourrag\u00e8re_le_06_juin_2009._Recadr\u00e9.jpg|Fusilier Marin with his FAMAS G2\n}}\n\n===FAMAS Infantry===\nThe FAMAS Infantry is an improvement of the FAMAS F1, obtained by retrofiting an accessory rail onto the top of the handguard. This allows mounting combat optics, most notably [[reflex sight]]s or the 4\u00d7 magnification [[SCROME J4]] scope.\n\n=== MAS .223 ===\n[[File:MAS.223 .jpg|thumb|[[Century Arms]] MAS .223 (FAMAS) rifle with accessories]]\n[[File:Century Arms FAMAS receiver.jpg|thumb|Century Arms MAS .223 (FAMAS) left side receiver markings]]\n\nDuring the late 1980s, [[Century Arms]] imported a very small number of semi-automatic FAMAS rifles into the United States. Due to poor sales, production and importation ceased and the existing number are not only extremely rare but cost in the range of $25,000 with no spare parts available on the market.\n\n[[File:MAS .223 markings RS.jpg|thumb|Century Arms MAS .223 (FAMAS) right side receiver markings]]\n\n==Design details==\n\n===Action===\n[[File:FAMAS Bolt-gr.PNG|thumb|right|A schematic of the lever-delayed blowback mechanism used in the FAMAS assault rifle.]]\nThe FAMAS assault rifle is a [[bullpup]] configuration, with the ammunition feed behind the trigger. The receiver housing is made of a special steel alloy, and the rifle furniture is made of fiberglass. The rifle uses a [[Blowback (arms)#Lever delayed|lever-delayed blowback]] action, an action used on the [[AA-52 machine gun]] derived from the prototypes built during Army Technical Department tests having taken place between the First and Second World Wars.\n\n===Ergonomics===\nFire mode is controlled by a selector within the trigger guard, with three settings:  safe (central position), single shot (to the right), and automatic fire (to the left). Automatic fire can be in three-shot bursts (rafale) or fully automatic; this is determined by another selector, located under the housing and behind the magazine.\n\nThe FAMAS G2 weighs {{convert|3.8|kg|lb|2|abbr=on}}. The G1 and G2 have a large, grip-length trigger-guard like a [[Steyr AUG]] to allow easy access to the trigger when wearing gloves.\n\nBoth F1 and G2 models of the FAMAS feature a bipod attached to the upper hand-guard.\n\nThe FAMAS-G2 and some F1 sport a  \"polyvalent hand-guard\" which features a standard [[NATO Accessory Rail]], allowing a variety of sights to be mounted, notably red dot sights and night vision units.\n\n[[File:FAMAS-F1 parts assembled.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|{{ordered list\n| Rubber buttpad\n| Removable stock\n| Cheek rest.

Using standard brass-casing [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ammunition employed by other armies can create over-pressure and case ruptures in the FAMAS during extraction, which can lead to severe malfunctions.<ref name=\"secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr\">{{Cite web |url=http://secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr/defense/2009/09/larm%C3%A9e-a-de-s%C3%A9rieuses-difficult%C3%A9s-avec-les-munitions-du-fusil-famas.html |title=L'arm\u00e9e rencontre de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s avec les munitions du fusil Famas |access-date=3 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111004617/http://secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr/defense/2009/09/larm%C3%A9e-a-de-s%C3%A9rieuses-difficult%C3%A9s-avec-les-munitions-du-fusil-famas.html |archive-date=11 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Using incorrectly built ammunition also results in approximately two minor injuries for every million rounds fired from a FAMAS.<ref name=\"secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr\"/> As a result, the French military has discreetly banned the use of foreign-produced ammunition in all French-issued FAMAS rifles.<ref name=\"secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr\"/> However, fluting the chamber will completely remove these malfunctions, although the brass casings will still be deformed and will not be able to be reloaded without reshaping.\n\nThe FAMAS F1 uses a proprietary 25-round magazine. It has a chrome-lined barrel with 1 turn in 12 inch (1:12 inch) rifling and functions best with the {{convert|55|gr|g|abbr=on}} (M193 type) ammunition.

This plug is necessary for automatic or semi-automatic blank fire operation, and functions by blocking part of the gas used in a blank cartridge.\n\n===Rifle grenades===\nThe FAMAS can use a variety of rifle grenades up to 500&nbsp;grams. Notable examples include the antipersonnel [[APAV40]] and the antitank [[AC58]].\n\n[[File:FAMAS-F1 firing APAV40.svg|thumb|Alidade for direct fire of the [[APAV 40]] grenade]]\nThe FAMAS features two [[alidade]]s for aiming rifle grenades with several modes:\n* direct fire at 75 or 100 metres, in anti-vehicle role\n* indirect fire, in anti-personnel role:\n** with the FAMAS inclined by 45\u00b0, allowing fire from 120 to 340 metres\n** with the FAMAS inclined by 75\u00b0, allowing fire from 60 to 170 metres\nIn indirect fire mode the grenade support (more exactly named \"grenade enforcement ring\" in French) is moved forwards or backwards on the barrel which has markings (12/13?). This changes the position of the grenade on the barrel and automatically the volume of the chamber in which the gas expands to push the grenade forward. Each position of the grenade support has a number which is multiplied by a certain fixed number depending on the alidade position, 45\u00b0 or 75\u00b0; this will accurately indicate the firing distance of the grenade.\n\nThe FAMAS can also accommodate an external grenade launcher as an add-on module under the hand guard; the US [[M203 grenade launcher]] is sometimes used.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:FAMAS Felin 501556 fh000002.jpg|thumb|Improved FAMAS F1 F\u00e9lin system]]\nThe FAMAS first saw service in [[Chad]] during [[Operation Manta]] and again in desert operations during Operation [[Desert Storm]] and in other various peacekeeping missions. Officially, operational conditions proved the weapon to be reliable and trustworthy under combat conditions. The FAMAS is affectionately known  by French-speaking troops as ''le Clairon'' (\"the Bugle\") because of its shape. An improved version of the FAMAS F1 is integrated in the [[F\u00e9lin]] system.\n\n[[Senegal]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] received a small number of FAMAS F1 rifles from France,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} though it was unknown when they received them.

It is being replaced as the [[service rifle]] of the [[Military of France|French military]] by the [[Heckler & Koch HK416|HK416F]]. It is known by French troops as ''Le Clairon'' (The [[Bugle]]) due to its distinctive shape. The FAMAS is recognized for its high rate of fire at 1,100 rounds per minute.\n\n==History==\nThe first French bullpup rifles were developed between 1946 and 1950 at the AME (''Atelier M\u00e9canique de Mulhouse'') and MAS, testing rounds such as [[.30 US Carbine]], [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]], [[7.65\u00d738mm]] (Made by ''Cartoucherie de Valence'') and some other intermediate calibers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Since France was engaged in the [[First Indochina War]] at the time, and was also the second-largest contributor to [[NATO]], the research budgets for new types of weapons were limited and priority was given to the modernization and production of existing service weapons. Nevertheless, approximately forty different [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] calibre prototype rifles were developed between 1952 and 1962, most notably the [[FA-MAS Type 62]]. However, the United States adoption of the [[M16 rifle]] and [[5.56\u00d745mm]] cartridge caused the French to rethink their approach, and consequently the Type 62 was not adopted.<ref>http://talks.guns.ru/forums/icons/forum_pictures/004217/4217682.jpg</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-1955 |title=French MAS Type 1955 |publisher=Forgotten Weapons |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617074513/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-1955 |archive-date=17 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-62 |title=French MAS Type 62 |publisher=Forgotten Weapons |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617074519/http://www.forgottenweapons.com/lorem-ipsum/rifles/french-mas-type-62 |archive-date=17 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.securityarms.com/20010315/galleryfiles/3000/3005.htm |title=FA-MAS Type 62 |publisher=Securityarms.com |access-date=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031951/http://www.securityarms.com/20010315/galleryfiles/3000/3005.htm |archive-date=16 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:FAMAS.jpg|thumb|left|Cutaway of the muzzle of a FAMAS F1 on display at the Weapons Department in the Museum of Art and Industry in Saint-\u00c9tienne, France.]]\nIn the 1960s, MAS began to manufacture under licence the [[Heckler & Koch G3]] [[battle rifle]] and later on the [[Heckler & Koch HK33]] [[assault rifle]] as temporary substitutes. At the same time, the French embraced the idea of developing a new 5.56&nbsp;mm automatic rifle. However, simply adopting the German-designed HK33 rifle was considered unsatisfactory for many members of the French high command. General [[Marcel Bigeard]] was also against the idea of relying on foreign weapons; while visiting the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne, he asked the engineers to develop a homemade French 5.56&nbsp;mm automatic rifle, which subsequently led to the creation and adoption of the FAMAS.\n\nThe FAMAS project began in 1967 under the direction of General Paul Telli\u00e9 (1919-2014) and the first prototype was completed in 1971, with French military evaluation of the rifle beginning in 1972.<ref name=\"modernfirearms\"/> When production problems delayed the general issue of the new rifles, and with the 1978 [[Battle of Kolwezi]] showing an immediate need for a more modern weapon, the [[French Army]] began searching for an emergency temporary rifle until the FAMAS came into full production. While the Heckler & Koch HK33 was considered, with a batch of 1,200 examples tested, it was ultimately turned down in favor of the [[SIG SG 540]], built under licence by Manurhin, until enough domestically-built FAMAS rifles were produced to issue to French forces. In late 1978, the French military accepted the FAMAS as their standard-issue rifle.\n\nAfter adoption, the FAMAS F1 replaced both the aging [[MAS 49]]/56 rifle and [[MAT-49]] [[submachine gun]]. Approximately 400,000 FAMAS F1 assault rifles were produced by MAS. While a capable rifle, the F1 had numerous problems to overcome. For instance, many plastic pieces on the rifle easily broke, including critical parts like the cheek riser on the buttstock. The FAMAS was also susceptible to malfunction on occasion because of poorly-built, or rather improperly used, magazines. The FAMAS was designed around the concept of single-use, disposable magazines; when the limited budget of the French military forced soldiers to reuse disposable magazines over and over, the FAMAS would jam and require immediate attention. MAS would eventually manufacture more durable magazines for the FAMAS that reduced malfunctions.\n\nThe F1 was followed by the G1 version that included several minor improvements, such as redesigned grips and an enlarged trigger guard for operation with gloves. However, the G1 remained conceptual and was never actually produced.\n\n===FAMAS G2===\nThe FAMAS G2 was developed in 1994 to comply with NATO standards by accepting standard [[STANAG magazine|NATO magazines]] and by employing tighter barrel rifling to accurately fire both older 5.56&nbsp;mm {{convert|55|gr|g|abbr=on}} ammunition and new standard [[5.56x45mm NATO|5.56mm NATO 62gr ammo]]. The G2 also included several other upgrades taken from the G1 model, such as an enlarged trigger guard and improved hand guards made from reinforced fiberglass instead of plastic, and also the ability to take standard brass cased ammunition as well as French made steel ammunition. The [[French Navy]] purchased the FAMAS G2 in 1995 and issued it to their [[Fusiliers Marins]] and [[Naval commandos (France)|Commandos Marine]]. However, the French army refused to purchase the G2, preferring to rely on the FAMAS F1 as their primary rifle.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=Views of different versions of the FAMAS\n|width=200\n|height=100\n|lines=\n|align=center\n|File:Rifles FAMAS.jpg|FAMAS F1 with bayonet\n|File:FAMAS-G2-IMG 8894-white.jpg|FAMAS-G2 with bayonet<br/>The G2 features<br />- a larger trigger guard<br />- a redesigned magwell and magazine catch accepting [[STANAG magazine]]<br />- a small hand-guard protrusion (bump) on the front of fore-stock under the muzzle<br />- a 1/9 rifling, instead of the 1/12 rifling of the F1\n|File:Fusilier_marin_remise_des_fourrag\u00e8re_le_06_juin_2009._Recadr\u00e9.jpg|Fusilier Marin with his FAMAS G2\n}}\n\n===FAMAS Infantry===\nThe FAMAS Infantry is an improvement of the FAMAS F1, obtained by retrofiting an accessory rail onto the top of the handguard. This allows mounting combat optics, most notably [[reflex sight]]s or the 4\u00d7 magnification [[SCROME J4]] scope.\n\n=== MAS .223 ===\n[[File:MAS.223 .jpg|thumb|[[Century Arms]] MAS .223 (FAMAS) rifle with accessories]]\n[[File:Century Arms FAMAS receiver.jpg|thumb|Century Arms MAS .223 (FAMAS) left side receiver markings]]\n\nDuring the late 1980s, [[Century Arms]] imported a very small number of semi-automatic FAMAS rifles into the United States. Due to poor sales, production and importation ceased and the existing number are not only extremely rare but cost in the range of $25,000 with no spare parts available on the market.\n\n[[File:MAS .223 markings RS.jpg|thumb|Century Arms MAS .223 (FAMAS) right side receiver markings]]\n\n==Design details==\n\n===Action===\n[[File:FAMAS Bolt-gr.PNG|thumb|right|A schematic of the lever-delayed blowback mechanism used in the FAMAS assault rifle.]]\nThe FAMAS assault rifle is a [[bullpup]] configuration, with the ammunition feed behind the trigger. The receiver housing is made of a special steel alloy, and the rifle furniture is made of fiberglass. The rifle uses a [[Blowback (arms)#Lever delayed|lever-delayed blowback]] action, an action used on the [[AA-52 machine gun]] derived from the prototypes built during Army Technical Department tests having taken place between the First and Second World Wars.\n\n===Ergonomics===\nFire mode is controlled by a selector within the trigger guard, with three settings:  safe (central position), single shot (to the right), and automatic fire (to the left). Automatic fire can be in three-shot bursts (rafale) or fully automatic; this is determined by another selector, located under the housing and behind the magazine.\n\nThe FAMAS G2 weighs {{convert|3.8|kg|lb|2|abbr=on}}. The G1 and G2 have a large, grip-length trigger-guard like a [[Steyr AUG]] to allow easy access to the trigger when wearing gloves.\n\nBoth F1 and G2 models of the FAMAS feature a bipod attached to the upper hand-guard.\n\nThe FAMAS-G2 and some F1 sport a  \"polyvalent hand-guard\" which features a standard [[NATO Accessory Rail]], allowing a variety of sights to be mounted, notably red dot sights and night vision units.\n\n[[File:FAMAS-F1 parts assembled.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|{{ordered list\n| Rubber buttpad\n| Removable stock\n| Cheek rest.

Using standard brass-casing [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ammunition employed by other armies can create over-pressure and case ruptures in the FAMAS during extraction, which can lead to severe malfunctions.<ref name=\"secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr\">{{Cite web |url=http://secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr/defense/2009/09/larm%C3%A9e-a-de-s%C3%A9rieuses-difficult%C3%A9s-avec-les-munitions-du-fusil-famas.html |title=L'arm\u00e9e rencontre de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s avec les munitions du fusil Famas |access-date=3 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111004617/http://secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr/defense/2009/09/larm%C3%A9e-a-de-s%C3%A9rieuses-difficult%C3%A9s-avec-les-munitions-du-fusil-famas.html |archive-date=11 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Using incorrectly built ammunition also results in approximately two minor injuries for every million rounds fired from a FAMAS.<ref name=\"secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr\"/> As a result, the French military has discreetly banned the use of foreign-produced ammunition in all French-issued FAMAS rifles.<ref name=\"secretdefense.blogs.liberation.fr\"/> However, fluting the chamber will completely remove these malfunctions, although the brass casings will still be deformed and will not be able to be reloaded without reshaping.\n\nThe FAMAS F1 uses a proprietary 25-round magazine. It has a chrome-lined barrel with 1 turn in 12 inch (1:12 inch) rifling and functions best with the {{convert|55|gr|g|abbr=on}} (M193 type) ammunition.

This plug is necessary for automatic or semi-automatic blank fire operation, and functions by blocking part of the gas used in a blank cartridge.\n\n===Rifle grenades===\nThe FAMAS can use a variety of rifle grenades up to 500&nbsp;grams. Notable examples include the antipersonnel [[APAV40]] and the antitank [[AC58]].\n\n[[File:FAMAS-F1 firing APAV40.svg|thumb|Alidade for direct fire of the [[APAV 40]] grenade]]\nThe FAMAS features two [[alidade]]s for aiming rifle grenades with several modes:\n* direct fire at 75 or 100 metres, in anti-vehicle role\n* indirect fire, in anti-personnel role:\n** with the FAMAS inclined by 45\u00b0, allowing fire from 120 to 340 metres\n** with the FAMAS inclined by 75\u00b0, allowing fire from 60 to 170 metres\nIn indirect fire mode the grenade support (more exactly named \"grenade enforcement ring\" in French) is moved forwards or backwards on the barrel which has markings (12/13?). This changes the position of the grenade on the barrel and automatically the volume of the chamber in which the gas expands to push the grenade forward. Each position of the grenade support has a number which is multiplied by a certain fixed number depending on the alidade position, 45\u00b0 or 75\u00b0; this will accurately indicate the firing distance of the grenade.\n\nThe FAMAS can also accommodate an external grenade launcher as an add-on module under the hand guard; the US [[M203 grenade launcher]] is sometimes used.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:FAMAS Felin 501556 fh000002.jpg|thumb|Improved FAMAS F1 F\u00e9lin system]]\nThe FAMAS first saw service in [[Chad]] during [[Operation Manta]] and again in desert operations during Operation [[Desert Storm]] and in other various peacekeeping missions. Officially, operational conditions proved the weapon to be reliable and trustworthy under combat conditions. The FAMAS is affectionately known  by French-speaking troops as ''le Clairon'' (\"the Bugle\") because of its shape.
