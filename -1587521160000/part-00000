This association of volunteers were constantly fundraising through community socials to raise money needed to add titles and later build its first dedicated building.

The library itself managed to outlive the community it was a part of when Lemon City was enveloped by surrounding neighborhoods. Today the area is known as [[Little Haiti]]. In 1942 the library became a member of the [[Miami-Dade Public Library System]]. After a fire broke out, the branch was expected to close in 1963 as the damage from the fire was too impracticable to restore. Members of the community had been advocating for the construction of a new building to house the library, and for the original to be marked as a historical landmark.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Lemon City Branch Library officially opened the doors to its current location, a 6,393 square foot building located at 430 NE 61st Street, on April 13, 1964.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ash|first=Agnes|title=Literary Bugs Beneath the Lemon Trees|newspaper=The Miami News|date=March 29, 1964}}</ref>\n\nToday, the library boasts a 10,000 piece collection of books and materials, including databases and internet access.\n\n=== Important events/dates in the establishment of the Lemon City Public Library ===\nThe exact date of the Lemon City Public Library has come into question over the last few years, due to confusion over the meaning and distinction between the words library, circulating library, and public library. According to historical records, Miss Ada Merritt arrived in Lemon City in the 1890's to serve as a school teacher and establish the first \"school library\" in Lemon City. As Lemon City's population continued to rise, citizens living in Lemon City began to form their own cultural engagement groups in order to bring more life to the city, and to improve life in the city as a whole. One such group was created by Ada Merritt, coined the \"Busy Bees of the Everglades\" this group of young women came together to raise money for the fledgling school library collection. Through the group's efforts, the collection grew over a period of several years to reach the sizable amount of 400 volumes. Between 1892 and 1893, Ada Merritt and the Busy Bees coordinated various functions, from dances to formal dinners, in an effort to raise money and continue funding and supporting the growing library. The Tropical Sun newspaper, the first newspaper published in the area, features an article dated May 6, 1893 that describes Miss Ada Merritt's school library and the delivery of new books for the collection. There is no mention of another library established in Lemon City during the early years of Ada Merritt's school library.\n\nIn 1896, the Village Improvement Association (V.I.A.) came together in the home of Mrs. Cornelia Keys with the aim to improve roads going in and out of Lemon City.  Before the roads were laid, residents and travelers journeying through Lemon City and beyond were forced to traverse rocky roads, mud, and swamps. Paved roads required hard labor and funds; through the V.I.A.'s efforts, fully functional, easily traversable roads started to become a reality. In 1902, Dade County took on the task of overseeing road construction in and out of Lemon City, and funded such projects through the selling of bonds, leaving the V.I.A in need of a new mission.\n\nIn 1902, thirteen women came together once more in the home of Cornelia Keys; the V.I.A. was disbanded and a new group formed a library association. These thirteen women, many of whom were former members of the V.I.A., went on to become the motivating force behind the creation of the first recorded public library in Lemon City. Following the example set by the Busy Bees over a decade before the library association's formation, the group started to host fundraising events to support the library initiative. It was at this time that Cornelia Keys' residence began to serve as the base for the town's library. For the next three years, until 1905, the thirteen members of the library association agreed to pay monthly member dues, donate books, and take books home, much like a traditional circulating library at the time.\n\n[[File:Lemon City Library plaque.jpg|thumb|The Lemon City Library plaque commemorating the location of the original library. The site is currently adjacent to the where the current library is located.]]\n\nDuring this time, the library association's valiant effort served to grow the number of monetary contributions received through fundraising events, as well as the available number of furnishings and books for the collection itself. Construction of the library began in 1904 and found a home at 412 N.E. 61st Street in Lemon City. The formal dedication ceremony for Lemon's City Public Library took place on January 13, 1905. The library served Lemon City residents for several decades, and became part of the Miami-Dade Public Library System in 1942. In 1963, the library was scheduled to close and after a fire caused severe damage to the structure; it was decided that a new Lemon City Public Library would be built. On April 13, 1964, the newly built Lemon City Public Library officially opened and has remained open at its current location ever since. A plaque placed beside the library marks the site as a Florida Heritage site and commemorates the history of the library, serving as a reminder of its original location, and the efforts of those enterprising individuals who strove to make the library a reality for the residents of Lemon City.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blazek|first1=Ron|title=Library in a Pioneer Community: Lemon City, Florida|journal=Tequesta|date=1982|volume=1|issue=42|url=http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/tequesta/files/1982/82_1_02.pdf|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Thelma|title=Lemon City: Pioneering on Biscayne Bay, 1850-1925|date=1976|publisher=Banyan Books|isbn=0916224120}}</ref>\n\n==== Hours of Operation and Contact Information ====\n* Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday & Sunday: 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.\n* Wednesday: Noon - 8 p.m.\n* Friday: Closed\n\nPhone Number: 305-757-0662\n\n==References==\n<references />\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

He is the Member for the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Churchlands|Churchlands]]. He was the Minister for Finance; [[Minister for Mines (Western Australia)|Minister for Mines and Petroleum]]; and Minister for Small Business in the Barnett-Liberal [[Government of Western Australia]]. In Opposition he has held the role of Manager of Opposition Business and senior Shadow Ministerial portfolios. His career background includes being a Senior Infantry Army Officer (Colonel) and Afghanistan veteran; Business leadership and management consultant; and Senior School Economics teacher and Head of Department.\n\nL'Estrange was born in Perth, Western Australia. He holds a bachelor's degree of Education (majoring in Economics), a master's degree of Educational Leadership, a Graduate Diploma of Resource Management, and a Graduate Diploma of Management (majoring in Defence Studies). He is also a graduate of the  [[Australian Defence College|Australian Defence Force Command and Staff College]].\n\n==Early life==\nL'Estrange completed his schooling at [[Aquinas College, Perth]]. While he was at Aquinas, he was College Prefect, House Captain, College Swimming Captain, College Cross Country Captain, Army Cadet Under Officer, President of the Young Christian Students, a member of the College Debating Team and he performed in College drama productions. L'Estrange represented Western Australia at the National All Schools Cross Country Championships in Adelaide in 1982, Brisbane in 1984, and Perth in 1985 and was made the State Team Vice Captain in 1985. He was also a silver medalist in the WA Debating League State final. At his school graduation he was awarded the College Prize for Leadership and Service.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Pre-politics business and professional background===\nFor six years before entering parliament L'Estrange established and operated a leadership and management consulting business which specialized in strategic planning, business resilience and recovery planning, and leadership development. He worked with large resources sector companies, city and regional businesses, and Government departments. L'Estrange also has extensive experience in the Australian Defence Force as an Infantry Army Officer where he completed full-time (regular) and part-time (reserve) roles. Career highlights included reaching the rank of Colonel; Commanding a Reserve Infantry Regiment which trained and deployed soldiers for the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands; Preparing and deploying troops for national security tasks; and himself deploying to Afghanistan as part of the NATO led International Security Assistance Force. While serving in Afghanistan, he was the Australian Task Force Commander's Operations Analyst to Uruzgan province; and posted in direct support of the Australian Battle Group which was led by the 1st Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment and later the 6th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment. Prior to L'Estrange's business and Senior Army Officer roles he also had a highly rewarding career as a Senior School Economics teacher and Head of an Academic Department. He worked in schools such as Christ Church Grammar School, Ursula Frayne and Mandurah Catholic Colleges, and Wesley College.\n\n===Politics and parliament===\nL'Estrange joined the Liberal Party of Western Australia in 2002 (Hackett Branch/Churchlands electorate). He held pre-parliamentary service positions as President of Hackett Branch 2008\u201312; President of Curtin Division 2008\u201309; Member of State Executive 2008\u201309 and member of State Council 2008\u20132012. He has continued to serve as a Liberal Parliamentary Party State Council Delegate since 2013.\n\nIn 2013 L'Estrange was elected to the seat of Churchlands in the 39th Parliament of Western Australia. The seat had been held by conservative independent [[Liz Constable]] since 1991, dating to its time as [[electoral district of Floreat|Floreat]]. However, it was located in the Liberals' heartland of the southwest beachside suburbs of Perth, and it was a foregone conclusion that it would revert to the Liberals once Constable retired. As expected, L'Estrange won comfortably, with 59 percent of the primary vote and 70.2 percent of the two-party vote.\n\nL'Estrange served as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Corruption and Crime Commission, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Deputy Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Audit, and as member of the Parliamentary Liberal Party's Finance, Commerce & Development Committee. In March 2016, he was elevated to Cabinet and appointed Minister for Mines and Petroleum and Minister for Small Business. In September 2016 he was also appointed as Minister for Finance and to the Government's Economic and Expenditure Reform Committee.\n\nIn 2017, L'Estrange was re-elected to the seat of Churchlands in the 40th Parliament of Western Australia. The Liberal Party suffered a primary vote swing of 16 percent but L\u2019Estrange kept his swing to 4 percent, securing a comfortable TPP majority of 63.2 percent, the second-safest Liberal seat in Perth. Following the Liberal Government's defeat, he was appointed Manager of Opposition Business in the Legislative Assembly and Shadow Minister for Mines and Petroleum; Economic Development; Defence Issues; Innovation and ICT; Science. He was also elected as the Deputy Chairman of the Parliament's Economic and Industry Standing Committee. In January 2018 he was made Shadow Minister for Health and Mental Health. In June 2019 he was appointed Shadow Minister for Corrective Services and Housing. In February 2020 he took on the role as Shadow Minister for Corrective Services; Emergency Services; Defence Issues; and Racing and Gaming.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nL'Estrange has been awarded the following Australian Honours and awards: Returned from Active Service Badge; Army Combat Badge; Australian Active Service Medal with International Coalition Against Terrorism (ICAT) Clasp; Afghanistan Campaign Medal; Australian Defence Force Long Service Medal with 2 x Clasps; Australian Defence Force Medal; North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Medal with International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Clasp.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|au-wa-la}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Liz Constable]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member for [[Electoral district of Churchlands|Churchlands]]|years=2013\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Bill Marmion]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Minister for Mines and Petroleum (Western Australia)|Minister for Mines and Petroleum]]|years=2016\u20132017}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Bill Johnston (politician)|Bill Johnston]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Joe Francis (politician)|Joe Francis]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Minister for Small Business (Western Australia)|Minister for Small Business]]|years=2016\u20132017}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Paul Papalia]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Bill Marmion]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Minister for Finance (Western Australia)|Minister for Finance]]|years=2016\u20132017}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Ben Wyatt]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{WACurrentMLAs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:L'Estrange, Sean}}\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:People from Perth, Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian politicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=September 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox officeholder | name = Sean L'Estrange \n|honorific-suffix = \n| constituency_AM = [[Electoral district of Churchlands|Churchlands]]  \n|image            =<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Sean L'Estrange.png|thumb|right|Sean L'Estrange MLA, Member for Churchlands]] -->\n| assembly        = Western Australian Legislative\n| term_start      = 9 March 2013\n| term_end        = \n| predecessor     = [[Liz Constable]]\n| majority        = \n| office2          = [[Minister for Mines and Petroleum (Western Australia)|Minister for Mines and Petroleum]] \n| term_start2      = 31 March 2016\n| term_end2        = 17 March 2017\n| predecessor2     = [[Bill Marmion]]\n| successor2       = [[Peter Tinley]]\n| office3          = [[Minister for Small Business (Western Australia)|Minister for Small Business]]\n| term_start3      = 31 March 2016\n| term_end3        = 17 March 2017\n| successor3       = [[Paul Papalia]] \n| predecessor3     = [[Joe Francis (politician)|Joe Francis]]  \n| office4          = [[Minister for Finance (Western Australia)|Minister for Finance]]\n| term_start4      = 23 September 2016\n| term_end4        = 17 March 2017\n| predecessor4     = [[Bill Marmion]]\n| successor4       = [[Ben Wyatt]]\n| birth_name      = Sean Kimberley L'Estrange\n| birth_date      = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1967|09|19}}\n| birth_place     = Perth, Western Australia\n| death_date      = \n| death_place     = \n| constituency    = \n| party           = [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]]\n| spouse          = Alyson<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wa.liberal.org.au/representative-full/911 | title=Sean L'Estrange | publisher= Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division) | accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref>\n| children        = \n| residence       = \n| university      = \n| profession      = Army officer, secondary teacher, management consultant\n| religion        = \n| signature       = \n| footnotes       = \n| website         = \n}}\n\n'''Sean Kimberley L'Estrange''' (born 19 September 1967<ref name=\"parliamentprofile\">{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/Parliament%5CMemblist.nsf/WAllMembersFlat/L%27Estrange,+Sean+Kimberley?opendocument | title=Sean Kimberley L'Estrange MLA  | publisher=Parliament of Western Australia | accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref>) is an Australian politician.

The brigade was first formed in early 1912 following the introduction of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]]. Later, as part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and saw action during [[World War I]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. In the interwar years, the brigade was re-raised with its headquarters in Brisbane. During [[World War II]], it undertook garrison and defensive duties in north Queensland before deploying to [[Dutch New Guinea]] in 1943. In 1944\u20131945, the brigade took part in the fighting against the Japanese on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]]. In the postwar era, the 11th Brigade was raised and disbanded several times, before being raised in Townsville in 1987, where its headquarters is currently located. It forms part of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]], and consists of units based across Queensland and New South Wales. \n\n==History==\nThe 11th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a Militia brigade as part of the introduction of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]], assigned to the [[2nd Military District (Australia)|2nd Military District]]. The brigade's constituent units were spread across various locations in New South Wales including [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]], [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]], [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]], [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[Wagga Wagga]] and [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]].{{sfn|Australian Military Forces|1912|p=19}} During World War I, the 11th Brigade was raised in early 1916 as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. Forming part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]],{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=1}} the brigade was formed in Australia during the period shortly after the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] when the AIF was being expanded prior to its commitment to the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. On formation, the brigade consisted of four infantry battalions: the [[41st Battalion (Australia)|41st]], [[42nd Battalion (Australia)|42nd]], [[43rd Battalion (Australia)|43rd]] and [[44th Battalion (Australia)|44th]].{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=42}} Of these, the first two were drawn from Queensland, while the 43rd was recruited mainly from South Australia and the 44th came from Western Australia. In addition to these battalions, the brigade was supported by the 11th Field Ambulance, the 11th Trench Mortar Battery and the 11th Machine Gun Company (later part of the [[3rd Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|3rd Machine Gun Battalion]]).<ref name=Digger>{{cite web |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-conflicts-periods/ww1/1aif/3div/11bde/11th_brigade_aif.htm |title=11th Brigade |author=Harris, Ted |work=Digger History |accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hamel (AWM E02690).jpg|thumb|left|Australian troops from the 11th Brigade, with US troops, during the Battle of Hamel, July 1918]]\n\nFollowing the brigade's establishment, a brief period of training was undertaken in Queensland until May 1916 when the formation embarked for the United Kingdom where they concentrated with other elements of the 3rd Division on [[Salisbury Plain]] for further training after July 1916. There, they undertook further training until November that year, when the troops of the 3rd Division began moving across the Channel to the Western Front.{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=21}}{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=176}} The brigade's first commander was Brigadier General [[Colin Rankin]], although he was replaced by Brigadier General [[James Cannan]] in December 1916.

These include: the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of Broodseinde]], the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], the [[Second Battle of Morlancourt]], the [[Battle of Hamel]] and the [[Hundred Days Offensive]].<ref name=Digger/>\n\nWhile the AIF was deployed, a separate [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Force]] (later known as the Militia) formation remained in Australia.

The brigade was first formed in early 1912 following the introduction of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]]. Later, as part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] and saw action during [[World War I]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. In the interwar years, the brigade was re-raised with its headquarters in Brisbane. During [[World War II]], it undertook garrison and defensive duties in north Queensland before deploying to [[Dutch New Guinea]] in 1943. In 1944\u20131945, the brigade took part in the fighting against the Japanese on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]]. In the postwar era, the 11th Brigade was raised and disbanded several times, before being raised in Townsville in 1987, where its headquarters is currently located. It forms part of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]], and consists of units based across Queensland and New South Wales. \n\n==History==\nThe 11th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a Militia brigade as part of the introduction of the [[Conscription in Australia|compulsory training scheme]], assigned to the [[2nd Military District (Australia)|2nd Military District]]. The brigade's constituent units were spread across various locations in New South Wales including [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]], [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]], [[Dubbo, New South Wales|Dubbo]], [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], [[Wagga Wagga]] and [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]].{{sfn|Australian Military Forces|1912|p=19}} During World War I, the 11th Brigade was raised in early 1916 as part of the [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. Forming part of the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]],{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=1}} the brigade was formed in Australia during the period shortly after the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] when the AIF was being expanded prior to its commitment to the fighting on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. On formation, the brigade consisted of four infantry battalions: the [[41st Battalion (Australia)|41st]], [[42nd Battalion (Australia)|42nd]], [[43rd Battalion (Australia)|43rd]] and [[44th Battalion (Australia)|44th]].{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=42}} Of these, the first two were drawn from Queensland, while the 43rd was recruited mainly from South Australia and the 44th came from Western Australia. In addition to these battalions, the brigade was supported by the 11th Field Ambulance, the 11th Trench Mortar Battery and the 11th Machine Gun Company (later part of the [[3rd Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|3rd Machine Gun Battalion]]).<ref name=Digger>{{cite web |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-conflicts-periods/ww1/1aif/3div/11bde/11th_brigade_aif.htm |title=11th Brigade |author=Harris, Ted |work=Digger History |accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hamel (AWM E02690).jpg|thumb|left|Australian troops from the 11th Brigade, with US troops, during the Battle of Hamel, July 1918]]\n\nFollowing the brigade's establishment, a brief period of training was undertaken in Queensland until May 1916 when the formation embarked for the United Kingdom where they concentrated with other elements of the 3rd Division on [[Salisbury Plain]] for further training after July 1916. There, they undertook further training until November that year, when the troops of the 3rd Division began moving across the Channel to the Western Front.{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=21}}{{sfn|Bean|1941|p=176}} The brigade's first commander was Brigadier General [[Colin Rankin]], although he was replaced by Brigadier General [[James Cannan]] in December 1916. Following its commitment to the Western Front, the 11th Brigade took part in many battles over the course of the next two years. These include: the [[Third Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of Broodseinde]], the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], the [[Second Battle of Morlancourt]], the [[Battle of Hamel]] and the [[Hundred Days Offensive]].<ref name=Digger/>\n\nWhile the AIF was deployed, a separate [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Force]] (later known as the Militia) formation remained in Australia.

Mead, from [[Montpelier, Vermont]], came to Sheboygan in 1856. With his father-in-law, he founded and obtained a charter for the German Bank (later known as Security First National bank, then acquired by First Wisconsin Bank in 1985, eventually becoming a part of [[U.S. Bancorp|US Bank]] after [[Firstar Corporation|Firstar]]'s purchase of that bank in 2001). At the time of his death in 1891, he was president of the German Bank and the Crocker Chair Company. He left $10,000 to the Congregational Church and $20,000 to the City of Sheboygan to be used to provide places \"for the amusement and literary culture of young men,\" in the case of the gift to the city, for a [[public library]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Mead Public Library|url=http://www.meadpl.org/about/history|website=Mead Public Library|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229060911/http://www.meadpl.org/about/history|archivedate=2014-12-29|df=}}</ref>\n\nAfter being contained within several storefronts (including the [[Henry Store Foeste Building|Foeste Building]]), with the assistance of funds from [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s [[Carnegie library]] effort, the library was moved into its own dedicated building in 1904, located at the corner of N. 7th Street and New York Avenue.\n\n== Library branches ==\nDuring the early 1950s, the library built two branch libraries. Although Sheboygan had had many different branches over the years, these were the first constructed to serve as library branches. The first was the Frank Stone branch attached to Cooper Elementary School on the city's north side. Frank Stone was the first librarian of the Sheboygan Library Association. The second branch was named after Charles E. Broughton and was attached to Wilson Elementary School on the city's south side.\n\n=== Current location ===\nEarly in 1964, the library board agreed that a new or expanded library building was needed and money for planning was requested of, and granted by, the Common Council in the next annual budget. A bond issue, containing $2.3 million for the construction of a new library, was approved by the Common Council in 1970. The city at this time was acquiring land for [[Plaza 8]]. The city planner at that time reported that some of this land, located at North 8th Street and New York Avenue, could be used as a library site.\n\nThe new and current 64,000 square-foot library opened in 1974. Before the opening, hundreds of high school students lugged 150,000 books from the old library to the new, one block to the west. Units of the [[Wisconsin National Guard]] and the Army Reserve moved heavy equipment with their trucks. The original design of the library was of a [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] structure, with a large amount of vaulted concrete and brickwork defining the interior structure of the library. The main library took up the second floor, with the children's room on the first floor, and services including circulation, administration and the headquarters for the [[Eastern Shores Library System]] in an exposed [[basement]] which was landscaped on a slope which came down from Plaza 8's water feature.\n\nThe Carnegie building was then used for the city's health department and county human services until the 90s, when the [[John Michael Kohler Arts Center]] acquired the building and disassembled the interior, retaining the facade as a modern '[[ruins|ruin]]', with the former building footprint containing gardens.\n\nIn April 1987, the city had planned to put downtown including Plaza 8, under one roof. Developer John Livesey proposed a $100 million enclosed shopping and office complex, to be called City Center.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wozniak|first1=Maurice|title=Sheboygan may build downtown with a roof|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|date=April 19, 1987}}</ref> The only buildings that would have remained in the City Center site were the Prange's store, Mead Public Library and Trinity Lutheran Church. Most of the other buildings would have been demolished by the city including the First Wisconsin Sheboygan Bank (now the [[U.S. Bank]]). In 1992, the process of removing Plaza 8 from the block between the Mead Public Library and [[H. C. Prange Co.|Prange's]] across the street was completed, though due to the water feature and the Prange's frontage, the restored North 8th Street was a compressed two-lane road through the library block.\n\nFrom 1996 until 1998, the current library building underwent an expansion which changed the building's front from North 8th Street to Wisconsin Avenue. The Brutalist features of the building were considerably lightened with [[dropped ceiling]]s and brighter lighting, with the children's room moved to a newly-built third floor with panoramic views of the surroundings of Sheboygan. A quiet study room was placed atop the new second floor frontage, and fiction and audiovisual services were moved down to the first floor. The library's check-out system also changed considerably, from an early [[light pen]] and [[RFID]] system to a current all-RFID system which now uses several self-checkout kiosks, freeing up library staff to provide other services. Computer services, which in the 1980s were limited to [[Infotrac]] terminals, have also widened considerably to a number of internet terminals throughout the building and the move of the [[card catalog]] system to a fully web-based system shared with its sister libraries in the Monarch system.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Plaza 8]]\n* [[Eastern Shores Library System]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.meadpl.org Mead Public Library]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Public libraries in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Sheboygan, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Education in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Carnegie libraries in Wisconsin]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox library\n| name               = Mead Public Library\n| logo               = Mead_Public_Library.png\n| logo_size          = 200px\n| image              = File:Mead Public Library Fall 2019.jpg\n| image_size         = 300px\n| alt                = A three-floor brown building of brick and concrete is pictured with a walkway and plaza in front of it and water feature in the foreground, with the middle of the building featuring a large reading room which overlooks the plaza.

The main library took up the second floor, with the children's room on the first floor, and services including circulation, administration and the headquarters for the [[Eastern Shores Library System]] in an exposed [[basement]] which was landscaped on a slope which came down from Plaza 8's water feature.\n\nThe Carnegie building was then used for the city's health department and county human services until the 90s, when the [[John Michael Kohler Arts Center]] acquired the building and disassembled the interior, retaining the facade as a modern '[[ruins|ruin]]', with the former building footprint containing gardens.\n\nIn April 1987, the city had planned to put downtown including Plaza 8, under one roof. Developer John Livesey proposed a $100 million enclosed shopping and office complex, to be called City Center.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wozniak|first1=Maurice|title=Sheboygan may build downtown with a roof|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|date=April 19, 1987}}</ref> The only buildings that would have remained in the City Center site were the Prange's store, Mead Public Library and Trinity Lutheran Church. Most of the other buildings would have been demolished by the city including the First Wisconsin Sheboygan Bank (now the [[U.S. Bank]]). In 1992, the process of removing Plaza 8 from the block between the Mead Public Library and [[H. C. Prange Co.|Prange's]] across the street was completed, though due to the water feature and the Prange's frontage, the restored North 8th Street was a compressed two-lane road through the library block.\n\nFrom 1996 until 1998, the current library building underwent an expansion which changed the building's front from North 8th Street to Wisconsin Avenue. The Brutalist features of the building were considerably lightened with [[dropped ceiling]]s and brighter lighting, with the children's room moved to a newly-built third floor with panoramic views of the surroundings of Sheboygan. A quiet study room was placed atop the new second floor frontage, and fiction and audiovisual services were moved down to the first floor. The library's check-out system also changed considerably, from an early [[light pen]] and [[RFID]] system to a current all-RFID system which now uses several self-checkout kiosks, freeing up library staff to provide other services. Computer services, which in the 1980s were limited to [[Infotrac]] terminals, have also widened considerably to a number of internet terminals throughout the building and the move of the [[card catalog]] system to a fully web-based system shared with its sister libraries in the Monarch system.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Plaza 8]]\n* [[Eastern Shores Library System]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.meadpl.org Mead Public Library]\n\n[[Category:Public libraries in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Sheboygan, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Education in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Carnegie libraries in Wisconsin]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead_Public_Library"}
