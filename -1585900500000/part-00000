In the absence of vitamin D, dietary calcium is not properly absorbed, resulting in [[hypocalcaemia]], leading to skeletal and dental deformities and [[neuromuscular]] symptoms, e.g. hyperexcitability. Foods that contain vitamin D include butter, eggs, fish liver oils, margarine, fortified milk and juice, portabella and shiitake mushrooms, and [[oily fish]]es such as tuna, herring, and salmon. A rare [[X-linked dominant]] form exists called vitamin D-resistant rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia.\n\nCases have been reported in Britain in recent years<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', page 4, Wednesday 19 January 2011</ref> of rickets in children of many social backgrounds caused by insufficient production in the body of vitamin D because the sun's ultraviolet light was not reaching the skin due to use of strong [[sunblock]], too much \"covering up\" in sunlight, or not getting out into the sun. Other cases have been reported among the children of some ethnic groups in which mothers avoid exposure to the sun for religious or cultural reasons, leading to a maternal shortage of vitamin D;<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/rise-in-rickets-linked-to-ethnic-groups-that-shun-the-sun-2319920.html Rise in rickets linked to ethnic groups that shun the sun] [[The Independent]], published 2011-07-25, accessed 2011-07-251</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7161458.stm Doctors fear rickets resurgence] [[BBC]], published 2007-12-28, accessed 2011-07-25</ref> and people with darker skins need more sunlight to maintain vitamin D levels.\n\nRickets had historically been a problem in London, especially during the Industrial Revolution. Persistent thick fog and heavy industrial smog permeating the city blocked out significant amounts of sunlight to such an extent that up to 80 percent of children at one time had varying degrees of rickets in one form or the other.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} It is sometimes known \"the English Disease\" in some foreign languages (e.g. German: 'Die englische Krankheit', Dutch: 'Engelse ziekte', Hungarian: \"angolkor\").\n\n===Evolutionary considerations===\nVitamin D natural selection hypotheses:\nRickets is often a result of vitamin D3 deficiency. The correlation between human skin color and latitude is thought to be the result of positive selection to varying levels of solar ultraviolet radiation. Northern latitudes have selection for lighter skin that allows UV rays to produce vitamin D from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Conversely, latitudes near the equator have selection for darker skin that can block the majority of UV radiation to protect from toxic levels of vitamin D, as well as skin cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loomis|first=W.G.|title=Skin-pigment regulation of vitamin-D biosynthesis in man|journal=Science|date=August 1967|volume=157|pages=501\u20136|doi=10.1126/science.157.3788.501|issue=3788|pmid=6028915}}</ref>\n\nAn anecdote often cited to support this hypothesis is that Arctic populations whose skin is relatively darker for their latitude, such as the Inuit, have a diet that is historically rich in vitamin D. Since these people acquire vitamin D through their diet, there is not a positive selective force to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barr|first1=Sharma|author2=Macdonald H.M., Sheehy T., Novotny R., Corriveau A.|title=Vitamin D deficiency and disease risk among aboriginal Arctic populations|journal=Nutritional Review|date=August 2011|volume=69|issue=8|pages=468\u2013478|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00406.x|pmid=21790613}}</ref>\n\nEnvironment mismatch:\nUltimately, vitamin D deficiency arises from a mismatch between a population's previous evolutionary environment and the individual's current environment. This risk of mismatch increases with advances in transportation methods and increases in urban population size at high latitudes.\n\nSimilar to the environmental mismatch when dark-skinned people live at high latitudes, Rickets can also occur in religious communities that require long garments with hoods and veils.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bachrach|first1=S.|author2=Fisher J., Parks J.S.|title=An outbreak of vitamin D deficiency rickets in a susceptible population|journal=Pediatrics Volume|year=1979|volume=64|issue=6|pages=871\u2013877}}</ref> These hoods and veils act as sunlight barriers that prevent individuals from synthesizing vitamin D naturally from the sun.\n\nIn a study by Mithal et al.,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mithal|first1=A.|author2=Wahl D.A., Bonjour J.P., Burckhardt T., Dawson-Hughes B., Eisman J.A., El-Hajj Fuleihan G., Josse R.G., Lips P., Morales-Torres J.|title=Global vitamin D status and determinants of hypovitaminosis D|journal=Osteoporosis International|date=19 June 2009|doi=10.1007/s00198-009-0954-6|pmid=19543765|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1807\u20131820|url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/27487/1/237115.pdf}}</ref> Vitamin D insufficiency of various countries was measured by lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 25(OH)D is an indicator of vitamin D insufficiency that can be easily measured. These percentages should be regarded as relative vitamin D levels, and not as predicting evidence for development of rickets.\n\nA systematic review published in the [[Cochrane Library]] looked at children up to three years old in Turkey and China and found there was a beneficial association between vitamin D and rickets. In Turkey children getting vitamin D had only a 4% chance of developing rickets compared to children who received no medical intervention. In China, a combination of vitamin D, calcium and nutritional counseling was linked to a decreased risk of rickets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lerch|first1=C|last2=Meissner|first2=T|title=Interventions for the prevention of nutritional rickets in term born children.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD006164|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006164.pub2|pmid=17943890}}</ref>\n\nWith this evolutionary perspective in mind, parents can supplement their nutritional intake with vitamin D enhanced beverages if they feel their child is at risk for vitamin D deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weisberg|first1=P.|author2=Scanlon K.S., Ruowei L., Cogswell M.E.|title=Nutritional rickets among children in the United States: review of cases reported between 1986 and 2003|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2004|volume=80|issue=6|pages=1697S\u20131705S|doi=10.1093/ajcn/80.6.1697S|pmid=15585790}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:RicketsXray.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Wrist X ray showing changes in rickets.

In the absence of vitamin D, dietary calcium is not properly absorbed, resulting in [[hypocalcaemia]], leading to skeletal and dental deformities and [[neuromuscular]] symptoms, e.g. hyperexcitability. Foods that contain vitamin D include butter, eggs, fish liver oils, margarine, fortified milk and juice, portabella and shiitake mushrooms, and [[oily fish]]es such as tuna, herring, and salmon. A rare [[X-linked dominant]] form exists called vitamin D-resistant rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia.\n\nCases have been reported in Britain in recent years<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', page 4, Wednesday 19 January 2011</ref> of rickets in children of many social backgrounds caused by insufficient production in the body of vitamin D because the sun's ultraviolet light was not reaching the skin due to use of strong [[sunblock]], too much \"covering up\" in sunlight, or not getting out into the sun. Other cases have been reported among the children of some ethnic groups in which mothers avoid exposure to the sun for religious or cultural reasons, leading to a maternal shortage of vitamin D;<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/rise-in-rickets-linked-to-ethnic-groups-that-shun-the-sun-2319920.html Rise in rickets linked to ethnic groups that shun the sun] [[The Independent]], published 2011-07-25, accessed 2011-07-251</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7161458.stm Doctors fear rickets resurgence] [[BBC]], published 2007-12-28, accessed 2011-07-25</ref> and people with darker skins need more sunlight to maintain vitamin D levels.\n\nRickets had historically been a problem in London, especially during the Industrial Revolution. Persistent thick fog and heavy industrial smog permeating the city blocked out significant amounts of sunlight to such an extent that up to 80 percent of children at one time had varying degrees of rickets in one form or the other.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} It is sometimes known \"the English Disease\" in some foreign languages (e.g. German: 'Die englische Krankheit', Dutch: 'Engelse ziekte', Hungarian: \"angolkor\").\n\n===Evolutionary considerations===\nVitamin D natural selection hypotheses:\nRickets is often a result of vitamin D3 deficiency. The correlation between human skin color and latitude is thought to be the result of positive selection to varying levels of solar ultraviolet radiation. Northern latitudes have selection for lighter skin that allows UV rays to produce vitamin D from 7-dehydrocholesterol. Conversely, latitudes near the equator have selection for darker skin that can block the majority of UV radiation to protect from toxic levels of vitamin D, as well as skin cancer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Loomis|first=W.G.|title=Skin-pigment regulation of vitamin-D biosynthesis in man|journal=Science|date=August 1967|volume=157|pages=501\u20136|doi=10.1126/science.157.3788.501|issue=3788|pmid=6028915}}</ref>\n\nAn anecdote often cited to support this hypothesis is that Arctic populations whose skin is relatively darker for their latitude, such as the Inuit, have a diet that is historically rich in vitamin D. Since these people acquire vitamin D through their diet, there is not a positive selective force to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barr|first1=Sharma|author2=Macdonald H.M., Sheehy T., Novotny R., Corriveau A.|title=Vitamin D deficiency and disease risk among aboriginal Arctic populations|journal=Nutritional Review|date=August 2011|volume=69|issue=8|pages=468\u2013478|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00406.x|pmid=21790613}}</ref>\n\nEnvironment mismatch:\nUltimately, vitamin D deficiency arises from a mismatch between a population's previous evolutionary environment and the individual's current environment. This risk of mismatch increases with advances in transportation methods and increases in urban population size at high latitudes.\n\nSimilar to the environmental mismatch when dark-skinned people live at high latitudes, Rickets can also occur in religious communities that require long garments with hoods and veils.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bachrach|first1=S.|author2=Fisher J., Parks J.S.|title=An outbreak of vitamin D deficiency rickets in a susceptible population|journal=Pediatrics Volume|year=1979|volume=64|issue=6|pages=871\u2013877}}</ref> These hoods and veils act as sunlight barriers that prevent individuals from synthesizing vitamin D naturally from the sun.\n\nIn a study by Mithal et al.,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mithal|first1=A.|author2=Wahl D.A., Bonjour J.P., Burckhardt T., Dawson-Hughes B., Eisman J.A., El-Hajj Fuleihan G., Josse R.G., Lips P., Morales-Torres J.|title=Global vitamin D status and determinants of hypovitaminosis D|journal=Osteoporosis International|date=19 June 2009|doi=10.1007/s00198-009-0954-6|pmid=19543765|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1807\u20131820|url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/27487/1/237115.pdf}}</ref> Vitamin D insufficiency of various countries was measured by lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D. 25(OH)D is an indicator of vitamin D insufficiency that can be easily measured. These percentages should be regarded as relative vitamin D levels, and not as predicting evidence for development of rickets.\n\nAsian immigrants living in Europe have an increased risk for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D insufficiency was found in 40% of non-Western immigrants in the Netherlands, and in more than 80% of Turkish and Moroccan immigrants.\n\nThe Middle East, despite high rates of sun-exposure, has the highest rates of rickets worldwide.<ref>[http://www.iofbonehealth.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/Audit%20Middle%20East_Africa/ME_audit-executive_summary.pdf THE MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA REGIONAL AUDIT, Executive Summary, Epidemiology, costs & burden of osteoporosis in 2011], The International Osteoporosis Foundation, www.iofbonehealth.org, retrieved 6 April 2017</ref> This can be explained by limited sun exposure due to cultural practices and lack of vitamin D supplementation for breast-feeding women. Up to 70% and 80% of adolescent girls in Iran and Saudi Arabia, respectively, have vitamin D insufficiency. Socioeconomic factors that limit a vitamin D rich diet also plays a role. \nIn the United States, vitamin D insufficiency varies dramatically by ethnicity. Among males aged 70 years and older, the prevalence of low serum 25(OH) D levels was 23% for non-Hispanic whites, 45% for Mexican Americans, and 58% for non-Hispanic blacks. Among women, the prevalence was 28.5%, 55%, and 68%, respectively.\n\nA systematic review published in the [[Cochrane Library]] looked at children up to three years old in Turkey and China and found there was a beneficial association between vitamin D and rickets. In Turkey children getting vitamin D had only a 4% chance of developing rickets compared to children who received no medical intervention. In China, a combination of vitamin D, calcium and nutritional counseling was linked to a decreased risk of rickets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lerch|first1=C|last2=Meissner|first2=T|title=Interventions for the prevention of nutritional rickets in term born children.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD006164|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006164.pub2|pmid=17943890}}</ref>\n\nWith this evolutionary perspective in mind, parents can supplement their nutritional intake with vitamin D enhanced beverages if they feel their child is at risk for vitamin D deficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Weisberg|first1=P.|author2=Scanlon K.S., Ruowei L., Cogswell M.E.|title=Nutritional rickets among children in the United States: review of cases reported between 1986 and 2003|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2004|volume=80|issue=6|pages=1697S\u20131705S|doi=10.1093/ajcn/80.6.1697S|pmid=15585790}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:RicketsXray.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Wrist X ray showing changes in rickets.

However, the high cost of racing karts led to the decision to race minimoto exclusively.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Through 1992 and 1993, Valentino continued to learn the ins and outs of minimoto racing.\n\nIn 1993, with help from his father, [[Virginio Ferrari]], Claudio Castiglioni and [[Claudio Lusuardi]] (who ran the official [[Cagiva]] Sport Production team), Rossi rode a [[Cagiva Mito]] 125cc motorcycle for the team, which he damaged in a first-corner crash no more than a hundred metres from the pit lane.{{sfnp|Rossi|2006|p=93\u201394}} He finished ninth that race weekend.{{sfnp|Rossi|2006|p=93\u201394}}\n\nAlthough his first season in the Italian Sport Production Championship was varied, he achieved a pole position in the season's final race at [[Misano Circuit|Misano]], where he would ultimately finish on the podium. By the second year, Rossi had been provided with a factory Mito by Lusuardi and won the Italian title.\n\nIn 1994, Rossi raced in the Italian 125 CC Championship with a prototype called Sandroni, using a Rotax engine. The bike was built by Guido Mancini, a former rider and mechanic who had worked, in the past, with [[Loris Capirossi]]. A documentary about Mancini, called \"Mancini, the Motorcycle Wizard\" (Il Mago Mancini), was released in 2016 by director Jeffrey Zani and explains the birth of the motorcycle and the relationship between Rossi and the mechanic.\n\nIn 1995, Rossi switched to Aprilia and won the Italian 125 CC Championship.

Critics say that compared to the other manufacturers, Ducati had a significant way to go before being competitive even with Rossi at the helm. This proved to be the truth with Ducati's lacklustre performance in the 2004 season, which had actually been worse than their inaugural year in MotoGP in 2003.

Valentino often found himself battling on the track with Capirossi and Biaggi, dubbing them ''\"the three musketeers\"'' by the Italian press. While the rivalry with Capirossi never escalated and the two always were on good terms with each other, the rivalry with Biaggi had been growing since the mid-1990s, even though both didn't race against each other until the 2000 season when Rossi first joined the 500cc class.\n\nBefore the first race of the 2001 season even started, Rossi and Biaggi already got into a heated argument when Biaggi encountered Rossi at a restaurant in Suzuka and told him to ''\"wash your mouth out before saying my name\"''.

Neither rider admitted that they got into a fist fight, but Biaggi appeared in the post-race press conference with red marks and scratches on his face, which he said ''\"must have been caused by a mosquito bite\"''.

During the race, Rossi and Biaggi fought hard but eventually, Rossi crossed the line 0.210 seconds ahead of Biaggi, dealing a critical psychological blow to Biaggi, with Rossi calling the race ''\"one of the best of his career\"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/04/18/moto.safrica/|title=CNN.com - Rossi celebrates a welcome victory - Apr 18, 2004|website=edition.cnn.com|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZIi4PN_z9Q|title=Historic MotoGP\u2122 Battles -- Rossi vs Biaggi|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=24 April 2019|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography ''What If I'd Never Tried It?'', Rossi makes a number of claims about the reasons for his rivalry with Biaggi, and some of the incidents which led to its escalation.

Over the course of the season, Rossi and Stoner frequently battled for wins - particularly in [[2007 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix|Catalunya]] and [[2007 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix|China]] - but the young Australian had the better of Rossi in many of the races thanks to the strong Ducati and Bridgestone combination and the underperforming Yamaha Rossi had, resulting in his claiming of the 2007 MotoGP World Championship title.\n\nStoner's and Rossi's rivalry came to a dramatic climax at the [[2008 United States motorcycle Grand Prix|2008 United States GP]]. After numerous position changes, Rossi overtook Stoner at the Corkscrew.

Initially, relationships were friendly; Rossi won the 2008 title while Lorenzo suffered two serious crashes at [[2008 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix|Shanghai]] and [[2008 United States motorcycle Grand Prix|Laguna Seca]] which prevented any serious rivalries from ever starting to begin with, Rossi more concentrated on his rivalry with Casey Stoner at the time.\n\nIn 2009, Rossi and Lorenzo resumed hostilities with Rossi emerging as champion again. Over the course of the season, Rossi defeated Lorenzo in several tight battles - such as [[2009 Dutch TT|Assen]], [[2009 German motorcycle Grand Prix|Sachsenring]], [[2009 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|Valencia]] and, most memorably, Lorenzo's home race in [[2009 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix|Catalunya]]. Both were battling hard on the Catalan circuit, with Lorenzo taking the lead on the final lap. Rossi tried to overtake him in the usual spots but failed, with many assuming Lorenzo was going to win the race. However, Rossi managed to pass him going into the final corner, where many assumed overtaking was impossible, to take an unlikely victory.\n\nIn 2010, Lorenzo finally emerged victorious in the championship battle after Rossi first injured his shoulder at a motocross accident two weeks before the [[2010 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Spanish race]] and then suffered a displaced compound fracture of his right tibia during a free practice fall at the [[2010 Italian motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Italian round]], which caused him to miss four races.

However, tempers would again flare two years later, once more in [[2018 Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix|Argentina]].

The biggest moment of their rivalry came at the [[2017 French motorcycle Grand Prix|Le Mans in 2017]] when Rossi and Vi\u00f1ales battled hard for the lead, coming into contact with each other a few times.

In the beginning he was known as \"Rossifumi\", inspired by [[Norifumi Abe]], who made a spectacular debut in the 500cc class in [[1994 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix|Japan]].\n\nSince dominating the 500 cc category later known as MotoGP, \"The Doctor\" has become the nickname of choice for Rossi. Two theories prevail as to why Rossi uses \"The Doctor.\" One is that Rossi adopted the nickname upon having earned a degree, which in Italy entitles one to use the title \"Doctor.\" Another, as spoken by Graziano himself, \"The Doctor because, I don't think there is a particular reason, but it's beautiful, and is important, The Doctor. And in Italy, The Doctor is a name you give to someone for respect, it's very important, The Doctor... important.\"<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Graziano Rossi|Rossi, Graziano]]|year=2003|title=Faster (2003)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368721|medium=Motion picture|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|location=Madrid, Spain|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> Rossi often jokes, however, that the name arrived because in Italy, Rossi is a common surname for doctors.\n\nHe has always raced with the number No. 46 in his motorcycle grand prix career, the number his father had raced with in the first of his 3 grand prix career wins in 1979, in [[Yugoslavia]], on a 250c [[Morbidelli]]. Typically, a World Championship winner is awarded the No. 1 sticker for the next season. However, in a homage to Britain's [[Barry Sheene]], who was the first rider of the modern era to keep the same number (#7), Rossi has stayed with the now-famous No. 46 throughout his career, though as the world champion he has worn the No. 1 on the shoulder of his racing leathers.\n\nThe text on his helmet refers to the name of his group of friends: \"The Tribe of the Chihuahua,\" and the letters WLF on his leathers stand for \"Viva La Figa,\" Italian for \"Long Live Pussy.\" He has so far escaped any sanctions or ultimatums that he remove the letters because the \"W\" in \"WLF\" represents the two \"V\"s in \"ViVa.\" Equally obvious is his success at escaping any disciplinary action from the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] or [[Dorna Sports]] for having the letters so brazenly on the front neck area of his leathers. He traditionally also incorporates his favorite color (fluorescent yellow) into his leather designs. This has also earned him the nickname \"Highlighter Pen\" more recently. It is most commonly used by commentators [[Toby Moody]] and Julian Ryder.\n\nFellow motorcycle racer and former teammate [[Colin Edwards]], as well as some TV journalists, have often referred to him as 'the GOAT' (Greatest of all Time).<ref>{{cite video|year=2003|title=Fastest (2003)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368721|medium=Motion picture|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|location=Madrid, Spain|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Other motorsport activities==\n[[File:Wales Rally Gb 2008 Valentino Rossi.JPG|thumb|right|Rossi competing on the shakedown stage for the [[2008 Rally GB]]]]\nRossi tested the [[Ferrari]] Formula One car in 2006 on 31 January 1 February, and 2 February at [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Valencia]].

His helmets are manufactured by [[AGV (helmet manufacturer)|AGV]].<ref name=\"AGVRossihelmets\">{{cite web|url=http://store.agv.com/c/valentino-rossi-helmets|title=AGV Official Valentino Rossi helmets|publisher=AGV|accessdate=15 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922070643/http://store.agv.com/c/valentino-rossi-helmets|archive-date=22 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Aldo Drudi was associated with Rossi's helmet graphics in 2010.

In {{MGP|1996}} and {{MGP|1997}}, [[Alpinestars]] was a sponsor on his bike, but did not supply Rossi with leathers. [[Alpinestars]] just supplied racing boots for Rossi. After Rossi joined the [[Yamaha Motor Racing|Yamaha Factory Team]], the team wore shirts from Alpinestars, while Rossi maintained his association with Dainese. In {{MGP|2011}} and {{MGP|2012}}, Rossi was a member of the [[Ducati Corse|Ducati factory team]], where the team wore shirts from [[Puma SE|Puma]], while Rossi still maintained his association with Dainese. In 2016, Rossi has a new jacket from [[Dainese]]. His jacket has a different graphic compared with Alpinestars Movistar Yamaha jacket.\n\n==Pre-ride rituals==\n[[File:Valentino Rossi 2010 Qatar GP 1.jpg|thumb|right|Rossi at the [[2010 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Qatar Grand Prix]].]]\nRossi is superstitious and renowned for his pre-ride rituals. On a race day, he will always watch the beginning of the Moto3 race to see how long the starting lights remain lit before going out at the start of the race. Prior to riding (whether racing, qualifying, or practice), he will start his personal ritual by stopping about two metres from his bike, bending over and reaching for his boots. Then, when arriving at his bike, he will crouch down and hold the right-side foot-peg, with his head bowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorcyclistonline.com/valentino-rossi-motogp-rituals-from-circuit-of-the-americas-austin|title= Valentino Rossi\u2019s MotoGP Rituals|date=26 April 2017|author=Zack Courts|publisher=Motorcyclist Online|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref> In an interview, Rossi said \"It\u2019s just a moment to focus and \u2018talk\u2019 to my bike, like moving from one place to the next.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Valentino+Rossi/articles/VyUzAroFUYH/Zimbio+Exclusive+Interview+Valentino+Rossi |title=Zimbio Exclusive: Interview with Valentino Rossi |publisher=Zimbio.com |accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref> He adjusts the fit of his leathers by standing straight up on the foot-pegs, whilst riding down the pit-lane before the start of race or practice. He also revealed in an interview with MotoGP.com that he always puts one particular boot on before the other, as well as one particular glove on before the other, and that he always gets on the bike the same way. He also gets off the bike in the same way, swinging his right leg over the front of the bike.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2018/01/18/racing-together-superstition/248214|title= Racing Together: Superstition|author=Matthew Miles|publisher=MotoGP|date=18 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAfter leaving the family home in Tavullia, he moved to Milan, before taking up residency in London, England during his period with Honda. During this time he acquired a villa in [[Ibiza]] which he still owns,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2752342/Valentino-Rossi-two-wheels-god.html|title=Valentino Rossi: two wheels god|author=Rory Ross|work=Daily Telegraph|date=17 May 2008|accessdate=15 August 2010|location=London}}</ref> and following the tax case returned to his main residence to live close to his family in Italy.

The anarchists considered Rossi \"guilty\" because at the time he rode for Honda's MotoGP factory team, it had been sponsored by the oil company [[Repsol]] since 1994, (for which he filmed a commercial in Spain.) with their logo displayed on both the motorcycle and on his race suits.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Valentino Rossi|url = http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/12/15/la-trincea-spagnola-dei-nuovi-anarchici.html|language = it}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2005 he received an honorary degree in Communications and Advertising for Organizations.

Having previously unsuccessfully investigated Rossi for tax evasion in 2002, the authorities announced they were investigating Rossi for undeclared revenues of 112 million euros ($160 million) between 2000 and 2004. The officials said, against the European Taxes Agreements among European countries, Rossi's London residency has enabled him to take advantage of favourable tax conditions, such as only declaring earnings made in Britain and avoiding taxes on his lucrative merchandising and sponsorship contracts, commenting that Rossi had residency in London but his \"centre of interests\" wasn't there, as shown by a thorough investigation.<ref>[http://www.gazzetta.it/Motori/Motomondiale/MotoGP/Primo_Piano/2007/08_Agosto/15/fiscocontrorossi.shtml Fisco, Rossi incastrato cos\u00ec] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406193625/http://www.gazzetta.it/Motori/Motomondiale/MotoGP/Primo_Piano/2007/08_Agosto/15/fiscocontrorossi.shtml |date=6 April 2016 }}, La Gazzetta dello Sport, 15 agosto 2007</ref> It noted that in 2002, Rossi's Italian tax form declared earnings of 500 euros, while sponsorship contracts were all reported to be made out to foreign companies, but with his affairs controlled mainly from Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28907020070809|title=Motorcycle champ Rossi's tax probe shocks Italy|date=9 August 2007|website=Reuters.com}}</ref> In February 2008, Rossi announced that he had reached a settlement with the Italian tax authorities: he paid 35 million euros to close the tax case.

All of those titles were won in a dominant manner, being decided before the final round on all occasions.

Rossi led the championship for the vast majority of the 2015 season before being surpassed by team colleague [[Jorge Lorenzo]] in the final round at Valencia, with Rossi losing out as a result of a grid penalty sustained for a controversial clash with Honda rider [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] in the previous [[2015 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix|Malaysian]] round. During Rossi's second stint at Yamaha, M\u00e1rquez won multiple titles in succession with Rossi often having to settle for podium finishes and only occasional wins.

Both Valentino and Graziano had started looking at moving into the Italian 100cc series, as well as the corresponding European series, which most likely would have pushed him into the direction of [[Formula One]]. However, the high cost of racing karts led to the decision to race minimoto exclusively.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Through 1992 and 1993, Valentino continued to learn the ins and outs of minimoto racing.\n\nIn 1993, with help from his father, [[Virginio Ferrari]], Claudio Castiglioni and [[Claudio Lusuardi]] (who ran the official [[Cagiva]] Sport Production team), Rossi rode a [[Cagiva Mito]] 125cc motorcycle for the team, which he damaged in a first-corner crash no more than a hundred metres from the pit lane.{{sfnp|Rossi|2006|p=93\u201394}} He finished ninth that race weekend.{{sfnp|Rossi|2006|p=93\u201394}}\n\nAlthough his first season in the Italian Sport Production Championship was varied, he achieved a pole position in the season's final race at [[Misano Circuit|Misano]], where he would ultimately finish on the podium. By the second year, Rossi had been provided with a factory Mito by Lusuardi and won the Italian title.\n\nIn 1994, Rossi raced in the Italian 125 CC Championship with a prototype called Sandroni, using a Rotax engine. The bike was built by Guido Mancini, a former rider and mechanic who had worked, in the past, with [[Loris Capirossi]]. A documentary about Mancini, called \"Mancini, the Motorcycle Wizard\" (Il Mago Mancini), was released in 2016 by director Jeffrey Zani and explains the birth of the motorcycle and the relationship between Rossi and the mechanic.\n\nIn 1995, Rossi switched to Aprilia and won the Italian 125 CC Championship.

Critics say that compared to the other manufacturers, Ducati had a significant way to go before being competitive even with Rossi at the helm. This proved to be the truth with Ducati's lacklustre performance in the 2004 season, which had actually been worse than their inaugural year in MotoGP in 2003.

Valentino often found himself battling on the track with Capirossi and Biaggi, dubbing them ''\"the three musketeers\"'' by the Italian press. While the rivalry with Capirossi never escalated and the two always were on good terms with each other, the rivalry with Biaggi had been growing since the mid-1990s, even though both didn't race against each other until the 2000 season when Rossi first joined the 500cc class.\n\nBefore the first race of the 2001 season even started, Rossi and Biaggi already got into a heated argument when Biaggi encountered Rossi at a restaurant in Suzuka and told him to ''\"wash your mouth out before saying my name\"''.

Neither rider admitted that they got into a fist fight, but Biaggi appeared in the post-race press conference with red marks and scratches on his face, which he said ''\"must have been caused by a mosquito bite\"''.

During the race, Rossi and Biaggi fought hard but eventually, Rossi crossed the line 0.210 seconds ahead of Biaggi, dealing a critical psychological blow to Biaggi, with Rossi calling the race ''\"one of the best of his career\"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/04/18/moto.safrica/|title=CNN.com - Rossi celebrates a welcome victory - Apr 18, 2004|website=edition.cnn.com|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZIi4PN_z9Q|title=Historic MotoGP\u2122 Battles -- Rossi vs Biaggi|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=24 April 2019|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his autobiography ''What If I'd Never Tried It?'', Rossi makes a number of claims about the reasons for his rivalry with Biaggi, and some of the incidents which led to its escalation.

Over the course of the season, Rossi and Stoner frequently battled for wins - particularly in [[2007 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix|Catalunya]] and [[2007 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix|China]] - but the young Australian had the better of Rossi in many of the races thanks to the strong Ducati and Bridgestone combination and the underperforming Yamaha Rossi had, resulting in his claiming of the 2007 MotoGP World Championship title.\n\nStoner's and Rossi's rivalry came to a dramatic climax at the [[2008 United States motorcycle Grand Prix|2008 United States GP]]. After numerous position changes, Rossi overtook Stoner at the Corkscrew. The move caused Rossi to run into the dirt and broken pavement on the inside of the right turn, and his rejoining the track came close to causing a collision between the two riders.

Initially, relationships were friendly; Rossi won the 2008 title while Lorenzo suffered two serious crashes at [[2008 Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix|Shanghai]] and [[2008 United States motorcycle Grand Prix|Laguna Seca]] which prevented any serious rivalries from ever starting to begin with, Rossi more concentrated on his rivalry with Casey Stoner at the time.\n\nIn 2009, Rossi and Lorenzo resumed hostilities with Rossi emerging as champion again. Over the course of the season, Rossi defeated Lorenzo in several tight battles - such as [[2009 Dutch TT|Assen]], [[2009 German motorcycle Grand Prix|Sachsenring]], [[2009 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|Valencia]] and, most memorably, Lorenzo's home race in [[2009 Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix|Catalunya]]. Both were battling hard on the Catalan circuit, with Lorenzo taking the lead on the final lap. Rossi tried to overtake him in the usual spots but failed, with many assuming Lorenzo was going to win the race. However, Rossi managed to pass him going into the final corner, where many assumed overtaking was impossible, to take an unlikely victory.\n\nIn 2010, Lorenzo finally emerged victorious in the championship battle after Rossi first injured his shoulder at a motocross accident two weeks before the [[2010 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Spanish race]] and then suffered a displaced compound fracture of his right tibia during a free practice fall at the [[2010 Italian motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Italian round]], which caused him to miss four races.

However, tempers would again flare two years later, once more in [[2018 Argentine motorcycle Grand Prix|Argentina]].

The biggest moment of their rivalry came at the [[2017 French motorcycle Grand Prix|Le Mans in 2017]] when Rossi and Vi\u00f1ales battled hard for the lead, coming into contact with each other a few times.

In the beginning he was known as \"Rossifumi\", inspired by [[Norifumi Abe]], who made a spectacular debut in the 500cc class in [[1994 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix|Japan]].\n\nSince dominating the 500 cc category later known as MotoGP, \"The Doctor\" has become the nickname of choice for Rossi. Two theories prevail as to why Rossi uses \"The Doctor.\" One is that Rossi adopted the nickname upon having earned a degree, which in Italy entitles one to use the title \"Doctor.\" Another, as spoken by Graziano himself, \"The Doctor because, I don't think there is a particular reason, but it's beautiful, and is important, The Doctor. And in Italy, The Doctor is a name you give to someone for respect, it's very important, The Doctor... important.\"<ref>{{cite video|people=[[Graziano Rossi|Rossi, Graziano]]|year=2003|title=Faster (2003)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368721|medium=Motion picture|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|location=Madrid, Spain|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> Rossi often jokes, however, that the name arrived because in Italy, Rossi is a common surname for doctors.\n\nHe has always raced with the number No. 46 in his motorcycle grand prix career, the number his father had raced with in the first of his 3 grand prix career wins in 1979, in [[Yugoslavia]], on a 250c [[Morbidelli]]. Typically, a World Championship winner is awarded the No. 1 sticker for the next season. However, in a homage to Britain's [[Barry Sheene]], who was the first rider of the modern era to keep the same number (#7), Rossi has stayed with the now-famous No. 46 throughout his career, though as the world champion he has worn the No. 1 on the shoulder of his racing leathers.\n\nThe text on his helmet refers to the name of his group of friends: \"The Tribe of the Chihuahua,\" and the letters WLF on his leathers stand for \"Viva La Figa,\" Italian for \"Long Live Pussy.\" He has so far escaped any sanctions or ultimatums that he remove the letters because the \"W\" in \"WLF\" represents the two \"V\"s in \"ViVa.\" Equally obvious is his success at escaping any disciplinary action from the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme|FIM]] or [[Dorna Sports]] for having the letters so brazenly on the front neck area of his leathers. He traditionally also incorporates his favorite color (fluorescent yellow) into his leather designs. This has also earned him the nickname \"Highlighter Pen\" more recently. It is most commonly used by commentators [[Toby Moody]] and Julian Ryder.\n\nFellow motorcycle racer and former teammate [[Colin Edwards]], as well as some TV journalists, have often referred to him as 'the GOAT' (Greatest of all Time).<ref>{{cite video|year=2003|title=Fastest (2003)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368721|medium=Motion picture|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|location=Madrid, Spain|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Other motorsport activities==\n[[File:Wales Rally Gb 2008 Valentino Rossi.JPG|thumb|right|Rossi competing on the shakedown stage for the [[2008 Rally GB]]]]\nRossi tested the [[Ferrari]] Formula One car in 2006 on 31 January 1 February, and 2 February at [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Valencia]].

In {{MGP|1996}} and {{MGP|1997}}, [[Alpinestars]] was a sponsor on his bike, but did not supply Rossi with leathers. [[Alpinestars]] just supplied racing boots for Rossi. After Rossi joined the [[Yamaha Motor Racing|Yamaha Factory Team]], the team wore shirts from Alpinestars, while Rossi maintained his association with Dainese. In {{MGP|2011}} and {{MGP|2012}}, Rossi was a member of the [[Ducati Corse|Ducati factory team]], where the team wore shirts from [[Puma SE|Puma]], while Rossi still maintained his association with Dainese. In 2016, Rossi has a new jacket from [[Dainese]]. His jacket has a different graphic compared with Alpinestars Movistar Yamaha jacket.\n\n==Pre-ride rituals==\n[[File:Valentino Rossi 2010 Qatar GP 1.jpg|thumb|right|Rossi at the [[2010 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix|2010 Qatar Grand Prix]].]]\nRossi is superstitious and renowned for his pre-ride rituals. On a race day, he will always watch the beginning of the Moto3 race to see how long the starting lights remain lit before going out at the start of the race. Prior to riding (whether racing, qualifying, or practice), he will start his personal ritual by stopping about two metres from his bike, bending over and reaching for his boots. Then, when arriving at his bike, he will crouch down and hold the right-side foot-peg, with his head bowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorcyclistonline.com/valentino-rossi-motogp-rituals-from-circuit-of-the-americas-austin|title= Valentino Rossi\u2019s MotoGP Rituals|date=26 April 2017|author=Zack Courts|publisher=Motorcyclist Online|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref> In an interview, Rossi said \"It\u2019s just a moment to focus and \u2018talk\u2019 to my bike, like moving from one place to the next.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Valentino+Rossi/articles/VyUzAroFUYH/Zimbio+Exclusive+Interview+Valentino+Rossi |title=Zimbio Exclusive: Interview with Valentino Rossi |publisher=Zimbio.com |accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref> He adjusts the fit of his leathers by standing straight up on the foot-pegs, whilst riding down the pit-lane before the start of race or practice. He also revealed in an interview with MotoGP.com that he always puts one particular boot on before the other, as well as one particular glove on before the other, and that he always gets on the bike the same way. He also gets off the bike in the same way, swinging his right leg over the front of the bike.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2018/01/18/racing-together-superstition/248214|title= Racing Together: Superstition|author=Matthew Miles|publisher=MotoGP|date=18 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nAfter leaving the family home in Tavullia, he moved to Milan, before taking up residency in London, England during his period with Honda. During this time he acquired a villa in [[Ibiza]] which he still owns,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2752342/Valentino-Rossi-two-wheels-god.html|title=Valentino Rossi: two wheels god|author=Rory Ross|work=Daily Telegraph|date=17 May 2008|accessdate=15 August 2010|location=London}}</ref> and following the tax case returned to his main residence to live close to his family in Italy.

The anarchists considered Rossi \"guilty\" because at the time he rode for Honda's MotoGP factory team, it had been sponsored by the oil company [[Repsol]] since 1994, (for which he filmed a commercial in Spain.) with their logo displayed on both the motorcycle and on his race suits.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Valentino Rossi|url = http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/12/15/la-trincea-spagnola-dei-nuovi-anarchici.html|language = it}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2005 he received an honorary degree in Communications and Advertising for Organizations.

Having previously unsuccessfully investigated Rossi for tax evasion in 2002, the authorities announced they were investigating Rossi for undeclared revenues of 112 million euros ($160 million) between 2000 and 2004. The officials said, against the European Taxes Agreements among European countries, Rossi's London residency has enabled him to take advantage of favourable tax conditions, such as only declaring earnings made in Britain and avoiding taxes on his lucrative merchandising and sponsorship contracts, commenting that Rossi had residency in London but his \"centre of interests\" wasn't there, as shown by a thorough investigation.<ref>[http://www.gazzetta.it/Motori/Motomondiale/MotoGP/Primo_Piano/2007/08_Agosto/15/fiscocontrorossi.shtml Fisco, Rossi incastrato cos\u00ec] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406193625/http://www.gazzetta.it/Motori/Motomondiale/MotoGP/Primo_Piano/2007/08_Agosto/15/fiscocontrorossi.shtml |date=6 April 2016 }}, La Gazzetta dello Sport, 15 agosto 2007</ref> It noted that in 2002, Rossi's Italian tax form declared earnings of 500 euros, while sponsorship contracts were all reported to be made out to foreign companies, but with his affairs controlled mainly from Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-28907020070809|title=Motorcycle champ Rossi's tax probe shocks Italy|date=9 August 2007|website=Reuters.com}}</ref> In February 2008, Rossi announced that he had reached a settlement with the Italian tax authorities: he paid 35 million euros to close the tax case.

The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right. The left one is situated both on the [[moraine]] plateau ({{convert|10|to|25|m|1|abbr=on}} above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. {{convert|6.5|m|1|abbr=on}} above Vistula level).

It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.\n\nThe plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of [[clay pit]]s. The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical. The left side consists mainly of two levels: the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one the flood plain terrace. The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground [[depression (geology)|depressions]] with water systems coming from the old Vistula&nbsp;\u2013 riverbed. They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the Vistula plain terraces (flooded as well as formerly flooded), and only a small part is a not so visible moraine escarpment. [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] sand with a number of dunes parted by [[peat]] swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace.

There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] is situated. In the 19th century the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: [[Ginkgo biloba|maidenhair tree]], [[Juglans nigra|black walnut]], [[Corylus colurna|Turkish hazel]] and [[Pterocarya fraxinifolia|Caucasian wingnut]] trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. \u0141azienki Park covers an area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its [[landscape architecture]] (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, water cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carp in the pond. Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers an area of 43 ha. Its central [[Garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise|French-styled area]] corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Kr\u00f3likarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.\n\n[[File:Reservoir Warsaw.jpg|thumb|[[Saxon Garden]] with the Temple of Vesta]]\n\nOther green spaces in the city include the [[Botanical garden|Botanic Garden]] and the University Library garden.

The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered a stereotype popular among the dwellers of other cities claiming that average Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.

All state agencies are located there, including the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]], the [[President of Poland|Presidential Office]] and the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]]. In the Polish parliament the city and the area are represented by 31 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] (out of 460). Additionally, Warsaw elects two [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament).\n\n[[Sejm|The Sejm]] is the lower house of the Polish parliament. The Sejm is made up of 460 deputies, or Pose\u0142 in Polish (literally 'Envoy'). It is elected by universal ballot and is presided over by a speaker called the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (Marsza\u0142ek Sejmu).\n\n===Municipal government===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\n\nThe municipal government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City Council&nbsp;\u2013 ''Miejska Rada Narodowa''&nbsp;\u2013 governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the system of city administration has been changed several times&nbsp;\u2013 also as the result of the reform which restored ''[[powiat]]''s, cancelled in 1975. Finally, according to the ''Warsaw Act'', the city is divided into 18 districts and forms one ''city powiat'' with a unified municipal government.<ref name=\"admin\">{{cite web |url=http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |title=Administration |work=e-warsaw.pl |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218181549/http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |archive-date=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pa\u0142ac Komisji Rz\u0105dowej Przychod\u00f3w i Skarbu w Warszawie 2018.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neoclassical architecture in Poland|Neoclassical]] Commission Palace, the house of the city's government]]\n\nThe basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (''[[gmina]]'').<ref name=\"altrock\">{{cite book |author=Uwe Altrock|title=Spatial planning and urban development in the new EU member states: from adjustment to reinvention|year=2006 |page=262 |pages=|chapter=|chapterurl=|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|location=|isbn=0-7546-4684-X |url=|accessdate=}}</ref> A city is also a commune&nbsp;\u2013 but with a city charter.<ref name=\"altrock\"/> Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor&nbsp;\u2013 but in the communes the mayor is [[vogt]] (''w\u00f3jt'' in Polish), however in the cities&nbsp;\u2013 ''burmistrz''. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division&nbsp;\u2013 counties (''powiaty'' in Polish). An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a ''gmina'' cannot register cars, this is a ''powiat's'' task (i.e. a registration number depends on what ''powiat'' a car had been registered in, not the ''gmina''). In this case we say \"city county\" or ''powiat grodzki''. Such cities are for example [[Lublin]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Gda\u0144sk]], and [[Pozna\u0144]]. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of a ''powiat''{{'s}} entitlements&nbsp;\u2013 like the already mentioned car registration. For example, the Wola district has its own evidence and the Ursyn\u00f3w district&nbsp;\u2013 its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than those from Ursyn\u00f3w). But for instance the districts in Krak\u00f3w do not have the entitlements of a ''powiat'', so the registration numbers in Krak\u00f3w are of the same type for all districts.\n\n[[File:Dutch Embassy in Warsaw 2016.jpg|thumb|Embassy of the Netherlands]]\n\n[[Legislature|Legislative power]] in Warsaw is vested in a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Warsaw City Council]] (''Rada Miasta''), which comprises 60 members.<ref name=\"admin\"/> Council members are elected directly every five years (since [[2018_Polish_local_elections|2018 election]]). Like most legislative bodies, the city council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government.<ref name=\"admin\"/> Bills passed by a simple majority are sent to the mayor (the [[List of mayors of Warsaw|President of Warsaw]]), who may sign them into law. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nEach of the 18 separate city districts has its own council (''Rada dzielnicy'').<ref name=\"admin\"/> Their duties are focused on aiding the President and the City Council, as well as supervising various municipal companies, city-owned property and schools. The head of each of the District Councils is named the Mayor (''Burmistrz'') and is elected by the local council from the candidates proposed by the President of Warsaw.\n\nThe mayor of Warsaw is called President. Generally, in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called ''presidents''&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. cities with over 100,000 people or that had a president before 1990. The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695\u20131696).<ref name=Petrozolin/> Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw presidents simultaneously led the [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1975-1998)|Warsaw Voivode]]. Since 1990 the President of Warsaw had been elected by the [[city council]].<ref name=\"djordjevic\"/> In the years of 1994\u20131999 the mayor of the district Centrum automatically was designated as the President of Warsaw: the mayor of Centrum was elected by the district council of Centrum and the council was elected only by the Centrum residents. Since 2002 the President of Warsaw is elected by all of the citizens of Warsaw.<ref name=\"djordjevic\"/>\n\nThe current [[List of mayors of Warsaw|President of Warsaw]] is [[Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski]]. The first president elected according these rules was [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]].

In the Champions League season 1995/96 they reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] Athens.\n\nTheir local rivals, [[Polonia Warsaw]], have significantly fewer supporters, yet they managed to win the country's championship two times (in 1946 and 2000) and won the cup twice as well. Polonia's home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, a ten-minute walk north from the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]].

Another is located on the bank of the Vistula River near \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski Bridge and another on Karowa Street.\n\nThe origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The best-known legend, by Artur Oppman, is that long ago two of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]'s daughters set out on a journey through the depths of the oceans and seas. One of them decided to stay on the coast of Denmark and can be seen sitting at the entrance to the port of [[Copenhagen]]. The second mermaid reached the mouth of the [[Vistula]] River and plunged into its waters. She stopped to rest on a sandy beach by the village of Warszowa, where fishermen came to admire her beauty and listen to her beautiful voice. A greedy merchant also heard her songs; he followed the fishermen and captured the mermaid.<ref name=\"legend\"/>\n\nAnother legend says that a mermaid once swam to Warsaw from the [[Baltic Sea]] for the love of the Griffin, the ancient defender of the city, who was killed in a struggle against the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasions]] of the 17th century. The mermaid, wishing to avenge his death, took the position of defender of Warsaw, becoming the symbol of the city.<ref name=\"legend\"/>\n\nEvery member of the [[Queen's Royal Hussars]] of the UK's light [[cavalry]] wears the ''Maid of Warsaw'', the crest of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress.<ref name=qohmuseum/> Members of [[No. 651 Squadron RAF|651 Squadron Army Air Corps]] of the United Kingdom also wear the ''Maid of Warsaw'' on the left sleeve of their No. 2 (Service) Dress.<ref name=RAF/>\n\n==Famous people==\n{{further|Category:People from Warsaw}}\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Marie Curie c1920.jpg\n| image2 = Benoit Mandelbrot, TED 2010.jpg\n| image3 = Samuel Goldwyn - Jul 1919 EH.jpg\n| image4 = Tamara \u0141empicka ssj 20060914 - cropped.jpg\n| footer = Famous people born in Warsaw, clockwise from upper left: [[Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]], [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and [[Tamara de Lempicka]]\n}}\n\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\nOne of the most famous people born in Warsaw was [[Marie Curie|Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]], who achieved international recognition for her research on radioactivity and was the first female recipient of the Nobel Prize.<ref name=nobelprize/> Famous musicians include [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]].

The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right. The left one is situated both on the [[moraine]] plateau ({{convert|10|to|25|m|1|abbr=on}} above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. {{convert|6.5|m|1|abbr=on}} above Vistula level).

It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.\n\nThe plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of [[clay pit]]s. The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical. The left side consists mainly of two levels: the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one the flood plain terrace. The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground [[depression (geology)|depressions]] with water systems coming from the old Vistula&nbsp;\u2013 riverbed. They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the Vistula plain terraces (flooded as well as formerly flooded), and only a small part is a not so visible moraine escarpment. [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] sand with a number of dunes parted by [[peat]] swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace.

There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] is situated. In the 19th century the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: [[Ginkgo biloba|maidenhair tree]], [[Juglans nigra|black walnut]], [[Corylus colurna|Turkish hazel]] and [[Pterocarya fraxinifolia|Caucasian wingnut]] trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. \u0141azienki Park covers an area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its [[landscape architecture]] (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, water cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carp in the pond. Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers an area of 43 ha. Its central [[Garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise|French-styled area]] corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Kr\u00f3likarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.\n\n[[File:Reservoir Warsaw.jpg|thumb|[[Saxon Garden]] with the Temple of Vesta]]\n\nOther green spaces in the city include the [[Botanical garden|Botanic Garden]] and the University Library garden.

The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered a stereotype popular among the dwellers of other cities claiming that average Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.

All state agencies are located there, including the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]], the [[President of Poland|Presidential Office]] and the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]]. In the Polish parliament the city and the area are represented by 31 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] (out of 460). Additionally, Warsaw elects two [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament).\n\n[[Sejm|The Sejm]] is the lower house of the Polish parliament. The Sejm is made up of 460 deputies, or Pose\u0142 in Polish (literally 'Envoy'). It is elected by universal ballot and is presided over by a speaker called the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (Marsza\u0142ek Sejmu).\n\n===Municipal government===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\n\nThe municipal government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City Council&nbsp;\u2013 ''Miejska Rada Narodowa''&nbsp;\u2013 governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the system of city administration has been changed several times&nbsp;\u2013 also as the result of the reform which restored ''[[powiat]]''s, cancelled in 1975. Finally, according to the ''Warsaw Act'', the city is divided into 18 districts and forms one ''city powiat'' with a unified municipal government.<ref name=\"admin\">{{cite web |url=http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |title=Administration |work=e-warsaw.pl |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218181549/http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |archive-date=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pa\u0142ac Komisji Rz\u0105dowej Przychod\u00f3w i Skarbu w Warszawie 2018.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neoclassical architecture in Poland|Neoclassical]] Commission Palace, the house of the city's government]]\n\nThe basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (''[[gmina]]'').<ref name=\"altrock\">{{cite book |author=Uwe Altrock|title=Spatial planning and urban development in the new EU member states: from adjustment to reinvention|year=2006 |page=262 |pages=|chapter=|chapterurl=|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|location=|isbn=0-7546-4684-X |url=|accessdate=}}</ref> A city is also a commune&nbsp;\u2013 but with a city charter.<ref name=\"altrock\"/> Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor&nbsp;\u2013 but in the communes the mayor is [[vogt]] (''w\u00f3jt'' in Polish), however in the cities&nbsp;\u2013 ''burmistrz''. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division&nbsp;\u2013 counties (''powiaty'' in Polish). An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a ''gmina'' cannot register cars, this is a ''powiat's'' task (i.e. a registration number depends on what ''powiat'' a car had been registered in, not the ''gmina''). In this case we say \"city county\" or ''powiat grodzki''. Such cities are for example [[Lublin]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Gda\u0144sk]], and [[Pozna\u0144]]. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of a ''powiat''{{'s}} entitlements&nbsp;\u2013 like the already mentioned car registration. For example, the Wola district has its own evidence and the Ursyn\u00f3w district&nbsp;\u2013 its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than those from Ursyn\u00f3w). But for instance the districts in Krak\u00f3w do not have the entitlements of a ''powiat'', so the registration numbers in Krak\u00f3w are of the same type for all districts.\n\n[[File:Dutch Embassy in Warsaw 2016.jpg|thumb|Embassy of the Netherlands]]\n\n[[Legislature|Legislative power]] in Warsaw is vested in a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Warsaw City Council]] (''Rada Miasta''), which comprises 60 members.<ref name=\"admin\"/> Council members are elected directly every five years (since [[2018_Polish_local_elections|2018 election]]). Like most legislative bodies, the city council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government.<ref name=\"admin\"/> Bills passed by a simple majority are sent to the mayor (the [[List of mayors of Warsaw|President of Warsaw]]), who may sign them into law. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nEach of the 18 separate city districts has its own council (''Rada dzielnicy'').<ref name=\"admin\"/> Their duties are focused on aiding the President and the City Council, as well as supervising various municipal companies, city-owned property and schools. The head of each of the District Councils is named the Mayor (''Burmistrz'') and is elected by the local council from the candidates proposed by the President of Warsaw.\n\nThe mayor of Warsaw is called President. Generally, in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called ''presidents''&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. cities with over 100,000 people or that had a president before 1990. The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695\u20131696).<ref name=Petrozolin/> Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw presidents simultaneously led the [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1975-1998)|Warsaw Voivode]]. Since 1990 the President of Warsaw had been elected by the [[city council]].<ref name=\"djordjevic\"/> In the years of 1994\u20131999 the mayor of the district Centrum automatically was designated as the President of Warsaw: the mayor of Centrum was elected by the district council of Centrum and the council was elected only by the Centrum residents. Since 2002 the President of Warsaw is elected by all of the citizens of Warsaw.<ref name=\"djordjevic\"/>\n\nThe current [[List of mayors of Warsaw|President of Warsaw]] is [[Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski]]. The first president elected according these rules was [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]].

In the Champions League season 1995/96 they reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] Athens.\n\nTheir local rivals, [[Polonia Warsaw]], have significantly fewer supporters, yet they managed to win the country's championship two times (in 1946 and 2000) and won the cup twice as well. Polonia's home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, a ten-minute walk north from the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]].

Another is located on the bank of the Vistula River near \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski Bridge and another on Karowa Street.\n\nThe origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The best-known legend, by Artur Oppman, is that long ago two of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]'s daughters set out on a journey through the depths of the oceans and seas. One of them decided to stay on the coast of Denmark and can be seen sitting at the entrance to the port of [[Copenhagen]]. The second mermaid reached the mouth of the [[Vistula]] River and plunged into its waters. She stopped to rest on a sandy beach by the village of Warszowa, where fishermen came to admire her beauty and listen to her beautiful voice. A greedy merchant also heard her songs; he followed the fishermen and captured the mermaid.<ref name=\"legend\"/>\n\nAnother legend says that a mermaid once swam to Warsaw from the [[Baltic Sea]] for the love of the Griffin, the ancient defender of the city, who was killed in a struggle against the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasions]] of the 17th century. The mermaid, wishing to avenge his death, took the position of defender of Warsaw, becoming the symbol of the city.<ref name=\"legend\"/>\n\nEvery member of the [[Queen's Royal Hussars]] of the UK's light [[cavalry]] wears the ''Maid of Warsaw'', the crest of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress.<ref name=qohmuseum/> Members of [[No. 651 Squadron RAF|651 Squadron Army Air Corps]] of the United Kingdom also wear the ''Maid of Warsaw'' on the left sleeve of their No. 2 (Service) Dress.<ref name=RAF/>\n\n==Famous people==\n{{further|Category:People from Warsaw}}\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Marie Curie c1920.jpg\n| image2 = Benoit Mandelbrot, TED 2010.jpg\n| image3 = Samuel Goldwyn - Jul 1919 EH.jpg\n| image4 = Tamara \u0141empicka ssj 20060914 - cropped.jpg\n| footer = Famous people born in Warsaw, clockwise from upper left: [[Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]], [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and [[Tamara de Lempicka]]\n}}\n\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\nOne of the most famous people born in Warsaw was [[Marie Curie|Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie]], who achieved international recognition for her research on radioactivity and was the first female recipient of the Nobel Prize.<ref name=nobelprize/> Famous musicians include [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Szpilman]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]].

{"title_page": "Battle of Maguelone", "text_new": "The '''Battle of Maguelone''' was a minor naval action that occurred in late October 1809, during the [[Peninsular War]], between the escort of a French convoy, comprising three ships of the line and two frigates, and a 6-ship strong squadron of the Royal Navy. In a running battle, the French covered the retreat of the convoy and attempted to escape by sailing in shallow waters close to the shore of Maguelone. After two of the ships of the line ran aground, their crew evacuated them and scuttled them by fire after removing valuable equipment, including the artillery. The remaining ship and frigates made good their escape.\n\n== Context ==\nOn 21 October 1809, a squadron of the French Navy under Rear-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Baudin]] left Toulon, escorting a convoy bound for [[Barcelona]]. On 23, off [[Cape Saint Sebastian]], the squadron detected five sails in the West. With a light wind from the East, Baudin ordered the convoy to seek shelter in Baie des Roses, and had his forces sail to the open sea. By noon, 14 British ships were in sight. In the night, the weather deteriorated and the ships had to reduce sail, an operation made difficult and longer than usual by the lack of training of the crew. In the morning of 24, the squadron found itself near the coast, and by 7:30, Baudin ordered his ships to anchor. With 16 metres under keel, he signaled his intention to set sail soon and seek refuge off [[S\u00e8te]].<ref group=note>\"S\u00e8te\" was then written \"Cette\".</ref><ref name=Troude56>Troude, p.56</ref>\n\nCollingwood, having had word of the French attempt to resupply their forces in Barcelona, had left [[Cape Sici\u00e9]] with 15 ships of the line and 5 frigates and was ambushing the convoy off Cape Saint Sebastian. Tow frigates were also posted off Toulon to watch the movements of the French ships.<ref name=Troude56 />\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 25 October 1809, the French squadron left their anchorage of Baie des Roses and sailed to the West, close to shore, with light winds from the East. The British resumed their chase, catching up on the French, as the wind was stronger further off at sea. Baudin ordered ''Pauline'' to run to S\u00e8te to warn of the incoming British squadron and have coastal defences manned and ready. At 11:30, the French ships started to touch bottom, and Baudin gave freedom of manoeuver to his captains. ''Bor\u00e9e'' managed to reach deeped waters, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' ran aground.<ref name=Troude57>Troude, p.57</ref>\n\n''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' rested on a bed of rock and hard sand, ''Lion'' east of ''Robuste'', both ships out of range of the British. Meanwhile, ''Pauline'' and ''Bor\u00e9e'' came in range and exchanged a few shots with HMS ''Tigre'' and ''Leviathan''. Senez, the captaing of ''Bor\u00e9e'', planned to anchor off S\u00e8te, but Ensign Vallat, captain of the aviso ''Proven\u00e7ale'' that was patrolling the area, offered to pilot ''Bor\u00e9e'' into the harbour. The man\u0153uver succeeded, putting ''Bor\u00e9e'' out of reach of the British squadron. ''Pauline'' mirrored the actions of ''Bor\u00e9e'' and also entered the port.<ref name=Troude57 />\n\nWith the sea growing heavier, the British stayed off Baudin's ships, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' were sustaining increasing damage and leaking water.<ref name=Troude57 /> It soon became obvious that the ships could not be raised, and had to be evacuated and scuttled.<ref name=Troude58>Troude, p.58</ref> In the morning of 26, Baudin ordered his crew to abandon ship and set them afire. ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' exploded in the night.<ref name=Troude58 />\n\nOn 1 October, British [[cutting out]] parties from HMS [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']], [[HMS Cumberland (1807)|''Cumberland'']], [[HMS Apollo (1805)|''Apollo'']], [[HMS Topaze (1793)|HMS ''Topaze'']], [[French frigate Volontaire (1796)|''Volontaire'']], [[HMS Scout (1804)|''Scout'']], [[HMS Philomel (1806)|''Philomel'']] and [[French brig Ronco (1808)|''Ronco'']], attacked the convoy anchored at Baie des Roses.

In a running battle, the French covered the retreat of the convoy and attempted to escape by sailing in shallow waters close to the shore of Maguelone. After two of the ships of the line ran aground, their crew evacuated them and scuttled them by fire after removing valuable equipment, including the artillery. The remaining ship and frigates made good their escape.\n\n== Context ==\nOn 21 October 1809, a squadron of the French Navy under Rear-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Baudin]] left Toulon, escorting a convoy bound for [[Barcelona]]. On 23, off [[Cape Saint Sebastian]], the squadron detected five sails in the West. With a light wind from the East, Baudin ordered the convoy to seek shelter in Baie des Roses, and had his forces sail to the open sea. By noon, 14 British ships were in sight. In the night, the weather deteriorated and the ships had to reduce sail, an operation made difficult and longer than usual by the lack of training of the crew. In the morning of 24, the squadron found itself near the coast, and by 7:30, Baudin ordered his ships to anchor. With 16 metres under keel, he signaled his intention to set sail soon and seek refuge off [[S\u00e8te]].<ref group=note>\"S\u00e8te\" was then written \"Cette\".</ref><ref name=Troude56>Troude, p.56</ref>\n\nCollingwood, having had word of the French attempt to resupply their forces in Barcelona, had left [[Cape Sici\u00e9]] with 15 ships of the line and 5 frigates and was ambushing the convoy off Cape Saint Sebastian. Tow frigates were also posted off Toulon to watch the movements of the French ships.<ref name=Troude56 />\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 25 October 1809, the French squadron left their anchorage of Baie des Roses and sailed to the West, close to shore, with light winds from the East. The British resumed their chase, catching up on the French, as the wind was stronger further off at sea. Baudin ordered ''Pauline'' to run to S\u00e8te to warn of the incoming British squadron and have coastal defences manned and ready. At 11:30, the French ships started to touch bottom, and Baudin gave freedom of manoeuver to his captains. ''Bor\u00e9e'' managed to reach deeped waters, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' ran aground.<ref name=Troude57>Troude, p.57</ref>\n\n''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' rested on a bed of rock and hard sand, ''Lion'' east of ''Robuste'', both ships out of range of the British. Meanwhile, ''Pauline'' and ''Bor\u00e9e'' came in range and exchanged a few shots with HMS ''Tigre'' and ''Leviathan''. Senez, the captaing of ''Bor\u00e9e'', planned to anchor off S\u00e8te, but Ensign Vallat, captain of the aviso ''Proven\u00e7ale'' that was patrolling the area, offered to pilot ''Bor\u00e9e'' into the harbour. The man\u0153uver succeeded, putting ''Bor\u00e9e'' out of reach of the British squadron. ''Pauline'' mirrored the actions of ''Bor\u00e9e'' and also entered the port.<ref name=Troude57 />\n\nWith the sea growing heavier, the British stayed off Baudin's ships, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' were sustaining increasing damage and leaking water.<ref name=Troude57 /> It soon became obvious that the ships could not be raised, and had to be evacuated and scuttled.<ref name=Troude58>Troude, p.58</ref> In the morning of 26, Baudin ordered his crew to abandon ship and set them afire. ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' exploded in the night.<ref name=Troude58 />\n\nOn 1 October, British [[cutting out]] parties from HMS [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']], [[HMS Cumberland (1807)|''Cumberland'']], [[HMS Apollo (1805)|''Apollo'']], [[HMS Topaze (1793)|HMS ''Topaze'']], [[French frigate Volontaire (1796)|''Volontaire'']], [[HMS Scout (1804)|''Scout'']], [[HMS Philomel (1806)|''Philomel'']] and [[French brig Ronco (1808)|''Ronco'']], attacked the convoy anchored at Baie des Roses.

It plays a fundamental role in [[binomial nomenclature]], the system of naming [[organisms]], where it is combined with the scientific name of a [[species]]: see [[Specific name (botany)]] and [[Specific name (zoology)]].\n\n=== Use in nomenclature ===\n{{Main|Binomial nomenclature|Taxonomy (biology)|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\nThe rules for the [[scientific name]]s of [[organisms]] are laid down in the [[Nomenclature Codes]], which allow each species a single unique name that, for \"[[animals]]\" (including [[protists]]), \"[[plants]]\" (also including [[algae]] and [[fungi]]) and [[prokaryotes]] ([[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]), is [[Latin]] and binomial in form; this contrasts with [[common name|common]] or [[vernacular]] names, which are non-standardized, can be non-unique, and typically also vary by country and language of usage. \n\nExcept for [[Virus classification|viruses]], the standard format for a [[species]] name comprises the generic name, indicating the genus to which the species belongs, followed by the specific epithet, which (within that genus) is unique to the species. For example, the [[gray wolf]]'s scientific name is {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus}}'',}} with ''[[Canis]]'' (Lat. \"dog\") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and ''lupus'' (Lat. \"wolf\") being the specific name particular to the wolf. A botanical example would be ''[[Hibiscus arnottianus]]'', a particular species of the genus ''[[Hibiscus]]'' native to Hawaii. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by [[subspecies]] names in [[zoology]] or a variety of [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific names]] in [[botany]]. \n\nWhen the generic name is already known from [[Context (language use)|context]], it may be shortened to its initial letter, for example ''C. lupus'' in place of ''Canis lupus''. Where species are further subdivided, the generic name (or its abbreviated form) still forms the leading portion of the scientific name, for example {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus familiaris}}''}} for the domestic dog (when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf) in zoology, or as a botanical example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Hibiscus arnottianus}}'' ssp. ''{{lang|la|immaculatus}}''}}. Also, as visible in the above examples, the Latinised portions of the scientific names of genera and their included species (and infraspecies, where applicable) are, by convention, written in [[Italic type|italics]].\n\nThe scientific names of [[virus]] species are descriptive, not binomial in form, and may or may not incorporate an indication of their containing genus; for example the virus species \"Salmonid herpesvirus 1\", \"Salmonid herpesvirus 2\" and \"Salmonid herpesvirus 3\" are all within the genus ''[[Salmonivirus]]'', however the genus to which the species with the formal names \"[[Everglades virus]]\" and \"[[Ross River virus]]\" are assigned is ''[[Alphavirus]]''.\n\nAs with scientific names at other ranks, in all groups other than viruses, names of genera may be cited with their authorities, typically in the form \"author, year\" in zoology, and \"standard abbreviated author name\" in botany. Thus in the examples above, the genus ''Canis'' would be cited in full as \"''Canis'' Linnaeus, 1758\" (zoological usage), while ''Hibiscus'', also first established by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] but in 1753, is simply \"''Hibiscus'' L.\" (botanical usage).\n\n=== The type concept===\n{{see also|Type genus|Type species|Type specimen}}\nEach genus should have a designated [[type (biology)|type]], although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one. In zoology, this is the [[type species]] and the generic name is permanently associated with the [[type specimen]] of its type species. Should the specimen turn out to be assignable to another genus, the generic name linked to it becomes a [[junior synonym]] and the remaining [[taxon|taxa]] in the former genus need to be reassessed.\n\n===Categories of generic name===\nIn zoological usage, taxonomic names, including those of genera, are classified as \"[[available name|available]]\" or \"unavailable\". Available names are those published in accordance with the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and not otherwise suppressed by subsequent decisions of the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN); the earliest such name for any taxon (for example, a genus) should then be selected as the \"[[valid name (zoology)|valid]]\" (i.e., current or accepted) name for the taxon in question. \n\nConsequently, there will be more available names than valid names at any point in time, which names are currently in use depending on the judgement of taxonomists in either combining taxa described under multiple names, or splitting taxa which may bring available names previously treated as synonyms back into use. \"Unavailable\" names in zoology comprise names that either were not published according to the provisions of the ICZN Code, or have subsequently been suppressed, e.g., incorrect original or subsequent spellings, names published only in a thesis, and generic names published after 1930 with no type species indicated.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\">{{cite book|author=D. L. Hawksworth|title=Terms Used in Bionomenclature: The Naming of Organisms and Plant Communities : Including Terms Used in Botanical, Cultivated Plant, Phylogenetic, Phytosociological, Prokaryote (bacteriological), Virus, and Zoological Nomenclature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qky7_6-UcQQC&pg=PA10|year=2010|publisher=GBIF|isbn=978-87-92020-09-3|pages=1\u2013215}}</ref>\n\nIn botany, similar concepts exist but with different labels. The botanical equivalent of zoology's \"available name\" is a [[validly published name]]. An invalidly published name is a ''nomen invalidum'' or ''nom. inval.''; a rejected name is a ''nomen rejiciendum'' or ''nom. rej.''; a later homonym of a validly published name is a ''nomen illegitimum'' or ''nom. illeg.''; for a full list refer the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICNafp) and the work cited above by Hawksworth, 2010.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\" /> In place of the \"valid taxon\" in zoology, the nearest equivalent in botany is \"[[correct name]]\" or \"current name\" which can, again, differ or change with alternative taxonomic treatments or new information that results in previously accepted genera being combined or split.\n\n[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|Prokaryote]] and [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|virus]] Codes of Nomenclature also exist which serve as a reference for designating currently accepted genus names as opposed to others which may be either reduced to synonymy, or, in the case of prokaryotes, relegated to a status of \"names without standing in prokaryotic nomenclature\".\n\nAn '''available''' (zoological) or '''validly published''' (botanical) name that has been historically applied to a genus but is not regarded as the accepted (current/valid) name for the taxon is termed a '''[[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]'''; some authors also include unavailable names in lists of synonyms as well as available names, such as misspellings, names previously published without fulfilling all of the requirements of the relevant nomenclatural Code, and rejected or suppressed names. \n\nA particular genus name may have zero to many synonyms, the latter case generally if the genus has been known for a long time and redescribed as new by a range of subsequent workers, or if a range of genera previously considered separate taxa have subsequently been consolidated into one. For example, the [[World Register of Marine Species]] presently lists 8 genus-level synonyms for the sperm whale genus ''[[Physeter]]'' Linnaeus, 1758,<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=137032 World Register of Marine Species: ''Physeter'' Linnaeus, 1758 ]</ref> and 13 for the bivalve genus ''[[Pecten (bivalve)|Pecten]]'' O.F. M\u00fcller, 1776.<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=138323 World Register of Marine Species: ''Pecten'' O. F. M\u00fcller, 1776]</ref>\n\n===Identical names (homonyms)===\nWithin the same kingdom, one generic name can apply to one genus only.  However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the [[platypus]] belongs to the genus ''Ornithorhynchus'' although [[George Shaw]] named it ''Platypus'' in 1799 (these two names are thus '''''synonyms'')'''. However, the name ''Platypus'' had already been given to a group of [[ambrosia beetle]]s by [[Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst]] in 1793. A name that means two different things is a '''''homonym'''''. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both. [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] published the replacement name ''Ornithorhynchus'' in 1800.\n\nHowever, a genus in one [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code. Names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called \"homonyms\". Although this is discouraged by both the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom. For instance, \n* ''[[Anura (frog)|Anura]]'' is the name of the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[frog]]s but also is the name of a [[synonym (botany)|non-current]] genus of plants; \n* ''Aotus'' is the generic name of both [[Aotus (pea)|golden peas]] and [[night monkey]]s; \n* ''Oenanthe'' is the generic name of both [[wheatear]]s and [[water dropwort]]s; \n* ''Prunella'' is the generic name of both [[accentor]]s and [[self-heal]]; and \n* ''Proboscidea'' is the order of [[elephant]]s and the genus of [[Proboscidea (plant)|devil's claws]].\n* The name of the genus ''[[Paramecia (alga)|Paramecia]]'' (an extinct red alga) is also the plural of the name of the genus ''[[Paramecium]]'' (which is in the SAR supergroup), which can also lead to confusion.\nA list of generic homonyms (with their authorities), including both available (validly published) and selected unavailable names, has been compiled by the [[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]] (IRMNG).<ref name =\"IRMNG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irmng.org/homonyms.php|title=IRMNG: Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera|website=www.irmng.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Use in higher classifications===\nThe [[type genus]] forms the base for higher [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] ranks, such as the family name {{lang|la|[[Canidae]]}} (\"Canids\") based on ''Canis''. However, this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels: the [[order (biology)|order]] to which dogs and wolves belong is {{lang|la|[[Carnivora]]}} (\"Carnivores\").\n\n==Numbers of accepted genera==\nThe numbers of either accepted, or all published genus names is not known precisely; Rees et al., 2020 estimate that approximately 310,000 accepted names (valid taxa) may exist, out of a total of c. 520,000 published names (including synonyms) as at end 2019, increasing at some 2,500 published generic names per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=Tony |last2=Vandepitte |first2=Leen |last3=Vanhoorne |first3=Bart |last4=Decock |first4=Wim |title=All genera of the world: an overview and estimates based on the March 2020 release of the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) |journal=Megataxa |volume=1 |pages=123-140 |year=2020 |url=https://www.mapress.com/j/mt/article/view/megataxa.1.2.3/39250 |doi=10.11646/megataxa.1.2.3}}</ref>  \"Official\" registers of taxon names at all ranks, including genera, exist for a few groups only such as viruses<ref name = \"ICTV\" /> and prokaryotes,<ref>[http://www.bacterio.net/ List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]</ref> while for others there are compendia with no \"official\" standing such as ''Index Fungorum'' for Fungi,<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/ ''Index Fungorum'']</ref> ''Index Nominum Algarum''<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/ina/ ''Index Nominum Algarum'']</ref> and AlgaeBase<ref>[http://www.algaebase.org/ AlgaeBase]</ref> for algae, ''Index Nominum Genericorum''<ref>[http://botany.si.edu/ing/ ''Index Nominum Genericorum'']</ref> and the International Plant Names Index<ref>[http://www.ipni.org/ The International Plant Names Index]</ref> for plants in general, and ferns through angiosperms, respectively, and ''[[Nomenclator Zoologicus]]''<ref>[http://ubio.org/NomenclatorZoologicus/ ''Nomenclator Zoologicus'']</ref> and the [[Index to Organism Names]] (http://www.organismnames.com/) for zoological names.\n\nTotals for both \"all names\" and estimates for \"accepted names\" as held in the ''[[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]]'' (IRMNG) are broken down further in the publication by Rees et al., 2020 cited above.

Within Plantae, [[Tracheophya]] (vascular plants) make up the largest component, with 23,236 \u00b1 5,379 accepted genus names, of which 20,845 \u00b1 4,494 are [[angiosperms]] (superclass Angiospermae).\n\nBy comparison, the 2018 annual edition of the [[Catalogue of Life]] (estimated >90% complete, for extant species in the main) contains currently 175,363 \"accepted\" genus names for 1,744,204 living and 59,284 extinct species,<ref>[http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2018/info/ac Information: Catalogue of Life: 2018 Annual Checklist]</ref> also including genus names only (no species) for some groups.\n\n==Genus size==\n[[File:Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.

For instance, among (non-avian) [[reptile]]s, which have about 1180 genera, the most (>300) have only 1 species, ~360 have between 2 and 4 species, 260 have 5-10 species, ~200 have 11-50 species, and only 27 genera have more than 50 species (see figure).<ref>[[The Reptile Database]]</ref> However, some insect genera such as the bee genera ''[[Lasioglossum]]'' and ''[[Andrena]]'' have over 1000 species each. The largest flowering plant genus, ''[[Astragalus]]'', contains over 3,000 species.<ref name=\"Frodin\">{{cite journal |last=Frodin |first=David G. |year=2004 |title=History and concepts of big plant genera |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=753\u2013776 |jstor=4135449 |doi=10.2307/4135449}}</ref>\n\nWhich species are assigned to a genus is somewhat arbitrary. Although all species within a genus are supposed to be \"similar\" there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera. There is much debate among zoologists whether large, species-rich genera should be maintained, as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species. Hence, many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera. For instance, the lizard genus ''[[Anolis]]'' has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller, more manageable subsets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.

It plays a fundamental role in [[binomial nomenclature]], the system of naming [[organisms]], where it is combined with the scientific name of a [[species]]: see [[Specific name (botany)]] and [[Specific name (zoology)]].\n\n=== Use in nomenclature ===\n{{Main|Binomial nomenclature|Taxonomy (biology)|Author citation (zoology)|Author citation (botany)}}\nThe rules for the [[scientific name]]s of [[organisms]] are laid down in the [[Nomenclature Codes]], which allow each species a single unique name that, for \"[[animals]]\" (including [[protists]]), \"[[plants]]\" (also including [[algae]] and [[fungi]]) and [[prokaryotes]] ([[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]), is [[Latin]] and binomial in form; this contrasts with [[common name|common]] or [[vernacular]] names, which are non-standardized, can be non-unique, and typically also vary by country and language of usage. \n\nExcept for [[Virus classification|viruses]], the standard format for a [[species]] name comprises the generic name, indicating the genus to which the species belongs, followed by the specific epithet, which (within that genus) is unique to the species. For example, the [[gray wolf]]'s scientific name is {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus}}'',}} with ''[[Canis]]'' (Lat. \"dog\") being the generic name shared by the wolf's close relatives and ''lupus'' (Lat. \"wolf\") being the specific name particular to the wolf. A botanical example would be ''[[Hibiscus arnottianus]]'', a particular species of the genus ''[[Hibiscus]]'' native to Hawaii. The specific name is written in lower-case and may be followed by [[subspecies]] names in [[zoology]] or a variety of [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific names]] in [[botany]]. \n\nWhen the generic name is already known from [[Context (language use)|context]], it may be shortened to its initial letter, for example ''C. lupus'' in place of ''Canis lupus''. Where species are further subdivided, the generic name (or its abbreviated form) still forms the leading portion of the scientific name, for example {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Canis lupus familiaris}}''}} for the domestic dog (when considered a subspecies of the gray wolf) in zoology, or as a botanical example, {{nowrap|''{{lang|la|Hibiscus arnottianus}}'' ssp. ''{{lang|la|immaculatus}}''}}. Also, as visible in the above examples, the Latinised portions of the scientific names of genera and their included species (and infraspecies, where applicable) are, by convention, written in [[Italic type|italics]].\n\nThe scientific names of [[virus]] species are descriptive, not binomial in form, and may or may not incorporate an indication of their containing genus; for example the virus species \"Salmonid herpesvirus 1\", \"Salmonid herpesvirus 2\" and \"Salmonid herpesvirus 3\" are all within the genus ''[[Salmonivirus]]'', however the genus to which the species with the formal names \"[[Everglades virus]]\" and \"[[Ross River virus]]\" are assigned is ''[[Alphavirus]]''.\n\nAs with scientific names at other ranks, in all groups other than viruses, names of genera may be cited with their authorities, typically in the form \"author, year\" in zoology, and \"standard abbreviated author name\" in botany. Thus in the examples above, the genus ''Canis'' would be cited in full as \"''Canis'' Linnaeus, 1758\" (zoological usage), while ''Hibiscus'', also first established by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] but in 1753, is simply \"''Hibiscus'' L.\" (botanical usage).\n\n=== The type concept===\n{{see also|Type genus|Type species|Type specimen}}\nEach genus should have a designated [[type (biology)|type]], although in practice there is a backlog of older names without one. In zoology, this is the [[type species]] and the generic name is permanently associated with the [[type specimen]] of its type species. Should the specimen turn out to be assignable to another genus, the generic name linked to it becomes a [[junior synonym]] and the remaining [[taxon|taxa]] in the former genus need to be reassessed.\n\n===Categories of generic name===\nIn zoological usage, taxonomic names, including those of genera, are classified as \"[[available name|available]]\" or \"unavailable\". Available names are those published in accordance with the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and not otherwise suppressed by subsequent decisions of the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN); the earliest such name for any taxon (for example, a genus) should then be selected as the \"[[valid name (zoology)|valid]]\" (i.e., current or accepted) name for the taxon in question. \n\nConsequently, there will be more available names than valid names at any point in time, which names are currently in use depending on the judgement of taxonomists in either combining taxa described under multiple names, or splitting taxa which may bring available names previously treated as synonyms back into use. \"Unavailable\" names in zoology comprise names that either were not published according to the provisions of the ICZN Code, or have subsequently been suppressed, e.g., incorrect original or subsequent spellings, names published only in a thesis, and generic names published after 1930 with no type species indicated.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\">{{cite book|author=D. L. Hawksworth|title=Terms Used in Bionomenclature: The Naming of Organisms and Plant Communities : Including Terms Used in Botanical, Cultivated Plant, Phylogenetic, Phytosociological, Prokaryote (bacteriological), Virus, and Zoological Nomenclature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qky7_6-UcQQC&pg=PA10|year=2010|publisher=GBIF|isbn=978-87-92020-09-3|pages=1\u2013215}}</ref>\n\nIn botany, similar concepts exist but with different labels. The botanical equivalent of zoology's \"available name\" is a [[validly published name]]. An invalidly published name is a ''nomen invalidum'' or ''nom. inval.''; a rejected name is a ''nomen rejiciendum'' or ''nom. rej.''; a later homonym of a validly published name is a ''nomen illegitimum'' or ''nom. illeg.''; for a full list refer the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICNafp) and the work cited above by Hawksworth, 2010.<ref name=\"Hawksworth2010\" /> In place of the \"valid taxon\" in zoology, the nearest equivalent in botany is \"[[correct name]]\" or \"current name\" which can, again, differ or change with alternative taxonomic treatments or new information that results in previously accepted genera being combined or split.\n\n[[International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes|Prokaryote]] and [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|virus]] Codes of Nomenclature also exist which serve as a reference for designating currently accepted genus names as opposed to others which may be either reduced to synonymy, or, in the case of prokaryotes, relegated to a status of \"names without standing in prokaryotic nomenclature\".\n\nAn '''available''' (zoological) or '''validly published''' (botanical) name that has been historically applied to a genus but is not regarded as the accepted (current/valid) name for the taxon is termed a '''[[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]'''; some authors also include unavailable names in lists of synonyms as well as available names, such as misspellings, names previously published without fulfilling all of the requirements of the relevant nomenclatural Code, and rejected or suppressed names. \n\nA particular genus name may have zero to many synonyms, the latter case generally if the genus has been known for a long time and redescribed as new by a range of subsequent workers, or if a range of genera previously considered separate taxa have subsequently been consolidated into one. For example, the [[World Register of Marine Species]] presently lists 8 genus-level synonyms for the sperm whale genus ''[[Physeter]]'' Linnaeus, 1758,<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=137032 World Register of Marine Species: ''Physeter'' Linnaeus, 1758 ]</ref> and 13 for the bivalve genus ''[[Pecten (bivalve)|Pecten]]'' O.F. M\u00fcller, 1776.<ref>[http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=138323 World Register of Marine Species: ''Pecten'' O. F. M\u00fcller, 1776]</ref>\n\n===Identical names (homonyms)===\nWithin the same kingdom, one generic name can apply to one genus only.  However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the [[platypus]] belongs to the genus ''Ornithorhynchus'' although [[George Shaw]] named it ''Platypus'' in 1799 (these two names are thus '''''synonyms'')'''. However, the name ''Platypus'' had already been given to a group of [[ambrosia beetle]]s by [[Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst]] in 1793. A name that means two different things is a '''''homonym'''''. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both. [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] published the replacement name ''Ornithorhynchus'' in 1800.\n\nHowever, a genus in one [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] is allowed to bear a scientific name that is in use as a generic name (or the name of a taxon in another rank) in a kingdom that is governed by a different nomenclature code. Names with the same form but applying to different taxa are called \"homonyms\". Although this is discouraged by both the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], there are some five thousand such names in use in more than one kingdom. For instance, \n* ''[[Anura (frog)|Anura]]'' is the name of the [[order (biology)|order]] of [[frog]]s but also is the name of a [[synonym (botany)|non-current]] genus of plants; \n* ''Aotus'' is the generic name of both [[Aotus (pea)|golden peas]] and [[night monkey]]s; \n* ''Oenanthe'' is the generic name of both [[wheatear]]s and [[water dropwort]]s; \n* ''Prunella'' is the generic name of both [[accentor]]s and [[self-heal]]; and \n* ''Proboscidea'' is the order of [[elephant]]s and the genus of [[Proboscidea (plant)|devil's claws]].\n* The name of the genus ''[[Paramecia (alga)|Paramecia]]'' (an extinct red alga) is also the plural of the name of the genus ''[[Paramecium]]'' (which is in the SAR supergroup), which can also lead to confusion.\nA list of generic homonyms (with their authorities), including both available (validly published) and selected unavailable names, has been compiled by the [[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]] (IRMNG).<ref name =\"IRMNG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.irmng.org/homonyms.php|title=IRMNG: Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera|website=www.irmng.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Use in higher classifications===\nThe [[type genus]] forms the base for higher [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] ranks, such as the family name {{lang|la|[[Canidae]]}} (\"Canids\") based on ''Canis''. However, this does not typically ascend more than one or two levels: the [[order (biology)|order]] to which dogs and wolves belong is {{lang|la|[[Carnivora]]}} (\"Carnivores\").\n\n==Numbers of accepted genera==\nThe numbers of either accepted, or all published genus names is not known precisely; Rees et al., 2020 estimate that approximately 310,000 accepted names (valid taxa) may exist, out of a total of c. 520,000 published names (including synonyms) as at end 2019, increasing at some 2,500 published generic names per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rees|first=Tony |last2=Vandepitte |first2=Leen |last3=Vanhoorne |first3=Bart |last4=Decock |first4=Wim |title=All genera of the world: an overview and estimates based on the March 2020 release of the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera (IRMNG) |journal=Megataxa |volume=1 |pages=123-140 |year=2020 |url=https://www.mapress.com/j/mt/article/view/megataxa.1.2.3/39250 |doi=10.11646/megataxa.1.2.3}}</ref>  \"Official\" registers of taxon names at all ranks, including genera, exist for a few groups only such as viruses<ref name = \"ICTV\" /> and prokaryotes,<ref>[http://www.bacterio.net/ List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature]</ref> while for others there are compendia with no \"official\" standing such as ''Index Fungorum'' for Fungi,<ref>[http://www.indexfungorum.org/ ''Index Fungorum'']</ref> ''Index Nominum Algarum''<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/ina/ ''Index Nominum Algarum'']</ref> and AlgaeBase<ref>[http://www.algaebase.org/ AlgaeBase]</ref> for algae, ''Index Nominum Genericorum''<ref>[http://botany.si.edu/ing/ ''Index Nominum Genericorum'']</ref> and the International Plant Names Index<ref>[http://www.ipni.org/ The International Plant Names Index]</ref> for plants in general, and ferns through angiosperms, respectively, and ''[[Nomenclator Zoologicus]]''<ref>[http://ubio.org/NomenclatorZoologicus/ ''Nomenclator Zoologicus'']</ref> and the [[Index to Organism Names]] (http://www.organismnames.com/) for zoological names.\n\nTotals for both \"all names\" and estimates for \"accepted names\" as held in the ''[[Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera]]'' (IRMNG) are broken down further in the publication by Rees et al., 2020 cited above. The accepted names estimates are as follows, broken down by kingdom:\n[[File:Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al 2020.jpg|thumb|Estimated accepted genus totals by kingdom - based on Rees et al., 2020]]\n* [[Animalia]]: 239,093 accepted genus names (\u00b1 55,350)\n* [[Plantae]]: 28,724 accepted genus names (\u00b1 7,721)\n* [[Fungi]]: 10,468 accepted genus names (\u00b1 182)\n* [[Chromista]]: 11,114 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,268)\n* [[Protozoa]]: 3,109 accepted genus names (\u00b1 1,206)\n* [[Bacteria]]: 3,433 accepted genus names (\u00b1 115)\n* [[Archaea]]: 140 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n* [[Virus]]es: 851 accepted genus names (\u00b1 0)\n\nThe cited ranges of uncertainty arise because IRMNG lists \"uncertain\" names (not researched therein) in addition to known \"accepted\" names; the values quoted are the mean of \"accepted\" names alone (all \"uncertain\" names treated as unaccepted) and \"accepted + uncertain\" names (all \"uncertain\" names treated as accepted), with the associated range of uncertainty indicating these two extremes.\n\nWithin Animalia, the largest phylum is [[Arthropoda]], with 151,697 \u00b1 33,160 accepted genus names, of which 114,387 \u00b1 27,654 are [[insects]] (class Insecta). Within Plantae, [[Tracheophya]] (vascular plants) make up the largest component, with 23,236 \u00b1 5,379 accepted genus names, of which 20,845 \u00b1 4,494 are [[angiosperms]] (superclass Angiospermae).\n\nBy comparison, the 2018 annual edition of the [[Catalogue of Life]] (estimated >90% complete, for extant species in the main) contains currently 175,363 \"accepted\" genus names for 1,744,204 living and 59,284 extinct species,<ref>[http://www.catalogueoflife.org/annual-checklist/2018/info/ac Information: Catalogue of Life: 2018 Annual Checklist]</ref> also including genus names only (no species) for some groups.\n\n==Genus size==\n[[File:Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Number of reptile genera with a given number of species.

For instance, among (non-avian) [[reptile]]s, which have about 1180 genera, the most (>300) have only 1 species, ~360 have between 2 and 4 species, 260 have 5-10 species, ~200 have 11-50 species, and only 27 genera have more than 50 species (see figure).<ref>[[The Reptile Database]]</ref> However, some insect genera such as the bee genera ''[[Lasioglossum]]'' and ''[[Andrena]]'' have over 1000 species each. The largest flowering plant genus, ''[[Astragalus]]'', contains over 3,000 species.<ref name=\"Frodin\">{{cite journal |last=Frodin |first=David G. |year=2004 |title=History and concepts of big plant genera |journal=[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]] |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=753\u2013776 |jstor=4135449 |doi=10.2307/4135449}}</ref>\n\nWhich species are assigned to a genus is somewhat arbitrary. Although all species within a genus are supposed to be \"similar\" there are no objective criteria for grouping species into genera. There is much debate among zoologists whether large, species-rich genera should be maintained, as it is extremely difficult to come up with identification keys or even character sets that distinguish all species. Hence, many taxonomists argue in favor of breaking down large genera. For instance, the lizard genus ''[[Anolis]]'' has been suggested to be broken down into 8 or so different genera which would bring its ~400 species to smaller, more manageable subsets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=K.
