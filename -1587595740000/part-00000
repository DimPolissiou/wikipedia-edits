This is referred to as the [[#Von Neumann bottleneck|von Neumann bottleneck]] and often limits the performance of the system.<ref>{{Citation |author-last=Markgraf |author-first=Joey D. |title=The Von Neumann Bottleneck |date=2007 |url=http://aws.linnbenton.edu/cs271c/markgrj/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212205159/http://aws.linnbenton.edu/cs271c/markgrj/ |archive-date=December 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe design of a von Neumann architecture machine is simpler than a [[Harvard architecture]] machine\u2014which is also a stored-program system but has one dedicated set of address and data buses for reading and writing to memory, and another set of address and [[Memory bus|data buses]] to fetch [[instruction fetch|instructions]].\n\nA stored-program digital computer keeps both [[Computer program|program instructions]] and data in [[Read\u2013write memory|read\u2013write]], [[random-access memory]] (RAM).  Stored-program computers were an advancement over the program-controlled computers of the 1940s, such as the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] and the [[ENIAC]]. Those were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch cables to route data and control signals between various functional units. The vast majority of modern computers use the same memory for both data and program instructions. The von Neumann vs. Harvard distinction applies to the [[CPU cache|cache]] architecture, not the main memory ([[Modified Harvard architecture#Split-cache (or_Almost-von-Neumann) architecture|split cache architecture]]).\n\n==History==\nThe earliest computing machines had fixed programs.  Some very simple computers still use this design, either for simplicity or training purposes.  For example, a desk [[calculator]] (in principle) is a fixed program computer.  It can do basic [[mathematics]], but it cannot run a [[word processor]] or games.  Changing the program of a fixed-program machine requires rewiring, restructuring, or redesigning the machine.  The earliest computers were not so much \"programmed\" as  \"designed\" for a particular task.  \"Reprogramming\" \u2013 when possible at all \u2013 was a laborious process that started with [[flowchart]]s and paper notes, followed by detailed engineering designs, and then the often-arduous process of physically rewiring and rebuilding the machine. It could take three weeks to set up and debug a program on [[ENIAC]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=104}}</ref>\n\nWith the proposal of the stored-program computer, this changed. A stored-program computer includes, by design, an [[instruction set]], and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]].\n\nA stored-program design also allows for [[self-modifying code]]. One early motivation for such a facility was the need for a program to increment or otherwise modify the address portion of instructions, which operators had to do manually in early designs. This became less important when [[index register]]s and [[Addressing mode|indirect addressing]] became usual features of machine architecture. Another use was to embed frequently used data in the instruction stream using [[Addressing mode|immediate addressing]]. Self-modifying code has largely fallen out of favor, since it is usually hard to understand and [[debugging|debug]], as well as being inefficient under modern processor [[pipeline (computing)|pipelining]] and caching schemes.\n\n==Capabilities==\nOn a large scale, the ability to treat instructions as data is what makes [[Assembly language#Assembler|assemblers]], [[compiler]]s, [[Linker (computing)|linkers]], [[Loader (computing)|loaders]], and other automated programming tools possible. It makes \"programs that write programs\" possible.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/MFTL.html |title=''MFTL'' (My Favorite Toy Language) entry Jargon File 4.4.7 |access-date=2008-07-11}}</ref>  This has made a sophisticated self-hosting computing ecosystem flourish around von Neumann architecture machines.\n\nSome high level languages leverage the von Neumann architecture by providing an abstract, machine-independent way to manipulate executable code at runtime (e.g., [[LISP]]), or by using runtime information to tune [[just-in-time compilation]] (e.g. languages hosted on the [[Java virtual machine]], or languages embedded in [[web browsers]]).\n\nOn a smaller scale, some repetitive operations such as [[Bit blit|BITBLT]] or [[High-level shader language|pixel and vertex shaders]] can be accelerated on general purpose processors with just-in-time compilation techniques. This is one use of self-modifying code that has remained popular.\n\n==Development of the stored-program concept==\nThe mathematician [[Alan Turing]], who had been alerted to a problem of mathematical logic by the lectures of [[Max Newman]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a paper in 1936 entitled ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', which was published in the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society''.<ref name=\"Turing1936\">{{Citation |author-last=Turing |author-first=Alan M. |author-link=Alan M.

At that time, he and Mauchly were not aware of Turing's work.\n\nVon Neumann was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], which required huge amounts of calculation. This drew him to the ENIAC project, during the summer of 1944. There he joined the ongoing discussions on the design of this stored-program computer, the EDVAC.

It described in engineering and programming detail, his idea of a machine he called the ''[[Automatic Computing Engine|Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=108\u2013111}}</ref> He presented this to the Executive Committee of the British [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] on February 19, 1946. Although Turing knew from his wartime experience at Bletchley Park that what he proposed was feasible, the secrecy surrounding [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], that was subsequently maintained for several decades, prevented him from saying so. Various successful implementations of the ACE design were produced.\n\nBoth von Neumann's and Turing's papers described stored-program computers, but von Neumann's earlier paper achieved greater circulation and the computer architecture it outlined became known as the \"von Neumann architecture\". In the 1953 publication ''Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines'' (edited by B. V. Bowden), a section in the chapter on ''Computers in America'' reads as follows:<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|pp=176,177}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n'''The Machine of the Institute For Advanced Studies, Princeton'''\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nIn 1945, Professor J. von Neumann, who was then working at the Moore School of Engineering in Philadelphia, where the E.N.I.A.C. had been built, issued on behalf of a group of his co-workers, a report on the logical design of digital computers. The report contained a detailed proposal for the design of the machine that has since become known as the E.D.V.A.C. (electronic discrete variable automatic computer). This machine has only recently been completed in America, but the von Neumann report inspired the construction of the E.D.S.A.C. (electronic delay-storage automatic calculator) in Cambridge (see page 130).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nIn 1947, Burks, Goldstine and von Neumann published another report that outlined the design of another type of machine (a parallel machine this time) that would be exceedingly fast, capable perhaps of 20,000 operations per second. They pointed out that the outstanding problem in constructing such a machine was the development of suitable memory with instantaneously accessible contents. At first they suggested using a special [[vacuum tube]]\u2014called the \"[[Selectron tube|Selectron]]\"\u2014which the Princeton Laboratories of RCA had invented. These tubes were expensive and difficult to make, so von Neumann subsequently decided to build a machine based on the [[Williams tube|Williams memory]]. This machine\u2014completed in June, 1952 in Princeton\u2014has become popularly known as the Maniac. The design of this machine inspired at least half a dozen machines now being built in America, all known affectionately as \"Johniacs.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the same book, the first two paragraphs of a chapter on ACE read as follows:<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|p=135}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n'''Automatic Computation at the National Physical Laboratory'''\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nOne of the most modern digital computers which embodies developments and improvements in the technique of automatic electronic computing was recently demonstrated at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, where it has been designed and built by a small team of mathematicians and electronics research engineers on the staff of the Laboratory, assisted by a number of production engineers from the English Electric Company, Limited. The equipment so far erected at the Laboratory is only the pilot model of a much larger installation which will be known as the Automatic Computing Engine, but although comparatively small in bulk and containing only about 800 thermionic valves, as can be judged from Plates XII, XIII and XIV, it is an extremely rapid and versatile calculating machine.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe basic concepts and abstract principles of computation by a machine were formulated by Dr. A. M. Turing, F.R.S., in a paper<sup>1</sup>. read before the London Mathematical Society in 1936, but work on such machines in Britain was delayed by the war. In 1945, however, an examination of the problems was made at the National Physical Laboratory by Mr. J. R. Womersley, then superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the Laboratory. He was joined by Dr. Turing and a small staff of specialists, and, by 1947, the preliminary planning was sufficiently advanced to warrant the establishment of the special group already mentioned. In April, 1948, the latter became the Electronics Section of the Laboratory, under the charge of Mr. F. M. Colebrook.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Early von Neumann-architecture computers==\nThe ''First Draft'' described a design that was used by many universities and corporations to construct their computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/vonneumann/ecp/ |title=Electronic Computer Project |publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]] |access-date=2011-05-26}}</ref> Among these various computers, only ILLIAC and ORDVAC had compatible instruction sets.\n* [[APEXC|ARC2]] ([[Birkbeck, University of London]]) officially came online on May 12, 1948.<ref name=\"birkbeck\">{{cite journal |author-last1=Campbell-Kelly |author-first1=Martin |title=The Development of Computer Programming in Britain (1945 to 1955) |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |date=April 1982 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121\u2013139 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.1982.10016}}</ref>\n* [[Manchester Baby]] (Victoria University of Manchester, England) made its first successful run of a stored program on June 21, 1948.\n* [[EDSAC]] (University of Cambridge, England) was the first practical stored-program electronic computer (May 1949)\n* [[Manchester Mark 1]] (University of Manchester, England) Developed from the Baby (June 1949)\n* [[CSIRAC]] ([[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]]) Australia (November 1949)\n* [[EDVAC]] ([[Ballistic Research Laboratory]], Computing Laboratory at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] 1951)\n* [[ORDVAC]] (U-Illinois) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland (completed November 1951)<ref>{{citation |author-first=James E. |author-last=Robertson |title=Illiac Design Techniques |publisher=report number UIUCDCS-R-1955-146, Digital Computer Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |date=1955}}</ref>\n* [[IAS machine]] at Princeton University (January 1952)\n* [[MANIAC I]] at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] (March 1952)\n* [[ILLIAC]] at the University of Illinois, (September 1952)\n* [[BESM|BESM-1]] in Moscow (1952)\n* [[AVIDAC]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (1953)\n* [[ORACLE (computer)|ORACLE]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (June 1953)\n* [[BESK]] in Stockholm (1953)\n* [[JOHNNIAC]] at RAND Corporation (January 1954)\n* [[DASK]] in Denmark (1955)\n* [[WEIZAC]] at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]], Israel (1955)\n* [[PERM (computer)|PERM]] in Munich (1956?)\n* [[SILLIAC]] in Sydney (1956)\n\n==Early stored-program computers==\nThe date information in the following chronology is difficult to put into proper order.

Because the single bus can only access one of the two classes of memory at a time, throughput is lower than the rate at which the CPU can work.  This seriously limits the effective processing speed when the CPU is required to perform minimal processing on large amounts of data.  The CPU is continually<!-- http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continual#Usage_notes --> [[Wait state|forced to wait]] for needed data to move to or from memory.  Since CPU speed and memory size have increased much faster than the throughput between them, the bottleneck has become more of a problem, a problem whose severity increases with every new generation of CPU.\n\nThe von Neumann bottleneck was described by [[John Backus]] in his 1977 ACM [[Turing Award]] lecture.  According to Backus:\n\n<blockquote>Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in the store than by pushing vast numbers of [[Word (computer architecture)|words]] back and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus programming is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic of words through the von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic concerns not significant data itself, but where to find it.<ref name=\"backus\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/359576.359579 |title=Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?

For example, the following all can improve performance{{why|date=November 2015}}:\n*Providing a [[CPU cache|cache]] between the CPU and the [[main memory]]\n*providing separate caches or separate access paths for data and instructions (the so-called [[Modified Harvard architecture]])\n*using [[branch predictor]] algorithms and logic\n*providing a limited CPU stack or other on-chip [[scratchpad memory]] to reduce memory access\n*Implementing the CPU and the [[memory hierarchy]] as a [[System on a chip|system on chip]], providing greater [[locality of reference]] and thus reducing latency and increasing throughput between [[Processor register|processor registers]] and [[main memory]]\n\nThe problem can also be sidestepped somewhat by using [[parallel computing]], using for example the [[non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) architecture\u2014this approach is commonly employed by supercomputers. It is less clear whether the ''intellectual bottleneck'' that Backus criticized has changed much since 1977. Backus's proposed solution has not had a major influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Modern [[functional programming]] and [[object-oriented programming]] are much less geared towards \"pushing vast numbers of words back and forth\" than earlier languages like [[FORTRAN]] were, but internally, that is still what computers spend much of their time doing, even highly parallel supercomputers.\n\nAs of 1996, a database benchmark study found that three out of four CPU cycles were spent waiting for memory. Researchers expect that increasing the number of simultaneous instruction streams with [[multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading]] or single-chip [[multiprocessing]] will make this bottleneck even worse.<ref>Sites, Richard L.; Patt, Yale.

Stored-program computers were an advancement over the program-controlled computers of the 1940s, such as the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] and the [[ENIAC]]. Those were programmed by setting switches and inserting patch cables to route data and control signals between various functional units. The vast majority of modern computers use the same memory for both data and program instructions. The von Neumann vs. Harvard distinction applies to the [[CPU cache|cache]] architecture, not the main memory ([[Modified Harvard architecture#Split-cache (or_Almost-von-Neumann) architecture|split cache architecture]]).\n\n==History==\nThe earliest computing machines had fixed programs.  Some very simple computers still use this design, either for simplicity or training purposes.  For example, a desk [[calculator]] (in principle) is a fixed program computer.  It can do basic [[mathematics]], but it cannot run a [[word processor]] or games.  Changing the program of a fixed-program machine requires rewiring, restructuring, or redesigning the machine.  The earliest computers were not so much \"programmed\" as  \"designed\" for a particular task.  \"Reprogramming\"\u2014when possible at all\u2014was a laborious process that started with [[flowchart]]s and paper notes, followed by detailed engineering designs, and then the often-arduous process of physically rewiring and rebuilding the machine. It could take three weeks to set up and debug a program on [[ENIAC]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=104}}</ref>\n\nWith the proposal of the stored-program computer, this changed. A stored-program computer includes, by design, an [[instruction set]], and can store in memory a set of instructions (a [[computer program|program]]) that details the [[computation]].\n\nA stored-program design also allows for [[self-modifying code]]. One early motivation for such a facility was the need for a program to increment or otherwise modify the address portion of instructions, which operators had to do manually in early designs. This became less important when [[index register]]s and [[Addressing mode|indirect addressing]] became usual features of machine architecture. Another use was to embed frequently used data in the instruction stream using [[Addressing mode|immediate addressing]]. Self-modifying code has largely fallen out of favor, since it is usually hard to understand and [[debugging|debug]], as well as being inefficient under modern processor [[pipeline (computing)|pipelining]] and caching schemes.\n\n==Capabilities==\nOn a large scale, the ability to treat instructions as data is what makes [[Assembly language#Assembler|assemblers]], [[compiler]]s, [[Linker (computing)|linkers]], [[Loader (computing)|loaders]], and other automated programming tools possible. It makes \"programs that write programs\" possible.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/MFTL.html |title=''MFTL'' (My Favorite Toy Language) entry Jargon File 4.4.7 |access-date=2008-07-11}}</ref>  This has made a sophisticated self-hosting computing ecosystem flourish around von Neumann architecture machines.\n\nSome high level languages leverage the von Neumann architecture by providing an abstract, machine-independent way to manipulate executable code at runtime (e.g., [[LISP]]), or by using runtime information to tune [[just-in-time compilation]] (e.g. languages hosted on the [[Java virtual machine]], or languages embedded in [[web browsers]]).\n\nOn a smaller scale, some repetitive operations such as [[Bit blit|BITBLT]] or [[High-level shader language|pixel and vertex shaders]] can be accelerated on general purpose processors with just-in-time compilation techniques. This is one use of self-modifying code that has remained popular.\n\n==Development of the stored-program concept==\nThe mathematician [[Alan Turing]], who had been alerted to a problem of mathematical logic by the lectures of [[Max Newman]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], wrote a paper in 1936 entitled ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', which was published in the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society''.<ref name=\"Turing1936\">{{Citation |author-last=Turing |author-first=Alan M. |author-link=Alan M.

At that time, he and Mauchly were not aware of Turing's work.\n\nVon Neumann was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], which required huge amounts of calculation. This drew him to the ENIAC project, during the summer of 1944. There he joined the ongoing discussions on the design of this stored-program computer, the EDVAC.

It described in engineering and programming detail, his idea of a machine he called the ''[[Automatic Computing Engine|Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=108\u2013111}}</ref> He presented this to the Executive Committee of the British [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] on February 19, 1946. Although Turing knew from his wartime experience at Bletchley Park that what he proposed was feasible, the secrecy surrounding [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], that was subsequently maintained for several decades, prevented him from saying so. Various successful implementations of the ACE design were produced.\n\nBoth von Neumann's and Turing's papers described stored-program computers, but von Neumann's earlier paper achieved greater circulation and the computer architecture it outlined became known as the \"von Neumann architecture\". In the 1953 publication ''Faster than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines'' (edited by B. V. Bowden), a section in the chapter on ''Computers in America'' reads as follows:<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|pp=176,177}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n'''The Machine of the Institute For Advanced Studies, Princeton'''\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nIn 1945, Professor J. von Neumann, who was then working at the Moore School of Engineering in Philadelphia, where the E.N.I.A.C. had been built, issued on behalf of a group of his co-workers, a report on the logical design of digital computers. The report contained a detailed proposal for the design of the machine that has since become known as the E.D.V.A.C. (electronic discrete variable automatic computer). This machine has only recently been completed in America, but the von Neumann report inspired the construction of the E.D.S.A.C. (electronic delay-storage automatic calculator) in Cambridge (see page 130).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nIn 1947, Burks, Goldstine and von Neumann published another report that outlined the design of another type of machine (a parallel machine this time) that would be exceedingly fast, capable perhaps of 20,000 operations per second. They pointed out that the outstanding problem in constructing such a machine was the development of suitable memory with instantaneously accessible contents. At first they suggested using a special [[vacuum tube]]\u2014called the \"[[Selectron tube|Selectron]]\"\u2014which the Princeton Laboratories of RCA had invented. These tubes were expensive and difficult to make, so von Neumann subsequently decided to build a machine based on the [[Williams tube|Williams memory]]. This machine\u2014completed in June, 1952 in Princeton\u2014has become popularly known as the Maniac. The design of this machine inspired at least half a dozen machines now being built in America, all known affectionately as \"Johniacs.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the same book, the first two paragraphs of a chapter on ACE read as follows:<ref>{{Harvnb|Bowden|1953|p=135}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n'''Automatic Computation at the National Physical Laboratory'''\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nOne of the most modern digital computers which embodies developments and improvements in the technique of automatic electronic computing was recently demonstrated at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, where it has been designed and built by a small team of mathematicians and electronics research engineers on the staff of the Laboratory, assisted by a number of production engineers from the English Electric Company, Limited. The equipment so far erected at the Laboratory is only the pilot model of a much larger installation which will be known as the Automatic Computing Engine, but although comparatively small in bulk and containing only about 800 thermionic valves, as can be judged from Plates XII, XIII and XIV, it is an extremely rapid and versatile calculating machine.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe basic concepts and abstract principles of computation by a machine were formulated by Dr. A. M. Turing, F.R.S., in a paper<sup>1</sup>. read before the London Mathematical Society in 1936, but work on such machines in Britain was delayed by the war. In 1945, however, an examination of the problems was made at the National Physical Laboratory by Mr. J. R. Womersley, then superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the Laboratory. He was joined by Dr. Turing and a small staff of specialists, and, by 1947, the preliminary planning was sufficiently advanced to warrant the establishment of the special group already mentioned. In April, 1948, the latter became the Electronics Section of the Laboratory, under the charge of Mr. F. M. Colebrook.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Early von Neumann-architecture computers==\nThe ''First Draft'' described a design that was used by many universities and corporations to construct their computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/people/vonneumann/ecp/ |title=Electronic Computer Project |publisher=[[Institute for Advanced Study]] |access-date=2011-05-26}}</ref> Among these various computers, only ILLIAC and ORDVAC had compatible instruction sets.\n* [[APEXC|ARC2]] ([[Birkbeck, University of London]]) officially came online on May 12, 1948.<ref name=\"birkbeck\">{{cite journal |author-last1=Campbell-Kelly |author-first1=Martin |title=The Development of Computer Programming in Britain (1945 to 1955) |journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing |date=April 1982 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=121\u2013139 |doi=10.1109/MAHC.1982.10016}}</ref>\n* [[Manchester Baby]] (Victoria University of Manchester, England) made its first successful run of a stored program on June 21, 1948.\n* [[EDSAC]] (University of Cambridge, England) was the first practical stored-program electronic computer (May 1949)\n* [[Manchester Mark 1]] (University of Manchester, England) Developed from the Baby (June 1949)\n* [[CSIRAC]] ([[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]]) Australia (November 1949)\n* [[EDVAC]] ([[Ballistic Research Laboratory]], Computing Laboratory at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] 1951)\n* [[ORDVAC]] (U-Illinois) at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland (completed November 1951)<ref>{{citation |author-first=James E. |author-last=Robertson |title=Illiac Design Techniques |publisher=report number UIUCDCS-R-1955-146, Digital Computer Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |date=1955}}</ref>\n* [[IAS machine]] at Princeton University (January 1952)\n* [[MANIAC I]] at [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]] (March 1952)\n* [[ILLIAC]] at the University of Illinois, (September 1952)\n* [[BESM|BESM-1]] in Moscow (1952)\n* [[AVIDAC]] at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] (1953)\n* [[ORACLE (computer)|ORACLE]] at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (June 1953)\n* [[BESK]] in Stockholm (1953)\n* [[JOHNNIAC]] at RAND Corporation (January 1954)\n* [[DASK]] in Denmark (1955)\n* [[WEIZAC]] at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]], Israel (1955)\n* [[PERM (computer)|PERM]] in Munich (1956?)\n* [[SILLIAC]] in Sydney (1956)\n\n==Early stored-program computers==\nThe date information in the following chronology is difficult to put into proper order.

Because the single bus can only access one of the two classes of memory at a time, throughput is lower than the rate at which the CPU can work.  This seriously limits the effective processing speed when the CPU is required to perform minimal processing on large amounts of data.  The CPU is continually<!-- http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/continual#Usage_notes --> [[Wait state|forced to wait]] for needed data to move to or from memory.  Since CPU speed and memory size have increased much faster than the throughput between them, the bottleneck has become more of a problem, a problem whose severity increases with every new generation of CPU.\n\nThe von Neumann bottleneck was described by [[John Backus]] in his 1977 ACM [[Turing Award]] lecture.  According to Backus:\n\n<blockquote>Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in the store than by pushing vast numbers of [[Word (computer architecture)|words]] back and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus programming is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic of words through the von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic concerns not significant data itself, but where to find it.<ref name=\"backus\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/359576.359579 |title=Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?

Dijkstra}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Mitigations====\nThere are several known methods for mitigating the Von Neumann performance bottleneck.  For example, the following all can improve performance{{why|date=November 2015}}:\n*Providing a [[CPU cache|cache]] between the CPU and the [[main memory]]\n*providing separate caches or separate access paths for data and instructions (the so-called [[Modified Harvard architecture]])\n*using [[branch predictor]] algorithms and logic\n*providing a limited CPU stack or other on-chip [[scratchpad memory]] to reduce memory access\n*Implementing the CPU and the [[memory hierarchy]] as a [[System on a chip|system on chip]], providing greater [[locality of reference]] and thus reducing latency and increasing throughput between [[Processor register|processor registers]] and [[main memory]]\n\nThe problem can also be sidestepped somewhat by using [[parallel computing]], using for example the [[non-uniform memory access]] (NUMA) architecture\u2014this approach is commonly employed by supercomputers. It is less clear whether the ''intellectual bottleneck'' that Backus criticized has changed much since 1977. Backus's proposed solution has not had a major influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Modern [[functional programming]] and [[object-oriented programming]] are much less geared towards \"pushing vast numbers of words back and forth\" than earlier languages like [[FORTRAN]] were, but internally, that is still what computers spend much of their time doing, even highly parallel supercomputers.\n\nAs of 1996, a database benchmark study found that three out of four CPU cycles were spent waiting for memory. Researchers expect that increasing the number of simultaneous instruction streams with [[multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading]] or single-chip [[multiprocessing]] will make this bottleneck even worse.<ref>Sites, Richard L.; Patt, Yale. [http://cva.stanford.edu/classes/cs99s/papers/architects_look_to_future.pdf \"Architects Look to Processors of Future\"]. Microprocessor report. 1996</ref>  In the context of [[Multi-core processor|multi-core processors]], additional [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]] is required to maintain [[cache coherence]] between processors and threads.\n\n===Self-modifying code===\nAside from the von Neumann bottleneck, program modifications can be quite harmful, either by accident or design.  In some simple stored-program computer designs, a malfunctioning program can damage itself, other programs, or the [[operating system]], possibly leading to a computer [[crash (computing)|crash]]. [[Memory protection]] and other forms of [[access control]] can usually protect against both accidental and malicious program modification.\n\n==See also==\n* [[CARDboard Illustrative Aid to Computation]]\n* [[Interconnect bottleneck]]\n* [[Little man computer]]\n* [[Random-access machine]]\n* [[Turing machine]]\n* [[Neuromorphic engineering]]\n* [[Eckert architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |publication-date=1953 |editor-last=Bowden |editor-first=B.

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-CareClocks.asp|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right.

[[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:00, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-CareClocks.asp|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right.

A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Environmental Conditions ===\n\n\n'''Incorrect Relative Humidity'''\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Incorrect Temperature'''\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n\n'''Pests'''\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n\n'''Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet'''\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n\n'''Pollutants'''\n\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Catastrophic Damage  ===\n\n'''Fire'''\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n'''Water'''\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue. \n\n=== Specific Types of Clock Damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

{"title_page": "Treewidth", "text_new": "In [[graph theory]], the '''treewidth''' of an undirected graph is a number associated with the graph. Treewidth may be defined in several equivalent ways: from the size of the largest vertex set in a [[tree decomposition]] of the graph, from the size of the largest [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a [[chordal completion]] of the graph, from the maximum order of a [[haven (graph theory)|haven]] describing a strategy for a [[pursuit-evasion]] game on the graph, or from the maximum order of a [[Bramble (graph theory)|bramble]], a collection of connected subgraphs that all touch each other.\n\nTreewidth is commonly used as a parameter in the [[parameterized complexity]] analysis of graph [[algorithm]]s. The graphs with treewidth at most ''k'' are also called [[partial k-tree|partial ''k''-trees]]; many other well-studied graph families also have bounded treewidth.\n\nThe concept of treewidth was originally introduced by {{harvs|last1 = Bertel\u00e8|first1=Umberto|last2=Brioschi|first2=Francesco|year = 1972|txt}} under the name of ''dimension''.

Each tree node lists at most three vertices, so the width of this decomposition is two.]]\nA [[tree decomposition]] of a graph ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'') is a tree, ''T'', with nodes ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, where each ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> is a subset of ''V'', satisfying the following properties<ref>{{harvtxt|Diestel|2005}} section 12.3</ref> (the term ''node'' is used to refer to a vertex of ''T'' to avoid confusion with vertices of ''G''):\n# The union of all sets ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> equals ''V''. That is, each graph vertex is contained in at least one tree node.\n# If ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''X''<sub>''j''</sub> both contain a vertex ''v'', then all nodes ''X''<sub>''k''</sub> of ''T'' in the (unique) path between ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''X''<sub>''j''</sub> contain ''v'' as well. Equivalently, the tree nodes containing vertex ''v'' form a connected subtree of ''T''.\n# For every edge (''v'', ''w'') in the graph, there is a subset ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> that contains both ''v'' and ''w''. That is, vertices are adjacent in the graph only when the corresponding subtrees have a node in common.\nThe ''width'' of a tree decomposition is the size of its largest set ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> minus one.   The '''treewidth''' tw(''G'') of a graph ''G'' is the minimum width among all possible tree decompositions of ''G''. In this definition, the size of the largest set is diminished by one in order to make the treewidth of a tree equal to one.\n\nEquivalently, the treewidth of ''G'' is one less than the size of the largest [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] in the [[chordal graph]] containing ''G'' with the smallest [[maximum clique|clique number]]. A chordal graph with this clique size may be obtained by adding to ''G'' an edge between every two vertices that both belong to at least one of the sets ''X<sub>i</sub>''.\n\nTreewidth may also be characterized in terms of [[haven (graph theory)|havens]], functions describing an evasion strategy for a certain [[pursuit-evasion]] game defined on a graph. A graph ''G'' has treewidth ''k'' if and only if it has a haven of order {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} but of no higher order, where a haven of order {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} is a function ''\u03b2'' that maps each set ''X'' of at most ''k'' vertices in ''G'' into one of the connected components of {{nowrap|''G'' \\ ''X''}} and that obeys the [[monotonicity]] property that {{nowrap|''&beta;''(''Y'') \u2286 ''&beta;''(''X'')}} whenever {{nowrap|''X'' \u2286 ''Y''.}}\n\n[[File:3x3 grid graph haven.svg|thumb|A [[Bramble (graph theory)|bramble]] of order four in a 3&times;3 grid graph, the existence of which shows that the graph has treewidth at least&nbsp;3]]\nA similar characterization can also be made using [[Bramble (graph theory)|brambles]], families of connected subgraphs that all touch each other (meaning either that they share a vertex or are connected by an edge).<ref>{{harvtxt|Seymour|Thomas|1993}}.</ref> The order of a bramble is the smallest [[hitting set]] for the family of subgraphs, and the treewidth of a graph is one less than the maximum order of a bramble.\n\n==Examples==\nEvery [[complete graph]] ''K<sub>n</sub>'' has treewidth ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. This is most easily seen using the definition of treewidth in terms of chordal graphs: the complete graph is already chordal, and adding more edges cannot reduce the size of its largest clique.\n\nA connected graph with at least two vertices has treewidth 1 if and only if it is a tree. A tree has treewidth one by the same reasoning as for complete graphs (namely, it is chordal, and has maximum clique size two). Conversely, if a graph has a cycle, then every [[chordal completion]] of the graph includes at least one triangle consisting of three consecutive vertices of the cycle, from which it follows that its treewidth is at least two.\n\n==Bounded treewidth==\n\n===Graph families with bounded treewidth===\nFor any fixed constant ''k'', the graphs of treewidth at most ''k'' are called the [[partial k-tree|partial ''k''-trees]]. Other families of graphs with bounded treewidth include the [[cactus graph]]s, [[pseudoforest]]s, [[series-parallel graph]]s, [[outerplanar graph]]s, [[Halin graph]]s, and [[Apollonian network]]s.<ref name=\"b98\">{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1998}}.</ref> The [[control flow graph]]s arising in the [[compiler|compilation]] of [[Structured programming|structured programs]] also have bounded treewidth, which allows certain tasks such as [[register allocation]] to be performed efficiently on them.<ref>{{harvtxt|Thorup|1998}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[planar graph]]s do not have bounded treewidth, because the ''n'' &times; ''n'' [[grid graph]] is a planar graph with treewidth exactly ''n''. Therefore, if ''F'' is a minor-closed graph family with bounded treewidth, it cannot include all planar graphs. Conversely, if some planar graph cannot occur as a minor for graphs in family ''F'', then there is a constant ''k'' such that all graphs in ''F'' have treewidth at most ''k''. That is, the following three conditions are equivalent to each other:<ref>{{harvtxt|Robertson|Seymour|1986}}.</ref>\n#''F'' is a minor-closed family of bounded-treewidth graphs;\n#One of the finitely many forbidden minors characterizing ''F'' is planar;\n#''F'' is a minor-closed graph family that does not include all planar graphs.\n\n===Forbidden minors===\n[[File:Partial 3-tree forbidden minors.svg|thumb|300px|The four forbidden minors for treewidth 3: ''K''<sub>5</sub> (top-left), the graph of the octahedron (bottom-left), the Wagner graph (top-right), and the graph of the pentagonal prism (bottom-right)]]\nFor every finite value of ''k'', the graphs of treewidth at most ''k'' may be characterized by a finite set of [[Forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minor]]s. (That is, any graph of treewidth >''k'' includes one of the graphs in the set as a minor.) Each of these sets of forbidden minors includes at least one planar graph.\n*For ''k'' = 1, the unique forbidden minor is a 3-vertex [[cycle graph]].<ref name=\"b88\">{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1988}}.</ref>\n*For ''k'' = 2, the unique forbidden minor is the 4-vertex [[complete graph]] ''K''<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"b88\"/>\n*For ''k'' = 3, there are four forbidden minors: ''K''<sub>5</sub>, the graph of the [[octahedron]], the [[pentagonal prism|pentagonal]] [[prism graph]], and the [[Wagner graph]]. Of these, the two [[polyhedral graph]]s are planar.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arnborg|Proskurowski|Corneil|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Satyanarayana|Tung|1990}}.</ref>\nFor larger values of ''k'', the number of forbidden minors grows at least as quickly as the exponential of the square root of&nbsp;''k''.{{sfnp|Ramachandramurthi|1997}} However, known upper bounds on the size and number of forbidden minors are much higher than this lower bound.{{sfnp|Lagergren|1993}}\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n\n===Computing the treewidth===\nIt is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph ''G'' has treewidth at most a given variable ''k''.{{sfnp|Arnborg|Corneil|Proskurowski|1987}}\nHowever, when ''k'' is any fixed constant, the graphs with treewidth ''k'' can be recognized, and a width ''k'' tree decomposition constructed for them, in linear time.<ref name=\"b96\">{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1996}}.</ref> The time dependence of this algorithm on ''k'' is exponential.\n\nDue to the roles the treewidth plays in an enormous number of fields, different practical and theoretical algorithms computing the treewidth of a graph were developed. Depending on the application on hand, one can prefer better approximation ratio, or better  dependence in the running time from the size of the input or the treewidth.   \nThe table below provides an overview of some of the treewidth  algorithms. Here <math> k </math> is the treewidth and <math>n</math> is the number of vertices of an input graph  <math>G</math>.\nEach of the algorithms outputs in time <math>f(k)\\cdot g(n)</math> a decomposition of width given in the Approximation column. For example, the algorithm of {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1996}} in time <math>O(k^{O(k^3)})\\cdot n </math> either constructs a tree decomposition of the input graph  <math>G</math> of width at most \n<math>k </math> or reports that the treewidth of <math>G</math> is more than\n<math>k </math>. Similarly,  the algorithm of {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|Drange|Dregi|Fomin|2016}}  in time <math>2^{O(k)}\\cdot n </math> either constructs a tree decomposition of the input graph  <math>G</math> of width at most \n<math>5k+4 </math> or reports that the treewidth of <math>G</math> is more than\n<math>k </math>. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Later, several authors independently observed at the end of the 1980s<ref>{{harvtxt|Arnborg|Proskurowski|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Bern|Lawler|Wong|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1988}}.</ref> that many algorithmic problems that are [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] for arbitrary graphs may be solved efficiently by [[dynamic programming]] for graphs of bounded treewidth, using the tree-decompositions of these graphs.\n\nAs an example, the problem of [[graph coloring|coloring]] a graph of treewidth ''k'' may be solved by using a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm on a tree decomposition of the graph. For each set ''X<sub>i</sub>'' of the tree decomposition, and each [[Partition of a set|partition]] of the vertices of  ''X<sub>i</sub>'' into color classes, the algorithm determines whether that coloring is valid and can be extended to all descendant nodes in the tree decomposition, by combining information of a similar type computed and stored at those nodes. The resulting algorithm finds an optimal coloring of an ''n''-vertex graph in time ''O''(''k''<sup>''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''O''(1)</sup>''n''), a time bound that makes this problem [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]].\n\n===Courcelle's theorem===\n{{main|Courcelle's theorem}}\nFor a large class of problems, there is a linear time algorithm to solve a problem from the class if a [[Tree decomposition|tree-decomposition]] with constant bounded treewidth is provided. Specifically, [[Courcelle's theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The monadic second-order logic of graphs I: Recognizable sets of finite graphs|last = Courcelle|first = B.|date = 1990|journal = Information and Computation|doi = 10.1016/0890-5401(90)90043-h|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 85|pages = 12\u201375|issue = |citeseerx = 10.1.1.158.5595}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The monadic second-order logic of graphs III: Treewidth, forbidden minors and complexity issues.|last = Courcelle|first = B.|date = 1992|journal = Informatique Th\u00e9orique|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |edition = |pages = 257\u2013286|issue = 26}}</ref> state that if a graph problem can be expressed in the [[logic of graphs]] using [[Monadic second-order logic|monadic second order logic]], then it can be solved in linear time on graphs with bounded treewidth. Monadic second order logic is a language to describe graph properties that uses the following constructions: logic operations  (<math> \\wedge ,\\vee ,\\neg ,\\Rightarrow </math>), membership tests (e.g., <math> e \\in E, v \\in V </math>), quantifications over vertices, edges, sets of vertices, sets of edges (e.g., <math>\\forall</math>  <math>v \\in V</math>, <math>\\exists</math>  <math>e \\in E</math>,  <math>\\exists</math>  <math>I \\subseteq V</math>,  <math>\\forall</math>  <math>F \\subseteq E </math>), adjacency tests (''u'' is an endpoint of ''e''), and some extensions that allow for things such as optimization.\n\nConsider for example the [[graph coloring|3-coloring problem]] for graphs. For a graph <math>G=(V,E)</math>, this problem asks if it is possible to assign each vertex <math>v \\in V</math> one of the 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.\nThis problem can be expressed in monadic second order logic as follows: \n:<math> \\exists W_1 \\subseteq V : \\exists W_2 \\subseteq V : \\exists W_3 \\subseteq V : \\forall v \\in V : (v \\in W_1 \\vee v \\in W_2 \\vee v \\in W_3) \\wedge </math>\n:<math> \\forall v \\in V : \\forall w \\in V : (v,w) \\in E \\Rightarrow (\\neg (v \\in W_1 \\wedge w \\in W_1) \\wedge \\neg (v \\in W_2 \\wedge w \\in W_2) \\wedge \\neg (v \\in W_3 \\wedge w \\in W_3))</math>, \nwhere <math>W_1, W_2, W_3</math> represent the subsets of vertices having each of the 3 colors.\nTherefore, by  Courcelle's results, the 3-coloring problem can be solved in linear time for a graph given a tree-decomposition of bounded constant treewidth.\n\n==Related parameters==\n\n===Pathwidth===\nThe [[pathwidth]] of a graph has a very similar definition to treewidth via tree decompositions, but is restricted to tree decompositions in which the underlying tree of the decomposition is a [[path graph]]. Alternatively, the pathwidth may be defined from [[interval graph]]s analogously to the definition of treewidth from chordal graphs. As a consequence, the pathwidth of a graph is always at least as large as its treewidth, but it can only be larger by a logarithmic factor.<ref name=\"b98\"/> Another parameter, the [[graph bandwidth]], has an analogous definition from [[proper interval graph]]s, and is at least as large as the pathwidth. Other related parameters include the [[tree-depth]], a number that is bounded for a minor-closed graph family if and only if the family excludes a path, and the [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]], a measure of the sparsity of a graph that is at most equal to its treewidth.\n\n===Grid minor size===\nBecause the treewidth of an ''n''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' [[grid graph]] is ''n'', the treewidth of a graph ''G'' is always greater than or equal to the size of the largest square grid [[graph minor|minor]] of ''G''. In the other direction, the ''grid minor theorem'' by [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Robertson]] and [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Seymour]] shows that there exists a function ''f'' such that the treewidth is at most ''f''(''r'') where ''r'' is the size of the largest square grid minor.<ref>Robertson, Seymour. ''Graph minors. V. Excluding a planar graph''. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0095895686900304] {{Open access}}</ref> The best bounds known on ''f'' are that ''f'' must be at least \u03a9(''r''<sup>''d''</sup>) for some fixed constant ''d''>0, and at most O({{sqrt|''r''/log ''r''}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Chekuri|Chuzhoy|2016}}. For the &Omega; notation in the lower bound, see [[big O notation]].</ref> Tighter bounds are known for restricted graph families, leading to efficient algorithms for many graph optimization problems on those families through the theory of [[bidimensionality]].{{sfnp|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2008}}\n[[Halin's grid theorem]] provides an analogue of the relation between treewidth and grid minor size for infinite graphs.{{sfnp|Diestel|2004}}\n\n===Diameter and local treewidth===\nA family ''F'' of graphs closed under taking subgraphs is said to have '''bounded local treewidth''', or the '''diameter-treewidth property''', if the treewidth of the graphs in the family is [[upper bound]]ed by a function of their [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]]. If the class is also assumed to be closed under taking [[graph minor|minors]], then ''F'' has bounded local treewidth if and only if one of the [[Forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minor]]s for ''F'' is an [[apex graph]].{{sfnp|Eppstein|2000}} The original proofs of this result showed that treewidth in an apex-minor-free graph family grows at most doubly exponentially as a function of diameter;<ref>{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2000}}; {{harvtxt|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2004a}}.</ref> later this was reduced to singly exponential{{sfnp|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2008}} and finally to a linear bound.{{sfnp|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2004b}}\nBounded local treewidth is closely related to the algorithmic theory of [[bidimensionality]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Demaine|Fomin|Hajiaghayi|Thilikos|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2008}}.</ref> and every graph property definable in first order logic can be decided for an apex-minor-free graph family in an amount of time that is only slightly superlinear.{{sfnp|Frick|Grohe|2001}}\n\nIt is also possible for a class of graphs that is not closed under minors to have bounded local treewidth. In particular this is trivially true for a class of bounded degree graphs, as bounded diameter subgraphs have bounded size. Another example is given by [[1-planar graph]]s, graphs that can be drawn in the plane with one crossing per edge, and more generally for the graphs that can be drawn on a surface of bounded genus with a bounded number of crossings per edge. As with minor-closed graph families of bounded local treewidth, this property has pointed the way to efficient approximation algorithms for these graphs.{{sfnp|Grigoriev|Bodlaender|2007}}\n\n===Hadwiger number and ''S''-functions===\n{{harvtxt|Halin|1976}} defines a class of graph parameters that he calls ''S''-functions, which include the treewidth. These functions from graphs to integers are required to be zero on [[empty graph|graphs with no edges]], to be [[graph minor|minor-monotone]] (a function ''f'' is referred to as \"minor-monotone\" if, whenever ''H'' is a minor of ''G'', one has f(H) \u2264 f(G)), to increase by one when a new vertex is added that is adjacent to all previous vertices, and to take the larger value from the two subgraphs on either side of a [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] [[Vertex separator|separator]]. The set of all such functions forms a [[complete lattice]] under the operations of elementwise minimization and maximization. The top element in this lattice is the treewidth, and the bottom element is the [[Hadwiger number]], the size of the largest [[complete graph|complete]] [[graph minor|minor]] in the given graph.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Arnborg | first1 = S.\n | last2 = Corneil | first2 = D. | author2-link = Derek Corneil\n | last3 = Proskurowski | first3 = A.\n | title = Complexity of finding embeddings in a ''k''-tree\n | journal = SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications\n | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1987 | pages = 277\u2013284 | doi = 10.1137/0608024}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Arnborg | first1 = Stefan\n | last2 = Proskurowski | first2 = Andrzej\n | last3 = Corneil | first3 = Derek G. | author3-link = Derek Corneil\n | doi = 10.1016/0012-365X(90)90292-P\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Discrete Mathematics\n | mr = 1045920\n | pages = 1\u201319\n | title = Forbidden minors characterization of partial 3-trees\n | volume = 80\n | year = 1990}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Arnborg | first1 = S.\n | last2 = Proskurowski | first2 = A.\n | title = Linear time algorithms for NP-hard problems restricted to partial ''k''-trees\n | journal = Discrete Applied Mathematics\n | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | year = 1989 | pages = 11\u201324 | doi = 10.1016/0166-218X(89)90031-0}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Bern | first1 = M.

Treewidth may be defined in several equivalent ways: from the size of the largest vertex set in a [[tree decomposition]] of the graph, from the size of the largest [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] in a [[chordal completion]] of the graph, from the maximum order of a [[haven (graph theory)|haven]] describing a strategy for a [[pursuit-evasion]] game on the graph, or from the maximum order of a [[Bramble (graph theory)|bramble]], a collection of connected subgraphs that all touch each other.\n\nTreewidth is commonly used as a parameter in the [[parameterized complexity]] analysis of graph [[algorithm]]s. The graphs with treewidth at most ''k'' are also called [[partial k-tree|partial ''k''-trees]]; many other well-studied graph families also have bounded treewidth.\n\nThe concept of treewidth was originally introduced by {{harvs|last1 = Bertel\u00e9|first1=Umberto|last2=Brioschi|first2=Francesco|year = 1972|txt}} under the name of ''dimension''. It was later rediscovered by {{harvs|last=Halin|first=Rudolf|authorlink=Rudolf Halin|year=1976|txt}}, based on properties that it shares with a different graph parameter, the [[Hadwiger number]]. Later it was again rediscovered by {{harvs|first1=Neil|last1=Robertson|author1-link=Neil Robertson (mathematician)|first2=Paul|last2=Seymour|author2-link=Paul Seymour (mathematician)|year=1984|txt}} and has since been studied by many other authors.<ref>{{harvtxt|Diestel|2005}} pp.354\u2013355</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n[[Image:Tree decomposition.svg|thumb|240px|A graph with eight vertices, and a tree decomposition of it onto a tree with six nodes. Each graph edge connects two vertices that are listed together at some tree node, and each graph vertex is listed at the nodes of a contiguous subtree of the tree. Each tree node lists at most three vertices, so the width of this decomposition is two.]]\nA [[tree decomposition]] of a graph ''G'' = (''V'', ''E'') is a tree, ''T'', with nodes ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, where each ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> is a subset of ''V'', satisfying the following properties<ref>{{harvtxt|Diestel|2005}} section 12.3</ref> (the term ''node'' is used to refer to a vertex of ''T'' to avoid confusion with vertices of ''G''):\n# The union of all sets ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> equals ''V''. That is, each graph vertex is contained in at least one tree node.\n# If ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''X''<sub>''j''</sub> both contain a vertex ''v'', then all nodes ''X''<sub>''k''</sub> of ''T'' in the (unique) path between ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''X''<sub>''j''</sub> contain ''v'' as well. Equivalently, the tree nodes containing vertex ''v'' form a connected subtree of ''T''.\n# For every edge (''v'', ''w'') in the graph, there is a subset ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> that contains both ''v'' and ''w''. That is, vertices are adjacent in the graph only when the corresponding subtrees have a node in common.\nThe ''width'' of a tree decomposition is the size of its largest set ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> minus one.   The '''treewidth''' tw(''G'') of a graph ''G'' is the minimum width among all possible tree decompositions of ''G''. In this definition, the size of the largest set is diminished by one in order to make the treewidth of a tree equal to one.\n\nEquivalently, the treewidth of ''G'' is one less than the size of the largest [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] in the [[chordal graph]] containing ''G'' with the smallest [[maximum clique|clique number]]. A chordal graph with this clique size may be obtained by adding to ''G'' an edge between every two vertices that both belong to at least one of the sets ''X<sub>i</sub>''.\n\nTreewidth may also be characterized in terms of [[haven (graph theory)|havens]], functions describing an evasion strategy for a certain [[pursuit-evasion]] game defined on a graph. A graph ''G'' has treewidth ''k'' if and only if it has a haven of order {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} but of no higher order, where a haven of order {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}} is a function ''\u03b2'' that maps each set ''X'' of at most ''k'' vertices in ''G'' into one of the connected components of {{nowrap|''G'' \\ ''X''}} and that obeys the [[monotonicity]] property that {{nowrap|''&beta;''(''Y'') \u2286 ''&beta;''(''X'')}} whenever {{nowrap|''X'' \u2286 ''Y''.}}\n\n[[File:3x3 grid graph haven.svg|thumb|A [[Bramble (graph theory)|bramble]] of order four in a 3&times;3 grid graph, the existence of which shows that the graph has treewidth at least&nbsp;3]]\nA similar characterization can also be made using [[Bramble (graph theory)|brambles]], families of connected subgraphs that all touch each other (meaning either that they share a vertex or are connected by an edge).<ref>{{harvtxt|Seymour|Thomas|1993}}.</ref> The order of a bramble is the smallest [[hitting set]] for the family of subgraphs, and the treewidth of a graph is one less than the maximum order of a bramble.\n\n==Examples==\nEvery [[complete graph]] ''K<sub>n</sub>'' has treewidth ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. This is most easily seen using the definition of treewidth in terms of chordal graphs: the complete graph is already chordal, and adding more edges cannot reduce the size of its largest clique.\n\nA connected graph with at least two vertices has treewidth 1 if and only if it is a tree. A tree has treewidth one by the same reasoning as for complete graphs (namely, it is chordal, and has maximum clique size two). Conversely, if a graph has a cycle, then every [[chordal completion]] of the graph includes at least one triangle consisting of three consecutive vertices of the cycle, from which it follows that its treewidth is at least two.\n\n==Bounded treewidth==\n\n===Graph families with bounded treewidth===\nFor any fixed constant ''k'', the graphs of treewidth at most ''k'' are called the [[partial k-tree|partial ''k''-trees]]. Other families of graphs with bounded treewidth include the [[cactus graph]]s, [[pseudoforest]]s, [[series-parallel graph]]s, [[outerplanar graph]]s, [[Halin graph]]s, and [[Apollonian network]]s.<ref name=\"b98\">{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1998}}.</ref> The [[control flow graph]]s arising in the [[compiler|compilation]] of [[Structured programming|structured programs]] also have bounded treewidth, which allows certain tasks such as [[register allocation]] to be performed efficiently on them.<ref>{{harvtxt|Thorup|1998}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[planar graph]]s do not have bounded treewidth, because the ''n'' &times; ''n'' [[grid graph]] is a planar graph with treewidth exactly ''n''. Therefore, if ''F'' is a minor-closed graph family with bounded treewidth, it cannot include all planar graphs. Conversely, if some planar graph cannot occur as a minor for graphs in family ''F'', then there is a constant ''k'' such that all graphs in ''F'' have treewidth at most ''k''. That is, the following three conditions are equivalent to each other:<ref>{{harvtxt|Robertson|Seymour|1986}}.</ref>\n#''F'' is a minor-closed family of bounded-treewidth graphs;\n#One of the finitely many forbidden minors characterizing ''F'' is planar;\n#''F'' is a minor-closed graph family that does not include all planar graphs.\n\n===Forbidden minors===\n[[File:Partial 3-tree forbidden minors.svg|thumb|300px|The four forbidden minors for treewidth 3: ''K''<sub>5</sub> (top-left), the graph of the octahedron (bottom-left), the Wagner graph (top-right), and the graph of the pentagonal prism (bottom-right)]]\nFor every finite value of ''k'', the graphs of treewidth at most ''k'' may be characterized by a finite set of [[Forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minor]]s. (That is, any graph of treewidth >''k'' includes one of the graphs in the set as a minor.) Each of these sets of forbidden minors includes at least one planar graph.\n*For ''k'' = 1, the unique forbidden minor is a 3-vertex [[cycle graph]].<ref name=\"b88\">{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1988}}.</ref>\n*For ''k'' = 2, the unique forbidden minor is the 4-vertex [[complete graph]] ''K''<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=\"b88\"/>\n*For ''k'' = 3, there are four forbidden minors: ''K''<sub>5</sub>, the graph of the [[octahedron]], the [[pentagonal prism|pentagonal]] [[prism graph]], and the [[Wagner graph]]. Of these, the two [[polyhedral graph]]s are planar.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arnborg|Proskurowski|Corneil|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Satyanarayana|Tung|1990}}.</ref>\nFor larger values of ''k'', the number of forbidden minors grows at least as quickly as the exponential of the square root of&nbsp;''k''.{{sfnp|Ramachandramurthi|1997}} However, known upper bounds on the size and number of forbidden minors are much higher than this lower bound.{{sfnp|Lagergren|1993}}\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n\n===Computing the treewidth===\nIt is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph ''G'' has treewidth at most a given variable ''k''.{{sfnp|Arnborg|Corneil|Proskurowski|1987}}\nHowever, when ''k'' is any fixed constant, the graphs with treewidth ''k'' can be recognized, and a width ''k'' tree decomposition constructed for them, in linear time.<ref name=\"b96\">{{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1996}}.</ref> The time dependence of this algorithm on ''k'' is exponential.\n\nDue to the roles the treewidth plays in an enormous number of fields, different practical and theoretical algorithms computing the treewidth of a graph were developed. Depending on the application on hand, one can prefer better approximation ratio, or better  dependence in the running time from the size of the input or the treewidth.   \nThe table below provides an overview of some of the treewidth  algorithms. Here <math> k </math> is the treewidth and <math>n</math> is the number of vertices of an input graph  <math>G</math>.\nEach of the algorithms outputs in time <math>f(k)\\cdot g(n)</math> a decomposition of width given in the Approximation column.

Later, several authors independently observed at the end of the 1980s<ref>{{harvtxt|Arnborg|Proskurowski|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Bern|Lawler|Wong|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1988}}.</ref> that many algorithmic problems that are [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] for arbitrary graphs may be solved efficiently by [[dynamic programming]] for graphs of bounded treewidth, using the tree-decompositions of these graphs.\n\nAs an example, the problem of [[graph coloring|coloring]] a graph of treewidth ''k'' may be solved by using a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm on a tree decomposition of the graph. For each set ''X<sub>i</sub>'' of the tree decomposition, and each [[Partition of a set|partition]] of the vertices of  ''X<sub>i</sub>'' into color classes, the algorithm determines whether that coloring is valid and can be extended to all descendant nodes in the tree decomposition, by combining information of a similar type computed and stored at those nodes. The resulting algorithm finds an optimal coloring of an ''n''-vertex graph in time ''O''(''k''<sup>''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''O''(1)</sup>''n''), a time bound that makes this problem [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]].\n\n===Courcelle's theorem===\n{{main|Courcelle's theorem}}\nFor a large class of problems, there is a linear time algorithm to solve a problem from the class if a [[Tree decomposition|tree-decomposition]] with constant bounded treewidth is provided. Specifically, [[Courcelle's theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The monadic second-order logic of graphs I: Recognizable sets of finite graphs|last = Courcelle|first = B.|date = 1990|journal = Information and Computation|doi = 10.1016/0890-5401(90)90043-h|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 85|pages = 12\u201375|issue = |citeseerx = 10.1.1.158.5595}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The monadic second-order logic of graphs III: Treewidth, forbidden minors and complexity issues.|last = Courcelle|first = B.|date = 1992|journal = Informatique Th\u00e9orique|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |edition = |pages = 257\u2013286|issue = 26}}</ref> state that if a graph problem can be expressed in the [[logic of graphs]] using [[Monadic second-order logic|monadic second order logic]], then it can be solved in linear time on graphs with bounded treewidth. Monadic second order logic is a language to describe graph properties that uses the following constructions: logic operations  (<math> \\wedge ,\\vee ,\\neg ,\\Rightarrow </math>), membership tests (e.g., <math> e \\in E, v \\in V </math>), quantifications over vertices, edges, sets of vertices, sets of edges (e.g., <math>\\forall</math>  <math>v \\in V</math>, <math>\\exists</math>  <math>e \\in E</math>,  <math>\\exists</math>  <math>I \\subseteq V</math>,  <math>\\forall</math>  <math>F \\subseteq E </math>), adjacency tests (''u'' is an endpoint of ''e''), and some extensions that allow for things such as optimization.\n\nConsider for example the [[graph coloring|3-coloring problem]] for graphs. For a graph <math>G=(V,E)</math>, this problem asks if it is possible to assign each vertex <math>v \\in V</math> one of the 3 colors such that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.\nThis problem can be expressed in monadic second order logic as follows: \n:<math> \\exists W_1 \\subseteq V : \\exists W_2 \\subseteq V : \\exists W_3 \\subseteq V : \\forall v \\in V : (v \\in W_1 \\vee v \\in W_2 \\vee v \\in W_3) \\wedge </math>\n:<math> \\forall v \\in V : \\forall w \\in V : (v,w) \\in E \\Rightarrow (\\neg (v \\in W_1 \\wedge w \\in W_1) \\wedge \\neg (v \\in W_2 \\wedge w \\in W_2) \\wedge \\neg (v \\in W_3 \\wedge w \\in W_3))</math>, \nwhere <math>W_1, W_2, W_3</math> represent the subsets of vertices having each of the 3 colors.\nTherefore, by  Courcelle's results, the 3-coloring problem can be solved in linear time for a graph given a tree-decomposition of bounded constant treewidth.\n\n==Related parameters==\n\n===Pathwidth===\nThe [[pathwidth]] of a graph has a very similar definition to treewidth via tree decompositions, but is restricted to tree decompositions in which the underlying tree of the decomposition is a [[path graph]]. Alternatively, the pathwidth may be defined from [[interval graph]]s analogously to the definition of treewidth from chordal graphs. As a consequence, the pathwidth of a graph is always at least as large as its treewidth, but it can only be larger by a logarithmic factor.<ref name=\"b98\"/> Another parameter, the [[graph bandwidth]], has an analogous definition from [[proper interval graph]]s, and is at least as large as the pathwidth. Other related parameters include the [[tree-depth]], a number that is bounded for a minor-closed graph family if and only if the family excludes a path, and the [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]], a measure of the sparsity of a graph that is at most equal to its treewidth.\n\n===Grid minor size===\nBecause the treewidth of an ''n''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n'' [[grid graph]] is ''n'', the treewidth of a graph ''G'' is always greater than or equal to the size of the largest square grid [[graph minor|minor]] of ''G''. In the other direction, the ''grid minor theorem'' by [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Robertson]] and [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Seymour]] shows that there exists a function ''f'' such that the treewidth is at most ''f''(''r'') where ''r'' is the size of the largest square grid minor.<ref>Robertson, Seymour. ''Graph minors. V. Excluding a planar graph''. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0095895686900304] {{Open access}}</ref> The best bounds known on ''f'' are that ''f'' must be at least \u03a9(''r''<sup>''d''</sup>) for some fixed constant ''d''>0, and at most O({{sqrt|''r''/log ''r''}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Chekuri|Chuzhoy|2016}}. For the &Omega; notation in the lower bound, see [[big O notation]].</ref> Tighter bounds are known for restricted graph families, leading to efficient algorithms for many graph optimization problems on those families through the theory of [[bidimensionality]].{{sfnp|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2008}}\n[[Halin's grid theorem]] provides an analogue of the relation between treewidth and grid minor size for infinite graphs.{{sfnp|Diestel|2004}}\n\n===Diameter and local treewidth===\nA family ''F'' of graphs closed under taking subgraphs is said to have '''bounded local treewidth''', or the '''diameter-treewidth property''', if the treewidth of the graphs in the family is [[upper bound]]ed by a function of their [[Diameter (graph theory)|diameter]]. If the class is also assumed to be closed under taking [[graph minor|minors]], then ''F'' has bounded local treewidth if and only if one of the [[Forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minor]]s for ''F'' is an [[apex graph]].{{sfnp|Eppstein|2000}} The original proofs of this result showed that treewidth in an apex-minor-free graph family grows at most doubly exponentially as a function of diameter;<ref>{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2000}}; {{harvtxt|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2004a}}.</ref> later this was reduced to singly exponential{{sfnp|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2008}} and finally to a linear bound.{{sfnp|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2004b}}\nBounded local treewidth is closely related to the algorithmic theory of [[bidimensionality]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Demaine|Fomin|Hajiaghayi|Thilikos|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Demaine|Hajiaghayi|2008}}.</ref> and every graph property definable in first order logic can be decided for an apex-minor-free graph family in an amount of time that is only slightly superlinear.{{sfnp|Frick|Grohe|2001}}\n\nIt is also possible for a class of graphs that is not closed under minors to have bounded local treewidth. In particular this is trivially true for a class of bounded degree graphs, as bounded diameter subgraphs have bounded size. Another example is given by [[1-planar graph]]s, graphs that can be drawn in the plane with one crossing per edge, and more generally for the graphs that can be drawn on a surface of bounded genus with a bounded number of crossings per edge. As with minor-closed graph families of bounded local treewidth, this property has pointed the way to efficient approximation algorithms for these graphs.{{sfnp|Grigoriev|Bodlaender|2007}}\n\n===Hadwiger number and ''S''-functions===\n{{harvtxt|Halin|1976}} defines a class of graph parameters that he calls ''S''-functions, which include the treewidth. These functions from graphs to integers are required to be zero on [[empty graph|graphs with no edges]], to be [[graph minor|minor-monotone]] (a function ''f'' is referred to as \"minor-monotone\" if, whenever ''H'' is a minor of ''G'', one has f(H) \u2264 f(G)), to increase by one when a new vertex is added that is adjacent to all previous vertices, and to take the larger value from the two subgraphs on either side of a [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] [[Vertex separator|separator]]. The set of all such functions forms a [[complete lattice]] under the operations of elementwise minimization and maximization. The top element in this lattice is the treewidth, and the bottom element is the [[Hadwiger number]], the size of the largest [[complete graph|complete]] [[graph minor|minor]] in the given graph.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Arnborg | first1 = S.\n | last2 = Corneil | first2 = D. | author2-link = Derek Corneil\n | last3 = Proskurowski | first3 = A.\n | title = Complexity of finding embeddings in a ''k''-tree\n | journal = SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications\n | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | year = 1987 | pages = 277\u2013284 | doi = 10.1137/0608024}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Arnborg | first1 = Stefan\n | last2 = Proskurowski | first2 = Andrzej\n | last3 = Corneil | first3 = Derek G. | author3-link = Derek Corneil\n | doi = 10.1016/0012-365X(90)90292-P\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Discrete Mathematics\n | mr = 1045920\n | pages = 1\u201319\n | title = Forbidden minors characterization of partial 3-trees\n | volume = 80\n | year = 1990}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Arnborg | first1 = S.\n | last2 = Proskurowski | first2 = A.\n | title = Linear time algorithms for NP-hard problems restricted to partial ''k''-trees\n | journal = Discrete Applied Mathematics\n | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | year = 1989 | pages = 11\u201324 | doi = 10.1016/0166-218X(89)90031-0}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Bern | first1 = M.
