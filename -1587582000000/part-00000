It is a [[remake]] of the [[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|1961 film of the same name]] and an adaptation of [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]'s German novel ''[[Lottie and Lisa]]'' (''Das doppelte Lottchen'').\n\n[[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Natasha Richardson]] star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; [[Lindsay Lohan]] stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]] wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on ''Lottie and Lisa''. The story is comparable to that of the 1936 [[Deanna Durbin]] film ''[[Three Smart Girls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kawano|first1=Kelley|title=Let's Get Together: An In-Depth Look at the Ongoing Appeal of Hayley Mills' 'The Parent Trap'|url=http://www.wordandfilm.com/2012/06/lets-get-together-hayley-mills-in-depth-look-ongoing-appeal-the-parent-trap/|website=Wordandfilm.com|accessdate=November 9, 2014|date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1986, [[Americans|American]] [[winery]] owner Nicholas \"Nick\" Parker and [[British people|British]] [[wedding gown]] designer Elizabeth \"Liz\" James meet, fall in love, and get married over the course of a transatlantic crossing on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''. However, shortly after the birth of their identical twin daughters, Annie and Hallie, they get divorced and each has sole custody of one girl. Nick raises Hallie in [[Napa Valley, California]] and Elizabeth raises Annie in [[London, England]].\n\nEleven years and nine months later in the summer of 1998, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally send their daughters to Camp Walden, a girls' [[sleep away camp]] in [[Maine]]. Annie and Hallie, who do not know each other, meet after a fencing match and take an immediate dislike to one another.\n\nAnnie and Hallie\u2019s dislike for each other grows and they begin to pull a series of pranks on each other. After a prank goes too far, the two are isolated together as punishment until camp is over. They ecstatically discover that they are twins and hatch a plan: for each girl to switch and meet the parent she has never met and reunite them. After a makeover, where Annie gets a haircut and pierces her ears, Hallie imitates Annie's British accent and flies to London to meet their mother, maternal grandfather Charles, and the James' butler, Martin.\n\nAnnie imitates Hallie's American accent, and flies to Napa Valley to meet their father, Hallie's nanny Chessy, and their dog Sammy. Eventually the plan unravels, as Charles catches Hallie sneaking out to a phone booth to call Annie in California, and gets her to confess that she is Hallie over a walk in the park. Soon after, Chessy is suspicious of \"Hallie's\" behavior, and Annie confirms her suspicions. After discovering that their father is engaged to the child-hating [[gold digger]] Meredith Blake, Annie and Hallie come clean and tell their parents they switched, it was part of their plot to reunite Elizabeth and Nick by falsely telling Elizabeth that Nick wants to meet her in [[San Francisco]]. Chessy, Martin, and Charles decide to help the girls' plan, and want to help them get their parents back together. Nick is shocked, but delighted to see Elizabeth for the first time in years, and to learn that he's had Annie in his care since the end of camp. Meanwhile, Chessy and Martin grow romantically attracted to each other.\n\nThe girls' pull out all the stops, including recreating the night their parents met, by having Charles pay to rent out a yacht for an evening, and having Chessy and Martin act as a waitress and [[sommelier]] respectively. However, they ultimately fail to rekindle Nick and Elizabeth's relationship. The twins resort to a last-ditch effort, by demanding a three-day family camping trip, refusing to reveal which twin is ''which'' until after they return; Elizabeth tricks Meredith into taking her place on the camping trip.\n\nAnnie and Hallie play a number of pranks on Meredith, who becomes enraged after waking up in the middle of the lake on her air mattress and gives Nick an ultimatum; choose either the girls or her. Nick, finally seeing Meredith for who she truly is, chooses the girls over Meredith much to her dismay, and as a result, she angrily breaks off the engagement. Being a responsible father, Nick punishes the girls for their mischief; however, he comments to Elizabeth that he will have to thank them one day.\n\nNick shows Elizabeth his wine collection, including the one from their wedding. Both realize they still have feelings for one another, but decide it is better to go their separate ways. Elizabeth and Annie later board a flight for London, but when they arrive, they find Nick and Hallie waiting for them (having taken a faster flight on the [[Concorde]]). Nick realizes his previous mistake of not going after Elizabeth when she left him and proposes to her. Elizabeth yields to Nick's unwavering confidence and tearfully accepts. Photos show Nick and Elizabeth getting remarried aboard the ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', with Annie and Hallie as bridesmaids, while Charles also presenting, and Martin proposing to Chessy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Lindsay Lohan]] as Hallie Parker and Annie James, eleven-year-old twin sisters who were separated after birth.

Later in the hotel, Hallie sings a few bars of \"[[Let's Get Together (Hayley Mills song)|Let's Get Together]]\", a tune from the first version of the film that was a hit for its star, Hayley Mills. The song is also quoted over the Walt Disney Pictures logo, and at the end of [[Alan Silvestri]]'s closing credits suite.\n\nWhen Hallie shows up at Annie's poker game at Camp Walden, the music used is \"[[Bad to the Bone]]\" by [[George Thorogood]] and the Destroyers.\n\nThe background song heard in the campfire scene is \"[[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]]\" by the music group [[OMC (band)|OMC]].\n<!-- See [[Template:Tracklist]] if you want to improve this section -->\n\nThe tune playing as Hallie and Annie are making their way up to the Isolation Cabin is the main theme from \"[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]\" by Elmer Bernstein.\n\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Parent Trap\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| released   = July 28, 1998\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n| length     = 54:08\n| label      = [[Hollywood Records|Hollywood]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = \n| headline  = ''The Parent Trap'' (Original Soundtrack)\n|extra_column= Recording artist\n| total_length =  54:08\n\n| title1    = [[L-O-V-E]]\n| writer1   = Bert Kaempfert; Milt Gabler\n|extra1= [[Nat King Cole]]\n| length1   = 2:32\n\n| title2    = [[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]\n| writer2   = John Sebastian\n|extra2= [[The Lovin' Spoonful]]\n| length2   = 2:05\n\n| title3    = [[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]  \n| writer3   =Lee Mavers\n|extra3= [[The La's]]\n| length3   = 2:43\n\n| title4    = [[Top of the World (The Carpenters song)|Top of the World]] \n| writer4   = Fred Busby; John Bettis\n|extra4= [[Shonen Knife]]\n| length4   = 3:56\n\n| title5    =  [[Here Comes the Sun]] \n| writer5   = George Harrison\n|extra5= [[Bronx Style Bob|Bob Khaleel]]\n| length5   =  3:08\n\n| title6    = [[(I Love You) For Sentimental Reasons]]  \n| writer6   = Deek Watson; William Best\n|extra6= [[Linda Ronstadt]]\n| length6   = 3:44\n\n| title7    = [[Am I the Same Girl|Soulful Strut]]\n| writer7   = Eugene Record; Sonny Sanders\n|extra7=[[Young-Holt Unlimited]]  \n| length7   = 3:00\n\n| title8    = Never Let You Go\n| writer8   =Christian Berman; Frank Berman; Gabriel Gilbert; Jeff Coplan; Matthias Hass; Nick Laird-Clowes\n|extra8= [[Jakaranda]]\n| length8   = 3:07\n\n| title9    = [[Bad to the Bone]]\n| writer9   = [[George Thorogood]]\n|extra9= [[George Thorogood & The Destroyers]]\n| length9   = 4:49\n\n| title10   = [[The Happy Club]] \n| writer10  =[[Bob Geldof]]; [[Karl Wallinger]]\n|extra10= Bob Geldof\n| length10  = 4:05\n\n| title11   =  Suite from ''The Parent Trap'' \n| writer11  = [[Alan Silvestri]]\n|extra11= \n| length11  = 7:13\n\n| title12   = [[This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)]] \n| writer12  = Chuck Jackson; Marvin Yancy\n|extra12= [[Natalie Cole]]\n| length12  = 2:49\n\n| title13   = Dream Come True{{ref|a}}\n| writer13  = Milton Davis\n|extra13= Ta-Gana\n| length13  = 3:50\n\n| title14   = [[Groovin']]{{ref|a}}\n| writer14  = Eddie Brigati; Felix Cavaliere\n|extra14= [[Pato Banton]] & The Reggae Revolution\n| length14  = 3:50\n\n| title15   = Let's Get Together{{ref|a}}\n| writer15  = Richard M.

It is a [[remake]] of the [[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|1961 film of the same name]] and an adaptation of [[Erich K\u00e4stner]]'s German novel ''[[Lottie and Lisa]]'' (''Das doppelte Lottchen'').\n\n[[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Natasha Richardson]] star as a divorced couple who separated shortly after their identical twin daughters' birth; [[Lindsay Lohan]] stars (in her film debut) as both twins, Hallie Parker and Annie James, who are fortuitously reunited at summer camp after being separated at birth. [[David Swift (director)|David Swift]] wrote the screenplay for the original 1961 film based on ''Lottie and Lisa''. The story is comparable to that of the 1936 [[Deanna Durbin]] film ''[[Three Smart Girls]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kawano|first1=Kelley|title=Let's Get Together: An In-Depth Look at the Ongoing Appeal of Hayley Mills' 'The Parent Trap'|url=http://www.wordandfilm.com/2012/06/lets-get-together-hayley-mills-in-depth-look-ongoing-appeal-the-parent-trap/|website=Wordandfilm.com|accessdate=November 9, 2014|date=June 26, 2012}}</ref> Swift is credited along with Meyers and Shyer as co-writers of the 1998 version.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1986, [[Americans|American]] [[winery]] owner Nicholas \"Nick\" Parker and [[British people|British]] [[wedding gown]] designer Elizabeth \"Liz\" James meet, fall in love, and get married over the course of a transatlantic crossing on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]''. However, shortly after the birth of their identical twin daughters, Annie and Hallie, they get divorced and each has sole custody of one girl. Nick raises Hallie in [[Napa Valley, California]] and Elizabeth raises Annie in [[London, England]].\n\nEleven years and nine months later in the summer of 1998, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally send their daughters to Camp Walden, a girls' [[sleep away camp]] in [[Maine]]. Annie and Hallie, who do not know each other, meet after a fencing match and take an immediate dislike to one another.\n\nAnnie and Hallie\u2019s dislike for each other grows and they begin to pull a series of pranks on each other. After a prank goes too far, the two are isolated together as punishment until camp is over. They ecstatically discover that they are twins and hatch a plan: for each girl to switch and meet the parent she has never met and reunite them. After a makeover, where Annie gets a haircut and pierces her ears, Hallie imitates Annie's British accent and flies to London to meet their mother, maternal grandfather Charles, and the James' butler, Martin.\n\nAnnie imitates Hallie's American accent, and flies to Napa Valley to meet their father, Hallie's nanny Chessy, and their dog Sammy. Eventually the plan unravels, as Charles catches Hallie sneaking out to a phone booth to call Annie in California, and gets her to confess that she is Hallie over a walk in the park. Soon after, Chessy is suspicious of \"Hallie's\" behavior, and Annie confirms her suspicions. After discovering that their father is engaged to the child-hating [[gold digger]] Meredith Blake, Annie and Hallie come clean and tell their parents they switched, it was part of their plot to reunite Elizabeth and Nick by falsely telling Elizabeth that Nick wants to meet her in [[San Francisco]]. Chessy, Martin, and Charles decide to help the girls' plan, and want to help them get their parents back together. Nick is shocked, but delighted to see Elizabeth for the first time in years, and to learn that he's had Annie in his care since the end of camp. Meanwhile, Chessy and Martin grow romantically attracted to each other.\n\nThe girls' pull out all the stops, including recreating the night their parents met, by having Charles pay to rent out a yacht for an evening, and having Chessy and Martin act as a waitress and [[sommelier]] respectively. However, they ultimately fail to rekindle Nick and Elizabeth's relationship. The twins resort to a last-ditch effort, by demanding a three-day family camping trip, refusing to reveal which twin is ''which'' until after they return; Elizabeth tricks Meredith into taking her place on the camping trip.\n\nAnnie and Hallie play a number of pranks on Meredith, who becomes enraged after waking up in the middle of the lake on her air mattress and gives Nick an ultimatum; choose either the girls or her. Nick, finally seeing Meredith for who she truly is, chooses the girls over Meredith much to her dismay, and as a result, she angrily breaks off the engagement. Being a responsible father, Nick punishes the girls for their mischief; however, he comments to Elizabeth that he will have to thank them one day.\n\nNick shows Elizabeth his wine collection, including the one from their wedding. Both realize they still have feelings for one another, but decide it is better to go their separate ways. Elizabeth and Annie later board a flight for London, but when they arrive, they find Nick and Hallie waiting for them (having taken a faster flight on the [[Concorde]]). Nick realizes his previous mistake of not going after Elizabeth when she left him and proposes to her. Elizabeth yields to Nick's unwavering confidence and tearfully accepts. Photos show Nick and Elizabeth getting remarried aboard the ''Queen Elizabeth 2'', with Annie and Hallie as bridesmaids, while Charles also presenting, and Martin proposing to Chessy.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Lindsay Lohan]] as Hallie Parker and Annie James, eleven-year-old twin sisters who were separated after birth.

Native American leader, [[Tantamous]] lived in the [[Nobscot Hill]] area of Framingham prior to [[King Philip's War]] in 1676. In 1660, [[Thomas Danforth]], an official of the Bay Colony, formerly of [[Framlingham|Framlingham, Suffolk]], received a grant of land at \"Danforth's Farms\" and began to accumulate over {{convert|15000|acre|km2|-2}}. He strenuously resisted petitions for incorporation of the town, which was officially incorporated in 1700, following his death the previous year. Why the \"L\" was dropped from the new town's name is not known. The first church was organized in 1701, the first teacher was hired in 1706, and the first permanent schoolhouse was built in 1716.\n\nOn February 22, 1775, the British general [[Thomas Gage]] sent two officers and an enlisted man out of Boston to survey the route to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. In Framingham, those spies stopped at Buckminster's Tavern. They watched the town militia muster outside the building, impressed with the men's numbers but not their discipline. Though \"the whole company\" came into the tavern after their drill, the officers remained undetected and continued on their mission the next day.<ref>''General Gage's Instructions'', Boston: John Gill, 1779.</ref> Gage did not order a march along that route, instead ordering troops to [[Concord, Massachusetts]], on April 18\u201319. Framingham sent two militia companies totaling about 130 men into the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] that followed; one of those men was wounded.<ref>Samuel Adams Drake, ''History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts'' (Boston: Estes & Lauriat, 1880), vol. 1, p. 443</ref>\n\nIn the years before the [[American Civil War]], Framingham was an annual gathering-spot for members of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. Each [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] from 1854 to 1865, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society held a rally in a picnic area called Harmony Grove near what is now downtown Framingham. At the 1854 rally, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] burned copies of the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] of 1850, judicial decisions enforcing it, and the [[United States Constitution]]. Other prominent abolitionists present that day included [[William Cooper Nell]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Massachusetts Historical Society: Object Archive |website=Masshist.org |date=1909-09-10 |accessdate=2017-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archive-date=2010-12-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[post-World War II baby boom]], Framingham, like many other suburban areas, experienced a large increase in population and housing. Much of the housing constructed during that time consisted of [[split-level house|split-level]] and ranch-style houses.\n\nFramingham is known for the [[Framingham Heart Study]], as well as for the Dennison Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1844 as a jewelry and watch box manufacturing company by [[Aaron Lufkin Dennison]], who became the pioneer of the [[American System of Watch Manufacturing]] at the nearby [[Waltham Watch Company]]. His brother Eliphalet Whorf Dennison developed the company into a sizable industrial complex which merged in 1990 into [[Avery Dennison]], with headquarters in [[Pasadena, California]], and active corporate offices in the town.\n\nIn 2000, Framingham celebrated its [[Tercentennial]]. Framingham soon rose to become the largest town in Massachusetts, commonly referred to by the people of Framingham as \"The largest town in the country.\" Framingham had attempted to become a city on three prior occasions 1993, 1997, and 2013, all of which were rejected by the people of Framingham.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/framingham/new-englands-largest-town-wants-become-city-0|title=New England's Largest Town Wants to Become a City|date=March 28, 2016|website=Framingham, MA Patch|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> However, on January 1, 2018,  Framingham became a city and [[Yvonne M.

Native American leader, [[Tantamous]] lived in the [[Nobscot Hill]] area of Framingham prior to [[King Philip's War]] in 1676. In 1660, [[Thomas Danforth]], an official of the Bay Colony, formerly of [[Framlingham|Framlingham, Suffolk]], received a grant of land at \"Danforth's Farms\" and began to accumulate over {{convert|15000|acre|km2|-2}}. He strenuously resisted petitions for incorporation of the town, which was officially incorporated in 1700, following his death the previous year. Why the \"L\" was dropped from the new town's name is not known. The first church was organized in 1701, the first teacher was hired in 1706, and the first permanent schoolhouse was built in 1716.\n\nOn February 22, 1775, the British general [[Thomas Gage]] sent two officers and an enlisted man out of Boston to survey the route to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. In Framingham, those spies stopped at Buckminster's Tavern. They watched the town militia muster outside the building, impressed with the men's numbers but not their discipline. Though \"the whole company\" came into the tavern after their drill, the officers remained undetected and continued on their mission the next day.<ref>''General Gage's Instructions'', Boston: John Gill, 1779.</ref> Gage did not order a march along that route, instead ordering troops to [[Concord, Massachusetts]], on April 18\u201319. Framingham sent two militia companies totaling about 130 men into the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] that followed; one of those men was wounded.<ref>Samuel Adams Drake, ''History of Middlesex County, Massachusetts'' (Boston: Estes & Lauriat, 1880), vol. 1, p. 443</ref>\n\nIn the years before the [[American Civil War]], Framingham was an annual gathering-spot for members of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. Each [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] from 1854 to 1865, the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society held a rally in a picnic area called Harmony Grove near what is now downtown Framingham. At the 1854 rally, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] burned copies of the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] of 1850, judicial decisions enforcing it, and the [[United States Constitution]]. Other prominent abolitionists present that day included [[William Cooper Nell]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Wendell Phillips]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Massachusetts Historical Society: Object Archive |website=Masshist.org |date=1909-09-10 |accessdate=2017-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229221730/http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |archive-date=2010-12-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[post-World War II baby boom]], Framingham, like many other suburban areas, experienced a large increase in population and housing. Much of the housing constructed during that time consisted of [[split-level house|split-level]] and ranch-style houses.\n\nFramingham is known for the [[Framingham Heart Study]], as well as for the Dennison Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1844 as a jewelry and watch box manufacturing company by [[Aaron Lufkin Dennison]], who became the pioneer of the [[American System of Watch Manufacturing]] at the nearby [[Waltham Watch Company]]. His brother Eliphalet Whorf Dennison developed the company into a sizable industrial complex which merged in 1990 into [[Avery Dennison]], with headquarters in [[Pasadena, California]], and active corporate offices in the town.\n\nIn 2000, Framingham celebrated its [[Tercentennial]]. Framingham soon rose to become the largest town in Massachusetts, commonly referred to by the people of Framingham as \"The largest town in the country.\" Framingham had attempted to become a city on three prior occasions 1993, 1997, and 2013, all of which were rejected by the people of Framingham.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/framingham/new-englands-largest-town-wants-become-city-0|title=New England's Largest Town Wants to Become a City|date=March 28, 2016|website=Framingham, MA Patch|accessdate=November 27, 2019}}</ref> However, on January 1, 2018,  Framingham became a city and [[Yvonne M.

Of those 14, none had been reared together during the first six years of life. This result suggests that the Westermarck effect operates during the period from birth to the age of six.<ref>{{cite book |last =Shepher |first=Joseph |year=1983 |title=Incest: A Biosocial View |isbn=0-12-639460-1 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |series=Studies in anthropology |lccn=81006552}}</ref>\n\nWhen proximity during this [[critical period]] does not occur\u2014for example, where a brother and sister are brought up separately, never meeting one another\u2014they may find one another highly sexually attractive when they meet as adults or adolescents, according to the hypothesis of [[genetic sexual attraction]].

For example, a 2009 study by [[Eran Shor]] and Dalit Simchai demonstrated that although most peers who grew up closely together in the Israeli kibbutzim did not marry one another, they did report substantial attraction to co-reared peers. The authors conclude that the case of the kibbutzim actually provides little support for the Westermarck effect and that childhood proximity cannot in itself produce sexual avoidance without the existence of social pressures and norms.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shor |first=Eran |author2=Simchai, Dalit |title=Incest Avoidance, the Incest Taboo, and Social Cohesion: Revisiting Westermarck and the Case of the Israeli Kibbutzim|journal=American Journal of Sociology |year=2009 |volume=114|issue=6|pages=1803\u20131842|doi=10.1086/597178|pmid=19852254 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/425aeff62052d44369a0540e104a8f4b22544817 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, Austrian historian [[Walter Scheidel]] argues that recent research has raised some support for Westermarck's hypothesis, arguing that studies show that cousin-marriage in Lebanon has a lower success rate if the cousins were raised in sibling-like conditions, first-cousin unions being more successful in Pakistan if there was a substantial age difference, as well as reduced marital appeal for cousins who grew up sleeping in the same room in Morocco.

Pharaoh orders the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asks Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord.\n\n== Composition and theology ==\nScholars are in broad agreement that the publication of the Torah took place in the mid-Persian period (the 5th century BCE).{{sfn|Romer|2008|p=2 and fn.3}} The [[Book of Deuteronomy]], composed in stages between the 7th and 6th centuries, mentions the \"diseases of Egypt\" (Deuteronomy 7:15 and 28:60) but refers to something that afflicted the Israelites, not the Egyptians, and never specifies the plagues.{{sfn|Rogerson|2003b|p=154}}{{sfn|Van Seters|2015|p=124}} \n\nThe traditional number of ten plagues is not actually mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], and other sources differ; [[Psalm 78|Psalms 78]] and [[Psalm 105|105]] seem to list only seven or eight plagues and order them differently.{{sfn|Greifenhagen|2000|p=1062}} It appears that originally there were only seven (which included the tenth), to which were added the third, sixth, and ninth, bringing the count to ten.{{sfn|Johnstone|2003|p=83-84}} \n\nIn this final version, the first nine plagues form three triads, each of which God introduces by informing Moses of the main lesson it will teach.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}} In the first triad, the Egyptians begin to experience the power of God;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=118}} in the second, God demonstrates that he is directing events;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=119}} and in the third, the incomparability of Yahweh is displayed.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=121}} Overall, the plagues are \"signs and marvels\" given by the God of Israel to answer Pharaoh's taunt that he does not know Yahweh: \"The Egyptians shall know that I am the {{LORD}}.\"{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}}\n\n== Historicity ==\n{{main|Historicity of the Bible}}\nScholars broadly agree that the Exodus is not a historical account, and that the Israelites originated in [[Canaan]] and from the [[Canaanites]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}}{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=6\u20137}} The [[Ipuwer Papyrus]], written probably in the late [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] (c. 1991\u20131803 BCE),{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}} has been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that \"the river is blood\" and its frequent references to servants running away; however, these arguments ignore the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as Asiatics arriving in Egypt rather than leaving and the likelihood that the \"river is blood\" phrase is simply a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}} Attempts to find natural explanations for the plagues (e.g., a volcanic eruption to explain the \"darkness\" plague) have been dismissed by biblical scholars on the grounds that their pattern, timing, rapid succession, and above all, control by Moses mark them as [[supernatural]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117-118}}\n\n== Artistic representation ==\n===Visual art===\n[[File:Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt by Charles Sprague Pearce.JPG|thumb|right|''Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt'' by [[Charles Sprague Pearce]] (1877)]]\nIn visual art, the plagues have generally been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more common subjects, with [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Turner]] producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Music===\nTaking direct inspiration from the ten plagues, [[Iced Earth|Iced Earth's]] eleventh studio album ''[[Plagues of Babylon]]'' contains many references and allusions to the plagues. [[Metallica|Metallica's]] song \"[[Creeping Death]]\" (from their second album, ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'') makes references to a few of the plagues, in addition to the rest of the story of the Exodus.\nPerhaps the most successful artistic representation of the plagues is [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] oratorio ''[[Israel in Egypt]]'', which, like his perennial favorite, \"[[Handel's Messiah|Messiah]]\", takes a libretto entirely from scripture. The work was especially popular in the 19th century because of its numerous choruses, generally one for each plague, and its playful musical depiction of the plagues. For example, the plague of frogs is performed as a light aria for alto, depicting frogs jumping in the violins, and the plague of flies and lice is a light chorus with fast scurrying runs in the violins.{{sfn|Leon|2011|p=unpaginated}} \n\n===Films===\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[The Moon of Israel]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|title=The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) \u2013 Did You Know?|publisher=imdb.com|quote=Dr. Phibes murders were inspired by the 10 plagues of Egypt found in the Old Testament|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123013207/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|archive-date=January 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Moses (film)|Moses]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|title=The Prince of Egypt|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930002040/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|archive-date=September 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|title=FAQ for Magnolia (1999)|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321002323/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|archive-date=March 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999)<ref>{{Citation|last=Sommers|first=Stephen|title=The Mummy|date=1999-05-07|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|others=Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah|accessdate=2018-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705083230/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|archive-date=July 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Reaping]]'' (2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|title=The Reaping|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906061903/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|archive-date=September 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' (2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|title=Exodus: Gods and Kings|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=December 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212072407/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|archive-date=December 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Seder-Masochism]]'' (2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|title=Seder-Masochism|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=April 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908191309/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|archive-date=September 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===TV===\n* ''[[The Bible (miniseries)|The Bible]]'' (2013 miniseries) \u2013 Episode 2 has a scene of these plagues.\n* ''[[Os Dez Mandamentos]]'' (2015)<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomes|first=Marta|url=http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|title=Tudo pronto para a estreia de \"Os Dez Mandamentos\"|publisher=Not\u00edcias do dia (Grupo RIC)|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306194805/http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\"\n* \"[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]\"\n* ''[[Family Guy]]'' \u2013 In the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\", the Griffin family is affected by most of the plagues due to Peter being worshiped like God.\n* ''[[Haven (TV series)|Haven]]'' \u2013 In \"A Tale of Two Audreys,\" the town of Haven is afflicted by almost all of the plagues of Egypt.\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Aaron points his rod at the river and it begins to flow with Wellcome V0034268.jpg|The Second Plague: \"Frogs came up and covered the Sand of Egypt''\nFile:William de Brailes - The Third Plague of Egypt - Gnats (Exodus 8 -17) - Walters W1065R - Full Page.jpg|The Third Plague:\nFile:Tissot The Plague of Flies.jpg|The Fourth Plague: ''The Plague of Flies'', [[James Jacques Joseph Tissot]], Jewish Museum, New York\nFile:033.The Fifth Plague.

Pharaoh orders the Israelites to leave, taking whatever they want, and asks Moses to bless him in the name of the Lord.\n\n== Composition and theology ==\nScholars are in broad agreement that the publication of the Torah took place in the mid-Persian period (the 5th century BCE).{{sfn|Romer|2008|p=2 and fn.3}} The [[Book of Deuteronomy]], composed in stages between the 7th and 6th centuries, mentions the \"diseases of Egypt\" (Deuteronomy 7:15 and 28:60) but refers to something that afflicted the Israelites, not the Egyptians, and never specifies the plagues.{{sfn|Rogerson|2003b|p=154}}{{sfn|Van Seters|2015|p=124}} \n\nThe traditional number of ten plagues is not actually mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], and other sources differ; [[Psalm 78|Psalms 78]] and [[Psalm 105|105]] seem to list only seven or eight plagues and order them differently.{{sfn|Greifenhagen|2000|p=1062}} It appears that originally there were only seven (which included the tenth), to which were added the third, sixth, and ninth, bringing the count to ten.{{sfn|Johnstone|2003|p=83-84}} \n\nIn this final version, the first nine plagues form three triads, each of which God introduces by informing Moses of the main lesson it will teach.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}} In the first triad, the Egyptians begin to experience the power of God;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=118}} in the second, God demonstrates that he is directing events;{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=119}} and in the third, the incomparability of Yahweh is displayed.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=121}} Overall, the plagues are \"signs and marvels\" given by the God of Israel to answer Pharaoh's taunt that he does not know Yahweh: \"The Egyptians shall know that I am the {{LORD}}.\"{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117}}\n\n== Historicity ==\n{{main|Historicity of the Bible}}\nScholars broadly agree that the Exodus is not a historical account, and that the Israelites originated in [[Canaan]] and from the [[Canaanites]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}}{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=6\u20137}} The [[Ipuwer Papyrus]], written probably in the late [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt]] (c. 1991\u20131803 BCE),{{sfn|Willems|2010|p=83}} has been put forward in popular literature as confirmation of the Biblical account, most notably because of its statement that \"the river is blood\" and its frequent references to servants running away; however, these arguments ignore the many points on which Ipuwer contradicts Exodus, such as Asiatics arriving in Egypt rather than leaving and the likelihood that the \"river is blood\" phrase is simply a poetic image of turmoil.{{sfn|Enmarch|2011|p=173-175}} Attempts to find natural explanations for the plagues (e.g., a volcanic eruption to explain the \"darkness\" plague) have been dismissed by biblical scholars on the grounds that their pattern, timing, rapid succession, and above all, control by Moses mark them as [[supernatural]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=90}}{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=117-118}}\n\n== Artistic representation ==\n===Visual art===\n[[File:Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt by Charles Sprague Pearce.JPG|thumb|right|''Lamentations over the Death of the First-Born of Egypt'' by [[Charles Sprague Pearce]] (1877)]]\nIn visual art, the plagues have generally been reserved for works in series, especially engravings. Still, relatively few depictions in art emerged compared to other religious themes until the 19th century, when the plagues became more common subjects, with [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[J. M. W. Turner|Joseph Turner]] producing notable canvases. This trend probably reflected a Romantic attraction to landscape and nature painting, for which the plagues were suited, a Gothic attraction to morbid stories, and a rise in Orientalism, wherein exotic Egyptian themes found currency. Given the importance of noble patronage throughout Western art history, the plagues may have found consistent disfavor because the stories emphasize the limits of a monarch's power, and images of lice, locusts, darkness, and boils were ill-suited for decoration in palaces and churches.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Music===\nTaking direct inspiration from the ten plagues, [[Iced Earth|Iced Earth's]] eleventh studio album ''[[Plagues of Babylon]]'' contains many references and allusions to the plagues. [[Metallica|Metallica's]] song \"[[Creeping Death]]\" (from their second album, ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'') makes references to a few of the plagues, in addition to the rest of the story of the Exodus.\nPerhaps the most successful artistic representation of the plagues is [[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] oratorio ''[[Israel in Egypt]]'', which, like his perennial favorite, \"[[Handel's Messiah|Messiah]]\", takes a libretto entirely from scripture. The work was especially popular in the 19th century because of its numerous choruses, generally one for each plague, and its playful musical depiction of the plagues. For example, the plague of frogs is performed as a light aria for alto, depicting frogs jumping in the violins, and the plague of flies and lice is a light chorus with fast scurrying runs in the violins.{{sfn|Leon|2011|p=unpaginated}} \n\n===Films===\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n* ''[[The Moon of Israel]]'' (1924)\n* ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956)\n* ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|title=The Abominable Dr. Phibes (1971) \u2013 Did You Know?|publisher=imdb.com|quote=Dr. Phibes murders were inspired by the 10 plagues of Egypt found in the Old Testament|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123013207/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066740/trivia|archive-date=January 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Moses (film)|Moses]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|title=The Prince of Egypt|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930002040/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/|archive-date=September 30, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|title=FAQ for Magnolia (1999)|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321002323/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/faq|archive-date=March 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Mummy (1999 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1999)<ref>{{Citation|last=Sommers|first=Stephen|title=The Mummy|date=1999-05-07|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|others=Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah|accessdate=2018-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705083230/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/|archive-date=July 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Reaping]]'' (2007)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|title=The Reaping|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=September 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906061903/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0444682/|archive-date=September 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' (2014)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|title=Exodus: Gods and Kings|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=December 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212072407/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528100/|archive-date=December 12, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ''[[Seder-Masochism]]'' (2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|title=Seder-Masochism|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=April 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190908191309/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8328612/|archive-date=September 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===TV===\n* ''[[The Bible (miniseries)|The Bible]]'' (2013 miniseries) \u2013 Episode 2 has a scene of these plagues.\n* ''[[Os Dez Mandamentos]]'' (2015)<ref>{{cite web|last=Gomes|first=Marta|url=http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|title=Tudo pronto para a estreia de \"Os Dez Mandamentos\"|publisher=Not\u00edcias do dia (Grupo RIC)|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306194805/http://ndonline.com.br/florianopolis/plural/242270-tudo-pronto-para-a-estreia-de-os-dez-mandamentos.html|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* \"[[A Rugrats Passover]]\"\n* \"[[Simpsons Bible Stories]]\"\n* ''[[Family Guy]]'' \u2013 In the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin']]\", the Griffin family is affected by most of the plagues due to Peter being worshiped like God.\n* ''[[Haven (TV series)|Haven]]'' \u2013 In \"A Tale of Two Audreys,\" the town of Haven is afflicted by almost all of the plagues of Egypt.\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:Aaron points his rod at the river and it begins to flow with Wellcome V0034268.jpg|The Second Plague: \"Frogs came up and covered the Sand of Egypt''\nFile:William de Brailes - The Third Plague of Egypt - Gnats (Exodus 8 -17) - Walters W1065R - Full Page.jpg|The Third Plague:\nFile:Tissot The Plague of Flies.jpg|The Fourth Plague: ''The Plague of Flies'', [[James Jacques Joseph Tissot]], Jewish Museum, New York\nFile:033.The Fifth Plague.

Their identical appearance initially creates rivalry, and they pull pranks on each other, culminating in the camp dance being ruined. As punishment, Miss Inch decides that they must live together in the isolated \"Serendipity\" cabin (and eat together at an \"Isolation Table\") for the remainder of the camp season. After discovering that they both come from single-parent homes, they soon realize they are twin sisters and that their parents, Mitchell \"Mitch\" Evers ([[Brian Keith]]) and Margaret \"Maggie\" McKendrick ([[Maureen O'Hara]]), divorced shortly after their birth, with each parent having custody of one of them. The twins, each eager to meet the parent she never knew, decide to switch places. Susan gives Sharon a matching haircut and teaches her how to bite her nails, and they also take a crash-course getting to know each other's personalities and character traits so as to fool the parents.\n\nWhile Susan is in Boston at their grandparents' house pretending to be Sharon, Sharon goes to California to their father's house, pretending to be Susan. Sharon learns their father is engaged to a child-hating gold digger named Vicky Robinson ([[Joanna Barnes]]). Sharon calls Susan to tell her that their father is planning to marry Vicky, who is beautiful and dangerous, and that she must bring their mother to California immediately. Susan eventually reveals to their mother and grandparents the truth about their switching places. They are extremely happy to see Susan again, and Maggie and Susan fly to California. After Mitch and Maggie are reunited, they argue and the twins make their surprise appearance together. Mitch is extremely happy to see Sharon again, and after he tells Vicky the truth about the twins, she is shocked and furious \u2014 especially after learning that Maggie plans to spend the night at his house.\n\nThe girls recreate their parents' first date at the Italian restaurant Martinelli's with a gypsy violinist. The former spouses are gradually drawn together, but have another fight about why they divorced in the first place, with Maggie telling Mitch that she and Sharon are leaving in the morning, and that she wishes him the best of everything with Vicky. Susan and Sharon try to find a way to delay their return to Boston, so the twins dress and talk alike so their parents are unable to tell them apart. They will reveal who is who only after returning from the annual family camping trip. Mitch and Maggie reluctantly agree. Vicky is furious, so Maggie tricks her into taking her place and letting her know it would give her a chance to get to know the twins better.\n\nMitch is an outdoorsman, but Vicky is not, and she is not used to climbing mountains and being in the woods, so the twins decide to play tricks on her. Vicky spends her time swatting mosquitoes after unknowingly using sugared water instead of mosquito repellent.  She is also awakened by two bear cubs licking honey, placed by the twins, off her feet. Exasperated, Vicky finally has a shouting tantrum, destroying everything in her path.  The tantrum culminates in Vicky angrily slapping Susan, leaving Mitch with a whole new-found view of her. When Vicky escapes back to the city in a great huff, Mitch seems none too worried to be rid of her.\n\nBack at the house, the twins apologize for what they did to Vicky, and are forgiven. Maggie makes dinner, and Mitch talks about what their life was like when they were married. They realize they still love each other, and do not want to grow into a couple of old and lonely people. They share a kiss, and decide to remarry.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hayley Mills]] as Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers\n*[[Brian Keith]] as Mitchell \"Mitch\" Evers\n*[[Maureen O'Hara]] as Margaret \"Maggie\" McKendrick\n*[[Joanna Barnes]] as Vicky Robinson\n*[[Charles Ruggles|Charlie Ruggles]] as Charles McKendrick\n*[[Cathleen Nesbitt]] as Louise McKendrick\n*[[Una Merkel]] as Verbena the housekeeper\n*[[Leo G.

The film used Disney's proprietary [[sodium vapor process]] for compositing rather than the usual [[chroma key]] technique. When Walt Disney saw how seamless the processed shots were, he ordered the script reconfigured to include more of the special effect. Disney also wanted Mills to appear on camera as much as possible, knowing that she was having growth spurts during filming.\n\nThe film was shot mostly at various locales in California. The summer camp scenes were filmed at Bluff Lake Camp (then owned by the Pasadena [[YMCA]], now by [[Habonim Dror]]'s Camp Gilboa) and the family camping scenes later in the movie at [[Cedar Lake Camp]], both in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] near the city of [[Big Bear Lake, California|Big Bear Lake]] in [[Southern California]]. The Monterey scenes were filmed in various California locations, including millionaire [[Stuyvesant Fish]]'s {{convert|5200|acre|km2}} ranch in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] and Monterey's [[Pebble Beach]] golf course. The scenes at the Monterey house were shot at the studio's [[Golden Oak Ranch]] in [[Placerita Canyon State Park|Placerita Canyon]], where Mitch's ranch was built.<ref name=\"GoldenOakRanchHistory\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldenoakranch.com/about/history/ |title=History: A Movie Ranch Like No Other |accessdate=2013-04-14|work=goldenoakranch.com}}</ref> It was the design of this set that proved the most popular, and to this day the Walt Disney Archives receives requests for plans of the home's interior design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disneymoviesandfacts.tumblr.com/page/679|title=Disney Movies & Facts|website=disneymoviesandfacts.tumblr.com}}{{self-published source|date=August 2018}}</ref> In fact, there never was such a house; the set was simply various rooms built on a sound stage. Camp Inch was based on a real girls' camp called Camp Crestridge for Girls at the Ridgecrest Baptist Conference Center near [[Asheville, North Carolina]].\n\n==Musical numbers==\n[[Richard and Robert Sherman]] provided the songs, which, besides the title song \"[[The Parent Trap (song)|The Parent Trap]]\", includes \"[[For Now, For Always]]\", and \"[[Let's Get Together (Hayley Mills song)|Let's Get Together]]\".  \"Let's Get Together\" (sung by Annette Funicello) is heard playing from a record player at the summer camp; the tune is reprised by the twins when they restage their parents' first date and that version is sung double-tracked by Hayley Mills. (Hayley's own single of the song, credited to \"Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills,\" reached #8 on the US charts.) The film's title song was performed by [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] and [[Annette Funicello]], who were both on the studio lot shooting ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' at the time.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"it should be most appealing to adults, as well as to children, because of the cheerfully persuasive dual performance of Hayley Mills.\"<ref>Crowther, Bosley (June 22, 1961). \"Hayley Mills Plays 2 Roles in Comedy\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 23.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that the film was \"absolutely predictable from the outset,\" but was still \"a winner\" thanks to the performance of Mills, who \"seems to have an instinctive sense of comedy and an uncanny ability to react in just the right manner. Her contribution to the picture is virtually infinite.\"<ref>\"Film Reviews: The Parent Trap\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.

Their identical appearance initially creates rivalry, and they pull pranks on each other, culminating in the camp dance being ruined. As punishment, Miss Inch decides that they must live together in the isolated \"Serendipity\" cabin (and eat together at an \"Isolation Table\") for the remainder of the camp season. After discovering that they both come from single-parent homes, they soon realize they are twin sisters and that their parents, Mitchell \"Mitch\" Evers ([[Brian Keith]]) and Margaret \"Maggie\" McKendrick ([[Maureen O'Hara]]), divorced shortly after their birth, with each parent having custody of one of them. The twins, each eager to meet the parent she never knew, decide to switch places. Susan gives Sharon a matching haircut and teaches her how to bite her nails, and they also take a crash-course getting to know each other's personalities and character traits so as to fool the parents.\n\nWhile Susan is in Boston at their grandparents' house pretending to be Sharon, Sharon goes to California to their father's house, pretending to be Susan. Sharon learns their father is engaged to a child-hating gold digger named Vicky Robinson ([[Joanna Barnes]]). Sharon calls Susan to tell her that their father is planning to marry Vicky, who is beautiful and dangerous, and that she must bring their mother to California immediately. Susan eventually reveals to their mother and grandparents the truth about their switching places. They are extremely happy to see Susan again, and Maggie and Susan fly to California. After Mitch and Maggie are reunited, they argue and the twins make their surprise appearance together. Mitch is extremely happy to see Sharon again, and after he tells Vicky the truth about the twins, she is shocked and furious \u2014 especially after learning that Maggie plans to spend the night at his house.\n\nThe girls recreate their parents' first date at the Italian restaurant Martinelli's with a gypsy violinist. The former spouses are gradually drawn together, but have another fight about why they divorced in the first place, with Maggie telling Mitch that she and Sharon are leaving in the morning, and that she wishes him the best of everything with Vicky. Susan and Sharon try to find a way to delay their return to Boston, so the twins dress and talk alike so their parents are unable to tell them apart. They will reveal who is who only after returning from the annual family camping trip. Mitch and Maggie reluctantly agree. Vicky is furious, so Maggie tricks her into taking her place and letting her know it would give her a chance to get to know the twins better.\n\nMitch is an outdoorsman, but Vicky is not, and she is not used to climbing mountains and being in the woods, so the twins decide to play tricks on her. Vicky spends her time swatting mosquitoes after unknowingly using sugared water instead of mosquito repellent.  She is also awakened by two bear cubs licking honey, placed by the twins, off her feet. Exasperated, Vicky finally has a shouting tantrum, destroying everything in her path.  The tantrum culminates in Vicky angrily slapping Susan, leaving Mitch with a whole new-found view of her. When Vicky escapes back to the city in a great huff, Mitch seems none too worried to be rid of her.\n\nBack at the house, the twins apologize for what they did to Vicky, and are forgiven. Maggie makes dinner, and Mitch talks about what their life was like when they were married. They realize they still love each other, and do not want to grow into a couple of old and lonely people. They share a kiss, and decide to remarry.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hayley Mills]] as Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers\n*[[Brian Keith]] as Mitchell \"Mitch\" Evers\n*[[Maureen O'Hara]] as Margaret \"Maggie\" McKendrick\n*[[Joanna Barnes]] as Vicky Robinson\n*[[Charles Ruggles|Charlie Ruggles]] as Charles McKendrick\n*[[Cathleen Nesbitt]] as Louise McKendrick\n*[[Una Merkel]] as Verbena the housekeeper\n*[[Leo G.

The film used Disney's proprietary [[sodium vapor process]] for compositing rather than the usual [[chroma key]] technique. When Walt Disney saw how seamless the processed shots were, he ordered the script reconfigured to include more of the special effect. Disney also wanted Mills to appear on camera as much as possible, knowing that she was having growth spurts during filming.\n\nThe film was shot mostly at various locales in California. The summer camp scenes were filmed at Bluff Lake Camp (then owned by the Pasadena [[YMCA]], now by [[Habonim Dror]]'s Camp Gilboa) and the family camping scenes later in the movie at [[Cedar Lake Camp]], both in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] near the city of [[Big Bear Lake, California|Big Bear Lake]] in [[Southern California]]. The Monterey scenes were filmed in various California locations, including millionaire [[Stuyvesant Fish]]'s {{convert|5200|acre|km2}} ranch in [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] and Monterey's [[Pebble Beach]] golf course. The scenes at the Monterey house were shot at the studio's [[Golden Oak Ranch]] in [[Placerita Canyon State Park|Placerita Canyon]], where Mitch's ranch was built.<ref name=\"GoldenOakRanchHistory\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldenoakranch.com/about/history/ |title=History: A Movie Ranch Like No Other |accessdate=2013-04-14|work=goldenoakranch.com}}</ref> It was the design of this set that proved the most popular, and to this day the Walt Disney Archives receives requests for plans of the home's interior design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disneymoviesandfacts.tumblr.com/page/679|title=Disney Movies & Facts|website=disneymoviesandfacts.tumblr.com}}{{self-published source|date=August 2018}}</ref> In fact, there never was such a house; the set was simply various rooms built on a sound stage. Camp Inch was based on a real girls' camp called Camp Crestridge for Girls at the Ridgecrest Baptist Conference Center near [[Asheville, North Carolina]].\n\n==Musical numbers==\n[[Richard and Robert Sherman]] provided the songs, which, besides the title song \"[[The Parent Trap (song)|The Parent Trap]]\", includes \"[[For Now, For Always]]\", and \"[[Let's Get Together (Hayley Mills song)|Let's Get Together]]\".  \"Let's Get Together\" (sung by Annette Funicello) is heard playing from a record player at the summer camp; the tune is reprised by the twins when they restage their parents' first date and that version is sung double-tracked by Hayley Mills. (Hayley's own single of the song, credited to \"Hayley Mills and Hayley Mills,\" reached #8 on the US charts.) The film's title song was performed by [[Tommy Sands (entertainer)|Tommy Sands]] and [[Annette Funicello]], who were both on the studio lot shooting ''[[Babes in Toyland (1961 film)|Babes in Toyland]]'' at the time.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"it should be most appealing to adults, as well as to children, because of the cheerfully persuasive dual performance of Hayley Mills.\"<ref>Crowther, Bosley (June 22, 1961). \"Hayley Mills Plays 2 Roles in Comedy\".
