If left untreated, the fungi continue to grow and spread.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"deHoog2017\">{{Cite journal |vauthors=de Hoog GS, Dukik K, Monod M, et al. |year=2017 |title=Toward a novel multilocus phylogenetic taxonomy for the dermatophytes |journal=[[Mycopathologia]] |volume=182 |issue=1-2 |pages=5\u201331 |doi=10.1007/s11046-016-0073-9 |pmid=27783317|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n}}\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121102161756/http://www.doctorfungus.org/thefungi/Trichophyton.php Doctor Fungus]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070524031748/http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Fungal_Descriptions/Dermatophytes/Trichophyton/ Mycology Unit at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital ]\n\n{{Fungi classification}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q310925}}\n\n[[Category:Parasitic fungi]]\n[[Category:Onygenales]]\n[[Category:Cat diseases]]\n", "name_user": "Premeditated Chaos", "label": "safe", "comment": "catfix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichophyton"}

Gentles discovered anamorph ''Arthroderma uncurvatum'', the teleomorph of ''Trichophyton ajelloi''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Shortly after this, D.M. Griffin rediscovered ''M. gypseum'' by Nanizzi, and another individual P.M. Stockdale also isolated the second teleomorph of the species naming it ''Nannizzia incurvatum''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Stockdale then confirmed that ''Nannizzia incurvatum'' differed from the original isolate of ''M. gypseum'' isolated by Nannizzi and proposed that two teleomorphic states of ''M. gypseum'' exist for the anamorph, thereby naming the latter ''N. gypsea''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Various authors, such as Stockdale, M.F. Visset, and J.W. Rippon have agreed that the differences in structure of the [[anamorph]]ic state of the complex of ''M. gypseum'' are inadequate for making distinctions between anamorphic states because of how similar they look.<ref name=demange /> It is now believed that very similar anamorphs, ''M. gypseum'' and ''M. fulvum'', consist of three teleomorphs: ''N. gypsea'', ''N. incurvatum'', and ''N. fulva''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Shortly after, ''[[Arthroderma]]'' replaced ''[[Nannizzia]]'',<ref name=versalovic/> where ''[[Arthroderma]]'' is depicting the teleomorphic states, and ''Microsporum'' refers to the anamorphic states.<ref name=kane1997 />\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Microsporum gypseum colony.JPG|thumb|alt=Powdery fungal colony.|Colony of ''Microsporum gypseum'' on Sabouraud agar]]\nThe colonies of ''M. gypseum'' are described as cottony or powdery, they grow rapidly with a colour range of white to buff, with a reserve that can range from pink, to red, to yellow (cinnamon); they may occasionally have overtones of violet.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=barron1983 /><ref name=versalovic/> The powdery appearance of the colony is due to the abundant production of [[macroconidia]] on the older mycelium, while the edges of the colony are described as scalloped to ragged and can exhibit [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|pleomorphism]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=kane1997 /> [[Macroconidia]] of ''M. gypseum'' have a substantial range that can occur as short pedicels, terminal, solitary, spindle shaped, large, thick walled, that are smooth or roughened,<ref name=barron1983 /> borne directly on [[hyphae]] or on short branches.<ref name=barron1983 /> They are often very large (e.g., 40\u2013150 x 8\u201315&nbsp;\u03bcm), [[ellipsoid]] to [[wikt:Special:Search/fusiform|fusiform]], moderately thick, have [[verrucose]] and are 4\u20136 [[septate]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The [[macroconidia]] also possess a rat-like tail at the edges of the [[conidia]].<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The [[ascoma]] of the fungus is a globose, appendaged gymnothecium that is pale buff in colour and 500\u20131250 \u03bcm in diameter.<ref name=howard2003 /> The peridial [[hyphae]] are hyaline, pale buff, septate, and are branched with thinly but have densely verrucose walls.<ref name=howard2003 /> [[Microconidia]] are drop shaped, clavate, (1.7\u20133.5 x 3.3\u20138.3&nbsp;\u03bcm), unicellular, smooth-walled or can be slightly roughened and are created laterally on the [[hyphae]].<ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=versalovic/> The abundance of [[microconidia]] is characteristic of the fungus.<ref name=kane1997 /> The [[hyphae]] or appendages are of three kinds in the fungi, the first being straight, slender, smooth walled [[hyphae]] that can grow up to 250&nbsp;\u03bcm long; they taper at 2.5\u20134.0&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter at the base but close to about 1.5-2&nbsp;\u03bcm. The second are slender, smooth-walled, septate, spiral [[hyphae]] that are rarely branched, which have a base diameter of 2.5\u20133.5&nbsp;\u03bcm that taper up to 1.5-2&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. They are usually variable in their coiled state, ranging from tightly to loosely coiled with numerous but variable numbers of turns. The third are thick-walled, verruculose, ellipsoid or fusiform [[macroconidia]], that are 35\u201355 x 10\u201313.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, with up to five septa.<ref name=howard2003 /> The [[ascus|asci]] of the fungus are subglobose, thin-walled, evanescent, which are 5-7&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter and contain a total of eight [[ascospore]]s.<ref name=howard2003 /> The ascospores are smooth-walled, lenticular, 1.5\u20132 x 2.5\u20134&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter, and when in mass are yellow.<ref name=howard2003 /> Additionally, the spiral hyphal appendages that ornament the ascomata are often produced spontaneously in culture in the absence of gymnothecia.<ref name=howard2003 /> The fungus does not have any specific nutritional requirements for growth.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The teleomorphic features of the microsporum on colonial and microscopic features are often done on Takashio's Medium.<ref name=versalovic/> However, distinguishing is best done by mating (+/\u2013) or by genetics.<ref name=versalovic/> The species is [[heterothallic]], and a such mating is controlled by a 1-locus, 2-allele compatibility system.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Comparatively ''A. gypseum'' produces more spreading and a coarser granular colony; the [[macroconidia]] also are wider and the surface colour is brighter and redder than ''A. incurvatum''. Colonies of ''A. incurvatum'' are pale buff in colour and finely granular, occasionally with a reddish to yellow reverse.<ref name=rippon1988 />\n\n==Ecology==\n\nThe species is [[geophilic]], is abundant in soil and can be isolated around the world; it is in world wide distribution.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> However, it is rare in places such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany but common in South America.<ref name=kane1997 /> It is defined to be either cosmopolitan or confined to a certain graphical regions.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The fungus can be found in soil of [[greenhouse]]s and [[munition]] factories within these areas.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> The species itself commonly infects humans whom are closely tied to these areas because of agricultural work.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=soil /> In these areas, soil moisture is indicative role in the presence of the ''M. gypseum'' complex, areas with higher moisture tend to be preferred.<ref name=ranganathan /> Correlations between infections and soil types indicate that most improved soils of the clayey or clayey-sandy type are preferred, particularly those fertilized with [[keratin]]ous manure.<ref name=soil /> Additionally the fungus prefers soils with a pH of 7-7.5. Various soils in correlation with number of infections indicates that the fungus specifically prefers [[chernozemic soil]] (74%), of which positive isolates occur.<ref name=soil />\n\nThe role of infection by the virus is influenced by the climate and geographical characteristics which favor the life of the [[dermatophyte]] as dictated by the average rainfall rate and average air temperatures.<ref name=soil /> There tends to be a greater number of infections in later seasons as emphasis is placed on age, sex, months of onset of infection, and marked localization of the fungus.<ref name=soil /> Adults, particularly males are typically infected, and of those infected usually involved in agricultural practices,<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /><ref name=soil /> such as greenhouses and plant nursery workers.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> School-age males are more prone than females because of contact in the soil.<ref name=soil /> Onset of infection usually occurs from August to November, when humans come into contact with soil more often.<ref name=disalvo1983 /><ref name=soil />\n\n==Epidemiology==\n\n[[File:Microsporum gypseum2418.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Circular red skin lesion surrounded by skin scale.|Ringworm lesion on forearm caused by ''Microsporum gypseum'', incurred from fomite exposure through handling of firewood]]\nThe species is [[keratin]]ophilic and is known for causing diseases on human skin.<ref name=barron1983 /> The genus ''Microsporum'' contains a number of pathogens to both humans and animals.<ref name=barron1983 /> The diseases it causes is classified as [[tinea]] or [[ringworm]], with an adjective prescribing to the afflicted body part.<ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> Infection usually occurs as [[tinea capitis]] with suppuration and [[kerion]] formation.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Pus formation can also occur from palpitated [[hair follicle]]s.<ref name=rippon1988 /> The species is [[ectothrix]] in terms of hair infection and can infect more than one part of the scalp at a time.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kane1997 /> The fungus produces hyphal growth at the scalp, and produces [[fronds]] (perforating organs) that invade the hair perpendicularly at the cortex near the edge of the cuticles.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> This can cause hair to be easily removed and dislodged from the scalp.<ref name=rippon1988 /> Additionally, individuals with thick dark hair have a tendency to have a more severe inflammatory response.<ref name=rippon1988 /> [[Tinea corporis]], as well; this is characterized as an intense inflammatory response resembling a bacterial infection, thus surgical intervention is not needed because inflammation is due to the fungus alone.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=rippon1988 /> Also, tinea pedis, or athletes foot is common, while tinea unguium is rare.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Additionally tinea manuum, of the thighs may occur as nodular [[granuloma]]tous [[perifolliculitis]], has been noted with infection of the thighs.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> [[Favus]], (a severe form of [[tinea capitis]]) is rarely seen to be caused by this fungus.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> However the most common cause in humans seems to be tinea capitis and [[tinea corporis]].<ref name=howard2003 /> As such clinical manifestations are localized to localization of contact.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Transmission from animals to humans is supported; especially in those constrained to agricultural work.<ref name=soil /><ref name=Romano /> Handlers of laboratory animals, including guinea pigs, cats, and rabbits can also be at risk of contracting the fungi if the animals were predisposed to a certain area.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> The fungus infects animals that associate themselves with soil on a repeated basis.<ref name=howard2003 /> So as such animals like cattle are commonly affected but horses, rodents, monkeys and dogs have a tendency to acquire it.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Entry of the fungus or contraction of one or more of these diseases is caused by deposition on human skin, and contact with soil is usually the primary cause of infection.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Quantitatively, animal or humans must acquire at least ten fungal spores on a [[keratin]] rich surface in order to acquire an infection.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Additionally of the mating types, the positive strain is more pathogenic then the negative strain.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Identification is usually classified on the appearance of the fungus on the host via a sample culture.<ref name=howard2003 /> Both ''M. gypseum'' and ''[[M. fulvum]]'' have been commonly isolated from patients with human infections of the disease.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Human to human transmission is known to occur.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=versalovic/>\n\n''Microsporum gypseum'' is categorized as a rare agent of infection, and usually only occurs in rural areas.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=Romano /> The infections associated with hair can also be prone to fluorescence under a [[Black light#Clinical use|Wood's Lamp]].<ref name=rippon1988 /> Sometimes these clinical manifestations are not ringworm but appear as impetigo, scleroderma or psoriasis.<ref name=Romano2 /> The lesions are usually inflammatory, [[impetiginous]], and sometimes bullous with rapid development and resolution; this is accompanied by scarring and permanent patches [[alopecia]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The greatest intensity of inflammation is at the advancing margin of the ring.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Direct examination with KOH of skin, reveal [[mycelium]] and masses of [[arthroconidia]] in some chains; KOH examination of hair produces distinctive large [[macroconidia]] in chain or irregular masses of hair. Mycelium was also discovered to run parallel to its length.<ref name=kane1997 /> Wood's lamp tests on humans indicate the fungus by fluorescence.<ref name=kane1997 /> The fungus is encountered rarely as a confirmed agent of [[onychomycosis]] in which the infection is validated by both a direct observation of filaments in the nail and recovery of the fungus in culture.<ref name=Romano /><ref name=Romano2 />\n\n==Pathogenicity==\n\n[[File:TEV protease summary.png|thumb|250px|Example of a protease ([[TEV protease]]) complex]]\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the fungi are due to either the presence of substances on the surface of the fungi, or substances released by the fungi.<ref name=singforme/> These can include: surface [[Fungal adhesin|adhesin]]s, [[mannan]]s, enzymes such as [[proteinases]], [[peptidase]]s, [[DNase]]s, and [[lipase]]s.<ref name=singforme/> The extracellular proteases released assist the fungus in invading the host skin barrier (keratin rich) with the presence of [[keratinase]] (keratinolytic activity increases).<ref name=singforme/> They then use the proteases to enhance their survival by chemically or physically altering the environment to their benefit by digesting the host proteins, thus providing themselves with nutrition. These [[protease]]s are found in all stages of growth (lag to declining) but peak at the mid log phase. These proteases are determined to be secreted during the lag phase of growth as they are secreted without the presence of host related proteins.

Gentles discovered anamorph ''Arthroderma uncurvatum'', the teleomorph of ''Trichophyton ajelloi''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Shortly after this, D.M. Griffin rediscovered ''M. gypseum'' by Nanizzi, and another individual P.M. Stockdale also isolated the second teleomorph of the species naming it ''Nannizzia incurvatum''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Stockdale then confirmed that ''Nannizzia incurvatum'' differed from the original isolate of ''M. gypseum'' isolated by Nannizzi and proposed that two teleomorphic states of ''M. gypseum'' exist for the anamorph, thereby naming the latter ''N. gypsea''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Various authors, such as Stockdale, M.F. Visset, and J.W. Rippon have agreed that the differences in structure of the [[anamorph]]ic state of the complex of ''M. gypseum'' are inadequate for making distinctions between anamorphic states because of how similar they look.<ref name=demange /> It is now believed that very similar anamorphs, ''M. gypseum'' and ''M. fulvum'', consist of three teleomorphs: ''N. gypsea'', ''N. incurvatum'', and ''N. fulva''.<ref name=kane1997 /> Shortly after, ''[[Arthroderma]]'' replaced ''[[Nannizzia]]'',<ref name=versalovic/> where ''[[Arthroderma]]'' is depicting the teleomorphic states, and ''Microsporum'' refers to the anamorphic states.<ref name=kane1997 />\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Microsporum gypseum colony.JPG|thumb|alt=Powdery fungal colony.|Colony of ''Microsporum gypseum'' on Sabouraud agar]]\nThe colonies of ''M. gypseum'' are described as cottony or powdery, they grow rapidly with a colour range of white to buff, with a reserve that can range from pink, to red, to yellow (cinnamon); they may occasionally have overtones of violet.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=barron1983 /><ref name=versalovic/> The powdery appearance of the colony is due to the abundant production of [[macroconidia]] on the older mycelium, while the edges of the colony are described as scalloped to ragged and can exhibit [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|pleomorphism]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=kane1997 /> [[Macroconidia]] of ''M. gypseum'' have a substantial range that can occur as short pedicels, terminal, solitary, spindle shaped, large, thick walled, that are smooth or roughened,<ref name=barron1983 /> borne directly on [[hyphae]] or on short branches.<ref name=barron1983 /> They are often very large (e.g., 40\u2013150 x 8\u201315&nbsp;\u03bcm), [[ellipsoid]] to [[wikt:Special:Search/fusiform|fusiform]], moderately thick, have [[verrucose]] and are 4\u20136 [[septate]].<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The [[macroconidia]] also possess a rat-like tail at the edges of the [[conidia]].<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The [[ascoma]] of the fungus is a globose, appendaged gymnothecium that is pale buff in colour and 500\u20131250 \u03bcm in diameter.<ref name=howard2003 /> The peridial [[hyphae]] are hyaline, pale buff, septate, and are branched with thinly but have densely verrucose walls.<ref name=howard2003 /> [[Microconidia]] are drop shaped, clavate, (1.7\u20133.5 x 3.3\u20138.3&nbsp;\u03bcm), unicellular, smooth-walled or can be slightly roughened and are created laterally on the [[hyphae]].<ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=versalovic/> The abundance of [[microconidia]] is characteristic of the fungus.<ref name=kane1997 /> The [[hyphae]] or appendages are of three kinds in the fungi, the first being straight, slender, smooth walled [[hyphae]] that can grow up to 250&nbsp;\u03bcm long; they taper at 2.5\u20134.0&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter at the base but close to about 1.5-2&nbsp;\u03bcm. The second are slender, smooth-walled, septate, spiral [[hyphae]] that are rarely branched, which have a base diameter of 2.5\u20133.5&nbsp;\u03bcm that taper up to 1.5-2&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter. They are usually variable in their coiled state, ranging from tightly to loosely coiled with numerous but variable numbers of turns. The third are thick-walled, verruculose, ellipsoid or fusiform [[macroconidia]], that are 35\u201355 x 10\u201313.5&nbsp;\u03bcm, with up to five septa.<ref name=howard2003 /> The [[ascus|asci]] of the fungus are subglobose, thin-walled, evanescent, which are 5-7&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter and contain a total of eight [[ascospore]]s.<ref name=howard2003 /> The ascospores are smooth-walled, lenticular, 1.5\u20132 x 2.5\u20134&nbsp;\u03bcm in diameter, and when in mass are yellow.<ref name=howard2003 /> Additionally, the spiral hyphal appendages that ornament the ascomata are often produced spontaneously in culture in the absence of gymnothecia.<ref name=howard2003 /> The fungus does not have any specific nutritional requirements for growth.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The teleomorphic features of the microsporum on colonial and microscopic features are often done on Takashio's Medium.<ref name=versalovic/> However, distinguishing is best done by mating (+/\u2013) or by genetics.<ref name=versalovic/> The species is [[heterothallic]], and a such mating is controlled by a 1-locus, 2-allele compatibility system.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Comparatively ''A. gypseum'' produces more spreading and a coarser granular colony; the [[macroconidia]] also are wider and the surface colour is brighter and redder than ''A. incurvatum''. Colonies of ''A. incurvatum'' are pale buff in colour and finely granular, occasionally with a reddish to yellow reverse.<ref name=rippon1988 />\n\n==Ecology==\n\nThe species is [[geophilic]], is abundant in soil and can be isolated around the world; it is in world wide distribution.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> However, it is rare in places such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany but common in South America.<ref name=kane1997 /> It is defined to be either cosmopolitan or confined to a certain graphical regions.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> The fungus can be found in soil of [[greenhouse]]s and [[munition]] factories within these areas.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> The species itself commonly infects humans whom are closely tied to these areas because of agricultural work.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=soil /> In these areas, soil moisture is indicative role in the presence of the ''M. gypseum'' complex, areas with higher moisture tend to be preferred.<ref name=ranganathan /> Correlations between infections and soil types indicate that most improved soils of the clayey or clayey-sandy type are preferred, particularly those fertilized with [[keratin]]ous manure.<ref name=soil /> Additionally the fungus prefers soils with a pH of 7-7.5. Various soils in correlation with number of infections indicates that the fungus specifically prefers [[chernozemic soil]] (74%), of which positive isolates occur.<ref name=soil />\n\nThe role of infection by the virus is influenced by the climate and geographical characteristics which favor the life of the [[dermatophyte]] as dictated by the average rainfall rate and average air temperatures.<ref name=soil /> There tends to be a greater number of infections in later seasons as emphasis is placed on age, sex, months of onset of infection, and marked localization of the fungus.<ref name=soil /> Adults, particularly males are typically infected, and of those infected usually involved in agricultural practices,<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /><ref name=soil /> such as greenhouses and plant nursery workers.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> School-age males are more prone than females because of contact in the soil.<ref name=soil /> Onset of infection usually occurs from August to November, when humans come into contact with soil more often.<ref name=disalvo1983 /><ref name=soil />\n\n==Epidemiology==\n\n[[File:Microsporum gypseum2418.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Circular red skin lesion surrounded by skin scale.|Ringworm lesion on forearm caused by ''Microsporum gypseum'', incurred from fomite exposure through handling of firewood]]\nThe species is [[keratin]]ophilic and is known for causing diseases on human skin.<ref name=barron1983 /> The genus ''Microsporum'' contains a number of pathogens to both humans and animals.<ref name=barron1983 /> The diseases it causes is classified as [[tinea]] or [[ringworm]], with an adjective prescribing to the afflicted body part.<ref name=howard2003 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> Infection usually occurs as [[tinea capitis]] with suppuration and [[kerion]] formation.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Pus formation can also occur from palpitated [[hair follicle]]s.<ref name=rippon1988 /> The species is [[ectothrix]] in terms of hair infection and can infect more than one part of the scalp at a time.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kane1997 /> The fungus produces hyphal growth at the scalp, and produces [[fronds]] (perforating organs) that invade the hair perpendicularly at the cortex near the edge of the cuticles.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> This can cause hair to be easily removed and dislodged from the scalp.<ref name=rippon1988 /> Additionally, individuals with thick dark hair have a tendency to have a more severe inflammatory response.<ref name=rippon1988 /> [[Tinea corporis]], as well; this is characterized as an intense inflammatory response resembling a bacterial infection, thus surgical intervention is not needed because inflammation is due to the fungus alone.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=rippon1988 /> Also, tinea pedis, or athletes foot is common, while tinea unguium is rare.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Additionally tinea manuum, of the thighs may occur as nodular [[granuloma]]tous [[perifolliculitis]], has been noted with infection of the thighs.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> [[Favus]], (a severe form of [[tinea capitis]]) is rarely seen to be caused by this fungus.<ref name=kane1997 /><ref name=disalvo1983 /> However the most common cause in humans seems to be tinea capitis and [[tinea corporis]].<ref name=howard2003 /> As such clinical manifestations are localized to localization of contact.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Transmission from animals to humans is supported; especially in those constrained to agricultural work.<ref name=soil /><ref name=Romano /> Handlers of laboratory animals, including guinea pigs, cats, and rabbits can also be at risk of contracting the fungi if the animals were predisposed to a certain area.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> The fungus infects animals that associate themselves with soil on a repeated basis.<ref name=howard2003 /> So as such animals like cattle are commonly affected but horses, rodents, monkeys and dogs have a tendency to acquire it.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Entry of the fungus or contraction of one or more of these diseases is caused by deposition on human skin, and contact with soil is usually the primary cause of infection.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Quantitatively, animal or humans must acquire at least ten fungal spores on a [[keratin]] rich surface in order to acquire an infection.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Additionally of the mating types, the positive strain is more pathogenic then the negative strain.<ref name=disalvo1983 /> Identification is usually classified on the appearance of the fungus on the host via a sample culture.<ref name=howard2003 /> Both ''M. gypseum'' and ''[[M. fulvum]]'' have been commonly isolated from patients with human infections of the disease.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /> Human to human transmission is known to occur.<ref name=kwon-chung1992 /><ref name=versalovic/>\n\n''Microsporum gypseum'' is categorized as a rare agent of infection, and usually only occurs in rural areas.<ref name=rippon1988 /><ref name=Romano /> The infections associated with hair can also be prone to fluorescence under a [[Black light#Clinical use|Wood's Lamp]].<ref name=rippon1988 /> Sometimes these clinical manifestations are not ringworm but appear as impetigo, scleroderma or psoriasis.<ref name=Romano2 /> The lesions are usually inflammatory, [[impetiginous]], and sometimes bullous with rapid development and resolution;

KOH examination of hair produces distinctive large [[macroconidia]] in chain or irregular masses of hair. Mycelium was also discovered to run parallel to its length.<ref name=kane1997 /> Wood's lamp tests on humans indicate the fungus by fluorescence.<ref name=kane1997 /> The fungus is encountered rarely as a confirmed agent of [[onychomycosis]] in which the infection is validated by both a direct observation of filaments in the nail and recovery of the fungus in culture.<ref name=Romano /><ref name=Romano2 />\n\n==Pathogenicity==\n\n[[File:TEV protease summary.png|thumb|250px|Example of a protease ([[TEV protease]]) complex]]\nThe pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the fungi are due to either the presence of substances on the surface of the fungi, or substances released by the fungi.<ref name=singforme/> These can include: surface [[Fungal adhesin|adhesin]]s, [[mannan]]s, enzymes such as [[proteinases]], [[peptidase]]s, [[DNase]]s, and [[lipase]]s.<ref name=singforme/> The extracellular proteases released assist the fungus in invading the host skin barrier (keratin rich) with the presence of [[keratinase]] (keratinolytic activity increases).<ref name=singforme/> They then use the proteases to enhance their survival by chemically or physically altering the environment to their benefit by digesting the host proteins, thus providing themselves with nutrition. These [[protease]]s are found in all stages of growth (lag to declining) but peak at the mid log phase. These proteases are determined to be secreted during the lag phase of growth as they are secreted without the presence of host related proteins.

Originally, the fungus was thought to be ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'' until enhanced genetic examination separated the two as distinct species in 1963<ref name=\"Dolenc-Volj\u010d2017\" />.  \n\n== History and taxonomy ==\n''Microsporum fulvum'' was first documented in 1909 as ''Microsporum gypseum'' by Weitzman et al. ([[Argentina Medical Society]])''.''<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The fungus was thought to be the imperfect state of the [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorphic]], asexually reproducing, ''M. gypseum.''<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> However, in [[Stockdale, Texas|Stockdale]] (1963) ''M. fulvum'' was considered and described as its own species, ''[[Nannizzia fulva]]'',<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> the perfect state of the fungus. In the present, ''M. fulvum'' is still referred to as part of the ''Microsporum gypseum complex.''<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> This complex includes the three distinct species: ''Microsporum gypseum'', ''Microsporum fulvum'' and ''Microsporum incurvatum.''<ref name=\"Dolenc-Volj\u010d2017\" /> Each of these fungi possess a high degree of morphological similarity but do have significant genetic differences accounting for the speciation. \n\n== Growth ==\n''Microsporum fulvum'' will grow well on soil in a wide-variety of climate conditions and is found in world-wide distribution.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> The fungus tends to colonize keratin-rich environments and will grow rapidly in [[Microbiological culture|culture]] or in nature at diverse temperatures.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /><ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> ''M. fulvum'' commonly occupies materials such as dead skin cells and fragmented hair filaments.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> In culture, growth will occur within 4-5 days and forms floccose, wooly colonies.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The clustered cells appear granular with a sandy-brown tinge where most compact and a less dense, whiter periphery.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /><ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" />\n\n=== Morphology ===\n''M. fulvum'' looks morphologically similar to ''Microsporum gypseum.'' The fungus propagates sexually reproductive [[Ascus|asci]] that are 5-7 microns large with up to 8 spores, which are densely packed with [[Ascospore|ascospores]].<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> Asexual [[macroconidia]] are also formed and appear in large clusters (up to 8 microns in diameter) with [[Hypha|hyphae]] branches.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The macroconidia are fusoid-shaped with tapered ends and have very thin walls.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> [[Conidium|Microconidia]] are drop-shaped and are observed with sparse, irregular hyphae.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> When grown on soil combined with horse hair, closed fruiting bodies called [[cleistothecia]] form.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" />\n<br />\n=== Reproduction ===\n''Microsporum fulvum'' is classified as a [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]]<nowiki/>ic species as it sexually reproduces.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> This sexual state has been referred to as ''Arthroderma fulvum.''<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> Two [[Mating type|mating types]] have been distinguished for the sexual reproduction of the fungus and are characterized with (+) and (-).<ref name=\"Chandler1980\" /> The (+) mating type synthesizes the [[elastase]] [[enzyme]], where as the (-) mating type is unable to produce the elastase. Experiments involving the mating types suggest that the (+) mating type has higher virulence and causes more cases of infection.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> However, both strains demonstrate a positive result for their ability to hydrolyze the [[urea]] molecule, indicating the presence of the [[urease]] enzyme.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> A conducted study showed that a majority of tested isolates (>50%) of ''M. fulvum'' tested positive for urea hydrolysis within 0-7 days, and almost all isolates tested positive within 10-12 days, suggesting rapid growth of the organism.<ref name=\"McGinnis1980\" />\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\nLike many other dermatophytes, ''M. fulvum'' is a soil-loving, [[geophilic]] organism.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The species is commonly found invading obsolete hair fibres and skin molecules which are made of [[Keratin|keratin proteins.]]<ref name=\"Roberts1984\" /> It can be found growing on the keratinized material of many different mammalian species including humans, horses, rodents, dogs, etc without perceived preference.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> However, a higher incidence of colonization of ''M. fulvum'' has been documented on the epidermis of hedgehogs without causing any serious skin lesions, suggesting a commensal relationship between the organisms.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Isolates of the fungus have been found in skin and lung samples of healthy rodents without indication of impairment.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> As well, other ''Microsporum'' species have [[Arthrospore|arthrospores]] that are known to remain on human scalp hairs for months without causing skin lesions.<ref name=\"Roberts1984\" /> Due to the similar behavioural description of species in the ''Microsporum'' genus, it is believed that penetration of the [[mucous membrane]] is necessary for the fungus to become infectious to the host, otherwise the fungal organism can coexist without harm.<ref name=\"Chandler1980\" />  \n\nGeographically, ''Microporum fulvum'' has been found in diverse climate regions world-wide. The distribution of the fungus seems to be very broad and indiscriminate to temperature fluctuations.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> Isolates have been documented in [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Gabon]], [[Iran]] and many more geographically distinct areas.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> The fungus is commonly isolated in Canadian soils, however few infections have been reported.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> After a 20 year old man in Iran was diagnosed with a ''M. fulvum'' fungal infection,<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> a study was conducted on Iranian soil cultures from regions of varying temperatures. Experiments concluded that ''M. fulvum'' is colonized in the soils of a wide variety of environmental regions.<ref name=\"Rezaei-Matehkolaei2017\" />\n\n== Detection ==\nA mechanism termed [[Bait (luring substance)|baiting]] can be used to attract ''Microsporum fulvum'' to specific soil samples. The method involves preparing the desired soil with keratinized molecules (hair fragments, nail clippings, etc) and waiting for colonization of fungus onto the material.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Once fungal collections populate the sample, morphological examination can be conducted and completed. Morphological analysis is used to distinguish ''Microsporum'' species from other keratin-loving dermatophytes.<ref name=\"McGinnis1980\" /> To accurately decipher ''Microsporum gypseum and'' ''Microsporum fulvum'' from one another, many researchers use genetic analysis procedures.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" />  [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR amplification]] and [[genetic testing]] can be used to uncover information about the [[mitochondrial DNA]], which differs between the two species.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> In clinical reports, researchers have used methods referred to as [[ITS sequencing|Internal Transcribed Spacer]] (ITS) Sequencing and [[Maldi-TOF|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (Maldi-TOF)]] [[Mass spectrometry|Mass Spectrometry]] to differentiate the species of the ''Microsporum gypseum complex''.<ref name=\"Seyfarth2009\" /> \n\n== Disease ==\n=== Pathogenicity ===\n''Microsporum fulvum'' causes infection in humans, similar to the [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]] infection caused by ''Microsporum gypseum'' that can lead to disease progression.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> ''M. fulvum'' has been reported in cases of [[dermatophytosis]], [[Skin|cutaneous]] [[Mycosis|mycoses]] on any [[Keratin|keratinized]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] (dead skin).<ref name=\"Chandler1980\" /> [[Tinea corporis]] refers to the generic ringworm infection that can occur on any area of the body.<ref name=\"Beneke1970\" /> [[Tinea pedis]] is commonly referred to as [[Athlete's foot|Athlete's Foot]] and involves ''Microsporum'' fungi infecting the feet.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> [[Tinea capitis]] refers to ''Microsporum'' fungi infection of the scalp.<ref name=\"Beneke1970\" /> Each of these can be caused by ''Microsporum fulvum'', as well as other fungi, and elicit a similar immune response leading to dry patches, rashes, redness, edema, etc in a localized area.<ref name=\"Lewis1939\" /> Research shows that most infections from ''M. fulvum'' will have a duration of approximately one month and regress on their own, with the exception of more severe cases that require treatment.<ref name=\"Lewis1939\" />\n\nThese mycoses are restricted to keratinized tissue and remain localized as non-systemic infections.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> The causative agent of disease are fungal [[Keratinase|keratinases]], which degrade dead material and break down tissue. However, defense mechanisms are present within mammalian blood serum that inhibit these molecules and do not allow the fungus to travel throughout the body in the circulatory system.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> If the fungus gains access to mucosal membranes, it begins to release the [[elastase]] enzyme as well, which is responsible for causing an [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] in the host.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" />\n\n=== Transmission ===\nInitial infections with ''Microsporum fulvum'' are most likely from indirect sources where the fungus inhabited soil that came into contact with the mucous membrane of an animal.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> New infections can arise through direct or indirect contact of animals and humans who have been introduced to another contaminated source.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Often tranmission involves the shared use of clothing (shoes- tinea pedis, hats- capitis, etc)<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" />. Incidence of infection cases increase in winter months with cold climates due to continued use of closed-toed footwear which provide a good environment for fungal growth.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> Symptoms of infection are also exacerbated and more severe in these conditions.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" />\n\nInitial infections are common in those with high contact to soil and plant material, such as gardeners.<ref name=\"Seyfarth2009\" /> Secondary contamination of ''M. fulvum'' often occurs in bursts with multiple infections. In 1949, there were 8 cases of [[Ringworm of the hair|microsporosis]] caused by ''M. fulvum'' that were all in children under the age of 10 who lived in the same neighbourhood of [[Indiana]].<ref name=\"Dalton1950\" /> Thus, the fungus can spread through contact transmission.\n\n=== Treatment and prevention  ===\nDue to the biological properties and transmission methods of ''M. fulvum,'' proper [[Hygiene|hygienic]] practices assist with prevention of infection, especially regarding tinea pedis (infection of the feet).<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Health officials recommend the avoidance of contaminated flooring, such as locker rooms where fungi grow rapidly.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> \n\nIn past reports, treatment methods for ''Microsporum gypseum'' infections have been effective for ''M. fulvum'' infections. Anti-fungal drugs may be prescribed. As few infections have been confirmed to be caused by ''M. fulvum'', little data has become available on treatment options. However, one confirmed infection in an Iranian man had been treated with oral [[terbinafine]] ([[Antifungal|antifungal drug]]) and the infection cleared.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" />\n\n== Biotechnology applications ==\n[[Keratinase]] is an enzyme that functions to break down and degrade keratin molecules.<ref name=\"Darah2013\" /> ''Microsporum fulvum'' has the ability to synthesize keratinase and utilize the enzyme to inhabit and exploit the environment in which it resides. [[Poultry farming|Poultry industries]] have become interested in organisms which intrinsically produce keratinase for the reasoning that chicken feathers, which have high levels of dense keratin, are tough to break down and utilize. Fungal keratinase could be cultivated to break down chicken feathers into smaller products which could be converted into other material, such as [[animal feed]].<ref name=\"Darah2013\" />\n\n== References ==\n {{Reflist | 30em | refs =\n\n<ref name=Chandler1980>{{cite book | last1=Chandler | first1=Francis W. | last2=Kaplan | first2=William | last3=Ajello | first3=Libero| title=A Colour Atlas and Textbook fo the Histopathology of Mycotic Diseases | year=1980 | publisher=Wolfe Medical Pub. | location=Weert, Netherlands | isbn= 9780723407546}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dalton1950>{{cite article | last1=Dalton | first1=John | last2=Slaughter | first2=Robert | last3=Jenkins | first3=Robert | last4=Phelps | first4=Stephen | last5=Hackney | first5=Victor | title=Microsporosis Due to ''Microsporum fulvum'' | year=1950 | journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume=15 | pages=421-423 | doi=10.1038/jid.1950.124}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Darah2013>{{cite article | last1=Darah | first1=I. | last2=Nur-Diyana | first2=A. | last3=Nurul-Husna | first3=S. | last4=Jain | first4=K. | last5=Lim | first5=Sheh-Hong | title=''Microsporum fulvum'' IBRL SD3: As Novel Isolate for Chicken Feathers Degradation | year=2013 | journal=Appl Biochem Biotechnol | volume=171 | pages=1900-1910 | doi= 10.1007/s12010-013-0496-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Emmons1977>{{cite book | last1=Emmons | first1=Chester W. | last2=Binford | first2= Chapman H. | last3=Utz | first3=John P. | last4=Kwon-Chung | first4= K.

([[Argentina Medical Society]])''.''<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The fungus was thought to be the imperfect state of the [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorphic]], asexually reproducing, ''M. gypseum.''<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> However, in [[Stockdale, Texas|Stockdale]] (1963) ''M. fulvum'' was considered and described as its own species, ''[[Nannizzia fulva]]'',<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> the perfect state of the fungus. In the present, ''M. fulvum'' is still referred to as part of the ''Microsporum gypseum complex.''<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> This complex includes the three distinct species: ''Microsporum gypseum'', ''Microsporum fulvum'' and ''Microsporum incurvatum.''<ref name=\"Dolenc-Volj\u010d2017\" /> Each of these fungi possess a high degree of morphological similarity but do have significant genetic differences accounting for the speciation. \n\n== Growth ==\n''Microsporum fulvum'' will grow well on soil in a wide-variety of climate conditions and is found in world-wide distribution.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> The fungus tends to colonize keratin-rich environments and will grow rapidly in [[Microbiological culture|culture]] or in nature at diverse temperatures.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /><ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> ''M. fulvum'' commonly occupies materials such as dead skin cells and fragmented hair filaments.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> In culture, growth will occur within 4-5 days and forms floccose, wooly colonies.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The clustered cells appear granular with a sandy-brown tinge where most compact and a less dense, whiter periphery.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /><ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" />\n\n=== Morphology ===\n''M. fulvum'' looks morphologically similar to ''Microsporum gypseum.'' The fungus propagates sexually reproductive [[Ascus|asci]] that are 5-7 microns large with up to 8 spores, which are densely packed with [[Ascospore|ascospores]].<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> Asexual [[macroconidia]] are also formed and appear in large clusters (up to 8 microns in diameter) with [[Hypha|hyphae]] branches.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The macroconidia are fusoid-shaped with tapered ends and have very thin walls.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> [[Conidium|Microconidia]] are drop-shaped and are observed with sparse, irregular hyphae.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> When grown on soil combined with horse hair, closed fruiting bodies called [[cleistothecia]] form.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" />\n<br />\n=== Reproduction ===\n''Microsporum fulvum'' is classified as a [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]]<nowiki/>ic species as it sexually reproduces.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> This sexual state has been referred to as ''Arthroderma fulvum.''<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> Two [[Mating type|mating types]] have been distinguished for the sexual reproduction of the fungus and are characterized with (+) and (-).<ref name=\"Chandler1980\" /> The (+) mating type synthesizes the [[elastase]] [[enzyme]], where as the (-) mating type is unable to produce the elastase. Experiments involving the mating types suggest that the (+) mating type has higher virulence and causes more cases of infection.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> However, both strains demonstrate a positive result for their ability to hydrolyze the [[urea]] molecule, indicating the presence of the [[urease]] enzyme.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> A conducted study showed that a majority of tested isolates (>50%) of ''M. fulvum'' tested positive for urea hydrolysis within 0-7 days, and almost all isolates tested positive within 10-12 days, suggesting rapid growth of the organism.<ref name=\"McGinnis1980\" />\n\n== Habitat and ecology ==\nLike many other dermatophytes, ''M. fulvum'' is a soil-loving, [[geophilic]] organism.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> The species is commonly found invading obsolete hair fibres and skin molecules which are made of [[Keratin|keratin proteins.]]<ref name=\"Roberts1984\" /> It can be found growing on the keratinized material of many different mammalian species including humans, horses, rodents, dogs, etc without perceived preference.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> However, a higher incidence of colonization of ''M. fulvum'' has been documented on the epidermis of hedgehogs without causing any serious skin lesions, suggesting a commensal relationship between the organisms.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Isolates of the fungus have been found in skin and lung samples of healthy rodents without indication of impairment.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> As well, other ''Microsporum'' species have [[Arthrospore|arthrospores]] that are known to remain on human scalp hairs for months without causing skin lesions.<ref name=\"Roberts1984\" /> Due to the similar behavioural description of species in the ''Microsporum'' genus, it is believed that penetration of the [[mucous membrane]] is necessary for the fungus to become infectious to the host, otherwise the fungal organism can coexist without harm.<ref name=\"Chandler1980\" />  \n\nGeographically, ''Microporum fulvum'' has been found in diverse climate regions world-wide. The distribution of the fungus seems to be very broad and indiscriminate to temperature fluctuations.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> Isolates have been documented in [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Gabon]], [[Iran]] and many more geographically distinct areas.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> The fungus is commonly isolated in Canadian soils, however few infections have been reported.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> After a 20 year old man in Iran was diagnosed with a ''M. fulvum'' fungal infection,<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> a study was conducted on Iranian soil cultures from regions of varying temperatures. Experiments concluded that ''M. fulvum'' is colonized in the soils of a wide variety of environmental regions.<ref name=\"Rezaei-Matehkolaei2017\" />\n\n== Detection ==\nA mechanism termed [[Bait (luring substance)|baiting]] can be used to attract ''Microsporum fulvum'' to specific soil samples. The method involves preparing the desired soil with keratinized molecules (hair fragments, nail clippings, etc) and waiting for colonization of fungus onto the material.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Once fungal collections populate the sample, morphological examination can be conducted and completed. Morphological analysis is used to distinguish ''Microsporum'' species from other keratin-loving dermatophytes.<ref name=\"McGinnis1980\" /> To accurately decipher ''Microsporum gypseum and'' ''Microsporum fulvum'' from one another, many researchers use genetic analysis procedures.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" />  [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR amplification]] and [[genetic testing]] can be used to uncover information about the [[mitochondrial DNA]], which differs between the two species.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" /> In clinical reports, researchers have used methods referred to as [[ITS sequencing|Internal Transcribed Spacer]] (ITS) Sequencing and [[Maldi-TOF|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (Maldi-TOF)]] [[Mass spectrometry|Mass Spectrometry]] to differentiate the species of the ''Microsporum gypseum complex''.<ref name=\"Seyfarth2009\" /> \n\n== Disease ==\n=== Pathogenicity ===\n''Microsporum fulvum'' causes infection in humans, similar to the [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]] infection caused by ''Microsporum gypseum'' that can lead to disease progression.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" /> ''M. fulvum'' has been reported in cases of [[dermatophytosis]], [[Skin|cutaneous]] [[Mycosis|mycoses]] on any [[Keratin|keratinized]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] (dead skin).<ref name=\"Chandler1980\" /> [[Tinea corporis]] refers to the generic ringworm infection that can occur on any area of the body.<ref name=\"Beneke1970\" /> [[Tinea pedis]] is commonly referred to as [[Athlete's foot|Athlete's Foot]] and involves ''Microsporum'' fungi infecting the feet.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> [[Tinea capitis]] refers to ''Microsporum'' fungi infection of the scalp.<ref name=\"Beneke1970\" /> Each of these can be caused by ''Microsporum fulvum'', as well as other fungi, and elicit a similar immune response leading to dry patches, rashes, redness, edema, etc in a localized area.<ref name=\"Lewis1939\" /> Research shows that most infections from ''M. fulvum'' will have a duration of approximately one month and regress on their own, with the exception of more severe cases that require treatment.<ref name=\"Lewis1939\" />\n\nThese mycoses are restricted to keratinized tissue and remain localized as non-systemic infections.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> The causative agent of disease are fungal [[Keratinase|keratinases]], which degrade dead material and break down tissue. However, defense mechanisms are present within mammalian blood serum that inhibit these molecules and do not allow the fungus to travel throughout the body in the circulatory system.<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" /> If the fungus gains access to mucosal membranes, it begins to release the [[elastase]] enzyme as well, which is responsible for causing an [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]] in the host.<ref name=\"rippon1988\" />\n\n=== Transmission ===\nInitial infections with ''Microsporum fulvum'' are most likely from indirect sources where the fungus inhabited soil that came into contact with the mucous membrane of an animal.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> New infections can arise through direct or indirect contact of animals and humans who have been introduced to another contaminated source.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Often tranmission involves the shared use of clothing (shoes- tinea pedis, hats- capitis, etc)<ref name=\"Versalovic2011\" />. Incidence of infection cases increase in winter months with cold climates due to continued use of closed-toed footwear which provide a good environment for fungal growth.<ref name=\"Wilson1965\" /> Symptoms of infection are also exacerbated and more severe in these conditions.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" />\n\nInitial infections are common in those with high contact to soil and plant material, such as gardeners.<ref name=\"Seyfarth2009\" /> Secondary contamination of ''M. fulvum'' often occurs in bursts with multiple infections. In 1949, there were 8 cases of [[Ringworm of the hair|microsporosis]] caused by ''M. fulvum'' that were all in children under the age of 10 who lived in the same neighbourhood of [[Indiana]].<ref name=\"Dalton1950\" /> Thus, the fungus can spread through contact transmission.\n\n=== Treatment and prevention  ===\nDue to the biological properties and transmission methods of ''M. fulvum,'' proper [[Hygiene|hygienic]] practices assist with prevention of infection, especially regarding tinea pedis (infection of the feet).<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> Health officials recommend the avoidance of contaminated flooring, such as locker rooms where fungi grow rapidly.<ref name=\"Emmons1977\" /> \n\nIn past reports, treatment methods for ''Microsporum gypseum'' infections have been effective for ''M. fulvum'' infections. Anti-fungal drugs may be prescribed. As few infections have been confirmed to be caused by ''M. fulvum'', little data has become available on treatment options. However, one confirmed infection in an Iranian man had been treated with oral [[terbinafine]] ([[Antifungal|antifungal drug]]) and the infection cleared.<ref name=\"Nouriour-Sisakht2013\" />\n\n== Biotechnology applications ==\n[[Keratinase]] is an enzyme that functions to break down and degrade keratin molecules.<ref name=\"Darah2013\" /> ''Microsporum fulvum'' has the ability to synthesize keratinase and utilize the enzyme to inhabit and exploit the environment in which it resides. [[Poultry farming|Poultry industries]] have become interested in organisms which intrinsically produce keratinase for the reasoning that chicken feathers, which have high levels of dense keratin, are tough to break down and utilize. Fungal keratinase could be cultivated to break down chicken feathers into smaller products which could be converted into other material, such as [[animal feed]].<ref name=\"Darah2013\" />\n\n== References ==\n {{Reflist | 30em | refs =\n\n<ref name=Chandler1980>{{cite book | last1=Chandler | first1=Francis W. | last2=Kaplan | first2=William | last3=Ajello | first3=Libero| title=A Colour Atlas and Textbook fo the Histopathology of Mycotic Diseases | year=1980 | publisher=Wolfe Medical Pub. | location=Weert, Netherlands | isbn= 9780723407546}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Dalton1950>{{cite article | last1=Dalton | first1=John | last2=Slaughter | first2=Robert | last3=Jenkins | first3=Robert | last4=Phelps | first4=Stephen | last5=Hackney | first5=Victor | title=Microsporosis Due to ''Microsporum fulvum'' | year=1950 | journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume=15 | pages=421-423 | doi=10.1038/jid.1950.124}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Darah2013>{{cite article | last1=Darah | first1=I. | last2=Nur-Diyana | first2=A. | last3=Nurul-Husna | first3=S. | last4=Jain | first4=K. | last5=Lim | first5=Sheh-Hong | title=''Microsporum fulvum'' IBRL SD3: As Novel Isolate for Chicken Feathers Degradation | year=2013 | journal=Appl Biochem Biotechnol | volume=171 | pages=1900-1910 | doi= 10.1007/s12010-013-0496-4}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Emmons1977>{{cite book | last1=Emmons | first1=Chester W. | last2=Binford | first2= Chapman H. | last3=Utz | first3=John P. | last4=Kwon-Chung | first4= K.

''Microsporum canis'' exemplifies a common situation in ascomycetous fungi in which, over time, one mating type strain has undergone habitat divergence from the other and established a self-sustaining reproductive population that consists only of the asexual form.<ref name=medmyco /> It is hypothesized that asexual lineage of ''Microsporum canis'' evolved as a result of host-specific interactions, changes in ecological niche, as well as, geographic isolation of + and \u2013 mating types of ''Arthroderma otae'', hence making it difficult to sustain sexual reproduction.<ref name=evol /> Early domestication of animals, such as cats and dogs, in Africa led to a later evolution of host-specific fungus, ''Microsporum canis'', which is commonly associated with loose fur animals.<ref name=evol /> Nearly all reported isolates of ''Microsporum canis'' represent the \"\u2013\" mating strain of ''A. otae''.<ref name=evol /><ref name=summerbell2002/> Together with two closely related taxa, ''M. ferrugineum'' and ''M. audouinii'', the clade is thought to have an African center of origin.<ref name=graser2006/>\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Mcanis3220.jpg|thumb|alt=Yellow, fungal colony with feathery margin|Characteristic yellow, feathery colony of ''Microsporum canis'' photographed on a slope of Modified Leonian's agar after 7 days growth.]]\n\n===Colony morphology===\n''Microsporum canis'' forms a white, coarsely fluffy spreading colony with a distinctive \"hairy\" or \"feathery\" texture.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> On the underside of the growth medium, a characteristic deep yellow pigment develops due to the metabolites secreted by the fungus.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> The intensity of this yellow pigmentation peak on the 6th day of colony growth and fades gradually making the identification of older colonies difficult.<ref name=derm /> Some strains of ''M. canis'' fail to produce yellow pigment altogether, exhibit abnormally slow colony growth and form undeveloped macroconidia.<ref name=derm /> Cultivation on polished rice tends to reestablish the typical growth morphology and is helpful for identification.<ref name=derm />\n\n===Microscopic morphology===\n''Microsporum canis'' reproduces asexually by forming macroconidia that are asymmetrical, spherically shaped and have cell walls that are thick and coarsely roughened.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> The interior portion of each macroconidium is typically divided into six or more compartments separated by broad cross-walls.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> ''Microsporum canis'' also produces microconidia that resemble those of many other dermatophytes and thus are not a useful diagnostic feature.<ref name=medmyco /><ref name=derm />\n\n==Identification==\n''Microsporum canis'' produces infections of scalp and body sites, creating highly inflammatory lesions associated with hair loss.<ref name=medmyco /> Infection by this species can often be detected clinically using Wood's lamp, which causes infected tissues to fluoresce bright green<ref name=derm /><ref name=mykosen /> Fluorescence is attributed to metabolite [[pteridine]], which is produced by the fungus in actively growing hairs.<ref name=medmyco /> Infected hairs remain fluorescent for prolonged periods of time (over the years), even after the death of the fungus.<ref name=medmyco /> Despite the frequent use of Wood's lamp in the clinical evaluation of ringworm infections, diagnosis of ''M. canis'' requires the performance of additional tests given the potential for false positives.<ref name=prev /> Culture of the fungus is most commonly used to evaluate morphological and physiological parameters of growth, and confirm the identity of the agent.

''Microsporum canis'' exemplifies a common situation in ascomycetous fungi in which, over time, one mating type strain has undergone habitat divergence from the other and established a self-sustaining reproductive population that consists only of the asexual form.<ref name=medmyco /> It is hypothesized that asexual lineage of ''Microsporum canis'' evolved as a result of host-specific interactions, changes in ecological niche, as well as, geographic isolation of + and \u2013 mating types of ''Arthroderma otae'', hence making it difficult to sustain sexual reproduction.<ref name=evol /> Early domestication of animals, such as cats and dogs, in Africa led to a later evolution of host-specific fungus, ''Microsporum canis'', which is commonly associated with loose fur animals.<ref name=evol /> Nearly all reported isolates of ''Microsporum canis'' represent the \"\u2013\" mating strain of ''A. otae''.<ref name=evol /><ref name=summerbell2002/> Together with two closely related taxa, ''M. ferrugineum'' and ''M. audouinii'', the clade is thought to have an African center of origin.<ref name=graser2006/>\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Mcanis3220.jpg|thumb|alt=Yellow, fungal colony with feathery margin|Characteristic yellow, feathery colony of ''Microsporum canis'' photographed on a slope of Modified Leonian's agar after 7 days growth.]]\n\n===Colony morphology===\n''Microsporum canis'' forms a white, coarsely fluffy spreading colony with a distinctive \"hairy\" or \"feathery\" texture.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> On the underside of the growth medium, a characteristic deep yellow pigment develops due to the metabolites secreted by the fungus.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> The intensity of this yellow pigmentation peak on the 6th day of colony growth and fades gradually making the identification of older colonies difficult.<ref name=derm /> Some strains of ''M. canis'' fail to produce yellow pigment altogether, exhibit abnormally slow colony growth and form undeveloped macroconidia.<ref name=derm /> Cultivation on polished rice tends to reestablish the typical growth morphology and is helpful for identification.<ref name=derm />\n\n===Microscopic morphology===\n''Microsporum canis'' reproduces asexually by forming macroconidia that are asymmetrical, spherically shaped and have cell walls that are thick and coarsely roughened.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> The interior portion of each macroconidium is typically divided into six or more compartments separated by broad cross-walls.<ref name=derm /><ref name=bodin /> ''Microsporum canis'' also produces microconidia that resemble those of many other dermatophytes and thus are not a useful diagnostic feature.<ref name=medmyco /><ref name=derm />\n\n==Identification==\n''Microsporum canis'' produces infections of scalp and body sites, creating highly inflammatory lesions associated with hair loss.<ref name=medmyco /> Infection by this species can often be detected clinically using Wood's lamp, which causes infected tissues to fluoresce bright green<ref name=derm /><ref name=mykosen /> Fluorescence is attributed to metabolite [[pteridine]], which is produced by the fungus in actively growing hairs.<ref name=medmyco /> Infected hairs remain fluorescent for prolonged periods of time (over the years), even after the death of the fungus.<ref name=medmyco /> Despite the frequent use of Wood's lamp in the clinical evaluation of ringworm infections, diagnosis of ''M. canis'' requires the performance of additional tests given the potential for false positives.<ref name=prev /> Culture of the fungus is most commonly used to evaluate morphological and physiological parameters of growth, and confirm the identity of the agent.

Differences in the chemical composition and quantity of the triglycerides in hair sebum secreted are the primary reasons.<ref name=Kligman1950/>  In instances whereby the triglyceride content in the sebum decreases so does the susceptibility of a person to the fungus.<ref name=\"Summerbell 2000\"/>  Cases like those are seen in postmenopausal women of whom suffer hormonal changes which can contribute to triglyceride reduction.<ref name=\"Summerbell 2000\"/> In addition, increased sweat production as well as the presence of ''Pityrosporum ovale'' decreases the ability for ''M. audouinii'' to thrive.<ref name=\"Narang 2012\"/><ref name=\"Faergemann 1993\"/> ''Pityrosporum ovale'' is an opportunistic lipophilic yeast that is a part of the human cutaneous flora in adults.<ref name=\"Faergemann 1993\"/> In most cases of adult onset Tinea capitis due to ''M. audouinii'', there is at least one predisposing factor such as immunocompromise (e.g., diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus, organ transplant and HIV), a local animal reservoir (e.g., infected pet or farm animal) and hormonal changes in postmenopausal women.<ref name=\"Summerbell 2000\"/><ref name=\"Narang 2012\"/>\n\nTinea capitis is seen in tropical, rural and suburban regions.<ref name=Arenas2010/> In the 19th and early 20th centuries, ''M. audouinii'' was the primary fungus responsible for Tinea capitis throughout the US and Western Europe.<ref name=Arenas2010/><ref name=Vella/> With the advent of antimycotic agents, its prevalence has decreased.<ref name=Arenas2010/> But in the poorer parts of Africa, especially Central and West Africa, ''M. audouinii'' remains the primary dermatophyte responsible for this disease.<ref name=Arenas2010/><ref name=Rez2011/>\n\n==Pathology==\n[[Tinea capitis]] develops when an [[Microbiological culture|inoculum]] from another individual or animal comes into a 'compromised scalp', which can occur when the [[stratum corneum]] of the scalp is exposed.<ref name=\"Summerbell 2000\"/> This can be due to trauma of the scalp, tight hair braiding or hair styling with infected tools.<ref name=\"Summerbell 2000\"/>  In general, fungal spread is facilitated by poverty, poor hygiene and overcrowding.<ref name=\"Summerbell 2000\"/>\n\nOnce the fungus has entered the stratum corneum it continues to invade the epidermis; it then enters a hair [[Hair follicle|follicle]], penetrates the hair shaft and grows down the length of the hair.<ref name = Emmons1963/> The hyphae grow distally until they reach the upper limits of the zone of keratinization where the nucleated hair shaft cornifies completely and is converted into hard, anucleated [[keratin]].<ref name=\"Joshi 2011\"/>  The terminal end of the growing hyphae forms a ring (Adamson's Fringe).<ref name = Emmons1963/> As the hair continues to grow outwards, hyphae are brought to the surface (scalp) and arthroconidia are produced.<ref name=\"Summerbell 2000\"/> Eventually due to mechanical forces (the movement of the fungi) and keratinase (a chymotrypsin-like enzyme with optimal activity at an acidic pH), all but 1\u20132&nbsp;mm of the diseased hair follicle weakens and falls off.<ref name =CC1996/><ref name = Emmons1963/> The remaining hair has a characteristic dark grey appearance due to the Adamson's Fringe.<ref name = Emmons1963/>\n\n==Diagnostic tests==\nThere is an array of different tests to differentiate between fungi.

''E. stockdaleae'' is also clinically differentiated from ''E. floccosum'' by its ability in perforating hair.<ref name = Liu2011 /> Due to the presence of [[Conidium|microconidia]], ''E. stockdaleae'' is now considered a synonym of [[Trichophyton|''Trichophyton ajelloi'']], hence ''E. floccosum'' is currently the only species in the genus ''Epidermophyton''.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Liu2011 />\n\n==Growth and morphology==\nThe filamentous non-soil associated fungus does not require any specific growth condition in culture.<ref name = St-Germain1996 /><ref name = Rippon1988 /> ''E. floccosum'' does not grow on urease culture, has low osmotolerance, and is unable to form perforating organs.<ref name=\"Kushwaha2000\" /><ref name=\"Shadomy1980\" /> The colonies have khaki suede-like flat surfaces and grow moderately rapidly, reaching maturity within 10 days.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Rebell1970 /> The reverse is reddish-brown.<ref name = Rippon1988 /> Colonies are initially flat, but the centre of which later becomes raised and folded, with the periphery submerged.<ref name = Liu2011 /> On rich media like [[Sabouraud agar]], colonies usually degenerate into white [[Pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]] tufts within several weeks, and sometimes exude a red-brown pigment into its agar.<ref name = Kushwaha2000 />\n\n''E. floccosum'' has septate, hyaline hyphae. Its key features are the smooth, thin-walled, club-shaped macroconidia and the absence of microconidia.<ref name = Liu2011 /> The macroconidia are borne singly or in clusters of 2 or 3; they are 20\u201340&nbsp;\u03bcm in length and 7\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm in width,  consisting of 1 to 9 septa.<ref name = Murray2003 /> The narrow base and broad, club-shaped apex of the macroconidium have been compared in shape to a [[beaver]] tail.<ref name = Rippon1988 />\n\nThe fungus reproduces asexually through [[chlamydoconidia]], which are resting spores that are abundant in culture.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Rebell1970 /> [[Arthroconidium|Arthroconidia]] are also abundant in the culture, emerging as swollen cells alongside macroconidia formation; these thick-walled spores are resistant to heat and drying conditions.<ref name = Rippon1988 />\n\n==Pathology==\n===Infection===\n\n''E. floccosum'' causes superficial diseases such as tinea pedis (athlete's foot) and tinea cruris, and less commonly tinea corporis and onychomycosis.<ref name = Kane1997 /><ref name = Liu2011 /> Similar to other fungal dermatophytes, ''E. floccosum'' can invade [[Keratinized epithelium|keratinized tissues]] including skin and nails.<ref name = Liu2011 /> A recent clinical case has also demonstrated its capacity of infecting eyes, causing [[keratitis]].<ref name = Liu2011 /> It does not perforate hair or hair follicles.<ref name = Murray2003 /> This anthropophilic dermatophyte preferentially infects humans and rarely infects animals, thus lab animal experiments are found to be unsuccessful.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Rippon1988 /> ''E. floccosum'' is more infective than most dermatophytes.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /> Chronic infections are rare, therefore maintenance of the species relies on rapid transmission between hosts.<ref name = Rippon1988 /> The infection typically stays within the nonliving conidified layer of host epidermis, since the fungus cannot pierce through living tissues of individuals with normal immunity. However, it has been found to cause invasive infections in immunocompromised patients, demonstrating severe onychomycosis, skin lesions, and subcutaneous nodules.<ref name = Liu2011 /><ref name = Seddon1997 />\n\n===Spread===\n\n''E. floccosum'' can remain viable for long periods of time by producing arthroconidia in skin scales. [[Arthroconidium|Arthroconidia]] are thick-walled spores with higher resistance to drying and heat conditions than [[mycelium]].<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /> Arthroconidia formation allows ''E. floccosum'' to survive for years in showers, baths, swimming pools, towels, blankets, sheets, shoes and other clothings.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /><ref name=\"Kane1997\" /><ref name = Cabrita1973 /> The fungus commonly spreads by contact in showers and gym facilities.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" />\n\n===Treatment===\n''In vitro'' studies have found that several agents are effective against ''E. floccosum''.<ref name = Pfaller1998 /> Disease-specific topical treatments for ''E. floccosum''-related infections are usually effective, commonly with the use of terbinafine, itraconazole, and ketoconazole.<ref name =\n\"\n Degreef1994\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n*\nWhen causing the same disease, clinical demonstrations of ''E. floccosum'' are generally indistinguishable from other dermatophytes, except for tinea pedis: infections involving ''E. floccosum'' can demonstrate marked scaling in patient's toe and sole and produce punctate lesions nearby. Brownish [[macules]] could derive from some of these lesions.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" /><ref name=\"Rippon1988\" />\n\nTraditionally, diseases are diagnosed with physical and [[Wood's lamp]] examinations. Unlike some ''Microsporium'' species, ''Epidermophyton, as well as'' ''Trichophyton'' do not fluoresce under the ultraviolet light of a Wood's lamp. Fungal cultures further distinguish ''Epidermophyton'' from other dermatophytes based on the absence of microconidia.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" /> Molecular advances have decreased the time of identification from 3\u20134 weeks to 3\u20134 days. Samples obtained from patient nail, hair, and skin scale can undergo [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|PCR-RFLP]], which distinguishes between 12 dermatophyte species based on their individual restriction enzyme profiles, including one for ''E. floccosum''. A [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|real time PCR]] protocol is also available for the specific detection of ''E. floccosum'', allowing identification as fast as 4 hours after sample lysis.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" />\n\n==Habitat==\n''E. floccosum'' has a worldwide distribution but is more commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /> Historical fungal infections have been reported in US military in Vietnam and British Army in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Kane1997\" /><ref name=\"Waugh2007\" /> ''E. floccosum'' was considered the fourth most common cause of dermatophytosis in North America.<ref name=\"Kane1997\" /> Accounting for around 20 percent US cases and 44 percent Asian cases, it is also the third most common cause of tinea pedis worldwide, following ''Trichophyton mentagrophytes'' and ''Trichophyton rubrum''.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" />\n*\n\n==References==\n {{Reflist | 30em | refs =\n\n<ref name = Cabrita1973>{{Cite journal|last=Cabrita|first=J\u00falia|last2=Esteves|first2=J.|last3=Sequeira|first3=Hort\u00eansia|date=1973|title=Dermatophytes in Portugal (1972\u20131981)|journal=Mycopathologia|language=en|volume=84|issue=2\u20133|pages=159\u2013164|doi=10.1007/BF00436527|pmid=6717555|issn=0301-486X}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = Degreef1994>{{Cite journal|last=Degreef|first=H.

''E. stockdaleae'' is also clinically differentiated from ''E. floccosum'' by its ability in perforating hair.<ref name = Liu2011 /> Due to the presence of [[Conidium|microconidia]], ''E. stockdaleae'' is now considered a synonym of [[Trichophyton|''Trichophyton ajelloi'']], hence ''E. floccosum'' is currently the only species in the genus ''Epidermophyton''.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Liu2011 />\n\n==Growth and morphology==\nThe filamentous non-soil associated fungus does not require any specific growth condition in culture.<ref name = St-Germain1996 /><ref name = Rippon1988 /> ''E. floccosum'' does not grow on urease culture, has low osmotolerance, and is unable to form perforating organs.<ref name=\"Kushwaha2000\" /><ref name=\"Shadomy1980\" /> The colonies have khaki suede-like flat surfaces and grow moderately rapidly, reaching maturity within 10 days.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Rebell1970 /> The reverse is reddish-brown.<ref name = Rippon1988 /> Colonies are initially flat, but the centre of which later becomes raised and folded, with the periphery submerged.<ref name = Liu2011 /> On rich media like [[Sabouraud agar]], colonies usually degenerate into white [[Pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]] tufts within several weeks, and sometimes exude a red-brown pigment into its agar.<ref name = Kushwaha2000 />\n\n''E. floccosum'' has septate, hyaline hyphae. Its key features are the smooth, thin-walled, club-shaped macroconidia and the absence of microconidia.<ref name = Liu2011 /> The macroconidia are borne singly or in clusters of 2 or 3; they are 20\u201340&nbsp;\u03bcm in length and 7\u201312&nbsp;\u03bcm in width,  consisting of 1 to 9 septa.<ref name = Murray2003 /> The narrow base and broad, club-shaped apex of the macroconidium have been compared in shape to a [[beaver]] tail.<ref name = Rippon1988 />\n\nThe fungus reproduces asexually through [[chlamydoconidia]], which are resting spores that are abundant in culture.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Rebell1970 /> [[Arthroconidium|Arthroconidia]] are also abundant in the culture, emerging as swollen cells alongside macroconidia formation; these thick-walled spores are resistant to heat and drying conditions.<ref name = Rippon1988 />\n\n==Pathology==\n===Infection===\n\n''E. floccosum'' causes superficial diseases such as tinea pedis (athlete's foot) and tinea cruris, and less commonly tinea corporis and onychomycosis.<ref name = Kane1997 /><ref name = Liu2011 /> Similar to other fungal dermatophytes, ''E. floccosum'' can invade [[Keratinized epithelium|keratinized tissues]] including skin and nails.<ref name = Liu2011 /> A recent clinical case has also demonstrated its capacity of infecting eyes, causing [[keratitis]].<ref name = Liu2011 /> It does not perforate hair or hair follicles.<ref name = Murray2003 /> This anthropophilic dermatophyte preferentially infects humans and rarely infects animals, thus lab animal experiments are found to be unsuccessful.<ref name = Murray2003 /><ref name = Rippon1988 /> ''E. floccosum'' is more infective than most dermatophytes.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /> Chronic infections are rare, therefore maintenance of the species relies on rapid transmission between hosts.<ref name = Rippon1988 /> The infection typically stays within the nonliving conidified layer of host epidermis, since the fungus cannot pierce through living tissues of individuals with normal immunity. However, it has been found to cause invasive infections in immunocompromised patients, demonstrating severe onychomycosis, skin lesions, and subcutaneous nodules.<ref name = Liu2011 /><ref name = Seddon1997 />\n\n===Spread===\n\n''E. floccosum'' can remain viable for long periods of time by producing arthroconidia in skin scales. [[Arthroconidium|Arthroconidia]] are thick-walled spores with higher resistance to drying and heat conditions than [[mycelium]].<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /> Arthroconidia formation allows ''E. floccosum'' to survive for years in showers, baths, swimming pools, towels, blankets, sheets, shoes and other clothings.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /><ref name=\"Kane1997\" /><ref name = Cabrita1973 /> The fungus commonly spreads by contact in showers and gym facilities.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" />\n\n===Treatment===\n''In vitro'' studies have found that several agents are effective against ''E. floccosum''.<ref name = Pfaller1998 /> Disease-specific topical treatments for ''E. floccosum''-related infections are usually effective, commonly with the use of terbinafine, itraconazole, and ketoconazole.<ref name =\n\"\n Degreef1994\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n*\nWhen causing the same disease, clinical demonstrations of ''E. floccosum'' are generally indistinguishable from other dermatophytes, except for tinea pedis: infections involving ''E. floccosum'' can demonstrate marked scaling in patient's toe and sole and produce punctate lesions nearby. Brownish [[macules]] could derive from some of these lesions.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" /><ref name=\"Rippon1988\" />\n\nTraditionally, diseases are diagnosed with physical and [[Wood's lamp]] examinations. Unlike some ''Microsporium'' species, ''Epidermophyton, as well as'' ''Trichophyton'' do not fluoresce under the ultraviolet light of a Wood's lamp. Fungal cultures further distinguish ''Epidermophyton'' from other dermatophytes based on the absence of microconidia.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" /> Molecular advances have decreased the time of identification from 3\u20134 weeks to 3\u20134 days. Samples obtained from patient nail, hair, and skin scale can undergo [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|PCR-RFLP]], which distinguishes between 12 dermatophyte species based on their individual restriction enzyme profiles, including one for ''E. floccosum''. A [[Real-time polymerase chain reaction|real time PCR]] protocol is also available for the specific detection of ''E. floccosum'', allowing identification as fast as 4 hours after sample lysis.<ref name=\"Liu2011\" />\n\n==Habitat==\n''E. floccosum'' has a worldwide distribution but is more commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" /> Historical fungal infections have been reported in US military in Vietnam and British Army in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Kane1997\" /><ref name=\"Waugh2007\" /> ''E. floccosum'' was considered the fourth most common cause of dermatophytosis in North America.<ref name=\"Kane1997\" /> Accounting for around 20 percent US cases and 44 percent Asian cases, it is also the third most common cause of tinea pedis worldwide, following ''Trichophyton mentagrophytes'' and ''Trichophyton rubrum''.<ref name=\"Rippon1988\" />\n*\n\n==References==\n {{Reflist | 30em | refs =\n\n<ref name = Cabrita1973>{{Cite journal|last=Cabrita|first=J\u00falia|last2=Esteves|first2=J.|last3=Sequeira|first3=Hort\u00eansia|date=1973|title=Dermatophytes in Portugal (1972\u20131981)|journal=Mycopathologia|language=en|volume=84|issue=2\u20133|pages=159\u2013164|doi=10.1007/BF00436527|pmid=6717555|issn=0301-486X}}</ref>\n\n<ref name = Degreef1994>{{Cite journal|last=Degreef|first=H.
