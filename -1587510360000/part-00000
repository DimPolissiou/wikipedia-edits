Letterkenny acts as an urban gateway to the Ulster ''[[Gaeltacht]]'', similar to [[Galway]]'s relationship to the [[Connemara]] ''Gaeltacht''.\n\nLetterkenny began as a [[market town]] at the start of the 17th century, during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. A castle once stood near where the [[Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba]], County Donegal's only [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral, stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. County Donegal's premier third-level institution, the [[Letterkenny Institute of Technology]] (LYIT), is located in the town, as are [[St Eunan's College]], [[Highland Radio]], and a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple.<ref name=first_hindu_temple/> Letterkenny was also the original home of [[Oatfield (confectioner)|Oatfield]] Sweet Factory, a confectionery manufacturer; the factory closed and was demolished in 2014.<ref>http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/sweet-sorrow-as-iconic-factory-is-torn-down-30216692.html</ref> In 1798, [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] was arrested at Laird's Hotel in the town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=William Tone, 1827|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> In 2015, Letterkenny was judged the tidiest town in Ireland.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/tidy-towns-lovely-letterkenny-scoops-national-top-spot-1.2369724</ref>\n\nMembers of the family of [[Jane Austen]] lived and are buried in the town, while Letterkenny also has ancestral links to the future British kings [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William V]] and [[Prince George of Cambridge|George VII]] (second and third [[Succession to the British throne|in line]] to the throne, respectively).<ref name=di/><ref name=novel_approach/>\n\n==Etymology==\nLetterkenny takes its name from the Irish ''Leitirceanainn'', meaning \"Hillside of the O'Cannons\" \u2013 the O'Cannons being the last of the ancient chieftains of [[T\u00edr Conaill]]. However, no evidence of forts or castles belonging to the O'Cannon clan exists in or around the Letterkenny district. Therefore, a speculative derivation of Letterkenny may be 'Leitir Ceann-Fhoinn', meaning 'Fairheaded Hillside').\n\nThe O'Cannon dynasty are allegedly descended from [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]] and [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]], two of Ireland's most famous Kings. The O'Cannons have been described as 'Ancient Princes of T\u00edr Connaill' and 'Valiant Chiefs'. However, their 350-year dynasty in T\u00edr Connaill ended in 1250. Their ancient territory would seem to have been T\u00edr Aeda (now the [[Baronies of Ireland|barony]] of Tirhugh) in what is now South Donegal.[[File:Riverswilly.JPG|260px|thumbnail|left|The mouth of the [[River Swilly]] at [[Lough Swilly]] in Letterkenny.]] After the deaths of Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Canannain (Rory O'Cannon) and his son Niall \u00d3 Canannain in 1250, the [[sept]] declined greatly in power. Brian \u00d3 N\u00e9ill (Brian O'Neill) died ten years later in 1260; he had supported an \u00d3 Canannain claimant to T\u00edr Conaill, i.e. to the Kingdom of T\u00edr Conaill (Tirconnell). However, the O'Cannon Clan remained subserviant to the [[O'Donnell Clan]], the Kings of T\u00edr Chonaill from the early thirteenth century onwards. The personal name Canannain is a diminutive of Cano meaning 'wolf cub'. Canannain was fifth in descent from [[Flaithbertach mac Loingsig]] (died [[765 in Ireland|765]]), [[high-king]] of Ireland; they were the descendants of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]] (Irish: Niall Noigiallach), who died c. [[405 in Ireland|405]] A.D., by his son [[Conall Gulban]], who gave his name to [[T\u00edr Conaill]], the 'Land of Conall', now County Donegal.\n\nBy the early 17th century, the name U\u00ed Canannain had been [[anglicised]] to O'Cannon. Further anglicisation took place during the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the name in Co. Dun na nGall became Cannon. In the early 1880s, there were just 200 families bearing the Cannon surname living in Co. Donegal, who were mainly tenant farmers. The Cannons/O'Canannains were of the ancient sept of Cenell Conaill, a branch of the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and descend from Ruaidr\u00ed ua Canannain (died 30 November [[950 in Ireland|950]]), King of Cenel Conaill, and grandson of Canannain, who flourished in the second half of the 9th century. The site of the ancient seat of the \u00d3 Canannain was near Letterkenny (the largest town of County Donegal only since the 1950s), which is said on good authority (?) to represent the countryside of the O'Cannons (English translation).\n\n==History==\n{{further|Battle of Farsetmore|Battle of Scarrifholis}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| image1    = Letterkenny Main Street 1900.jpg\n| width1    = 200\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Market-square-lk.jpg\n| width2    = 200\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Above: The Market Square district c.1900; <br />\nBelow: The Market Square district c.2007\n}}\nThe modern town of Letterkenny began as a [[market town]] at the start of the 17th century, during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. It may have been established on the site of an earlier [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] settlement. It was the first crossing point of the [[River Swilly]]. In the recent past, Letterkenny was a largely agricultural town, surrounded by extensive cattle and sheep grazing on what was then untilled hillside \u2013 at a time when Conwal (3&nbsp;km west of Letterkenny) was the ecclesiastical and seaport centre. The waters of the Atlantic had not yet retreated from the basin of the Swilly, whose estuary at that time extended up almost as far as New Mills \u2013 proof of this may be found in those alluvial flat-lands between [[Oldtown, Letterkenny|Oldtown]] and Port Road.\n\nRory O'Cannon, the last chieftain of the O'Cannon Clan, was killed in 1248. Godfrey O'Donnell succeeded Rory O'Cannon as King of [[T\u00edr Conaill]]. He engaged the Norman lord [[Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly]], in battle at [[Battle of Creadran Cille|Credan]] in the north of what is now [[County Sligo]] in 1257 in which both were badly wounded \u2013 Fitzgerald immediately fatally so. Godfrey (also dying from his wounds) retired to a crann\u00f3g in Lough Beag (Gartan Lake). [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill|O'Neill]] of [[T\u00edr Eoghain]] \u2014 taking advantage of Godfrey's fatal illness \u2014 demanded submission, hostages and pledges from the [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]] since they had no strong chieftain since the wounding of Godfrey. Godfrey summoned his forces and led them himself, although he had to be carried on a litter (stretcher). O'Neill and his men were completely defeated by the Swilly in 1258. Godfrey died however after the battle near where the town of Letterkenny is today. He was buried in Conwal Cemetery. A cross-shaped coffin slab marks his grave to this day.\n\nThe receding of the waters of the Atlantic eastwards enabled progress, and with the building of bridges etc., the town of Letterkenny started to take the shape it has today. In the wake of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] (which began around 1609), when a {{convert|4|km2|acre}} area was granted to a [[Scotsman]] Patrick Crawford, the compact community formed.\n\nThe honour of formally launching the town fell to [[George Marbury|Sir George Marbury]] who married Patrick Crawford's widow \u2014 Crawford having died suddenly while on a return visit to his native Scotland. Initially there were possibly fifty simple habitations sited where [[Oldtown, Letterkenny|the Oldtown]] is situated today.\n\nMarbury's wife, Johanna, was an ancestor (from an earlier marriage) of the future British kings [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William V]] and [[Prince George of Cambridge|George VII]] (second and third [[Succession to the British throne|in line]] to the throne, respectively).<ref name=di>{{cite web|url=https://www.letterkennyhistory.com/diana-princess-of-wales-letterkenny/|title=Diana, Princess of Wales & Letterkenny|date=9 October 2018|accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe main streets, though now suffering traffic congestion, were simple pony tracks used by the hill farmers to come to the markets. The markets \u2014 started by Patrick Crawford with only a few animals \u2014 grew into much busier mart which are not present today.\n\n[[File:Market Square, Letterkenny (8611952691).jpg|thumb|Traffic in Market Square in 1928.]]\n\nAn ancient castle once stood near where the [[Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba]] stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. Outlaw [[Redmond O'Hanlon (outlaw)|Redmond O' Hanlon]] found refuge there in 1690. No remains of the castle exist today.<ref>Donegal News \u2013 18 April 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], on 12 October, a large French force consisting of 3,000 men, and including [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]], attempted to land in [[County Donegal]] near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a large British [[Royal Navy]] force, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. After [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]] was captured he was held for a short time at Laird's Hotel (opposite the Market Square) in the Main Street of Letterkenny<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aohdiv1.org/wolftone.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222165151/http://aohdiv1.org/wolftone.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 December 2007 |title=Wolf Tone Captured in Letterkenny |work=aohdiv1.org }}</ref> before being transferred to the nearby [[Derry Gaol]]. He was later tried by court-martial in Dublin and found guilty. He committed suicide in prison. \n[[File:Wolfe_Tone_sign_Letterkenny.jpg|thumb|Sign erected to commemorate Tone's arrest in the town]]\nIn 1824, when the first description of Letterkenny as a modern town was written, it was stated that: ''\"Within half a mile is the Port of [[Ballyraine]], whither vessels of 100 tons bring iron, salt and colonial produce and whence they export hides and butter\"''. Nothing remains now except the warehouses with the example of 19th century warehouse architecture.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927141716/http://www.directorytourism.com/Tourism-By-Region/destination-letterkenny-tourism-l741.html?language=Spanish Only Warehouse Architecture remains]</ref>\n\nLetterkenny achieved town status in the early 1920s following the [[partition of Ireland]]. When the [[Irish pound|Irish punt]] replaced the British [[pound sterling]] in County Donegal in 1928, many Irish banks that had been previously located in [[Derry]] (in the new [[Northern Ireland]]) opened branches in Letterkenny.\n\nLetterkenny made history in August 2012 when two winning [[National Lottery (Ireland)|Lotto]] tickets using the same numbers for the same draw were bought at two different locations in the town \u2013 Mac's Mace on the High Road and The Paper Post on Main Street. The occurrence made national news. A spokesperson for Lotto HQ in Dublin said it was the first time this had happened.<ref>{{cite news|first=Greg |last=Harkin |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/it-could-be-you-and-you-too-letterkenny-scoops-two-lotto-wins-3199839.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218080711/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/it-could-be-you-and-you-too-letterkenny-scoops-two-lotto-wins-3199839.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 February 2013 |title=It could be you.. and you too, Letterkenny scoops two Lotto wins |newspaper=Irish Independent |publisher=Independent News & Media |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=13 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Carlisle Road, Derry 2010.jpg|250px|thumb|A view of Letterkenny Main Street]]\nLetterkenny is the largest town in County Donegal. Despite having a long tradition of emigration that continued until the early 1990s, Letterkenny has recently had net immigration. The recent immigrants are mostly of foreign origin, with many immigrants from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. This is reflected in the recent growth of immigrant restaurants and shops, including Chinese and Indian restaurants, as well as specialised shops run by and providing goods for Africans, Asians, South Americans, and Eastern Europeans. Letterkenny is home to one of Ireland's few [[Hindu temple]]s.<ref name=first_hindu_temple>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/from-timber-homes-to-godhouse-1062968.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120803132011/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/from-timber-homes-to-godhouse-1062968.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 3 August 2012 |title=From timber homes to god-house |newspaper=Irish Independent |publisher=Independent News & Media |date=21 August 2007 |accessdate=21 August 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.letterkennyindians.ie/CC.aspx |title=Letterkenny Indian Community Centre |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614204349/http://www.letterkennyindians.ie/CC.aspx |archivedate=14 June 2017  }}</ref>\n\nThe figures for ethnic and cultural background for people in the State in 2006 reveals that 16% of Letterkenny's population are non-nationals. The figures also show that most of Donegal's non-national population are living in the town. Of the town's total population 2,709 are non-nationals.<ref>[[Donegal Democrat]] report, 31 July 2007</ref> According to the 2006 census 4,957 people have a disability illness, 640 people have a registered disability, 537 have a chronic illness while 345 suffer from a psychological or an emotional condition.<ref>[[Donegal News]] report, 9 November 2007</ref> The 2006 census also revealed that there were 199 [[Irish Traveller|travellers]] living within the towns environs.<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/census/census2006results/volume_5/Tables_12_to_22.pdf Census 2006 \u2013 Irish Travellers]</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nClimate data for Letterkenny is recorded at Malin Head in the far northern tip of the county. Malin Head's climate is classified as [[Temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] '''Cfb''') and is significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude; this is due to the stations position near the Atlantic Coast and exposure to the warmth of the [[Gulf Stream]]. Due to its northerly latitude, Malin Head experiences long summer days and short winter days. Summers are cool with temperatures rarely exceeding {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0}}, while winters are relatively mild with daytime temperatures rarely dropping below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0}}. Extreme heat is very rare; however the town can on occasion receive extreme cold from the Arctic where temperatures drop several degrees below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0}}. Snow is relatively uncommon and the station receives on average 20 days of recorded snowfall per year, the vast majority of this occurring between December and March. Humidity is high year round and rainfall is spread quite evenly throughout the year, with winter months receiving the most rainy days; however, Letterkenny can have 4 seasons in one day: rain, snow, sunshine, hail.\n\nIn December 2019, the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) cited Letterkenny as having higher levels of [[air pollution]] than the Indian capital [[New Delhi]].

These include educational and ecclesiastical buildings. The town's tallest building is the [[Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba]], which was completed in 1901. The Cathedral was designed by William Hague from [[County Cavan]]. It is built in a light Victorian neo-Gothic version of the French 13th-century Gothic style. Located opposite the Cathedral, at the junction of Church Street with Cathedral Square, is [[Conwal Parish Church (Church of Ireland)|Conwal Parish Church]], parts of which date from the 17th century.\n\nAnother dominant building in the town is the historic [[St Eunan's College]]. St Eunan's is a three-storey castellated structure, built in the [[Edwardian]] variant of the neo-Hiberno-Romanesque style. It has four turreted [[Irish round tower|round tower]]s and [[flying buttress]]es which are modelled on [[Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba|the nearby Cathedral]].\n\nOther architecturally notable buildings can be found at [[Mount Southwell Terrace]], which is located at the top of the Market Square, just off Castle Street. This [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style terrace of red brick was built in 1837 by Lord Southwell. The terrace contains five of the most distinctive examples of Georgian houses in Letterkenny and also served as the holiday home of [[Maud Gonne]] who stayed here while on holiday in Donegal.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/26318904@N05/2486239621/ Mount Southwell]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on flickr. com (accessed 29 May 2008)</ref> [[St Conal's Hospital]] is a large Victorian neo-Georgian structure located on the [[Kilmacrennan]] Road in the town.

It was built in 1843 in the [[neo-Tudor]] style typical of this kind of building.\n\nIn more recent years, Letterkenny has seen more unusual architectural development. The new [[Letterkenny Town Council]] offices, known locally as \"The Grasshouse\", were designed by Donegal-based [[MacGabhann Architects]]. One of its most notable features is its distinctive sloping grass roof situated above a broad band of aluka matt cladding although it is also noticeable for its runway-like ramp to the first-floor concourse. It is said to be a building of international interest.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222225242/http://ireland.archiseek.com/news/2002/000204.htm \"In the ascendant\"], Archiseek, 4 August 2002 (accessed 29 May 2008)</ref>\n\n==Media and the arts==\nA niece of [[Jane Austen]], daughter of her brother [[Edward Austen Knight|Edward]], is buried in the town alongside her husband [[Lord George Hill]].

St Eunan's are considered one of Donegal's most successful and prolific clubs with major strides made with the clubs underage structure in recent years yielding various County and Ulster championships at underage level, as well as considerable success at senior level since the turn of the century. Letterkenny Gaels were formed in 1996 but have yet to achieve much success and currently play in the Donegal Junior Championship. Almost uniquely in Ireland, Letterkenny Gaels, the GAA club, share facilities with [[Letterkenny RFC|Letterkenny Rugby Club]]. Letterkenny Gaels were promoted in 2019 to division 3 winning 15 games and losing only 1. Gaelic football, like most of County Donegal, is the predominant sport, although soccer is also very popular.\n\n===Rugby football===\nRugby football is also popular in the town, being played at various levels, from school to senior league level. [[Letterkenny RFC]], which was founded in 1973, is the major rugby club in the town. It has recently forged links with [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] rugby fraternities due to the fact that [[Dave Gallaher]], the first captain of the All Blacks, was born in [[Ramelton]], a village eight miles (13&nbsp;km) from Letterkenny. The club's rugby ground in Letterkenny was named The Dave Gallaher Memorial Park in his honour in November 2005 by a visiting contingent of All Black players, led by captain [[Tana Umaga]].\n\n===Other sports===\nLetterkenny has two men's basketball teams, Letterkenny Heat and Letterkenny IT, as well as a junior basketball club, Letterkenny Blaze.<ref>[http://www.blazebasketball.ie Letterkenny Blaze Basketball Club]. Blazebasketball.ie. Retrieved on 23 July 2013.</ref> [[Letterkenny Golf Club]] is located just outside the town centre. There are also pitch and putt and tennis facilities in the town. [[Letterkenny Regional Sports and Leisure Complex|Letterkenny Sports Complex]], a state of the art leisure centre complete with skate park, is located on the edge of the town. [[Letterkenny Athletic Club]] is also located in the town. The town also hosts the [[Donegal International Rally]] on the third weekend of June every year and the [[Donegal Harvest Rally]] every October. There is a campaign being run by a local councillor for the construction of a horse racing track and facilities on land at the Big Isle, on the outskirts of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.build.ie/construction_news.asp?newsid=71334|title=Build.com Smarter Home Improvement - Plumbing, Lighting, HVAC, Door Hardware & More|work=build.ie|access-date=10 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185358/http://www.build.ie/construction_news.asp?newsid=71334|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 the Donegal Marathon was relaunched in the town after a 30 year absence.<ref>{{cite news |title=Marathon returns to Donegal in August |work=Donegal News |date=16 May 2014 |page=79 |quote=For the first time since 1983 there will be a Donegal Marathon on Sunday, August 24 [..]}}</ref> More than 800 participated in the 2014 race which was won by Benny Mullan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Harry |last=Walsh |title=Almost 900 run or walk |work=Donegal News |date=25 August 2014 |pages=1\u20132, 34\u201335}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n===Air===\nThe nearest airport is [[City of Derry Airport]], which is located about {{convert|48|km|mi}} to the east at [[Eglinton, County Londonderry|Eglinton]]. [[Donegal Airport]] (locally known as Carrickfinn Airport) is less than an hour away, located to the west in [[The Rosses]].\n\n[[File:Map Rail Ireland Viceregal Commission 1906.jpg|thumb|250px|right|1906 Irish Rail Infrastructure (including Letterkenny station)]]\n\nLetterkenny has a small privately operated airfield situated on the outskirts of the town which is operational; it has both hard and grass of 620 meters, hangars available for overnight guests, ICAO EILT. There is also a small private airfield at Finn Valley approx 8 miles away. It is run and operated by the Finn valley Flying Club. The airstrip is 700 metres of grass; it is mainly for use by ultralights and light aircraft. The airfield is home to quite a few ultralights, and the Flying Club run a big open weekend each August where many planes fly in to attend it. The airfield is only suitable for small private aircraft and ultralights, and there is no commercial traffic whatsoever there; it is occasionally used by businessmen to land their small aircraft, at and it is approximately 8 miles from the town.\n\n===Rail===\n{{see also|History of rail transport in Ireland|l1=History of Irish railways}}\nThe town was, in times past, connected with the once extensive narrow gauge rail network of County Donegal. This provided connections to Derry (and through there to Dublin and Belfast), to Lifford and Strabane, to [[Gweedore]] and Burtonport, and to [[Carndonagh]], north of Derry. The rail system was built in the late 19th century, with the last extensions opening in the 20th century. Some of these lines were never profitable, built using [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|then UK]] government subsidies. Only a couple of decades later, the independence of the [[Irish Free State]] from the rest of the UK resulted in rail companies operating across two jurisdictions where there had previously been one. This had devastating effects on an already fragile economic situation, resulting eventually in the final closure of all parts of the rail system in the area by December 1959.\n\nToday, the closest railway station to County Donegal is [[Londonderry railway station]] in the nearby City of [[Derry]]. This station is owned and run by [[Northern Ireland Railways]] (N.I.R.) and runs via [[Coleraine]] to [[Belfast Central railway station]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station]]. The strategically important [[Belfast-Derry railway line]] is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way such as track and signalling to enable faster services.

[[Bus \u00c9ireann]] operates multiple daily services from [[Letterkenny bus station|its bus depot]] to Ireland's larger urban areas like [[Dublin]] (number 32), [[Derry]] and [[Galway]] (both number 64). Private coach companies operate daily services to and from town. The [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway|Lough Swilly Bus Company]] (popularly known locally as ''Lough Swilly'' or ''the Swilly Bus'') operated a local transport service until they ceased trading in April 2014. Bus \u00c9ireann is now the main bus service provider in the town. Currently, access from Dublin is improving with motorway status roads being constructed along the route, allowing cars to complete the Dublin-Letterkenny journey in about 3 hours and 30 minutes. Galway, to the south, is 4 hours away by car, while [[Belfast]], to the south-east, is 2 hours away by car.\n\nPrivate companies provide daily bus services to [[Belfast]]. Letterkenny has no [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border|cross-border]] service linking it directly to Belfast.\n\nTaxi services are available from a rank on the Main St. at the Market Square.\n\nTwo [[national primary road]]s serve the town: the [[N13 road (Ireland)|N13]] from the South ([[Stranorlar]]) and the [[N14 road (Ireland)|N14]] from the East ([[Lifford]]). The N13 also links into the [[A2 road (Northern Ireland)]] to [[Derry]]. The [[N56 road (Ireland)|N56]] [[national secondary road|secondary road]], beginning at the N14 in the town, travels in a loop around the county, ending in [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]] town.

Letterkenny acts as an urban gateway to the Ulster ''[[Gaeltacht]]'', similar to [[Galway]]'s relationship to the [[Connemara]] ''Gaeltacht''.\n\nLetterkenny began as a [[market town]] at the start of the 17th century, during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. A castle once stood near where the [[Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba]], County Donegal's only [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral, stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. County Donegal's premier third-level institution, the [[Letterkenny Institute of Technology]] (LYIT), is located in the town, as are [[St Eunan's College]], [[Highland Radio]], and a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple.<ref name=first_hindu_temple/> Letterkenny was also the original home of [[Oatfield (confectioner)|Oatfield]] Sweet Factory, a confectionery manufacturer; the factory closed and was demolished in 2014.<ref>http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/sweet-sorrow-as-iconic-factory-is-torn-down-30216692.html</ref> In 1798, [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]] was arrested at Laird's Hotel in the town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=William Tone, 1827|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> In 2015, Letterkenny was judged the tidiest town in Ireland.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/news/environment/tidy-towns-lovely-letterkenny-scoops-national-top-spot-1.2369724</ref>\n\nMembers of the family of [[Jane Austen]] lived and are buried in the town, while Letterkenny also has ancestral links to the future British kings [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William V]] and [[Prince George of Cambridge|George VII]] (second and third [[Succession to the British throne|in line]] to the throne, respectively).<ref name=di/><ref name=novel_approach/>\n\n==Etymology==\nLetterkenny takes its name from the Irish ''Leitirceanainn'', meaning \"Hillside of the O'Cannons\" \u2013 the O'Cannons being the last of the ancient chieftains of [[T\u00edr Conaill]]. However, no evidence of forts or castles belonging to the O'Cannon clan exists in or around the Letterkenny district. Therefore, a speculative derivation of Letterkenny may be 'Leitir Ceann-Fhoinn', meaning 'Fairheaded Hillside').\n\nThe O'Cannon dynasty are allegedly descended from [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]] and [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]], two of Ireland's most famous Kings. The O'Cannons have been described as 'Ancient Princes of T\u00edr Connaill' and 'Valiant Chiefs'. However, their 350-year dynasty in T\u00edr Connaill ended in 1250. Their ancient territory would seem to have been T\u00edr Aeda (now the [[Baronies of Ireland|barony]] of Tirhugh) in what is now South Donegal.[[File:Riverswilly.JPG|260px|thumbnail|left|The mouth of the [[River Swilly]] at [[Lough Swilly]] in Letterkenny.]] After the deaths of Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Canannain (Rory O'Cannon) and his son Niall \u00d3 Canannain in 1250, the [[sept]] declined greatly in power. Brian \u00d3 N\u00e9ill (Brian O'Neill) died ten years later in 1260; he had supported an \u00d3 Canannain claimant to T\u00edr Conaill, i.e. to the Kingdom of T\u00edr Conaill (Tirconnell). However, the O'Cannon Clan remained subserviant to the [[O'Donnell Clan]], the Kings of T\u00edr Chonaill from the early thirteenth century onwards. The personal name Canannain is a diminutive of Cano meaning 'wolf cub'. Canannain was fifth in descent from [[Flaithbertach mac Loingsig]] (died [[765 in Ireland|765]]), [[high-king]] of Ireland; they were the descendants of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]] (Irish: Niall Noigiallach), who died c. [[405 in Ireland|405]] A.D., by his son [[Conall Gulban]], who gave his name to [[T\u00edr Conaill]], the 'Land of Conall', now County Donegal.\n\nBy the early 17th century, the name U\u00ed Canannain had been [[anglicised]] to O'Cannon. Further anglicisation took place during the [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the name in Co. Dun na nGall became Cannon. In the early 1880s, there were just 200 families bearing the Cannon surname living in Co. Donegal, who were mainly tenant farmers. The Cannons/O'Canannains were of the ancient sept of Cenell Conaill, a branch of the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and descend from Ruaidr\u00ed ua Canannain (died 30 November [[950 in Ireland|950]]), King of Cenel Conaill, and grandson of Canannain, who flourished in the second half of the 9th century. The site of the ancient seat of the \u00d3 Canannain was near Letterkenny (the largest town of County Donegal only since the 1950s), which is said on good authority (?) to represent the countryside of the O'Cannons (English translation).\n\n==History==\n{{further|Battle of Farsetmore|Battle of Scarrifholis}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| image1    = Letterkenny Main Street 1900.jpg\n| width1    = 200\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Market-square-lk.jpg\n| width2    = 200\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Above: The Market Square district c.1900; <br />\nBelow: The Market Square district c.2007\n}}\nThe modern town of Letterkenny began as a [[market town]] at the start of the 17th century, during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. It may have been established on the site of an earlier [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] settlement. It was the first crossing point of the [[River Swilly]]. In the recent past, Letterkenny was a largely agricultural town, surrounded by extensive cattle and sheep grazing on what was then untilled hillside \u2013 at a time when Conwal (3&nbsp;km west of Letterkenny) was the ecclesiastical and seaport centre. The waters of the Atlantic had not yet retreated from the basin of the Swilly, whose estuary at that time extended up almost as far as New Mills \u2013 proof of this may be found in those alluvial flat-lands between [[Oldtown, Letterkenny|Oldtown]] and Port Road.\n\nRory O'Cannon, the last chieftain of the O'Cannon Clan, was killed in 1248. Godfrey O'Donnell succeeded Rory O'Cannon as King of [[T\u00edr Conaill]]. He engaged the Norman lord [[Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly]], in battle at [[Battle of Creadran Cille|Credan]] in the north of what is now [[County Sligo]] in 1257 in which both were badly wounded \u2013 Fitzgerald immediately fatally so. Godfrey (also dying from his wounds) retired to a crann\u00f3g in Lough Beag (Gartan Lake). [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill|O'Neill]] of [[T\u00edr Eoghain]] \u2014 taking advantage of Godfrey's fatal illness \u2014 demanded submission, hostages and pledges from the [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]] since they had no strong chieftain since the wounding of Godfrey. Godfrey summoned his forces and led them himself, although he had to be carried on a litter (stretcher). O'Neill and his men were completely defeated by the Swilly in 1258. Godfrey died however after the battle near where the town of Letterkenny is today. He was buried in Conwal Cemetery. A cross-shaped coffin slab marks his grave to this day.\n\nThe receding of the waters of the Atlantic eastwards enabled progress, and with the building of bridges etc., the town of Letterkenny started to take the shape it has today. In the wake of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] (which began around 1609), when a {{convert|4|km2|acre}} area was granted to a [[Scotsman]] Patrick Crawford, the compact community formed.\n\nThe honour of formally launching the town fell to [[George Marbury|Sir George Marbury]] who married Patrick Crawford's widow \u2014 Crawford having died suddenly while on a return visit to his native Scotland. Initially there were possibly fifty simple habitations sited where [[Oldtown, Letterkenny|the Oldtown]] is situated today.\n\nMarbury's wife, Johanna, was an ancestor (from an earlier marriage) of the future British kings [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William V]] and [[Prince George of Cambridge|George VII]] (second and third [[Succession to the British throne|in line]] to the throne, respectively).<ref name=di>{{cite web|url=https://www.letterkennyhistory.com/diana-princess-of-wales-letterkenny/|title=Diana, Princess of Wales & Letterkenny|date=9 October 2018|accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe main streets, though now suffering traffic congestion, were simple pony tracks used by the hill farmers to come to the markets. The markets \u2014 started by Patrick Crawford with only a few animals \u2014 grew into much busier mart which are not present today.\n\n[[File:Market Square, Letterkenny (8611952691).jpg|thumb|Traffic in Market Square in 1928.]]\n\nAn ancient castle once stood near where the [[Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba]] stands today. Letterkenny Castle, built in 1625, was located south of Mt Southwell on Castle Street. Outlaw [[Redmond O'Hanlon (outlaw)|Redmond O' Hanlon]] found refuge there in 1690. No remains of the castle exist today.<ref>Donegal News \u2013 18 April 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], on 12 October, a large French force consisting of 3,000 men, and including [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]], attempted to land in [[County Donegal]] near Lough Swilly. They were intercepted by a large British [[Royal Navy]] force, and finally surrendered after a three-hour battle without ever landing in Ireland. After [[Theobald Wolfe Tone|Wolfe Tone]] was captured he was held for a short time at Laird's Hotel (opposite the Market Square) in the Main Street of Letterkenny<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aohdiv1.org/wolftone.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222165151/http://aohdiv1.org/wolftone.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 December 2007 |title=Wolf Tone Captured in Letterkenny |work=aohdiv1.org }}</ref> before being transferred to the nearby [[Derry Gaol]].

He committed suicide in prison. \n[[File:Wolfe_Tone_sign_Letterkenny.jpg|thumb|Sign erected to commemorate Tone's arrest in the town]]\nIn 1824, when the first description of Letterkenny as a modern town was written, it was stated that: ''\"Within half a mile is the Port of [[Ballyraine]], whither vessels of 100 tons bring iron, salt and colonial produce and whence they export hides and butter\"''. Nothing remains now except the warehouses with the example of 19th century warehouse architecture.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927141716/http://www.directorytourism.com/Tourism-By-Region/destination-letterkenny-tourism-l741.html?language=Spanish Only Warehouse Architecture remains]</ref>\n\nLetterkenny achieved town status in the early 1920s following the [[partition of Ireland]]. When the [[Irish pound|Irish punt]] replaced the British [[pound sterling]] in County Donegal in 1928, many Irish banks that had been previously located in [[Derry]] (in the new [[Northern Ireland]]) opened branches in Letterkenny.\n\nLetterkenny made history in August 2012 when two winning [[National Lottery (Ireland)|Lotto]] tickets using the same numbers for the same draw were bought at two different locations in the town \u2013 Mac's Mace on the High Road and The Paper Post on Main Street.

Despite having a long tradition of emigration that continued until the early 1990s, Letterkenny has recently had net immigration. The recent immigrants are mostly of foreign origin, with many immigrants from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. This is reflected in the recent growth of immigrant restaurants and shops, including Chinese and Indian restaurants, as well as specialised shops run by and providing goods for Africans, Asians, South Americans, and Eastern Europeans.

Malin Head's climate is classified as [[Temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] '''Cfb''') and is significantly milder than some other locations in the world at a similar latitude; this is due to the stations position near the Atlantic Coast and exposure to the warmth of the [[Gulf Stream]]. Due to its northerly latitude, Malin Head experiences long summer days and short winter days. Summers are cool with temperatures rarely exceeding {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0}}, while winters are relatively mild with daytime temperatures rarely dropping below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0}}. Extreme heat is very rare; however the town can on occasion receive extreme cold from the Arctic where temperatures drop several degrees below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0}}. Snow is relatively uncommon and the station receives on average 20 days of recorded snowfall per year, the vast majority of this occurring between December and March. Humidity is high year round and rainfall is spread quite evenly throughout the year, with winter months receiving the most rainy days; however, Letterkenny can have 4 seasons in one day: rain, snow, sunshine, hail.\n\nIn December 2019, the [[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) cited Letterkenny as having higher levels of [[air pollution]] than the Indian capital [[New Delhi]].

These include educational and ecclesiastical buildings. The town's tallest building is the [[Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba]], which was completed in 1901. The Cathedral was designed by William Hague from [[County Cavan]]. It is built in a light Victorian neo-Gothic version of the French 13th-century Gothic style.

Another local paper is ''[[Derry People/Donegal News|The Derry People Donegal News]]'' (popularly known locally as ''The Derry People''). It is distributed on a Friday, as well as having a Monday edition.

St Eunan's are considered one of Donegal's most successful and prolific clubs with major strides made with the clubs underage structure in recent years yielding various County and Ulster championships at underage level, as well as considerable success at senior level since the turn of the century. Letterkenny Gaels were formed in 1996 but have yet to achieve much success and currently play in the Donegal Junior Championship. Almost uniquely in Ireland, Letterkenny Gaels, the GAA club, share facilities with [[Letterkenny RFC|Letterkenny Rugby Club]].

[[Letterkenny RFC]], which was founded in 1973, is the major rugby club in the town. It has recently forged links with [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] rugby fraternities due to the fact that [[Dave Gallaher]], the first captain of the All Blacks, was born in [[Ramelton]], a village eight miles (13&nbsp;km) from Letterkenny.

There is also a small private airfield at Finn Valley approx 8 miles away. It is run and operated by the Finn valley Flying Club. The airstrip is 700 metres of grass; it is mainly for use by ultralights and light aircraft. The airfield is home to quite a few ultralights, and the Flying Club run a big open weekend each August where many planes fly in to attend it. The airfield is only suitable for small private aircraft and ultralights, and there is no commercial traffic whatsoever there; it is occasionally used by businessmen to land their small aircraft, at and it is approximately 8 miles from the town.\n\n===Rail===\n{{see also|History of rail transport in Ireland|l1=History of Irish railways}}\nThe town was, in times past, connected with the once extensive narrow gauge rail network of County Donegal. This provided connections to Derry (and through there to Dublin and Belfast), to Lifford and Strabane, to [[Gweedore]] and Burtonport, and to [[Carndonagh]], north of Derry. The rail system was built in the late 19th century, with the last extensions opening in the 20th century. Some of these lines were never profitable, built using [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|then UK]] government subsidies. Only a couple of decades later, the independence of the [[Irish Free State]] from the rest of the UK resulted in rail companies operating across two jurisdictions where there had previously been one. This had devastating effects on an already fragile economic situation, resulting eventually in the final closure of all parts of the rail system in the area by December 1959.\n\nToday, the closest railway station to County Donegal is [[Londonderry railway station]] in the nearby City of [[Derry]]. This station is owned and run by [[Northern Ireland Railways]] (N.I.R.) and runs via [[Coleraine]] to [[Belfast Central railway station]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station]]. The strategically important [[Belfast-Derry railway line]] is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way such as track and signalling to enable faster services.

Bus \u00c9ireann is now the main bus service provider in the town. Currently, access from Dublin is improving with motorway status roads being constructed along the route, allowing cars to complete the Dublin-Letterkenny journey in about 3 hours and 30 minutes. Galway, to the south, is 4 hours away by car, while [[Belfast]], to the south-east, is 2 hours away by car.\n\nPrivate companies provide daily bus services to [[Belfast]].
