It was released in 1992 and ran on [[IBM PC compatible|PC-compatible]] computer systems based on the [[32-bit]] [[Intel 80386]] [[microprocessor]]. 386BSD innovations included [[role-based security]], [[ring buffer]]s, self-ordered configuration and [[Loadable kernel module|modular kernel]] design.\n\n== History ==\n386BSD was written mainly by Berkeley alumni [[Lynne Jolitz]] and [[William Jolitz]]. William Jolitz had considerable experience with prior BSD releases while at the University of California at Berkeley (2.8 and 2.9BSD) and both contributed code developed at [[Symmetric Computer Systems]] during the 1980s, to Berkeley. Work on porting 4.3BSD-Reno and later 4.3BSD&nbsp;Net/2 to the Intel 80386 was done for the University of California by William Jolitz at Berkeley. 4.3BSD Net/2 was an incomplete non-operational release, with portions withheld by the University of California as ''encumbered'' (i.e. subject to an [[AT&T UNIX]] [[source code]] license). The 386BSD releases made to the public beginning in 1992 were based on portions of the 4.3BSD&nbsp;Net/2 release coupled with additional code (see \"Missing Pieces I and II\", ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', May\u2013June 1992) written by William and Lynne Jolitz to make a complete operational release.\n\nThe port began in 1989 and the first, incomplete traces of the port can be found in 4.3BSD&nbsp;Net/2 of 1991. The port was made possible as [[Keith Bostic]], partly influenced by [[Richard Stallman]], had started to remove proprietary AT&T out of BSD in 1988.<ref>Eric S. Raymond. 2003.

History.</ref> The port was first released in March 1992 (version 0.0<ref name=\"0.0-release\" />) and in a much more usable version on July 14, 1992 (version 0.1<ref name=\"0.1-release\">{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.unix.bsd/zA8Jl89HSRo/DqMzaUUZ7wYJ|title=386BSD 0.1 Release Notes}}</ref>). The porting process with code was extensively documented in an 18-part series written by Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'' beginning in January 1991.\n\n=== FreeBSD and NetBSD ===\nAfter the release of 386BSD 0.1,<ref name=\"0.1-release\" /> a group of users began collecting bug fixes and enhancements, releasing them as an unofficial ''[[patch (computing)|patchkit]]''. Due to differences of opinion between the Jolitzes and the patchkit maintainers over the future direction and release schedule of 386BSD,<ref name=\"386bsd-faq\"/> the maintainers of the patchkit founded the [[FreeBSD]] project in 1993 to continue their work.<ref name=\"Auto7E-1\"/> Around the same time, the [[NetBSD]] project was founded by a different group of 386BSD users, with the aim of unifying 386BSD with other strands of BSD development into one multi-platform system. Both projects continue to this day.\n\n=== Lawsuit ===\nDue to a lawsuit ([[UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.]]), some potentially so-called ''encumbered'' source was agreed to have been distributed within the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] Net/2 from the University of California, and a subsequent release (1993, 4.4BSD-Lite) was made by the University to correct this issue. However, 386BSD, ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', and William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California, and continued to publish and work on the 386BSD code base before, during, and after these lawsuits without limitation. There has never been any legal filings or claims from the University, USL, or other responsible parties with respect to 386BSD. Finally, no code developed for 386BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits.\n\n== Release 1.0 ==\nIn late 1994, a finished version 386BSD Release 1.0 was distributed by ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'' on CDROM only due to the immense size (600 [[megabyte|MB]]) of the release (the ''\"386BSD Reference CD-ROM\"'') and was a best-selling CDROM for three years (1994\u20131997). 386BSD Release 1.0 contained a completely new kernel design and implementation, and began the process to incorporate recommendations made by earlier Berkeley designers that had never been attempted in BSD.\n\n== Release 2.0 ==\nOn August 5, 2016 an update was pushed to the 386BSD [[GitHub|github]] by developer Ben Jolitz, named version 2.0.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bsd.slashdot.org/story/16/10/09/0230203/after-22-years-386bsd-gets-an-update|title=After 22 Years, 386BSD Gets An Update - Slashdot|website=bsd.slashdot.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/386bsd/386bsd|title=386bsd/386bsd|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2017-03-14}}</ref> Release 2.0 built upon the modular framework to create self-healing components. However, {{as of|2017|March|16|lc=y|df=US}}, almost all of the documentation remains the same as version 1.0, and a change log was not available.\n\n== Relationship with BSD/386 ==\n386BSD is often confused with [[BSD/386]] which was a different project developed by [[Berkeley Software Design|BSDi]], a Berkeley [[Corporate spin-off|spinout]], starting in 1991. BSD/386 used the same 386BSD code contributed to the University of California on ''4.3BSD NET/2''. Although Jolitz worked briefly for [[UUNET]] (which later spun out BSDi) in 1991, the work he did for them diverged from that contributed to the University of California and did not appear in 386BSD. Instead, William Jolitz gave regular code updates to Donn Seeley of BSDi for packaging and testing, and returned all materials when William Jolitz left that company following fundamental disagreements on company direction and goals.\n\n== Copyright and use of the code ==\nAll rights with respect to 386BSD and JOLIX are now held exclusively by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz.{{dubious|Ownership|date=February 2014}} 386BSD public releases ended in 1997 since code is now available from the many 386BSD-derived [[operating system]]s today, along with several derivatives thereof (such as [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]]).

Portions of 386BSD may be found in other open systems such as [[OpenSolaris]].\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Jolitz, William F. and Jolitz, Lynne Greer: Porting UNIX to the 386: A Practical Approach, 17-part series in ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'', January 1991 \u2013 July 1992:<ref name=\"DDJ-386BSD\">{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/comp.unix.bsd/uXJjzT4g7qI/mLMsO0hJsV4J|title=DDJ articles for 386BSD}}</ref><ref name=\"full_articles-DDJ-386BSD\">{{cite web|url=https://www.386bsd.org/releases|title=Porting Unix to the 386}}</ref>\n\n Jan/1991: DDJ \"Designing a Software Specification\"\n Feb/1991: DDJ \"Three Initial PC Utilities\"\n Mar/1991: DDJ \"The Standalone System\"\n Apr/1991: DDJ \"Language Tools Cross-Support\"\n May/1991: DDJ \"The Initial Root Filesystem\"\n Jun/1991: DDJ \"Research and the Commercial Sector: Where Does BSD Fit In?\"\n Jul/1991: DDJ \"A Stripped-Down Kernel\"\n Aug/1991: DDJ \"The Basic Kernel\"\n Sep/1991: DDJ \"Multiprogramming and Multiprocessing, Part I\"\n Oct/1991: DDJ \"Multiprogramming and Multiprocessing, Part II\"\n Nov/1991: DDJ \"Device Autoconfiguration\"\n Feb/1992: DDJ \"UNIX Device Drivers, Part I\"\n Mar/1992: DDJ \"UNIX Device Drivers, Part II\"\n Apr/1992: DDJ \"UNIX Device Drivers, Part III\"\n May/1992: DDJ \"Missing Pieces, Part I\"\n Jun/1992: DDJ \"Missing Pieces, Part II\"\n Jul/1992: DDJ \"The Final Step: Running Light with 386BSD\"\n\n* Jolitz, William F. and Jolitz, Lynne Greer: Operating System Source Code Secrets Vol 1 The Basic Kernel, 1996, {{ISBN|1-57398-026-9}}\n* Jolitz, William F. and Jolitz, Lynne Greer: Operating System Source Code Secrets Vol 2 Virtual Memory, 2000, {{ISBN|1-57398-027-7}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"foldoc\">{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/jolix|title=386BSD|date=2006-06-08|work=[[Free On-line Dictionary of Computing]]|accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"386bsd-faq\">{{cite web|url=http://www.386bsd.org/faq|title=386BSD FAQ|date=2006\u20132011|work=William Jolitz, Lynne Jolitz|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Auto7E-1\">[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/history.html About the FreeBSD Project<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|www.386bsd.org}}\n* [https://386bsd.github.io William Jolitz's 386bsd Notebook]\n* [http://www.jolix.com Jolix.com]\n* [http://porting-unix-to-the-386.jolix.com/ Porting UNIX to the 386: A Practical Approach]\n* [http://jolitz.telemuse.net/2lgj/on386bsd Memories of 386BSD releases by Lynne Jolitz]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060214060915/http://archive.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/05/17/386bsd/index.html The unknown hackers - Salon.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050305151340/http://minutepitch.valux.com/386bsddesign 386BSD Design Notes Professional Video Series]\n* [http://www.386bsd.org/faq Frequently asked questions of 386BSD - active Q/A by authors]\n* {{Cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bsdi/bsdisuit.html |title=Remarks and papers on USL v UC Berkeley by Dennis M.
