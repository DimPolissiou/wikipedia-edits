The Tigers played their home games at [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and competed in the West Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by second-year head coach [[Ed Orgeron]].\n\nThe Tigers, coming off a 9\u20134 season in [[2017 LSU Tigers football team|Orgeron's first full season]], began the year ranked 25th in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. In the first game of the year, the team defeated No. 8 [[2018 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]] in the [[Advocare Classic]] played at [[AT&T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]]. LSU won its next four games, including on the road against then-No. 7 [[2018 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and rose to fifth in the AP Poll, before falling on the road to [[2018 Florida Gators football team|Florida]]. The team rebounded with wins over No. 2 [[2018 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] and No. 22 [[2018 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]] before being shutout by eventual SEC champions [[2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. In the last game of the regular season, LSU lost on the road against [[2018 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] in an FBS record-tying [[2018 LSU vs. Texas A&M football game|seven overtimes]]. The final score of the game, 74\u201372, set the FBS record for combined points in a single game (146). The team finished the regular season tied for second in the SEC's West Division and was invited to the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (January)|Fiesta Bowl]] to play [[2018 UCF Knights football team|UCF]], which the Tigers won by a score of 40\u201332 to end UCF's active win streak of 25 games. LSU finished the season with an overall record of 10\u20133 and was ranked 6th in the final AP Poll.\n\nThe team's defense featured three [[2018 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-Americans]] in defensive backs [[Grant Delpit]] and [[Greedy Williams]], and linebacker [[Devin White]], who was awarded the [[Dick Butkus Award]] as the nation's best linebacker. On offense, the Tigers were led by redshirt junior quarterback [[Joe Burrow]], who finished with 2,894 passing yards and 23 total touchdowns (16 passing and 7 rushing). Senior running back Nick Brossette led the team in rushing with 1,039 yards and 14 touchdowns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/louisiana-state/2018.html|title=2018 LSU Tigers Stats|website=Sports-Reference.com|access-date=June 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Previous season==\nThe Tigers finished the [[2017 LSU Tigers football team|2017 season]] 9\u20134, 6\u20132 in SEC play to finish in third place in the Western Division.

In the first game of the year, the team defeated No. 8 [[2018 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami (FL)]] in the [[Advocare Classic]] played at [[AT&T Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]]. LSU won its next four games, including on the road against then-No. 7 [[2018 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]], and rose to fifth in the AP Poll, before falling on the road to [[2018 Florida Gators football team|Florida]].

LSU finished the season with an overall record of 10\u20133 and was ranked 6th in the final AP Poll.\n\nThe team's defense featured three [[2018 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-Americans]] in defensive backs [[Grant Delpit]] and [[Greedy Williams]], and linebacker [[Devin White]], who was awarded the [[Dick Butkus Award]] as the nation's best linebacker. On offense, the Tigers were led by redshirt junior quarterback [[Joe Burrow]], who finished with 2,894 passing yards and 23 total touchdowns (16 passing and 7 rushing).

The legislation was subsequently amended in 1957 to give the institution its current name.<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" />  The university moved to its current campus in 1959,<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" /> expanding rapidly throughout the 1960s amid broader efforts by the provincial government to increase support to post-secondary institutions and enhance access to higher education.\n\nThe university is named for the now-dissolved [[Carleton County, Ontario|Carleton County]], which included the city of Ottawa at the time the university was founded. Carleton County, in turn, was named in honour of [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester]], who served as [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] of [[The Canadas]] from 1786 to 1796.\n\nCarleton, which has more than 159,000 alumni worldwide, is reputed for its strength in many disciplines including the [[humanities]], [[international business]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[computer science]], [[international relations|international affairs]], journalism, [[political science]], [[political management]], [[public policy]] and [[public administration|administration]], and [[legal studies]]. Carleton has produced 6 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 29 [[Royal Society of Canada|Royal Society Fellows]], 20 recipients of the [[Order of Canada]], 8 Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship awardees, and 3 National Killam Award recipients.\n\nAs of 2019, Carleton has an enrolment of more than 27,000 undergraduate and more than 4,000 graduate students. Its campus is located west of [[Old Ottawa South]], in close proximity to [[The Glebe]] and [[Confederation Heights]], and is bounded to the north by the [[Rideau Canal]] and [[Dow's Lake]] and to the south by the [[Rideau River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldottawasouth.ca/index.php/oos|last=Gall|first=Gwendolyn|title=About Old Ottawa South|publisher=Old Ottawa South Community Association|accessdate=27 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314230515/http://www.oldottawasouth.ca/index.php/oos|archive-date=14 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCarleton competes in the [[U Sports]] league as the [[Carleton Ravens]]. The Carleton Ravens are recognized for the strong performance of its men's basketball team, which has won seven consecutive Canadian national championships between 2006 and 2017, in addition to 14 of the 16 championships since 2003.\n\n==History==\n<blockquote>I learned very early the life lesson that it is people, not buildings, that make up an institution.

While the outbreak of the Second World War disrupted the committee's activities, a new committee, under the leadership of Henry Marshall Tory, was reorganized into the Ottawa Association for the Advancement of Learning through a meeting held in December 1941, which was formalized in June 1942.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/2 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nEstablished in 1942 as Carleton College, a non-denominational institution, the school began offering evening courses in rented classrooms at the High School of Commerce, now part of the [[Glebe Collegiate Institute]]. Classes offered during the first academic year included [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[history]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[biology]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/8 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> With the end of the war in 1945, and return of veterans from the frontlines, the College experienced an unexpected upsurge in student enrolment during the 1945\u201346 academic year, totalling approximately 2,200 students. To accommodate the increased number of students, the school rented facilities in various locations through the city, including classrooms at the [[Lisgar Collegiate Institute]], [[Ottawa Technical High School]], and the basements of several local churches.  Higher enrolment also gave way to an expansion of the College's academic offerings with the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Science encompassing coursework in [[Carleton School of Journalism|journalism]] and first-year engineering.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp164/page/4|title=Carleton College: Fifth Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, the College gained possession of its first property, situated at the corner of Lyon Street and First Avenue in [[The Glebe]] neighbourhood. The four-story building was the former location of the [[Ottawa Ladies' College]], which was purchased during the Second World War for use as [[barracks]] for the Canadian Women's Army Corps.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp165/page/4|title=Carleton College: Fifth Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> Its first degrees were conferred in 1946 to graduates of its Journalism and Public Administration programs.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/carleton-university|title=Carleton University|author1=J.

Student fees during the school's first academic year from 1942-43 were about $10.00 per course for first-year students, equivalent to $153.71 as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/12 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> Fundraising efforts spearheaded by the College's President, Henry Marshall Tory, sought to raise $1 million for the institution from donors throughout the Ottawa area, with half of the proceeds going towards the debt incurred by the purchase of the new building, and the other to endow the College.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp167/page/7 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> The faculty was composed largely of part-time professors who worked full-time in the [[Civil service|public service]], some of whom were convinced to leave government for full-time tenure positions. However, full-time teaching staff were still mostly young scholars at the beginning of their careers.\n\nIn 1950, Carleton began the process of developing a crest and motto, as was tradition with other institutions of higher learning. James Gibson, chair of the Committee on Symbols and Ceremonials, initially proposed a Latin motto, \"''Opera nobis aeterna''\" derived from the [[Walt Whitman]] poem [[Pioneers! O Pioneers!]],<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" /> a translation of the phrase \"We take up the task eternal\". The Board of Governors rejected the Latin motto as it was perceived as too pretentious for an institution focused on egalitarianism, leading to Carleton's current motto, \"Ours the task eternal\".  In October 1951, the Board of Governors formally adopted the new crest and motto.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Carleton, 1951-52 |url=https://archive.org/details/thecarleton07carl/page/4 |website=Internet Archive |publisher=Carleton University |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the ''Carleton College Act'' was passed by the [[Ontario Legislature]], changing the school's corporate name to Carleton College and conferring upon it the power to grant university degrees. Carleton thus became the province's first private, [[non-sectarian]] college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/futuree.html#appendixB |title=Excellence Accessibility Responsibility > Ministry of Education |publisher=Edu.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>  The governance was modelled on the provincial ''University of Toronto Act'' of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a Faculty Senate, responsible for academic policy, and a Board of Governors composed of \nlocal community members, exercising exclusive control over the institution's finances and formal authority over all other matters. The President, appointed by the Board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university|title=Universities in Canada (Canadian Universities)|author=P.

In October 1956, the beginning of construction at the Rideau River campus was celebrated with a ceremonial sod-turning by [[Dana Porter]], then [[Treasurer of Ontario]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp391/page/12|title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1956-57|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Carleton University (1957\u2013present)===\n\nIn 1957, the ''Carleton University Act'' was enacted<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://carleton.ca/about/history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=15 March 2019}}</ref> as an amendment to the ''Carleton College Act'', granting Carleton nominal status as a [[public university]] and resulting in its current name, Carleton University.<ref name=\"Carleton Act\">{{cite web | title = Carleton University Act | publisher=University Secretariat| accessdate = 5 November 2011 | url = https://carleton.ca/secretariat/carleton-university-act/}}</ref> This did not result in substantive changes to the school's governance and academic organization as it had already been granted university powers through the preceding legislation.\n\n====Rapid development and growth (1960\u201369)====\n[[File:CarletonCampus RiverView 1965.png|thumb|right|Carleton campus viewed from the [[Rideau River]], 1965]]\nThe completion of initial construction at the Rideau River campus in 1959 saw the University move to its current location at the beginning of the 1959\u201360 academic year. Completed at a cost of $6.5 million, the first three buildings, the Maxwell MacOdrum Library, Norman Paterson Hall and the Henry Marshall Tory Building became the centre for academic life at the institution, with Paterson Hall and Tory Building respectively serving the arts and sciences disciplines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp394/page/4 |title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1959-60 |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> The1960s saw meteoric growth in student enrolment, with the number of full-time students ballooning from 857 to 7,139 within the decade,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp404/page/n1 |title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1960-61 |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> dovetailing with a sharp uptick in financial support from the provincial and federal governments towards post-secondary institutions. An increasing share of these students came to the school from outside the [[National Capital Region]], prompting the University to open its first purpose-built residence halls, Lanark and Renfrew Houses in the fall of 1962. The residences were initially segregated by sex, with Lanark House reserved for male students and Renfrew for females; Carleton discarded the practice of mandatory sex segregation in 1969 in favour of co-educational housing, becoming the first university in North America to adopt this practice.  By the end of the decade, the increased need for space to accommodate the growing faculty and student body saw the completion of several major academic buildings, including the Loeb Building in 1967 and the Mackenzie Building in 1968.\n\nIn 1967, a Catholic post-secondary institution, Saint Patrick's College became affiliated with Carleton. Founded in 1929, it had been granting its diplomas through the [[University of Ottawa]].<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title=Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> Both University of Ottawa and Saint Patrick's College had been inaugurated by the Catholic order Oblates of Immaculate Mary (OMI). The college was housed in a building on Echo Drive, near the Pretoria Bridge. Around 1973, a new building was erected on the Carleton campus, separated from the other academic building by its location at the northern end of campus. The college was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Carleton after the 1979\u201380 academic year, with Gerald Clarke who had been a professor at the school since 1954, serving as its final Dean. While Carleton is a secular institution, the name of the St. Patrick's Building is a legacy of Carleton's historical relationship to the Catholic institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1982/MacDougall.html|title=St. Patrick's College (Ottawa) (1929\u20131979) Ethnicity and the Liberal Arts in Catholic Education|last=MacDougall|first=H.A.|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref> Carleton's School of Social Work continues to offer undergraduate and graduate programs, building off of St. Patrick's College's reputation for teaching in the field of social work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.carleton.ca/socialwork/prospective-students/ |publisher=School of Social Work |title= Prospective Students|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Steady expansion (1970\u20131999)====\nThe arrival of a new decade ushered in the inauguration of the long-awaited University Centre, designed to be the linchpin for student life on campus, housing a student-operated pub and other administrative services. With growing restrictions in physical space, the University hailed the completion of Dunton Tower, then referred to as the Arts Tower, in September 1972, gracing the skyline of Carleton's campus with what was then the tallest academic building in Canada. Rising attention towards recreation and fitness, coupled with generous grants from the provincial government, spurred the construction of the Athletics Centre in 1974, housing a multiplicity of different sports facilities, including a pool, squash courts, and gymnasium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/thecharleton08carl/page/94 |publisher=Carleton University |title= The Charlatan: 1978-79|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Carleton experienced a temporary decline in student enrolment toward the latter half of the 1970s, the 1980s saw a resurgence in the number of students attending the school, representing an increase of 76%, or 5,582 students over the course of the decade, leading to overcrowding in many of the school's buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cp421/page/28?q=decline+in+enrolment |publisher=Carleton University |title= Advancing into the Second Half-Century|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> Responding to the demands of a larger student population during the 1980s, the University built the Life Sciences Research Centre, the Minto Centre of Advanced Studies in Engineering (CASE), and funded an extension to MacOdrum Library.\n\nFollowing renovations led by Toronto-based architect Michael Lundholm, 1992 saw the opening of the Carleton University Art Gallery in the St. Patrick's Building, supported by a fundraising drive within the local community and the bequest of several pieces of Canadian art from the estate of Frances and Jack Barwick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuag.ca/index.php/about/history/ |publisher=Carleton University Art Gallery |title=History|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref> In fall 1994, a new computing system was introduced at Carleton, extending Internet and e-mail access to all students and faculty, where this had previously been only accessible to graduate and undergraduate students in specific courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cp383/page/20 |publisher=Carleton University|title=Survival at Carleton, 1994-95|accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Contemporary developments (2000\u2013present)====\n[[File:HealthSciencesBuilding Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Health Sciences Building, completed in 2018]]\nThe new millennium brightened prospects for Carleton's finances, allowing it to fund the construction of several new buildings during the 2000s.

Runte's leadership also pushed forward the planning and construction of three new academic buildings, Canal Building (2010), and River Building (2011), and the Health Sciences Building (2018), as well as a new residence building, Lennox and Addington House in 2011.\n\n[[File:RichcraftGreenWall Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|right|[[Green wall]] installed in Richcraft Hall]]\n\nAt the behest of Runte's successor, Benoit-Antoine Bacon, Carleton has continued to pursue several major construction projects, notably the Advanced Research and Innovation and Smart Environments (ARISE) Building, replacing the existing Life Sciences Building, to house applied research in smart technology. The University also moved forward with the construction of the Nicol Building, providing 100,000 square feet of new learning spaces for students in the Sprott School of Business.  The cost of the building was estimated at around $65 million, but was offset through a sizeable donation of $10 million from the late Ottawa real estate developer and Carleton alumnus, Wes Nicol, for whom the building is namesake.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carleton.ca/fmp/our-services/construction/major-capital-projects/|title=Major Capital Projects|publisher=Carleton University|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> The building is slated for completion in 2021.\n\nIn 2018, Carleton purchased the [[Dominion-Chalmers United Church]] located in Ottawa's [[Centretown]] neighbourhood to serve as a community and cultural hub, and host to artistic performances and academic lectures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.carleton.ca/2018/carleton-in-the-community-dominion-chalmers-united-church/|title=Carleton in the Community: Dominion-Chalmers United Church|publisher=Carleton University|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> The facility represents Carleton's first building situated in Ottawa's downtown area.\n\n==== 2020 coronavirus pandemic ====\nIn response to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]], Carleton joined other Canadian post-secondary institutions in a decision to suspend in-person classes for the remainder of the 2019\u201320 academic year, effectively moving instruction online. This move also saw the temporary withdrawal of non-essential services, such as athletics facilities, in order to contain the spread of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.carleton.ca/2020/covid-19-update-plan-for-remainder-of-term/|title=COVID-19 Update \u2013 Plan for Remainder of Term|publisher=Carleton University|accessdate=19 March 2020}}</ref> Unlike some institutions, Carleton did not immediately move to evict students from residence buildings, but allowed students to leave early at their own discretion.

During its initial construction in 1959, the campus consisted of three buildings, the MacOdrum Library, the Tory Building, and Paterson Hall, forming a quadrangle situated at the heart of the university's academic buildings. Since then, the university has expanded to forty-seven buildings, the newest addition being the Health Sciences Building, which was inaugurated in 2018.\n\nThe campus is accessible to road traffic through two entrances respectively located at Bronson Avenue and Colonel By Drive. Carleton's campus contains a series of surface roads to facilitate traffic in and out of the university, the most heavily-used of them being Campus Avenue, which was converted to a single-direction road in 2019. Several [[OC Transpo]] bus lines, including the 7, 10, and 111 serve the campus directly, in addition to the O-Train's [[Carleton station]], located at the centre of campus.\n\nThe campus is bisected by the [[O-Train]] Trillium line, with several pedestrian and vehicular bridges and tunnels facilitating access between either side.

Note the alphabetic wayfinding signage distinguishing tunnel routes.]]\nBuildings on campus, with a few exceptions, are connected by a five kilometer-long system of underground pedestrian tunnels. The Carleton University tunnel system is the most extensive network of tunnels at a Canadian university or college campus. The tunnels were initially built as part of the second phase of initial construction on campus in the 1960s. Originally conceived as a maintenance crawl space connecting heating and ventilation between campus buildings,  a suggestion by a staff member transformed them into accessible pedestrian tunnels<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" /> for students and faculty to use when travelling between different buildings on campus.  The tunnels receive heightened usage during the winter months due to the severity of winters in Ottawa. Maintenance staff use modified [[golf carts]] in the tunnels to transport personnel, supplies, and mail to different locations on campus.\n\nIn 2019, Carleton introduced a new wayfinding system to assist students, faculty, and visitors in navigating the tunnel networking, using a [[Transit map|metro-style]] map to display the network.\n\n===Student housing===\n{|  style=\"float:right; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fefefe; padding:3px; margin:5px; width:33%;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 100%\" | '''Residence houses at Carleton University'''\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:90%; white-space:nowrap;\"\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n'''Traditional residences'''\n*'''Dundas House''' (1991)\n*'''Glengarry House''' (1969)\n*'''Grenville House''' (1965)\n*'''Lanark House''' (1962)\n*'''Lennox and Addington House''' (2011)\n*'''Renfrew House''' (1962)\n*'''Russell House'''(1965)\n*'''Stormont House''' (1991)\n| \n'''Suite-style residences'''\n*'''Frontenac House''' (2008)\n*'''Leeds House''' (2001)\n*'''Prescott House''' (2001)\n|}\n[[File:ResidenceBuildings Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Residence Commons, Glengarry House, and Frontenac House viewed from the Residence Quad]]\n[[File:LennoxAddington Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Lennox & Addington House, the newest residence house at Carleton, at dusk]]\nCarleton has eleven student residence buildings clustered together in the northwest section of campus, and are connected to the university's tunnel system. The first residence buildings constructed on campus were the Renfrew and Lanark Houses, which began accommodating students in 1962.  In 1969, the university introduced the first co-educational dormitories in North America.<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" /> Since then, the university has gradually expanded the number of dormitories as enrollment has risen. On-campus housing at Carleton is configured in traditional and suite-style residences, with the latter offering students a kitchenette shared between four students. Unlike most collegiate dormitories, bathroom facilities are usually shared between two rooms, in contrast to the typical communal bathrooms.  Residence floors are staffed by dedicated [[Resident assistant|Residence Fellows]], upper-year students hired by the university's Department of Housing and Residence Life Services to provide personal and academic support to students.\n\nAlthough the majority of students housed on-campus are first-year students, Frontenac House is reserved for returning second-year students, while Leeds House is reserved for upper-year and graduate students. Residence Commons serves as a hub for students living in residences, as it houses ''The Caf'', the university's main [[dining hall]], the Residence Reception Desk, a [[Tim Horton's]] location, and Abstentions, a [[convenience store]] operated by the [[Rideau River Residence Association]] (RRRA), which functions as the student government for residence students.\n\nDuring the summer months, some residence halls are turned over to Conference Services for use as hotels for visiting school and tourist groups to Ottawa. The [[Canadian Armed Forces]] uses some facilities, notably Glengarry House and Residence Commons, to house and feed the [[Ceremonial Guard]], which conducts the renowned Changing of the Guard ceremony on [[Parliament Hill]] and posts sentries at [[Rideau Hall]]. It is possible to see practice marches and drills occurring on campus during this season.\n\n==Library and collections==\n{{anchor|MacOdrum Library}}\n[[File:MacOdrumLibrary Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left| Main facade of MacOdrum Library, renovated in 2013]]\n[[File:InLibrary Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|View of study carrels on the second floor of MacOdrum Library]]\n\n=== MacOdrum Library ===\nOne of the three original buildings on the Carleton campus, the MacOdrum Library has served as Carleton's central library and archives.

Carleton County, in turn, was named in honour of [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester]], who served as [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] of [[The Canadas]] from 1786 to 1796.\n\nCarleton, which has more than 159,000 alumni worldwide, is reputed for its strength in many disciplines including the [[humanities]], [[international business]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[computer science]], [[international relations|international affairs]], journalism, [[political science]], [[political management]], [[public policy]] and [[public administration|administration]], and [[legal studies]]. Carleton has produced 6 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], 29 [[Royal Society of Canada|Royal Society Fellows]], 20 recipients of the [[Order of Canada]], 8 Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship awardees, and 3 National Killam Award recipients.\n\nAs of 2019, Carleton has an enrolment of more than 27,000 undergraduate and more than 4,000 graduate students. Its campus is located west of [[Old Ottawa South]], in close proximity to [[The Glebe]] and [[Confederation Heights]], and is bounded to the north by the [[Rideau Canal]] and [[Dow's Lake]] and to the south by the [[Rideau River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldottawasouth.ca/index.php/oos|last=Gall|first=Gwendolyn|title=About Old Ottawa South|publisher=Old Ottawa South Community Association|accessdate=27 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314230515/http://www.oldottawasouth.ca/index.php/oos|archive-date=14 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCarleton competes in the [[U Sports]] league as the [[Carleton Ravens]]. The Carleton Ravens are recognized for the strong performance of its men's basketball team, which has won seven consecutive Canadian national championships between 2006 and 2017, in addition to 14 of the 16 championships since 2003.\n\n==History==\n<blockquote>I learned very early the life lesson that it is people, not buildings, that make up an institution.

While the outbreak of the Second World War disrupted the committee's activities, a new committee, under the leadership of Henry Marshall Tory, was reorganized into the Ottawa Association for the Advancement of Learning through a meeting held in December 1941, which was formalized in June 1942.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/2 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nEstablished in 1942 as Carleton College, a non-denominational institution, the school began offering evening courses in rented classrooms at the High School of Commerce, now part of the [[Glebe Collegiate Institute]]. Classes offered during the first academic year included [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[history]], [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[biology]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp160/page/8 |title=Carleton College: First Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> With the end of the war in 1945, and return of veterans from the frontlines, the College experienced an unexpected upsurge in student enrolment during the 1945\u201346 academic year, totalling approximately 2,200 students. To accommodate the increased number of students, the school rented facilities in various locations through the city, including classrooms at the [[Lisgar Collegiate Institute]], [[Ottawa Technical High School]], and the basements of several local churches.  Higher enrolment also gave way to an expansion of the College's academic offerings with the establishment of the Faculty of Arts and Science encompassing coursework in [[Carleton School of Journalism|journalism]] and first-year engineering.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp164/page/4|title=Carleton College: Fifth Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, the College gained possession of its first property, situated at the corner of Lyon Street and First Avenue in [[The Glebe]] neighbourhood. The four-story building was the former location of the [[Ottawa Ladies' College]], which was purchased during the Second World War for use as [[barracks]] for the Canadian Women's Army Corps.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp165/page/4|title=Carleton College: Fifth Annual Calendar|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> Its first degrees were conferred in 1946 to graduates of its Journalism and Public Administration programs.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/carleton-university|title=Carleton University|author1=J.

However, full-time teaching staff were still mostly young scholars at the beginning of their careers.\n\nIn 1950, Carleton began the process of developing a crest and motto, as was tradition with other institutions of higher learning. James Gibson, chair of the Committee on Symbols and Ceremonials, initially proposed a Latin motto, \"''Opera nobis aeterna''\" derived from the [[Walt Whitman]] poem [[Pioneers! O Pioneers!]],<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" /> a translation of the phrase \"We take up the task eternal\". The Board of Governors rejected the Latin motto as it was perceived as too pretentious for an institution focused on egalitarianism, leading to Carleton's current motto, \"Ours the task eternal\".  In October 1951, the Board of Governors formally adopted the new crest and motto.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Carleton, 1951-52 |url=https://archive.org/details/thecarleton07carl/page/4 |website=Internet Archive |publisher=Carleton University |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the ''Carleton College Act'' was passed by the [[Ontario Legislature]], changing the school's corporate name to Carleton College and conferring upon it the power to grant university degrees. Carleton thus became the province's first private, [[non-sectarian]] college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/reports/futuree.html#appendixB |title=Excellence Accessibility Responsibility > Ministry of Education |publisher=Edu.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref>  The governance was modelled on the provincial ''University of Toronto Act'' of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a Faculty Senate, responsible for academic policy, and a Board of Governors composed of \nlocal community members, exercising exclusive control over the institution's finances and formal authority over all other matters.

In October 1956, the beginning of construction at the Rideau River campus was celebrated with a ceremonial sod-turning by [[Dana Porter]], then [[Treasurer of Ontario]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp391/page/12|title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1956-57|publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Carleton University (1957\u2013present)===\n\nIn 1957, the ''Carleton University Act'' was enacted<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://carleton.ca/about/history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=15 March 2019}}</ref> as an amendment to the ''Carleton College Act'', granting Carleton nominal status as a [[public university]] and resulting in its current name, Carleton University.<ref name=\"Carleton Act\">{{cite web | title = Carleton University Act | publisher=University Secretariat| accessdate = 5 November 2011 | url = https://carleton.ca/secretariat/carleton-university-act/}}</ref> This did not result in substantive changes to the school's governance and academic organization as it had already been granted university powers through the preceding legislation.\n\n====Rapid development and growth (1960\u201369)====\n[[File:CarletonCampus RiverView 1965.png|thumb|right|Carleton campus viewed from the [[Rideau River]], 1965]]\nThe completion of initial construction at the Rideau River campus in 1959 saw the University move to its current location at the beginning of the 1959\u201360 academic year. Completed at a cost of $6.5 million, the first three buildings, the Maxwell MacOdrum Library, Norman Paterson Hall and the Henry Marshall Tory Building became the centre for academic life at the institution, with Paterson Hall and Tory Building respectively serving the arts and sciences disciplines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp394/page/4 |title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1959-60 |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> The1960s saw meteoric growth in student enrolment, with the number of full-time students ballooning from 857 to 7,139 within the decade,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/cp404/page/n1 |title=The President's Report: Carleton University, 1960-61 |publisher=Carleton University|access-date=26 September 2019}}</ref> dovetailing with a sharp uptick in financial support from the provincial and federal governments towards post-secondary institutions. An increasing share of these students came to the school from outside the [[National Capital Region]], prompting the University to open its first purpose-built residence halls, Lanark and Renfrew Houses in the fall of 1962. The residences were initially segregated by sex, with Lanark House reserved for male students and Renfrew for females; Carleton discarded the practice of mandatory sex segregation in 1969 in favour of co-educational housing, becoming the first university in North America to adopt this practice.  By the end of the decade, the increased need for space to accommodate the growing faculty and student body saw the completion of several major academic buildings, including the Loeb Building in 1967 and the Mackenzie Building in 1968.\n\nIn 1967, a Catholic post-secondary institution, Saint Patrick's College became affiliated with Carleton. Founded in 1929, it had been granting its diplomas through the [[University of Ottawa]].<ref name=\"Pound 2005\">{{cite book |title=Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> Both University of Ottawa and Saint Patrick's College had been inaugurated by the Catholic order Oblates of Immaculate Mary (OMI). The college was housed in a building on Echo Drive, near the Pretoria Bridge. Around 1973, a new building was erected on the Carleton campus, separated from the other academic building by its location at the northern end of campus. The college was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Carleton after the 1979\u201380 academic year, with Gerald Clarke who had been a professor at the school since 1954, serving as its final Dean.

With growing restrictions in physical space, the University hailed the completion of Dunton Tower, then referred to as the Arts Tower, in September 1972, gracing the skyline of Carleton's campus with what was then the tallest academic building in Canada. Rising attention towards recreation and fitness, coupled with generous grants from the provincial government, spurred the construction of the Athletics Centre in 1974, housing a multiplicity of different sports facilities, including a pool, squash courts, and gymnasium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/thecharleton08carl/page/94 |publisher=Carleton University |title= The Charlatan: 1978-79|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Carleton experienced a temporary decline in student enrolment toward the latter half of the 1970s, the 1980s saw a resurgence in the number of students attending the school, representing an increase of 76%, or 5,582 students over the course of the decade, leading to overcrowding in many of the school's buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cp421/page/28?q=decline+in+enrolment |publisher=Carleton University |title= Advancing into the Second Half-Century|accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> Responding to the demands of a larger student population during the 1980s, the University built the Life Sciences Research Centre, the Minto Centre of Advanced Studies in Engineering (CASE), and funded an extension to MacOdrum Library.\n\nFollowing renovations led by Toronto-based architect Michael Lundholm, 1992 saw the opening of the Carleton University Art Gallery in the St. Patrick's Building, supported by a fundraising drive within the local community and the bequest of several pieces of Canadian art from the estate of Frances and Jack Barwick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cuag.ca/index.php/about/history/ |publisher=Carleton University Art Gallery |title=History|accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref> In fall 1994, a new computing system was introduced at Carleton, extending Internet and e-mail access to all students and faculty, where this had previously been only accessible to graduate and undergraduate students in specific courses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cp383/page/20 |publisher=Carleton University|title=Survival at Carleton, 1994-95|accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Contemporary developments (2000\u2013present)====\n[[File:HealthSciencesBuilding Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Health Sciences Building, completed in 2018]]\nThe new millennium brightened prospects for Carleton's finances, allowing it to fund the construction of several new buildings during the 2000s.

During its initial construction in 1959, the campus consisted of three buildings, the MacOdrum Library, the Tory Building, and Paterson Hall, forming a quadrangle situated at the heart of the university's academic buildings. Since then, the university has expanded to forty-seven buildings, the newest addition being the Health Sciences Building, which was inaugurated in 2018.\n\nThe campus is accessible to road traffic through two entrances respectively located at Bronson Avenue and Colonel By Drive. Carleton's campus contains a series of surface roads to facilitate traffic in and out of the university, the most heavily-used of them being Campus Avenue, which was converted to a single-direction road in 2019. Several [[OC Transpo]] bus lines, including the 7, 10, and 111 serve the campus directly, in addition to the O-Train's [[Carleton station]], located at the centre of campus.\n\nThe campus is bisected by the [[O-Train]] Trillium line, with several pedestrian and vehicular bridges and tunnels facilitating access between either side. The majority of the university's academic and residential buildings are situated on the western side of campus, while the eastern side contains the university's athletics facilities and administrative offices.\n\n====Recent developments====\nThe 2010\u20132011 academic year saw the inauguration of three buildings; Richcraft Hall (formerly River Building), Canal Building, and Lennox-Addington House, in addition to an extension to Residence Commons<ref name=\"CanalBld\">{{cite web|url= http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2011/01/18/carleton-opens-new-canal-building-on-jan-20/|title= Carleton Opens New Canal Building on Jan. 20|publisher= Carleton Newsroom|date= 18 January 2011|access-date= 28 February 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140219144835/http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2011/01/18/carleton-opens-new-canal-building-on-jan-20/|archive-date= 19 February 2014|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Canal Building will both house classes and serve as an extension to the Engineering faculties; Richcraft Hall will house the School of Journalism and Communication, the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs and the School of Public Policy and Administration.<ref name=\"CanalBld\" />\n\nIn December 2013, an extension of the MacOdrum Library, which saw the installation of a new glass facade,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2011/06/24/carleton-students-to-benefit-from-16-million-macodrum-library-project/|title= Carleton Students to Benefit from Multimillion MacOdrum Library Project|date= 24 June 2011|accessdate= 6 March 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120626175956/http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2011/06/24/carleton-students-to-benefit-from-16-million-macodrum-library-project/|archive-date= 26 June 2012|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2013/12/helping-more-students-succeed.html|title= Helping More Students Succeed: Premier Celebrates Major Expansion of the Carleton University Library|publisher=Ontario Newsroom|date= 5 December 2013|accessdate= 2 February 2014}}</ref>  In September 2016, the River Building was renamed Richcraft Hall in recognition of a donation of $3 million from the Singhal family, known for their extensive philanthropic activities in the Ottawa area.

The decision to incorporate modernist style into the design of the campus was intentional, presenting Carleon as an egalitarian, progressive, and forward-thinking institution.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://arc.library.carleton.ca/exhibits/construction-u |title= Construction U|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 2018  |website= |publisher=Carleton University |access-date=18 February 2019|quote=}}</ref>\n\nArchitectural critics have looked to Carleton as a leading example of modernist collegiate architecture in Canada. The campus became the subject of Modern U, an exhibition by local artist Adrian Gr\u00f6llner that sought to highlight the late [[modernist architecture]] embodied by many of Carleton's early buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuag.carleton.ca/online/modernu/|title=Modern U|publisher=Carleton University|accessdate=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807231423/http://cuag.carleton.ca/online/modernu/|archive-date=7 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Tunnel system===\n[[File:Tunnels Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Junction between tunnels near the Health Sciences Building. Note the alphabetic wayfinding signage distinguishing tunnel routes.]]\nBuildings on campus, with a few exceptions, are connected by a five kilometer-long system of underground pedestrian tunnels. The Carleton University tunnel system is the most extensive network of tunnels at a Canadian university or college campus. The tunnels were initially built as part of the second phase of initial construction on campus in the 1960s. Originally conceived as a maintenance crawl space connecting heating and ventilation between campus buildings,  a suggestion by a staff member transformed them into accessible pedestrian tunnels<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" /> for students and faculty to use when travelling between different buildings on campus.  The tunnels receive heightened usage during the winter months due to the severity of winters in Ottawa. Maintenance staff use modified [[golf carts]] in the tunnels to transport personnel, supplies, and mail to different locations on campus.\n\nIn 2019, Carleton introduced a new wayfinding system to assist students, faculty, and visitors in navigating the tunnel networking, using a [[Transit map|metro-style]] map to display the network.\n\n===Student housing===\n{|  style=\"float:right; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fefefe; padding:3px; margin:5px; width:33%;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 100%\" | '''Residence houses at Carleton University'''\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; font-size:90%; white-space:nowrap;\"\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n'''Traditional residences'''\n*'''Dundas House''' (1991)\n*'''Glengarry House''' (1969)\n*'''Grenville House''' (1965)\n*'''Lanark House''' (1962)\n*'''Lennox and Addington House''' (2011)\n*'''Renfrew House''' (1962)\n*'''Russell House'''(1965)\n*'''Stormont House''' (1991)\n| \n'''Suite-style residences'''\n*'''Frontenac House''' (2008)\n*'''Leeds House''' (2001)\n*'''Prescott House''' (2001)\n|}\n[[File:ResidenceBuildings Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Residence Commons, Glengarry House, and Frontenac House viewed from the Residence Quad]]\n[[File:LennoxAddington Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Lennox & Addington House, the newest residence house at Carleton, at dusk]]\nCarleton has eleven student residence buildings clustered together in the northwest section of campus, and are connected to the university's tunnel system. The first residence buildings constructed on campus were the Renfrew and Lanark Houses, which began accommodating students in 1962.  In 1969, the university introduced the first co-educational dormitories in North America.<ref name=\"CreatingCarleton\" /> Since then, the university has gradually expanded the number of dormitories as enrollment has risen. On-campus housing at Carleton is configured in traditional and suite-style residences, with the latter offering students a kitchenette shared between four students. Unlike most collegiate dormitories, bathroom facilities are usually shared between two rooms, in contrast to the typical communal bathrooms.  Residence floors are staffed by dedicated [[Resident assistant|Residence Fellows]], upper-year students hired by the university's Department of Housing and Residence Life Services to provide personal and academic support to students.\n\nAlthough the majority of students housed on-campus are first-year students, Frontenac House is reserved for returning second-year students, while Leeds House is reserved for upper-year and graduate students. Residence Commons serves as a hub for students living in residences, as it houses ''The Caf'', the university's main [[dining hall]], the Residence Reception Desk, a [[Tim Horton's]] location, and Abstentions, a [[convenience store]] operated by the [[Rideau River Residence Association]] (RRRA), which functions as the student government for residence students.\n\nDuring the summer months, some residence halls are turned over to Conference Services for use as hotels for visiting school and tourist groups to Ottawa. The [[Canadian Armed Forces]] uses some facilities, notably Glengarry House and Residence Commons, to house and feed the [[Ceremonial Guard]], which conducts the renowned Changing of the Guard ceremony on [[Parliament Hill]] and posts sentries at [[Rideau Hall]]. It is possible to see practice marches and drills occurring on campus during this season.\n\n==Library and collections==\n{{anchor|MacOdrum Library}}\n[[File:MacOdrumLibrary Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left| Main facade of MacOdrum Library, renovated in 2013]]\n[[File:InLibrary Carleton 2019.jpg|thumb|left|View of study carrels on the second floor of MacOdrum Library]]\n\n=== MacOdrum Library ===\nOne of the three original buildings on the Carleton campus, the MacOdrum Library has served as Carleton's central library and archives. The library is named for former Carleton President and Vice-Chancellor [[Murdoch Maxwell MacOdrum]].

The facility contains computer labs, study carrels, and meeting rooms for students to complete assignments and conduct academic research. During midterm and final examination periods, the Library extends its operating hours to twenty-four hours to accommodate students preparing for their examinations or completing assignments. On an annual basis, the library receives upwards of 1.6 million visits from students, faculty, and researchers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = At A Glance: Carleton University Library|url = https://library.carleton.ca/sites/default/files/about/ataglance_2017.pdf|website = carleton.ca|access-date = 18 February 2019}}</ref>..\n\nIn 2013, the Library inaugurated the Discovery Centre for Undergraduate Research, a multi-purpose space containing meeting tables, multimedia collaborative spaces, video game laboratories, as well as [[3D printers]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Discovery Centre - Carleton University|url = https://carleton.ca/discoverycentre/|website = carleton.ca|access-date = 16 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Library occasionally hosts special artistic and historical exhibitions on the first floor, covering a broad spectrum of topics and academic disciplines.\n\n====Archives and Special Collections====\nThe MacOdrum Library maintains extensive archives and research collections of documents, artifacts, and other materials related to specific academic disciplines, as well as the personal effects of various persons of historical significance.

Later, several princes of nationally important cities, which comprised [[vassal]] [[appanage]] principalities, held this title (Grand Prince of [[Moscow]], [[Tver']], [[Yaroslavl']], [[Ryazan Principality|Ryazan']], [[Smolensk]], etc.).  From 1328 the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Prince of Moscow]] appeared as the titular head of eastern Rus' and slowly centralized power until [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] was [[coronation|crowned]] tsar in 1547. Since then, the title ''grand prince'' ceased to be a hereditary office and became a [[wikt:generic|generic]] title for members of the [[House of Romanov|Imperial family]] until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n\n===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===\nThe [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] title ''{{lang|lt|Didysis kunigaik\u0161tis}}'' was used by the rulers of [[Lithuania]], and after 1569, it was one of two main titles used by the monarch of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The kings of Poland from the Swedish [[House of Vasa]] also used this title for their non-Polish territories.  This Lithuanian title was sometimes [[latin]]ized as ''{{lang|la|Magnus Dux}}'' or [[Grand duke|Grand Duke]].\n\n==Modern use==\n\nIn 1582, <!-- \"Modern\" --> king [[John III of Sweden]] added [[Grand Prince of Finland]] to the subsidiary titles of the Swedish kings, however without any territorial or civic implications, [[Finland]] already being a fully integrated part of the Swedish realm.\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruling house of [[Habsburg]] instituted a similar Grand Principality in [[Transylvania]] (''Siebenburgen'') in 1765.\n\nAfter the Russian conquests, the title continued to be used by the Russian emperor in his role as ruler of [[Lithuania]] (1793\u20131918) and of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|autonomous Finland]] (1809\u20131917) as well. His titulary included, among other titles: \"Grand Duke of [[Smolensk]], [[Volynia]], [[Podolia]]\", \"Lord and Grand Duke of [[Nizhni Novgorod]], [[Chernigov]]\" etc.\n\nA more literal translation of the Russian title than ''grand duke'' would be ''great prince'' \u2014 especially in the pre-[[Peter the Great|Petrine]] era \u2014 but the term is neither standard nor widely used in English. In German, however, a Russian Grand Duke was known as a ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dff\u00fcrst}}'', and in [[Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|Magnus Princeps}}''.\n\nGrand prince remained as a dynastic title for the senior members of the [[Romanov]] dynasty in Russia's imperial era. The title ''{{lang|ru|Velikiy [[Knyaz]]}}'', its use finally formalized by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], then belonged to children and male-line grandchildren of the emperors of Russia. The daughters and paternal granddaughters of the emperors used a different version of the title ({{lang|ru|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u043d\u0430}}, ''Velikie knyazhna'') from females who obtained it as the consorts of Russian ''grand princes'' ({{lang|ru|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0438}}, ''Velikie knjagini''). In modern times a Russian Grand Duke or Grand Duchess is styled ''Imperial Highness''.\n\nThe title grand prince was also used for the heir apparent to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]]\n* [[Royal and noble ranks]]\n* [[Titles of nobility]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Royal titles]]\n[[Category:Noble titles]]\n[[Category:Princes| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Title of nobility}}\n{{redirect|Grand princess|the cruise ship|Grand Princess}}\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n{{Royal and noble ranks}}\n'''Grand prince''' or '''great prince''' (feminine: '''grand princess''' or '''great princess''') ({{lang-la|magnus [[princeps]]}}; [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''megas [[archon]]''; {{lang-ru|\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u044c|\"velikiy Knyaz}}) is a [[nobility|title of nobility]] ranked in honour below [[king]] and [[emperor]] and above a sovereign [[prince]], and debatably ranked below an [[archduke]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Grand duke]] is the usual and established, though not [[literal translation|literal]], translation of these terms in English and [[Romance language]]s, which do not normally use separate words for a \"prince\" who [[reign]]s as a [[monarch]] (e.g., [[Albert II of Monaco|Albert II, Prince of Monaco]]) and a \"prince\" who does not reign, but belongs to a monarch's family (e.g., [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]).

Later, several princes of nationally important cities, which comprised [[vassal]] [[appanage]] principalities, held this title (Grand Prince of [[Moscow]], [[Tver']], [[Yaroslavl']], [[Ryazan Principality|Ryazan']], [[Smolensk]], etc.).  From 1328 the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Grand Prince of Moscow]] appeared as the titular head of eastern Rus' and slowly centralized power until [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] was [[coronation|crowned]] tsar in 1547. Since then, the title ''grand prince'' ceased to be a hereditary office and became a [[wikt:generic|generic]] title for members of the [[House of Romanov|Imperial family]] until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n\n===Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===\nThe [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] title ''{{lang|lt|Didysis kunigaik\u0161tis}}'' was used by the rulers of [[Lithuania]], and after 1569, it was one of two main titles used by the monarch of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The kings of Poland from the Swedish [[House of Vasa]] also used this title for their non-Polish territories.  This Lithuanian title was sometimes [[latin]]ized as ''{{lang|la|Magnus Dux}}'' or [[Grand duke|Grand Duke]].\n\n==Modern use==\n\nIn 1582, <!-- \"Modern\" --> king [[John III of Sweden]] added [[Grand Prince of Finland]] to the subsidiary titles of the Swedish kings, however without any territorial or civic implications, [[Finland]] already being a fully integrated part of the Swedish realm.\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] ruling house of [[Habsburg]] instituted a similar Grand Principality in [[Transylvania]] (''Siebenburgen'') in 1765.\n\nAfter the Russian conquests, the title continued to be used by the Russian emperor in his role as ruler of [[Lithuania]] (1793\u20131918) and of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|autonomous Finland]] (1809\u20131917) as well. His titulary included, among other titles: \"Grand Duke of [[Smolensk]], [[Volynia]], [[Podolia]]\", \"Lord and Grand Duke of [[Nizhni Novgorod]], [[Chernigov]]\" etc.\n\nA more literal translation of the Russian title than ''grand duke'' would be ''great prince'' \u2014 especially in the pre-[[Peter the Great|Petrine]] era \u2014 but the term is neither standard nor widely used in English. In German, however, a Russian Grand Duke was known as a ''{{lang|de|Gro\u00dff\u00fcrst}}'', and in [[Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|Magnus Princeps}}''.\n\nGrand prince remained as a dynastic title for the senior members of the [[Romanov]] dynasty in Russia's imperial era. The title ''{{lang|ru|Velikiy [[Knyaz]]}}'', its use finally formalized by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], then belonged to children and male-line grandchildren of the emperors of Russia. The daughters and paternal granddaughters of the emperors used a different version of the title ({{lang|ru|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0436\u043d\u0430}}, ''Velikie knyazhna'') from females who obtained it as the consorts of Russian ''grand princes'' ({{lang|ru|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u043d\u044f\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0438}}, ''Velikie knjagini''). In modern times a Russian Grand Duke or Grand Duchess is styled ''Imperial Highness''.\n\nThe title grand prince was also used for the heir apparent to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians]]\n* [[Royal and noble ranks]]\n* [[Titles of nobility]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Royal titles]]\n[[Category:Noble titles]]\n[[Category:Princes| ]]\n", "name_user": "SrpskiAnonimac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_prince"}

As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\" (see [[Crimson Contagion]]).<ref name= simulation2019>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/trump-let-u-fall-behind-120054883.html|title=How Trump let the U.S. fall behind the curve on coronavirus threat|website=news.yahoo.com}}</ref> Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

He won the [[Indianapolis 500]] twice, and was the 1976 [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Marlboro Championship Trail champion. Johncock was most often simply referred to as \"Gordy.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Early career==\nJohncock began his USAC and CART/IndyCar career in 1964 when he drove for Weinberger Racing. He ran four races in 1964, and then went full-time in 1965. Johncock's first USAC victory was scored at the [[Milwaukee Mile]] in August 1965. In 1966, he went winless in nine starts out of 16 races, so he left Gerhardt Racing at the end of the year, to form his own team, Johncock Racing. His primary sponsor became Gilmore Broadcasting and Johncock was the only other \"owner-driver\" in IndyCar other than AJ Foyt. Although Johncock's team won six races in a three-year period (1967 - 1969), things went downhill when Johncock lost the Gilmore sponsorship at the end of 1970. Between 1970 and 1973, Johncock went winless, his team shuttered operations, and Johncock found himself in bankruptcy court. He also was involved in a divorce with his ex-wife. By 1973, Johncock's winless draught came to an end during the prestigious Indianapolis 500 when he joined the [[Patrick Racing]] team ahead of the 1973 USAC season.\n\nAt the [[1973 Indianapolis 500]], Johncock was racing for [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]]/[[Patrick Racing]]. A major accident at the start involving [[Salt Walther]], coupled with two days of rain, postponed the race until late Wednesday afternoon. When the race was held, Johncock's teammate [[Swede Savage]] was severely injured in a fiery crash on lap 58. A moment later, Armando Teran, a pit crew member on the same STP/Patrick team, was struck by a [[fire truck]] going northbound in the pits, and was fatally injured at the scene. When the race resumed, Johncock who had led the most laps, was leading when rain fell again on the 133rd lap. Nearing 6 p.m., the race was red flagged and declared over. After a short and muted victory lane celebration, Johncock went to visit Savage at the hospital. Afterward, the celebratory victory [[banquet]] was cancelled. Instead, Johncock and his crew went to a local fast-food joint for hamburgers. About a month later, Savage died from his injuries.\n\nIn the [[1975 Indianapolis 500]], he started the race on the front row but retired with ignition problems on the 11th lap. Johncock won the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] national championship in 1976, snatching the title from [[Johnny Rutherford]] in the final race of the season at [[Phoenix International Raceway]]. In 1976 and 1978 he finished third at Indianapolis, and in 1977 he was leading [[A. J. Foyt]] when the car's crankshaft broke with sixteen laps to go.\n\n[[File:GordonJohncockPocono.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johncock's car at Pocono, October 2008]]\nJohncock took a second Indianapolis 500 victory in 1982, winning by 0.16 second over [[Rick Mears]]. This remains the fourth-closest Indy 500 finish in history. ([[Al Unser Jr.]]'s 0.043-second victory over [[Scott Goodyear]] in 1992 was the closest, followed by [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]]'s 0.0600-second<ref>Garrett, Jerry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/sports/with-late-move-hunter-reay-wins-indianapolis-500.html?_r=0 \"Daring pass produces narrow victory at Indy\"]. ''[[New York Times]]'', May 25, 2014. Retrieved on May 27, 2014.</ref> victory ahead of [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] in 2014, and [[Sam Hornish, Jr.|Sam Hornish Jr]]'s 0.0635-second victory ahead of [[Marco Andretti]] in 2006.) Mears was rapidly closing on Johncock in the final laps. In Mears' final pit stop, Mears' team made a miscalculation and filled his car with more fuel than it needed to finish the race. As a consequence Mears had to catch up a significant distance on Johncock, and on the 197th and 198th laps came from 3 seconds back to within car lengths. Johncock's tires were deteriorating by the lap, and with each turn the car understeered more severely. On the final lap, just after the white flag waved, Mears tried to pass Johncock for the win, with Johncock making a decisive defense of first place in Turn One, and Johncock began pulling away. In turn 4, Mears reeled him in and made a pass, but lost by 16-hundredths of a second (25 feet), which was, at that time, the closest finish in Indy 500 history (now the 4th closest).\n\nMears would later joke about watching the tape over and over to see if 'this time I get around Gordy'. Johncock, during a live interview on ABC years later, offered that if the dramatic duel had occurred two or three years later\u2014when Mears had additional experience\u2014the Californian would probably have pulled off the winning pass.\n\n[[File:Johncockmears1982indy500.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Johncock leads [[Rick Mears]] in the closing stages of the 1982 Indy 500.]]\nJohncock took another three Indycar races, including the 1982 Michigan 500 to complete two legs of what was then known as the Triple Crown before retiring from racing in 1985 (the three {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} races on the USAC Marlboro Championship Trail were known as such from 1970 until 1989, and again since 2014 (there was a Triple Crown of Indianapolis, Pocono, and Fontana in 2013, but Pocono was a 400-mile race in 2013)). Legend holds that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held off resurfacing the bumpy concrete pit lane until Johncock retired, as he was known for his high-speed trips through the pit lane. He returned for occasional appearances in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991 and retired for good after the [[1992 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nJohncock's last Indycar win was in the opening round of the [[1983 CART PPG Indy Car World Series]] at the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] driving a [[Cosworth]] powered Patrick Wildcat. Johncock, who started 3rd on the grid, won the 200 mile, 132 lap race at an average of 146.133&nbsp;mph from the [[Penske racing|Penske]]-Cosworth of [[Al Unser]] and [[John Paul, Jr. (racing driver)|John Paul, Jr.]] in a 1982 model Penske-Cosworth.\n\nJohncock competed in twenty-one [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] events in his career. He earned three top-fives and four top-tens in his limited schedules. The best of those finishes were a pair of fourths in 1973 at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and 1966 at [[North Carolina Speedway|Rockingham]].\n\n===First retirement===\nJohncock abruptly retired from IndyCar racing during the first week of practice for the 1985 Indianapolis 500, just before qualifications. He served on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]] in 1985 but decided to return to racing in 1986. He planned to enter the [[1986 Indianapolis 500]], but his funding for a car fell through. He wound up sitting out the race. He attempted another return in 1987. During the first week of time trials, [[Jim Crawford (racing driver)|Jim Crawford]] suffered serious injuries to his feet. Johncock was hired to drive in replacement and qualified for the race.\n\n===Second retirement===\nJohncock completed a sixth-place finish in the [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991 Indy 500]], despite having flu-like symptoms the morning of the race. His final race was the [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992 Indy 500]], where he dropped out with engine failure. Since his retirement, Johncock has distanced himself from motorsports, and focuses on his timber business in Michigan. He participated in a 2004 interview on [[ESPN Classic]]'s \"Big Ticket\" review of the 1982 Indy 500. In the interview, he admitted that his interests in racing were now limited, and was no longer his daily focus. In discussing the 1973 race, Johncock appeared to have made peace with the circumstances. While most discredit the race as being rain-shortened, and for its overall miserable memories, Johncock insisted that his car was undoubtedly the fastest on the track, led easily, and was not simply in front at the time of the red flag by chance.\n\nJohncock chose not to attend the [[2011 Indianapolis 500]], which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the first race. Despite the fact that all living former participants, and particularly living former winners, were invited, Johncock did not attend any of the festivities, seemingly by choice. A year later, Speedway officials again invited him to attend, and he did return to the Speedway and participated in pre-race festivities at the 2012 race.\n\n==Awards==\n*Johncock was inducted into the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Auto Racing Hall of Fame|Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame]] in 1997.\n*In 1999 he was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]].\n*He was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2002.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/gordon-johncock.html Gordon Johncock] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===American open-wheel racing===\n([[Template:American Open Wheel driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position</span>)\n\n====USAC Championship Car====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:82%\"\n|-\n!colspan=34| [[USAC Championship Car]] results\n|-\n!

He won the [[Indianapolis 500]] twice, and was the 1976 [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Marlboro Championship Trail champion. Johncock was most often simply referred to as \"Gordy.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Early career==\nJohncock began his USAC and CART/IndyCar career in 1964 when he drove for Weinberger Racing. He ran four races in 1964, and then went full-time in 1965. Johncock's first USAC victory was scored at the [[Milwaukee Mile]] in August 1965. In 1966, he went winless in nine starts out of 16 races, so he left Gerhardt Racing at the end of the year, to form his own team, Johncock Racing. His primary sponsor became Gilmore Broadcasting and Johncock was the only other \"owner-driver\" in IndyCar other than AJ Foyt. Although Johncock's team won six races in a three-year period (1967 - 1969), things went downhill when Johncock lost the Gilmore sponsorship at the end of 1970. Between 1970 and 1973, Johncock went winless, his team shuttered operations, and Johncock found himself in bankruptcy court. He also was involved in a divorce with his ex-wife. By 1973, Johncock's winless draught came to an end during the prestigious Indianapolis 500 when he joined the [[Patrick Racing]] team ahead of the 1973 USAC season.\n\nAt the [[1973 Indianapolis 500]], Johncock was racing for [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]]/[[Patrick Racing]]. A major accident at the start involving [[Salt Walther]], coupled with two days of rain, postponed the race until late Wednesday afternoon. When the race was held, Johncock's teammate [[Swede Savage]] was severely injured in a fiery crash on lap 58. A moment later, Armando Teran, a pit crew member on the same STP/Patrick team, was struck by a [[fire truck]] going northbound in the pits, and was fatally injured at the scene. When the race resumed, Johncock who had led the most laps, was leading when rain fell again on the 133rd lap. Nearing 6 p.m., the race was red flagged and declared over. After a short and muted victory lane celebration, Johncock went to visit Savage at the hospital. Afterward, the celebratory victory [[banquet]] was cancelled. Instead, Johncock and his crew went to a local fast-food joint for hamburgers. About a month later, Savage died from his injuries.\n\nIn the [[1975 Indianapolis 500]], he started the race on the front row but retired with ignition problems on the 11th lap. Johncock won the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] national championship in 1976, snatching the title from [[Johnny Rutherford]] in the final race of the season at [[Phoenix International Raceway]]. In 1976 and 1978 he finished third at Indianapolis, and in 1977 he was leading [[A. J. Foyt]] when the car's crankshaft broke with sixteen laps to go.\n\n[[File:GordonJohncockPocono.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johncock's car at Pocono, October 2008]]\nJohncock took a second Indianapolis 500 victory in 1982, winning by 0.16 second over [[Rick Mears]]. This remains the fourth-closest Indy 500 finish in history. ([[Al Unser Jr.]]'s 0.043-second victory over [[Scott Goodyear]] in 1992 was the closest, followed by [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]]'s 0.0600-second<ref>Garrett, Jerry. [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/sports/with-late-move-hunter-reay-wins-indianapolis-500.html?_r=0 \"Daring pass produces narrow victory at Indy\"]. ''[[New York Times]]'', May 25, 2014. Retrieved on May 27, 2014.</ref> victory ahead of [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] in 2014, and [[Sam Hornish, Jr.|Sam Hornish Jr]]'s 0.0635-second victory ahead of [[Marco Andretti]] in 2006.) Mears was rapidly closing on Johncock in the final laps. In Mears' final pit stop, Mears' team made a miscalculation and filled his car with more fuel than it needed to finish the race. As a consequence Mears had to catch up a significant distance on Johncock, and on the 197th and 198th laps came from 3 seconds back to within car lengths. Johncock's tires were deteriorating by the lap, and with each turn the car understeered more severely. On the final lap, just after the white flag waved, Mears tried to pass Johncock for the win, with Johncock making a decisive defense of first place in Turn One, and Johncock began pulling away. In turn 4, Mears reeled him in and made a pass, but lost by 16-hundredths of a second (25 feet), which was, at that time, the closest finish in Indy 500 history (now the 4th closest).\n\nMears would later joke about watching the tape over and over to see if 'this time I get around Gordy'. Johncock, during a live interview on ABC years later, offered that if the dramatic duel had occurred two or three years later\u2014when Mears had additional experience\u2014the Californian would probably have pulled off the winning pass.\n\n[[File:Johncockmears1982indy500.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Johncock leads [[Rick Mears]] in the closing stages of the 1982 Indy 500.]]\nJohncock took another three Indycar races, including the 1982 Michigan 500 to complete two legs of what was then known as the Triple Crown before retiring from racing in 1985 (the three {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} races on the USAC Marlboro Championship Trail were known as such from 1970 until 1989, and again since 2014 (there was a Triple Crown of Indianapolis, Pocono, and Fontana in 2013, but Pocono was a 400-mile race in 2013)). Legend holds that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held off resurfacing the bumpy concrete pit lane until Johncock retired, as he was known for his high-speed trips through the pit lane. He returned for occasional appearances in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991 and retired for good after the [[1992 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nJohncock's last Indycar win was in the opening round of the [[1983 CART PPG Indy Car World Series]] at the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] driving a [[Cosworth]] powered Patrick Wildcat. Johncock, who started 3rd on the grid, won the 200 mile, 132 lap race at an average of 146.133&nbsp;mph from the [[Penske racing|Penske]]-Cosworth of [[Al Unser]] and [[John Paul, Jr. (racing driver)|John Paul, Jr.]] in a 1982 model Penske-Cosworth.\n\nJohncock competed in twenty-one [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] events in his career. He earned three top-fives and four top-tens in his limited schedules. The best of those finishes were a pair of fourths in 1973 at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and 1966 at [[North Carolina Speedway|Rockingham]].\n\n===First retirement===\nJohncock abruptly retired from IndyCar racing during the first week of practice for the 1985 Indianapolis 500, just before qualifications. He served on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]] in 1985 but decided to return to racing in 1986. He planned to enter the [[1986 Indianapolis 500]], but his funding for a car fell through. He wound up sitting out the race. He attempted another return in 1987. During the first week of time trials, [[Jim Crawford (racing driver)|Jim Crawford]] suffered serious injuries to his feet. Johncock was hired to drive in replacement and qualified for the race.\n\n===Second retirement===\nJohncock completed a sixth-place finish in the [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991 Indy 500]], despite having flu-like symptoms the morning of the race. His final race was the [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992 Indy 500]], where he dropped out with engine failure. Since his retirement, Johncock has distanced himself from motorsports, and focuses on his timber business in Michigan. He participated in a 2004 interview on [[ESPN Classic]]'s \"Big Ticket\" review of the 1982 Indy 500. In the interview, he admitted that his interests in racing were now limited, and was no longer his daily focus. In discussing the 1973 race, Johncock appeared to have made peace with the circumstances. While most discredit the race as being rain-shortened, and for its overall miserable memories, Johncock insisted that his car was undoubtedly the fastest on the track, led easily, and was not simply in front at the time of the red flag by chance.\n\nJohncock chose not to attend the [[2011 Indianapolis 500]], which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the first race. Despite the fact that all living former participants, and particularly living former winners, were invited, Johncock did not attend any of the festivities, seemingly by choice. A year later, Speedway officials again invited him to attend, and he did return to the Speedway and participated in pre-race festivities at the 2012 race.\n\n==Awards==\n*Johncock was inducted into the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Museum#Auto Racing Hall of Fame|Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame]] in 1997.\n*In 1999 he was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]].\n*He was inducted in the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2002.<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/gordon-johncock.html Gordon Johncock] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===American open-wheel racing===\n([[Template:American Open Wheel driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position</span>)\n\n====USAC Championship Car====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:82%\"\n|-\n!colspan=34| [[USAC Championship Car]] results\n|-\n!

He was born in [[Kidderminster]] and educated at [[Durham University]] from which he took his [[pen name]] '''Cuthbert M. Bede, [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]]''' His most popular book was ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green]]'', on the experiences of an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate. There was a sequel, ''Little Mr Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green''. ''Tales of College Life'' (often bound with it), introduces the character of ''Mr Affable Canary''. The celebrated illustrations to the Verdant Green books were the work of the author.\n\n==Life==\nHe was the second son of Thomas Bradley, surgeon of Kidderminster, who came of a somewhat ancient Worcestershire and clerical family. He was born on 25 March 1827. A brother, Thomas Waldron Bradley, was author of two novels, ''Grantley Grange'' (1874) and ''Nelly Hamilton'' (1875), while an uncle, William Bradley of Leamington, wrote ''Sketches of the Poor by a retired Guardian.''\n\nAfter education at the [[King Charles I School|Kidderminster grammar school]], Bradley went up in 1845 to [[University College, Durham]], where he was a Thorp and foundation scholar. He graduated B.A. in 1848, and took his licentiateship of theology in 1849. Not being of age to take orders, he appears to have stayed a year at Oxford, pursuing various studies, though he never matriculated, and while there he formed a lifelong friendship with [[John George Wood]].\n\nFor a year or so he worked in the clergy schools at Kidderminster. In 1850, he was ordained by the [[bishop of Ely]], [[Thomas Turton]], and appointed to the curacy of [[Glatton]]-with-[[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme]] in Huntingdonshire. He remained there over four years, during which he described for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' the extensive work of draining [[Whittlesey Mere]], then being carried out by [[William Wells (1818\u20131889)|William Wells]] of Holmewood.\n\nIn 1857, Bradley was appointed vicar of [[Donington, Shropshire|Donington]] in Shropshire. From 1859 to 1871, he was rector of [[Denton, Cambridgeshire|Denton]]-with-[[Caldecote, Huntingdonshire|Caldecote]], Huntingdonshire. In 1871, he became rector of [[Stretton, Rutland]], where he carried through a much-needed restoration of the church, at a cost of nearly \u00a32,000. To raise the funds he gave lectures in the midland towns, and was much in demand as an authority upon ''Modern Humourists,'' ''Wit and Humour,'' and ''Light Literature.''{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n \nBradley was a friend and associate of [[George Cruikshank]], [[Frank Smedley]], [[Mark Lemon]], and [[Albert Richard Smith|Albert Smith]] (for whose serials, ''The Month,'' ''The Man in the Moon,'' and ''The Town and Country Miscellany,'' he began to write about 1850). He generally wrote for the press under the pseudonym of '''Cuthbert Bede,''' the names of the two patron saints of Durham. \n\nHis one marked literary success was obtained in 1853, when he produced ''The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green, an Oxford Freshman. With numerous illustrations designed and drawn on the wood by the author.'' \nBradley had the greatest difficulty in finding a publisher, but part i. was eventually issued by [[Nathaniel Cooke]] of the Strand as one of his shilling ''Books for the Rail'' in October 1853. Part ii. appeared in 1854, and part iii. in 1856. The three parts were then bound in one volume, of which one hundred thousand copies had been sold by 1870 ; subsequently the book was issued in a sixpenny form, and the sale was more than doubled. The total amount that Bradley received for his work was \u00a3350. The three original parts were scarce and fetched over five guineas in 1890. The picture of 'Master Verdant kissing the Maids on the Stairs after his return from Oxford College' was omitted from the later editions.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n \nVerdant Green contains portraits of [[Frederick Charles Plumptre|Dr. Plumptre]], vice-chancellor 1848\u201362, Dr. Bliss, registrar of the university, and 'the waiter at the Mitre,' while Mr. Bouncer reproduces many traits of the Rev. J. G. Wood. \nVerdant Green himself is a kind of undergraduate [[Samuel Pickwick]], and the book is full of harmless fun. \nWhen we regard the difficulty of the subject, the general fidelity with which one side of university life is depicted, and the fact that Bradley was not himself an Oxford man, we can scarcely refuse a certain measure of genius to the author. \n[[Hippolyte Taine]] used it effectively (together with ''[[Pendennis]]'' and ''[[Tom Brown at Oxford]]'') as material for his tableau of an English university in his ''Notes sur l'Angleterre''. A sequel by Bradley, produced many years later as ''Little Mr. Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green'' (1878), did not approach the original in vigour, nor can much success be claimed for the Cambridge rival of ''Verdant Green'', ''The Cambridge Freshman, or Memoirs of Mr. Golightly'' (1871), by Martin Legrand (i.e. James Rice), with illustrations by '[[Phiz]].'{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n \nIn 1883, on the presentation of [[Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster|Lord Aveland]], Bradley left Stretton for the vicarage of [[Lenton, Lincolnshire|Lenton]] with [[Hanby, Lincolnshire|Hanby]], near Grantham. There, as elsewhere, he was indefatigable as a parochial organiser, establishing a free library, a school bank, winter entertainments, and improvement societies.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\nHe died, greatly regretted by all who came into contact with his kindly personality, at the vicarage, Lenton, on 12 December 1889. He was buried in the churchyard of Stretton, which he had laid out during his incumbency there.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\n==Family==\nIn December 1858 he married Harriet Amelia, youngest daughter of Samuel Hancocks of Wolverley, Worcester. \nBy her he left two sons, the artist [[Cuthbert Bradley]] and the Rev. Henry Waldron Bradley.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}} Another son, William Hancocks Bradley, died in 1874, aged 12.\n\n==Works==\nCommencing with ''Bentley's'' in 1846, Bradley (as E. B. or 'Cuthbert Bede') contributed to a great number of papers and periodicals, including ''Punch'' (1847\u201355), ''All the Year Round,'' ''Illustrated London Magazine'' (1853\u201355), ''The Field,'' ''St. James's'' and ''The Gentleman's'' magazines, ''Leisure Hour,'' ''Quiver,'' ''Notes and Queries'' (1852\u20131886), ''The Boy's Own Paper,'' ''[[London Figaro]]'' and the ''Illustrated London News,'' for which paper he conducted a double [[acrostic]] column, commencing 30 August 1856. He claimed to have reintroduced the double acrostic into England.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\nHe wrote under the name of '''Cuthbert M. Bede, BA''' a few novels and tales, ''Fairy Fables'' (1858), ''Glencraggan'' (1861), ''Fotheringhay'' (1885), etc. His most popular book was ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green]]'', on the experiences of an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate. There was a sequel, ''Little Mr Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green''. ''Tales of College Life'' (often bound with it), introduces the character of ''Mr Affable Canary''.

A sequel by Bradley, produced many years later as ''Little Mr. Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green'' (1878), did not approach the original in vigour, nor can much success be claimed for the Cambridge rival of ''Verdant Green'', ''The Cambridge Freshman, or Memoirs of Mr. Golightly'' (1871), by Martin Legrand (i.e. James Rice), with illustrations by '[[Phiz]].'{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n \nIn 1883, on the presentation of [[Gilbert Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 1st Earl of Ancaster|Lord Aveland]], Bradley left Stretton for the vicarage of [[Lenton, Lincolnshire|Lenton]] with [[Hanby, Lincolnshire|Hanby]], near Grantham. There, as elsewhere, he was indefatigable as a parochial organiser, establishing a free library, a school bank, winter entertainments, and improvement societies.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\nHe died, greatly regretted by all who came into contact with his kindly personality, at the vicarage, Lenton, on 12 December 1889. He was buried in the churchyard of Stretton, which he had laid out during his incumbency there.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\n==Family==\nIn December 1858 he married Harriet Amelia, youngest daughter of Samuel Hancocks of Wolverley, Worcester. \nBy her he left two sons, the artist [[Cuthbert Bradley]] and the Rev. Henry Waldron Bradley.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}} Another son, William Hancocks Bradley, died in 1874, aged 12.\n\n==Works==\nCommencing with ''Bentley's'' in 1846, Bradley (as E. B. or 'Cuthbert Bede') contributed to a great number of papers and periodicals, including ''Punch'' (1847\u201355), ''All the Year Round,'' ''Illustrated London Magazine'' (1853\u201355), ''The Field,'' ''St. James's'' and ''The Gentleman's'' magazines, ''Leisure Hour,'' ''Quiver,'' ''Notes and Queries'' (1852\u20131886), ''The Boy's Own Paper,'' ''[[London Figaro]]'' and the ''Illustrated London News,'' for which paper he conducted a double [[acrostic]] column, commencing 30 August 1856. He claimed to have reintroduced the double acrostic into England.{{sfn|Seccombe|1901}}\n\nHe wrote under the name of '''Cuthbert M. Bede, BA''' a few novels and tales, ''Fairy Fables'' (1858), ''Glencraggan'' (1861), ''Fotheringhay'' (1885), etc. His most popular book was ''[[The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green]]'', on the experiences of an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate. There was a sequel, ''Little Mr Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green''. ''Tales of College Life'' (often bound with it), introduces the character of ''Mr Affable Canary''. The celebrated illustrations to the Verdant Green books were the work of the author.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Internet Archive|22581790.1799.emory.edu|The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green, An Oxford Freshman}} (3 parts, 1853-7)\n*''Little Mr Bouncer and his friend, Verdant Green''\n*''Tales of College Life.''\n*''Fairy Fables'' (1858).\n*''Glencraggan'' (1861).\n*''Photographic Pleasures'' (1855).\n*{{Internet Archive|10621195.1805.emory.edu|The white wife : with other stories, supernatural, romantic and legendary}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Attribution\n{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Bradley, Edward |first=Thomas|last=Seccombe}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[http://www.authorandbookinfo.com/cgi-bin/auth.pl?B006944 Author and Bookinfo.com]\n\n==External links==\n*{{wikisource author-inline|Edward Bradley}}\n*{{commonscat-inline|Edward Bradley}}\n* {{Gutenberg author |id=Bede,+Cuthbert | name=Cuthbert Bede}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |name=Cuthbert Bede |birth=1827 |death=1889}}\n*[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/oct2009.html Photographic Pleasures at Glasgow University library]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bradley, Edward}}\n[[Category:1827 births]]\n[[Category:1889 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Kidderminster]]\n[[Category:19th-century English Anglican priests]]\n[[Category:Alumni of University College, Durham]]\n[[Category:English male novelists]]\n[[Category:19th-century English novelists]]\n[[Category:19th-century British male writers]]\n[[Category:Burials in Rutland]]\n", "name_user": "Mandarax", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bradley_(writer)"}

Today the toys can be ordered online from retailers such as Only Toys and Darda UK. In Sweden, Darda Sweden is both wholesaler and retailer for Sweden and Scandinavia.\n\nThe [[unique selling point]] of the sets is the special Darda Motor, invented by Helmut Darda in 1970,<ref name=darda>{{cite web|title=Darda Cars|url=http://www.darda.co.uk/}}</ref> propelled the cars (similarly sized to [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] or [[Hot Wheels]]) at speeds of up to 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h). The [[pullback motor]] is wound up by pressing down the rear of the car and rolling it forwards and backwards on its wheels.<ref name=darda/> Whilst winding the car up the motor clicks and once fully wound the tone of clicks deepens to signify that it can be wound no more.\n\nThe cars can be run on any surface but are designed to be run on special Darda tracks which can be bought as sets or individual track pieces. The tracks incorporate loops, jumps, curves and crossovers, and can be combined into quite elaborate creations including multi-level loops and Y-shaped return curves.\n\nAs with Hot Wheels and Matchbox, a range of cars is available. As Darda was originally a German company, many of the cars were based on German brands such as VW and Porsche. Various special cars were also created including a dragster and a mouse (which could not run on the Darda tracks as it was too wide). Another variant available in the late '80s was a replica [[KITT]] (Knight Industries Two Thousand) from the US television series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. Recent models have included custom NASCAR racers, patrol cars from a variety of police forces including the New York Police Department, and a series of mounted collectible cars.\n\nIn the late '80s a new version of the Darda motor was introduced, called the Darda-Stop motor (later renamed to the Darda Stop-n-Go motor), it allowed the motor to be locked once wound so that the car could be placed on the track without immediately setting off. This allowed for longer tracks and 'tag-team' relay style racing where once the first car had gone round the track and just run out of power, it would tap the back of the wound up one and set it going. Ultraspeed cars, with lightweight plastic bodies rather than die-cast ones, were also introduced.\n\nDarda products were packaged in a distinctive yellow and green packaging; today the color scheme has shifted to grays, blacks and blues.\n\n== Understanding Toys ==\nToys give a feeling of psychological comfort and safety, but a long-time dependency on it can result in isolation from real life. Toys can be damaged during the delivery procedure, and ought to be returned since they are unsafe to play with. Most toys have an age recommendation.

In Sweden, Darda Sweden is both wholesaler and retailer for Sweden and Scandinavia.\n\nThe [[unique selling point]] of the sets is the special Darda Motor, invented by Helmut Darda in 1970,<ref name=darda>{{cite web|title=Darda Cars|url=http://www.darda.co.uk/}}</ref> propelled the cars (similarly sized to [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] or [[Hot Wheels]]) at speeds of up to 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h). The [[pullback motor]] is wound up by pressing down the rear of the car and rolling it forwards and backwards on its wheels.<ref name=darda/> Whilst winding the car up the motor clicks and once fully wound the tone of clicks deepens to signify that it can be wound no more.\n\nThe cars can be run on any surface but are designed to be run on special Darda tracks which can be bought as sets or individual track pieces. The tracks incorporate loops, jumps, curves and crossovers, and can be combined into quite elaborate creations including multi-level loops and Y-shaped return curves.\n\nAs with Hot Wheels and Matchbox, a range of cars is available. As Darda was originally a German company, many of the cars were based on German brands such as VW and Porsche. Various special cars were also created including a dragster and a mouse (which could not run on the Darda tracks as it was too wide). Another variant available in the late '80s was a replica [[KITT]] (Knight Industries Two Thousand) from the US television series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. Recent models have included custom NASCAR racers, patrol cars from a variety of police forces including the New York Police Department, and a series of mounted collectible cars.\n\nIn the late '80s a new version of the Darda motor was introduced, called the Darda-Stop motor (later renamed to the Darda Stop-n-Go motor), it allowed the motor to be locked once wound so that the car could be placed on the track without immediately setting off. This allowed for longer tracks and 'tag-team' relay style racing where once the first car had gone round the track and just run out of power, it would tap the back of the wound up one and set it going. Ultraspeed cars, with lightweight plastic bodies rather than die-cast ones, were also introduced.\n\nDarda products were packaged in a distinctive yellow and green packaging; today the color scheme has shifted to grays, blacks and blues.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Darda toys}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darda (Toy)}}\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n", "name_user": "Nick Emberman", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added further information.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darda_(toy)"}

For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called [[wear leveling]] to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD.\n\nIn a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. The process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Relocating data increases [[write amplification]] and adds to the wear of flash memory. Designers seek to minimize both.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |title       = Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives\n |date        = 2011-02-18\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Arnd Bergmann\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007144837/http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |title       = LogFS\n |date        = 2007-05-15\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Jonathan Corbet\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215514/https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-04\n}}</ref>\n\n===Memory===\n\n====Flash memory====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 30em; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0;\"\n|+ Comparison of architectures<ref>[http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ SLC and MLC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405082307/http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ |date=2013-04-05 }} SSD Festplatten.

The first units were intended to replace or augment hard disk drives, so the operating system recognized them as a hard drive. Originally, solid state drives were even shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. Later SSDs became smaller and more compact, eventually developing their own unique form factors such as the [[M.2]] form factor. The SSD was designed to be installed permanently inside a computer.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/>\n\nIn contrast, memory cards (such as [[Secure Digital]] (SD), [[CompactFlash]] (CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/> There are adapters which enable some memory cards to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer.{{citation needed |date=August 2019}} The typical [[CompactFlash]] card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As memory cards are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.\n\n== SSD failure ==\n\nSSDs have very different [[failure mode]]s than traditional magnetic hard drives. Because of their design, some kinds of failure are inapplicable (motors or magnetic heads cannot fail, because they are not needed in an SSD). Instead, other kinds of failure are possible (for example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power failure can be more of a problem than with HDDs, and if a chip fails then all the data on it is lost, a scenario not applicable to magnetic drives). However, on the whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable, and often continue working far beyond the expected lifetime as stated by their manufacturer.<ref name=\"2016study\">[http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/23105-fast16-papers-schroeder.pdf Flash Reliability in Production: The Expected and the Unexpected] - Schroeder, Lagisetty & Merchant, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== SSD reliability and failure modes===\nAn early test by ''[[Techreport.com]]'' which ran for 18 months during 2013 - 2015 had previously tested a number of SSDs to destruction to identify how and at what point they failed; the test found that \"All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue\", described as being far beyond any usual size for a \"typical consumer\".<ref name=\"TR2015\">{{cite web|url=https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead|title=The SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead|first=Geoff|last=Gasior|website=The Tech Report}}</ref> The first SSD to fail was a TLC based drive - a type of design expected to be less durable than either SLC or MLC - and the SSD concerned managed to write over 800,000 GB (800 TB or 0.8 [[petabyte]]s) before failing; three SSDs in the test managed to write almost three times that amount (almost 2.5 PB) before they also failed.<ref name=\"TR2015\"/> So the capability of even consumer SSDs to be remarkably reliable was already established.\n\nA 2016 study<ref name=\"2016study\" /> of \"millions of drive days\" in production use by SSDs over a six-year period, reported that \"4-10%\" of their SSDs were replaced in a 4-year period and concluded based upon annual failure rates of HDDs published in 2007 that SSDs fail at a \"significantly lower\" rate than HDDs; however a 2016 study of 71,940 HDDs (26 million drive days) reported annual failure rates comparable to the reported SSD rates, that is, the HDDs on the average had a calculated four year failure rate of 7.5% and with a lowest rate of 1.6%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-stats-for-2018/\n |title=Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2018\n |last=Klein\n |first=Andy\n |date=January 19, 2019\n |website=\n |publisher=Backblaze\n |access-date=February 13, 2019\n |quote= The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) for 2018 for all [hard disk] drive models was just 1.25%, well below the rates from previous years ...}}\nFour year rate calculated from published AFR.</ref>  The 2016 SDD study concluded SSD localized data loss due to unreadable blocks to be more of a problem than with HDDs. It also contained a number of \"unexpected conclusions\"\n\n* In the real world, [[Multi-level cell|MLC]] based designs - believed less reliable than [[Single-level cell|SLC]] designs - are often as reliable as SLC. (The findings state that \"SLC [is] not generally more reliable than MLC\")\n* Device age, measured by days in use, is the main factor in SSD reliability, and not amount of data read or written, which are measured by TBW or DWPD. Because this finding persists after controlling for early failure and other factors, it is likely that factors such as \"silicon aging\" is a cause of this trend. The correlation is significant (around 0.2 - 0.4).\n* Raw bit error rates (RBER) grows much slower than usually believed and is not exponential as often assumed, nor is it a good predictor of other errors or SSD failure.\n* The uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) is widely used but is not a good predictor of failure either. However SSD UBER rates are higher than those for HDDs, so although they do not predict failure, they can lead to data loss due to unreadable blocks being more common on SSDs than HDDs. The conclusion states that although more reliable overall, the rate of uncorrectable errors able to impact a user is larger.\n* \"Bad blocks in new SSDs are common, and drives with a large number of bad blocks are much more likely to lose hundreds of other blocks, most likely due to die or chip failure. 30-80 percent of SSDs develop at least one bad block and 2-7 percent develop at least one bad chip in the first four years of deployment.\"\n* There is no sharp increase in errors after the expected lifetime is reached.\n* Most SSDs develop no more than a few bad blocks, perhaps 2 - 4. SSDs that develop many bad blocks often go on to develop far more (perhaps hundreds), and may be prone to failure. However most drives (99%+) are shipped with bad blocks from manufacture. The finding overall was that bad blocks are common and 30-80% of drives will develop at least one in use, but even a few bad blocks (2 - 4) is a predictor of up to hundreds of bad blocks at a later time. The bad block count at manufacture correlates with later development of further bad blocks. The report conclusion added that SSDs tended to either have \"less than a handful\" of bad blocks or \"a large number\", and suggested that this might be a basis for predicting eventual failure.\n* Around 2-7% of SSDs will develop bad chips in their first 4 years of use. Over 2/3 of these chips will have breached their manufacturers' tolerances and specifications, which typically guarantee that no more than 2% of blocks on a chip will fail within its expected write lifetime.\n* 96% of those SSDs that need repair (warranty servicing), need repair only once in their life. Days between repair vary from \"a couple of thousand days\" to \"nearly 15,000 days\" depending on the model.\n\n===Data recovery and secure deletion===\nSolid state drives have set new challenges for [[data recovery]] companies, as the way of storing data is non-linear and much more complex than that of hard disk drives. The strategy the drive operates by internally can largely vary between manufacturers, and the TRIM command zeroes the whole range of a deleted file. Wear leveling also means that the physical address of the data and the address exposed to the operating system are different.\n\nAs for secure deletion of data, ATA Secure Erase command could be used. A program such as [[hdparm]] can be used for this purpose.\n\n===Endurance===\nThe ''[[JEDEC Solid State Technology Association]]'' (JEDEC) has published standards for reliability metrics:<ref name=\"NullLobur2014\">{{cite book|last1=Null|first1=Linda|last2=Lobur|first2=Julia|title=The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKgxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT499|date=14 February 2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-15077-3|pages=499\u2013500}}</ref>\n* Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)\n* Terabytes Written (TBW) - The number of terabytes that can be written to a drive within its warranty.\n* Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD) - The number of times the total capacity of the drive may be written to per day within its warranty.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to their generally prohibitive cost versus HDD's at the time, until 2009, SSDs were mainly used in those aspects of [[mission critical]] applications where the speed of the [[computer data storage|storage system]] needed to be as high as possible. Since flash memory has become a common component of SSDs, the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications. For instance, in the [[distributed computing]] environment, SSDs can be used as the building block for a [[distributed cache]] layer that temporarily absorbs the large volume of user requests to the slower HDD based backend storage system. This layer provides much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the storage system, and can be managed in a number of forms, such as distributed [[key-value database]] and distributed [[file system]]. On the supercomputers, this layer is typically referred to as [[burst buffer]]. With this fast layer, users often experience shorter system response time. Organizations that can benefit from faster access of system data include [[equity securities#Trading|equity trading]] companies, [[telecommunication]] corporations, and [[streaming media]] and [[video editing]] firms. The list of applications which could benefit from faster storage is vast.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/>\n\nFlash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purpose [[personal computer]] hardware. A [[write protection|write protected]] flash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nSSDs based on an [[SD card]] with a [[live SD]] operating system are easily [[SD card#Optional write-protect tab|write-locked]]. Combined with a [[cloud computing]] environment or other writable medium, to maintain [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]], an [[operating system|OS]] [[booting|booted]] from a write-locked SD card is robust, rugged, reliable, and impervious to permanent corruption. If the running OS degrades, simply turning the machine off and then on returns it back to its initial uncorrupted state and thus is particularly solid. The SD card installed OS does not require removal of corrupted components since it was write-locked though any written media may need to be restored.\n\n===Hard drives caching===\nIn 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for their [[Z68]] chipset (and mobile derivatives) called [[Smart Response Technology]], which allows a [[SATA]] SSD to be used as a [[cache (computing)|cache]] (configurable as write-through or [[write-back]]) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |title=Intel Z68 Chipset & Smart Response Technology (SSD Caching) Review |publisher=AnandTech |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505222631/http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |archivedate=2012-05-05 }}</ref> A similar technology is available on [[HighPoint]]'s RocketHybrid [[PCIe]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/rockethybrid-1220-ssd-caching,2936.html |title=SSD Caching (Without Z68): HighPoint's RocketHybrid 1220 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from the [[magnetic storage]] by the host using [[ATA-8]] commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft's [[ReadyDrive]] technology explicitly stores portions of the [[hibernation (computing)#Microsoft Windows|hibernation file]] in the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.<ref name=\"RussinovichSolomon2009b\">{{cite book |author1=Mark E.

Examples of this type of system are [[bcache]] and [[dm-cache]] on [[Linux]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |title       = Advanced Hard Drive Caching Techniques\n |date        = 2013-11-25\n |accessdate  = 2013-12-02\n |author      = Petros Koutoupis\n |publisher   = linuxjournal.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202152028/http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |archivedate = 2013-12-02\n}}</ref> and Apple's [[Fusion Drive]].\n\n=={{anchor|Page alignment|Block alignment|Partition alignment}}File system support for SSDs==\n{{Main|List of file systems#File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media|l1=File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media}}\n\nTypically the same [[file system]]s used on hard disk drives can also be used on solid state drives. It is usually expected for the file system to support the [[Trim (computing)|TRIM command]] which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data (support for TRIM arrived some years after SSDs themselves but is now nearly universal). This means that file system does not need to manage [[wear leveling]] or other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Some flash file systems using [[log-structured file system|log-based]] designs ([[F2FS]], [[JFFS2]]) help to reduce write amplification on SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updating [[file system#Metadata|file-system metadata]].\n\nWhile not a file system feature, operating systems should also aim to [[partition alignment|align partitions]] correctly, which avoids excessive [[read-modify-write]] cycles. A typical practice for personal computers is to have each partition aligned to start at a 1&nbsp;[[binary prefix|MiB]] (= 1,048,576 bytes) mark, which covers all common SSD page and block size scenarios, as it is divisible by all commonly used sizes - 1&nbsp;MiB, 512&nbsp;KiB, 128&nbsp;KiB, 4&nbsp;KiB, and 512&nbsp;B. Modern operating system installation software and disk tools handle this automatically.\n\n==={{Anchor|FSTRIM|QUEUED-TRIM}}Linux===\nThe [[ext4]], [[Btrfs]], [[XFS]], [[JFS (file system)|JFS]], and [[F2FS]] file systems include support for the discard (TRIM or UNMAP) function.\n\nKernel support for the TRIM operation was introduced in version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline, released on {{date|2010-02-24}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |title       = Linux kernel 2.6.33\n |date        = 2010-02-24\n |accessdate  = 2013-11-05\n |website     = kernelnewbies.org\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616025132/http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |archivedate = 2012-06-16\n}}</ref> To make use of it, a file system must be mounted using the <code>discard</code> parameter.

Without support for TRIM, the SSD would be unaware of this data being invalid and would unnecessarily continue to rewrite it during garbage collection causing further wear on the SSD. It is beneficial to make some changes that prevent SSDs from being treated more like HDDs, for example cancelling defragmentation, not filling them to more than about 75% of capacity, not storing frequently written-to files such as log and temporary files on them if a hard drive is available, and enabling the TRIM process.<ref>{{cite web |last=Yam |first=Marcus |title=Windows 7 and Optimization for Solid State Drives|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-solid-state-drives-ssd,7717.html |publisher=Tom's Hardware |accessdate=9 August 2010 |date=May 5, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |title=6 Things You Shouldn't Do With Solid-State Drives |newspaper=Howtogeek.com |accessdate=12 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313045015/http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |archivedate=13 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Windows 8.1====\nWindows 8.1 and later Windows systems like Windows 10 also support automatic TRIM for PCI Express SSDs based on [[NVM Express|NVMe]].

For this reason, SSD controllers use a technique called [[wear leveling]] to distribute writes as evenly as possible across all the flash blocks in the SSD.\n\nIn a perfect scenario, this would enable every block to be written to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. The process to evenly distribute writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Relocating data increases [[write amplification]] and adds to the wear of flash memory. Designers seek to minimize both.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |title       = Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives\n |date        = 2011-02-18\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Arnd Bergmann\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007144837/http://lwn.net/Articles/428584/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-07\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |title       = LogFS\n |date        = 2007-05-15\n |accessdate  = 2013-10-03\n |author      = Jonathan Corbet\n |publisher   = [[LWN.net]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215514/https://lwn.net/Articles/428799/\n |archivedate = 2013-10-04\n}}</ref>\n\n===Memory===\n\n====Flash memory====\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"width: 30em; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 0;\"\n|+ Comparison of architectures<ref>[http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ SLC and MLC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405082307/http://ssd-festplatte-kaufen.de/slc-und-mlc/ |date=2013-04-05 }} SSD Festplatten.

The first units were intended to replace or augment hard disk drives, so the operating system recognized them as a hard drive. Originally, solid state drives were even shaped and mounted in the computer like hard drives. Later SSDs became smaller and more compact, eventually developing their own unique form factors such as the [[M.2]] form factor. The SSD was designed to be installed permanently inside a computer.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/>\n\nIn contrast, memory cards (such as [[Secure Digital]] (SD), [[CompactFlash]] (CF), and many others) were originally designed for digital cameras and later found their way into cell phones, gaming devices, GPS units, etc. Most memory cards are physically smaller than SSDs, and designed to be inserted and removed repeatedly.<ref name=\"SanDisk_SSD_CF\"/> There are adapters which enable some memory cards to interface to a computer, allowing use as an SSD, but they are not intended to be the primary storage device in the computer.{{citation needed |date=August 2019}} The typical [[CompactFlash]] card interface is three to four times slower than an SSD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} As memory cards are not designed to tolerate the amount of reading and writing which occurs during typical computer use, their data may get damaged unless special procedures are taken to reduce the wear on the card to a minimum.\n\n== SSD failure ==\n\nSSDs have very different [[failure mode]]s than traditional magnetic hard drives. Because of their design, some kinds of failure are inapplicable (motors or magnetic heads cannot fail, because they are not needed in an SSD). Instead, other kinds of failure are possible (for example, incomplete or failed writes due to sudden power failure can be more of a problem than with HDDs, and if a chip fails then all the data on it is lost, a scenario not applicable to magnetic drives). However, on the whole statistics show that SSDs are generally highly reliable, and often continue working far beyond the expected lifetime as stated by their manufacturer.<ref name=\"2016study\">[http://0b4af6cdc2f0c5998459-c0245c5c937c5dedcca3f1764ecc9b2f.r43.cf2.rackcdn.com/23105-fast16-papers-schroeder.pdf Flash Reliability in Production: The Expected and the Unexpected] - Schroeder, Lagisetty & Merchant, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== SSD reliability and failure modes===\nAn early test by ''[[Techreport.com]]'' which ran for 18 months during 2013 - 2015 had previously tested a number of SSDs to destruction to identify how and at what point they failed; the test found that \"All of the drives surpassed their official endurance specifications by writing hundreds of terabytes without issue\", described as being far beyond any usual size for a \"typical consumer\".<ref name=\"TR2015\">{{cite web|url=https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-theyre-all-dead|title=The SSD Endurance Experiment: They're all dead|first=Geoff|last=Gasior|website=The Tech Report}}</ref> The first SSD to fail was a TLC based drive - a type of design expected to be less durable than either SLC or MLC - and the SSD concerned managed to write over 800,000 GB (800 TB or 0.8 [[petabyte]]s) before failing; three SSDs in the test managed to write almost three times that amount (almost 2.5 PB) before they also failed.<ref name=\"TR2015\"/> So the capability of even consumer SSDs to be remarkably reliable was already established.\n\nA 2016 study<ref name=\"2016study\" /> of \"millions of drive days\" in production use by SSDs over a six-year period, reported that \"4-10%\" of their SSDs were replaced in a 4-year period and concluded based upon annual failure rates of HDDs published in 2007 that SSDs fail at a \"significantly lower\" rate than HDDs; however a 2016 study of 71,940 HDDs (26 million drive days) reported annual failure rates comparable to the reported SSD rates, that is, the HDDs on the average had a calculated four year failure rate of 7.5% and with a lowest rate of 1.6%.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hard-drive-stats-for-2018/\n |title=Backblaze Hard Drive Stats for 2018\n |last=Klein\n |first=Andy\n |date=January 19, 2019\n |website=\n |publisher=Backblaze\n |access-date=February 13, 2019\n |quote= The Annualized Failure Rate (AFR) for 2018 for all [hard disk] drive models was just 1.25%, well below the rates from previous years ...}}\nFour year rate calculated from published AFR.</ref>  The 2016 SDD study concluded SSD localized data loss due to unreadable blocks to be more of a problem than with HDDs. It also contained a number of \"unexpected conclusions\"\n\n* In the real world, [[Multi-level cell|MLC]] based designs - believed less reliable than [[Single-level cell|SLC]] designs - are often as reliable as SLC. (The findings state that \"SLC [is] not generally more reliable than MLC\")\n* Device age, measured by days in use, is the main factor in SSD reliability, and not amount of data read or written, which are measured by TBW or DWPD. Because this finding persists after controlling for early failure and other factors, it is likely that factors such as \"silicon aging\" is a cause of this trend. The correlation is significant (around 0.2 - 0.4).\n* Raw bit error rates (RBER) grows much slower than usually believed and is not exponential as often assumed, nor is it a good predictor of other errors or SSD failure.\n* The uncorrectable bit error rate (UBER) is widely used but is not a good predictor of failure either. However SSD UBER rates are higher than those for HDDs, so although they do not predict failure, they can lead to data loss due to unreadable blocks being more common on SSDs than HDDs. The conclusion states that although more reliable overall, the rate of uncorrectable errors able to impact a user is larger.\n* \"Bad blocks in new SSDs are common, and drives with a large number of bad blocks are much more likely to lose hundreds of other blocks, most likely due to die or chip failure. 30-80 percent of SSDs develop at least one bad block and 2-7 percent develop at least one bad chip in the first four years of deployment.\"\n* There is no sharp increase in errors after the expected lifetime is reached.\n* Most SSDs develop no more than a few bad blocks, perhaps 2 - 4. SSDs that develop many bad blocks often go on to develop far more (perhaps hundreds), and may be prone to failure. However most drives (99%+) are shipped with bad blocks from manufacture. The finding overall was that bad blocks are common and 30-80% of drives will develop at least one in use, but even a few bad blocks (2 - 4) is a predictor of up to hundreds of bad blocks at a later time. The bad block count at manufacture correlates with later development of further bad blocks. The report conclusion added that SSDs tended to either have \"less than a handful\" of bad blocks or \"a large number\", and suggested that this might be a basis for predicting eventual failure.\n* Around 2-7% of SSDs will develop bad chips in their first 4 years of use. Over 2/3 of these chips will have breached their manufacturers' tolerances and specifications, which typically guarantee that no more than 2% of blocks on a chip will fail within its expected write lifetime.\n* 96% of those SSDs that need repair (warranty servicing), need repair only once in their life. Days between repair vary from \"a couple of thousand days\" to \"nearly 15,000 days\" depending on the model.\n\n===Data recovery and secure deletion===\nSolid state drives have set new challenges for [[data recovery]] companies, as the way of storing data is non-linear and much more complex than that of hard disk drives. The strategy the drive operates by internally can largely vary between manufacturers, and the TRIM command zeroes the whole range of a deleted file. Wear leveling also means that the physical address of the data and the address exposed to the operating system are different.\n\nAs for secure deletion of data, ATA Secure Erase command could be used. A program such as [[hdparm]] can be used for this purpose.\n\n===Endurance===\nThe ''[[JEDEC Solid State Technology Association]]'' (JEDEC) has published standards for reliability metrics:<ref name=\"NullLobur2014\">{{cite book|last1=Null|first1=Linda|last2=Lobur|first2=Julia|title=The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKgxDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT499|date=14 February 2014|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-1-284-15077-3|pages=499\u2013500}}</ref>\n* Unrecoverable Bit Error Ratio (UBER)\n* Terabytes Written (TBW) - The number of terabytes that can be written to a drive within its warranty.\n* Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD) - The number of times the total capacity of the drive may be written to per day within its warranty.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to their generally prohibitive cost versus HDD's at the time, until 2009, SSDs were mainly used in those aspects of [[mission critical]] applications where the speed of the [[computer data storage|storage system]] needed to be as high as possible. Since flash memory has become a common component of SSDs, the falling prices and increased densities have made it more cost-effective for many other applications. For instance, in the [[distributed computing]] environment, SSDs can be used as the building block for a [[distributed cache]] layer that temporarily absorbs the large volume of user requests to the slower HDD based backend storage system. This layer provides much higher bandwidth and lower latency than the storage system, and can be managed in a number of forms, such as distributed [[key-value database]] and distributed [[file system]]. On the supercomputers, this layer is typically referred to as [[burst buffer]]. With this fast layer, users often experience shorter system response time. Organizations that can benefit from faster access of system data include [[equity securities#Trading|equity trading]] companies, [[telecommunication]] corporations, and [[streaming media]] and [[video editing]] firms. The list of applications which could benefit from faster storage is vast.<ref name=\"SNIA-101\"/>\n\nFlash-based solid-state drives can be used to create network appliances from general-purpose [[personal computer]] hardware. A [[write protection|write protected]] flash drive containing the operating system and application software can substitute for larger, less reliable disk drives or CD-ROMs. Appliances built this way can provide an inexpensive alternative to expensive router and firewall hardware.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nSSDs based on an [[SD card]] with a [[live SD]] operating system are easily [[SD card#Optional write-protect tab|write-locked]]. Combined with a [[cloud computing]] environment or other writable medium, to maintain [[persistence (computer science)|persistence]], an [[operating system|OS]] [[booting|booted]] from a write-locked SD card is robust, rugged, reliable, and impervious to permanent corruption. If the running OS degrades, simply turning the machine off and then on returns it back to its initial uncorrupted state and thus is particularly solid. The SD card installed OS does not require removal of corrupted components since it was write-locked though any written media may need to be restored.\n\n===Hard drives caching===\nIn 2011, Intel introduced a caching mechanism for their [[Z68]] chipset (and mobile derivatives) called [[Smart Response Technology]], which allows a [[SATA]] SSD to be used as a [[cache (computing)|cache]] (configurable as write-through or [[write-back]]) for a conventional, magnetic hard disk drive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |title=Intel Z68 Chipset & Smart Response Technology (SSD Caching) Review |publisher=AnandTech |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505222631/http://www.anandtech.com/show/4329/intel-z68-chipset-smart-response-technology-ssd-caching-review/2 |archivedate=2012-05-05 }}</ref> A similar technology is available on [[HighPoint]]'s RocketHybrid [[PCIe]] card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/rockethybrid-1220-ssd-caching,2936.html |title=SSD Caching (Without Z68): HighPoint's RocketHybrid 1220 |publisher=Tom's Hardware |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Solid-state hybrid drive]]s (SSHDs) are based on the same principle, but integrate some amount of flash memory on board of a conventional drive instead of using a separate SSD. The flash layer in these drives can be accessed independently from the [[magnetic storage]] by the host using [[ATA-8]] commands, allowing the operating system to manage it. For example, Microsoft's [[ReadyDrive]] technology explicitly stores portions of the [[hibernation (computing)#Microsoft Windows|hibernation file]] in the cache of these drives when the system hibernates, making the subsequent resume faster.<ref name=\"RussinovichSolomon2009b\">{{cite book |author1=Mark E.

Examples of this type of system are [[bcache]] and [[dm-cache]] on [[Linux]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |title       = Advanced Hard Drive Caching Techniques\n |date        = 2013-11-25\n |accessdate  = 2013-12-02\n |author      = Petros Koutoupis\n |publisher   = linuxjournal.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131202152028/http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/advanced-hard-drive-caching-techniques\n |archivedate = 2013-12-02\n}}</ref> and Apple's [[Fusion Drive]].\n\n=={{anchor|Page alignment|Block alignment|Partition alignment}}File system support for SSDs==\n{{Main|List of file systems#File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media|l1=File systems optimized for flash memory, solid state media}}\n\nTypically the same [[file system]]s used on hard disk drives can also be used on solid state drives. It is usually expected for the file system to support the [[Trim (computing)|TRIM command]] which helps the SSD to recycle discarded data (support for TRIM arrived some years after SSDs themselves but is now nearly universal). This means that file system does not need to manage [[wear leveling]] or other flash memory characteristics, as they are handled internally by the SSD. Some flash file systems using [[log-structured file system|log-based]] designs ([[F2FS]], [[JFFS2]]) help to reduce write amplification on SSDs, especially in situations where only very small amounts of data are changed, such as when updating [[file system#Metadata|file-system metadata]].\n\nWhile not a file system feature, operating systems should also aim to [[partition alignment|align partitions]] correctly, which avoids excessive [[read-modify-write]] cycles. A typical practice for personal computers is to have each partition aligned to start at a 1&nbsp;[[binary prefix|MiB]] (= 1,048,576 bytes) mark, which covers all common SSD page and block size scenarios, as it is divisible by all commonly used sizes - 1&nbsp;MiB, 512&nbsp;KiB, 128&nbsp;KiB, 4&nbsp;KiB, and 512&nbsp;B. Modern operating system installation software and disk tools handle this automatically.\n\n==={{Anchor|FSTRIM|QUEUED-TRIM}}Linux===\nThe [[ext4]], [[Btrfs]], [[XFS]], [[JFS (file system)|JFS]], and [[F2FS]] file systems include support for the discard (TRIM or UNMAP) function.\n\nKernel support for the TRIM operation was introduced in version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline, released on {{date|2010-02-24}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |title       = Linux kernel 2.6.33\n |date        = 2010-02-24\n |accessdate  = 2013-11-05\n |website     = kernelnewbies.org\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120616025132/http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33\n |archivedate = 2012-06-16\n}}</ref> To make use of it, a file system must be mounted using the <code>discard</code> parameter.

Without support for TRIM, the SSD would be unaware of this data being invalid and would unnecessarily continue to rewrite it during garbage collection causing further wear on the SSD. It is beneficial to make some changes that prevent SSDs from being treated more like HDDs, for example cancelling defragmentation, not filling them to more than about 75% of capacity, not storing frequently written-to files such as log and temporary files on them if a hard drive is available, and enabling the TRIM process.<ref>{{cite web |last=Yam |first=Marcus |title=Windows 7 and Optimization for Solid State Drives|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-solid-state-drives-ssd,7717.html |publisher=Tom's Hardware |accessdate=9 August 2010 |date=May 5, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |title=6 Things You Shouldn't Do With Solid-State Drives |newspaper=Howtogeek.com |accessdate=12 March 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313045015/http://www.howtogeek.com/165472/6-things-you-shouldnt-do-with-solid-state-drives/ |archivedate=13 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Windows 8.1====\nWindows 8.1 and later Windows systems like Windows 10 also support automatic TRIM for PCI Express SSDs based on [[NVM Express|NVMe]].

In 1967 he embarked on a career in transportation design. Among his proposed projects were a gas-powered single seat city car, an electric city car, a Reliant-based three-wheeled car, an expandable six-wheeled vehicle, a small car based on the [[Mini Moke]] chassis, and a high-performance mid-engined grand touring car that became the Ikenga GT.<ref name=\"dwij-auto\"/>\n\nGittens bought a used [[McLaren]] chassis from Ken Sheppard.<ref name=\"dwij-mk1\"/><ref name=\"msm-aug2016\"/> Sheppard was also to handle limited production of the car.<ref name=\"beaulieu\"/> For development Gittens turned to Charles Williams of [[Williams & Pritchard (coachbuilders)|Williams & Pritchard]] coachbuilders.

'''[[Ikenga]]''' is a spirit often represented by a horned statue in Gittens' ancestral [[Igbo people|Igbo]] culture. Ikenga represents human achievement, accomplishment and success.\n\nThe first version of the car, later referred to as the Mk1, was completed in 1967.<ref name=\"dwij-mk1\"/> The somewhat blocky design of the Mk1 was quickly followed by the restyled MkII in 1968.<ref name=\"dwij-mk2\"/> In addition to the revised body shape, this version received a leather interior and an accompanying set of Gucci luggage. Some advanced lighting features were also introduced with the MkII.\n\nIn October 1968, during the [[British International Motor Show|Earls Court Motor Show]], the Ikenga MkII was displayed at the Banking Hall at Harrods. This location was chosen due to there being no provision for displaying experimental or prototype vehicles at the motor show venue.<ref name=\"msm-mar1969\"/> 30,000 people saw the car at the Banking Hall, including one who offered $53,000 for the prototype, and a Saudi prince who commissioned a unique version of the car to be called the \"Bird of Peace\" at a cost of $35,000.<ref name=\"ebony-sep1969\"/> This special does not appear to have been built.\n\nGittens planned a limited run of cars.

The MkII appeared on the cover of the April 1969 issue of [[Car and Driver]] magazine. In the summer of 1969 an American group made an offer for the US distribution rights to the car. One day later Charles Williams died suddenly. This was while the car was undergoing another restyling that would result in the MkIII.<ref name=\"dwij-mk2\"/> The car was transferred to the [[Harold Radford|Radford]] coachworks to have the work completed with the assistance of Roger Nathan among others.<ref name=\"dwij-mk3\"/> The car was complete by October 1969. It appeared in an episode of the BBC series ''Tomorrow's World'', then was sent to France where it was displayed at the 1969 Paris Auto Show. From there the car went to Italy, where it won an innovation award at the Turin Auto Show.<ref name=\"msm-aug2016\"/> In March 1970 the car appeared at the Swedish International Motor Show in Stockholm.\n\nEventually the car was seized by creditors, and Gittens returned to the United States.<ref name=\"chapmanbook\"/> Only one Ikenga GT was ever built.\n\nThe car was displayed at the Manx Motor Museum for some time and then was sold at auction in 1998 and again in 2008.<ref name=\"msm-aug2016\"/> It is believed to be somewhere in the Middle East.\n\nGittens would go on to use the name again for a line of gyroplanes called the Ikenga 530Z, one of which is part of the collection of the Smithsonian [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington DC.<ref name=\"charnovbook\"/><ref name=\"nasm-bio\"/>\n\n==Features==\n===Body and chassis===\nThe Ikenga GT was built on a McLaren-Elva Group 7 chassis.<ref name=\"msm-mar1969\"/> The chassis model was a McLaren M1B.<ref name=\"diseno-art\"/>\n\nThe aluminium bodywork was formed over the tubular steel frame.\n\nThe body of the Ikenga was meant to be evocative of an African mask facing skyward.

Only one was built, but that car went through three styling iterations. \n\n==History==\nDavid Gittens is a [[Brooklyn]]-born artist and designer who was a staff photographer at [[Car and Driver]] magazine from 1958 to 1964.<ref name=\"dwij-ikenga\"/> In 1964 he married and moved to London England, where he did photographic work for advertising and weddings. In 1967 he embarked on a career in transportation design. Among his proposed projects were a gas-powered single seat city car, an electric city car, a Reliant-based three-wheeled car, an expandable six-wheeled vehicle, a small car based on the [[Mini Moke]] chassis, and a high-performance mid-engined grand touring car that became the Ikenga GT.<ref name=\"dwij-auto\"/>\n\nGittens bought a used [[McLaren]] chassis from Ken Sheppard.<ref name=\"dwij-mk1\"/><ref name=\"msm-aug2016\"/> Sheppard was also to handle limited production of the car.<ref name=\"beaulieu\"/> For development Gittens turned to Charles Williams of [[Williams & Pritchard (coachbuilders)|Williams & Pritchard]] coachbuilders. Financing of the project was arranged through Copleys merchant bank.<ref name=\"chapmanbook\"/>\n\nThe car's name is of Nigerian origin. '''[[Ikenga]]''' is a spirit often represented by a horned statue in Gittens' ancestral [[Igbo people|Igbo]] culture.
