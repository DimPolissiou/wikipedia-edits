[[bacteria]] and [[archea]] make [[Vitamin B12|cobalamin]], vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Many steps are involved in converting [[aminolevulinic acid]] via [[uroporphyrinogen III]] and adenosylcobyric acid to the final forms in which it is used by [[enzymes]] in both the producing organisms and other species, including humans who acquire it through their diet.\n==Cobalamin==\n{{Main|Vitamin B12|l1=Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>}}\nCobalamin (vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) is a structurally complex [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]], consisting of a modified [[tetrapyrrole]] with a centrally [[chelated]] [[cobalt]]. It is usually found in one of two biologically active forms: [[methylcobalamin]] and [[adenosylcobalamin]]. Most [[prokaryotes]], as well as animals, have cobalamin-dependent enzymes, whereas [[plants]] and [[fungus|fungi]] do not use it. In [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], these enzymes include [[methionine synthase]], [[ribonucleotide reductase]], glutamate and [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]]s, [[ethanolamine ammonia-lyase]], and [[diol]] [[dehydratase]].<ref name=\"pmid12869542\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rodionov DA, Vitreschak AG, Mironov AA, Gelfand MS | title = Comparative genomics of the vitamin B12 metabolism and regulation in prokaryotes | journal = J.

His recent books, such as those retelling the stories of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', have been well received and critically acclaimed.<ref>New York Times, 2006</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nRobert Sabuda was born on the March 8, 1965 in [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]], [[Michigan]] and raised in [[Pinckney, Michigan|Pinckney]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=\"Harvnb Hedges\" /> He was skilled as an artist from a very young age, and attended the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[New York City]]. His specific interest in 3-D paper engineering (i.e., [[pop-up book]]s) was sparked by a book he received that was illustrated by [[Vojt\u011bch Kuba\u0161ta]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} His interest in children's book illustration began with an internship at ''Dial Books for Young Readers'' while attending the Pratt Institute. Initially working as a package designer, he illustrated his first children's book series, of \"Bulky Board Books\", in 1987. Wide recognition only came his way after he started designing pop-up books for children in 1994.<ref name=\"Harvnb Hedges\">{{Harvnb|Hedges|2003}}</ref>\n\nSabuda has experimented with modes of illustration in a conventionally conservative genre, using techniques including:\n\n* faux [[stained glass]] (Arthur and the Sword<ref>{{Harvnb|Sabuda|1995}}</ref>)\n* [[batik]] (Blizzard's Robe<ref>{{Harvnb|Sabuda|1999}}</ref>)\n* [[papyrus]]-textured illustrations (Tutankhamen's Gift<ref>{{Harvnb|Sabuda|June-1994}}</ref>)\n* [[mural]]s (Saint Valentine<ref>{{Harvnb|sabuda|1992}}</ref>)\n\nSabuda presently works from his studio in [[New York City]] and is involved in a wide variety of projects that involve movable paper. He has also released a video of his working style.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}  Sabuda has also been awarded the ''Meggendorfer Prize'' three times, an award instituted by the ''[http://www.movablebooksociety.org/ Movable Book Society of America]'' in honor of German illustrator [[Lothar Meggendorfer]]. He is a multiple No. 1 New York Times best-selling children's book creator and has over five million books in print published in over 25 languages.\n\nHe is married to NASDAQ technologist James Talvy. They got married on June 25, 2016 at their artist's retreat, ''[http://www.10horse.com/ 10 Horse Art Center]'' in Plutarch, New York.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== First editions ===\n\n====

It is an amalgamation of the '''[[Usher Gallery]]''' and the '''City and County Museum'''. The museum part of the enterprise is housed in a new, purpose-built building close by the Usher Gallery in the city of [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]].\n\n== History ==\n'The Collection' exists since 2005. It is a merge between the 'Usher Gallery,' that was established in 1927 and the 'City and County Museum', that was founded in 1906. The first curator of the Lincoln City and County Museum was Arthur Smith (1869\u20131947), who was born in Leicester and raised in [[Grimsby]] and who was interested in natural history.<ref name=collect>{{cite web | url=https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/about-us/history-of-the-museum |title=History of the Museum |publisher=The Collection |access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> After being appointed curator he moved to Lincoln. He became the (Honorary) Secretary of the Lincolnshire Naturalists' Union (LNU), and acquired important collections, for example from J.E. Mason (''[[Heteroptera]],'' bugs), W. Wallace (''[[Diptera]],'' flies) and G.W. Mason (''[[Lepidoptera]],'' butterflies).<ref name=nathist>{{cite web | url=https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/explore/natural-history |title=Natural History |publisher=The Collection |access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> The Museum also acquired important collections of bird specimen, for instance from [[George Henry Caton Haigh]].<ref name=Haigh>{{cite journal |title=Early twentieth century donors of bird specimens to the Lincoln County Museum\n|last=Kerry |first=Trevor |date=2015\n|journal=The Lincolnshire Poacher\n|volume=spring 2015\n|page=56\n|url=https://www.lincolnshirelife.co.uk/?ACT=33&FI=KzBQVW9aSTQ3VUhCRnVzNWRySHVxV3ljckFTOXZQcHluQ2s1dWVhTDNGK09lSHhtNlFGNUUxYmI1K0hHTjRYQVdUeC9ZdVh2Z0xTTlNZNzI3cHJRM08vZEpQMkJzNXBsN3hHOFRwSXlobnlVd1VUM2NkblMwekZyQjlEWDFtMmxoRjdZRUdVOUFBaFd6NmdWbkdhOGU0LzJ0V1ZDSWcvZ1B2T2NaRFZLNlUvWGVGZEkxN3VaM3FVUVdVZTc2NmhLK2podjZMWjJ0VHJvSTN2K3BzaXl5QT09\n|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nSmith retired as curator in 1935.

The site of the collection is on the steep slope between the two and within the Roman colonia which linked the first century legionary fortress with the shipping and commerce in the river.\n\n[[File:The-Collection-Geograph-2353254-by-Michael-Westley.jpg|thumb|right|The Collection - the \"glass covered 'alley'\" referred to in the text]]\n==Buildings==\nThe [[Usher Gallery]] was built to house the collection of [[James Ward Usher]], using funds he bequeathed for the purpose.  It was designed by the architect, Sir [[Reginald Blomfield]] and was officially opened on 25 May 1927 by the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]. It is a basically simple building faced in stone with brick panels separated by simplified Tuscan pilasters above which is a frieze decorated with triglyphs and a roof line finished with a balustrade. The portico, central in the south fa\u00e7ade, is topped by a broken pediment and urn finials. It stands in a small park on the hillside looking southwards across the lower town.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Ward Usher|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2005/08/25/famous_yellowbelly_james_ward_usher_feature.shtml|work=Famous Yellowbellies|publisher=BBC Lincolnshire}}</ref>\n\nThe Usher Gallery is the only purpose-built public art gallery in Lincolnshire<ref>{{cite web |title=Usher Gallery |url=https://artuk.org/visit/venues/usher-gallery-3366 |website=Artuk.org |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> and a Grade II* [[Listed Building]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1388632|desc=The Usher Art Gallery|grade=II*|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1388634|grade=II|desc=Wall and gatepiers|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> The Usher is owned by Lincoln City Council but leased to [[Lincolnshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Whitelam |first1=Paul |title=Disappointed Lincoln city council leader urges rethink on Usher Gallery plan |url=https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/lincoln-news/disappointed-lincoln-city-council-leader-3111044 |accessdate=30 July 2019 |work=Lincolnshire Live |date=23 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an [[architectural design competition]] managed by [[RIBA Competitions]] Panter Hudspith Architects (project architect, Hugh Strange) designed the new building and the doors were opened in October 2005 after much hard work including an archaeological excavation. Despite the building's having been designed to rest above the [[Culture of Ancient Rome|Roman]] horizon, at the foot of the pit for the lift shaft, it just found the corner of a [[mosaic]]-paved passage which had been laid around a courtyard.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Collection, Lincoln|url=http://www.architecture.com/useanarchitect/findanarchitect/competitions/casestudiesnew/cultureandleisure/museumsandgalleries/thecollectionlincoln/thecollectionlincoln.aspx|work=Case studies...Museums and galleries|publisher=RIBA|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the new building is faced and paved with [[Ancaster stone]] and borrows the concept of the glass-covered courtyard from the [[British Museum]] in a feature reminiscent of a medieval alley.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe main entrance is at the northern, uphill end and leads past, to the left, the caf\u00e9 which faces south across a courtyard and to the right, the shop. Passing the reception desk leads to the orientation hall which is the glass-covered 'alley' passing east to west.

It is a merge between the 'Usher Gallery,' that was established in 1927 and the 'City and County Museum', that was founded in 1906. The first curator of the Lincoln City and County Museum was Arthur Smith (1869\u20131947), who was born in Leicester and raised in [[Grimsby]] and who was interested in natural history.<ref name=collect>{{cite web | url=https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/about-us/history-of-the-museum |title=History of the Museum |publisher=The Collection |access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> After being appointed curator he moved to Lincoln. He became the (Honorary) Secretary of the Lincolnshire Naturalists' Union (LNU), and acquired important collections, for example from J.E. Mason (''[[Heteroptera]],'' bugs), W. Wallace (''[[Diptera]],'' flies) and G.W. Mason (''[[Lepidoptera]],'' butterflies).<ref name=nathist>{{cite web | url=https://www.thecollectionmuseum.com/explore/natural-history |title=Natural History |publisher=The Collection |access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> The Museum also acquired important collections of bird specimen, for instance from [[George Henry Caton Haigh]].<ref name=Haigh>{{cite journal |title=Early twentieth century donors of bird specimens to the Lincoln County Museum\n|last=Kerry |first=Trevor |date=2015\n|journal=The Lincolnshire Poacher\n|volume=spring 2015\n|page=56\n|url=https://www.lincolnshirelife.co.uk/?ACT=33&FI=KzBQVW9aSTQ3VUhCRnVzNWRySHVxV3ljckFTOXZQcHluQ2s1dWVhTDNGK09lSHhtNlFGNUUxYmI1K0hHTjRYQVdUeC9ZdVh2Z0xTTlNZNzI3cHJRM08vZEpQMkJzNXBsN3hHOFRwSXlobnlVd1VUM2NkblMwekZyQjlEWDFtMmxoRjdZRUdVOUFBaFd6NmdWbkdhOGU0LzJ0V1ZDSWcvZ1B2T2NaRFZLNlUvWGVGZEkxN3VaM3FVUVdVZTc2NmhLK2podjZMWjJ0VHJvSTN2K3BzaXl5QT09\n|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nSmith retired as curator in in 1935.

It was designed by the architect, Sir [[Reginald Blomfield]] and was officially opened on 25 May 1927 by the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]. It is a basically simple building faced in stone with brick panels separated by simplified Tuscan pilasters above which is a frieze decorated with triglyphs and a roof line finished with a balustrade. The portico, central in the south fa\u00e7ade, is topped by a broken pediment and urn finials. It stands in a small park on the hillside looking southwards across the lower town.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Ward Usher|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/lincolnshire/content/articles/2005/08/25/famous_yellowbelly_james_ward_usher_feature.shtml|work=Famous Yellowbellies|publisher=BBC Lincolnshire}}</ref>\n\nThe Usher Gallery is the only purpose-built public art gallery in Lincolnshire<ref>{{cite web |title=Usher Gallery |url=https://artuk.org/visit/venues/usher-gallery-3366 |website=Artuk.org |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> and a Grade II* [[Listed Building]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1388632|desc=The Usher Art Gallery|grade=II*|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE|num=1388634|grade=II|desc=Wall and gatepiers|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> The Usher is owned by Lincoln City Council but leased to [[Lincolnshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Whitelam |first1=Paul |title=Disappointed Lincoln city council leader urges rethink on Usher Gallery plan |url=https://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/news/lincoln-news/disappointed-lincoln-city-council-leader-3111044 |accessdate=30 July 2019 |work=Lincolnshire Live |date=23 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an [[architectural design competition]] managed by [[RIBA Competitions]] Panter Hudspith Architects (project architect, Hugh Strange) designed the new building and the doors were opened in October 2005 after much hard work including an archaeological excavation.
