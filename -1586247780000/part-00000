However, he returned to Saracens and was pivotal in the [[2010\u201311 Aviva Premiership]] Final, kicking five penalties and converting [[James Short (rugby union)|James Short]]'s try, ending with a personal haul of 17 points in the 22\u201318 victory over reigning champions Leicester Tigers.\n\nThe 2013\u201314 season was a strong season for Farrell and Saracens, with the London Club reaching the Heineken Cup against Toulon, but they missed out on the title after losing the match 23\u20136, and there was more disappointment for Farrell and Saracens after being defeated 24\u201320 in the Aviva Premiership Final against Northampton at Twickenham.

He finished the competition with 63 points from five games. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[2012 mid-year rugby test series|2012 summer tour]] of South Africa saw Farrell get selected again. He played all of the warm-up game against [[Barbarian F.C.|the Barbarians]] and scored a respectable 17 points in a game that England won comfortably. Farrell again played all through the first match against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], where England lost 22\u201317 in a tight game. He kicked all four of his penalties but missed a conversion. He came on as a substitute in the second test; he scored no points and could not help England avoid defeat for a second time. Farrell had two spells on the pitch in the third test; he scored two penalties in a tight game that ended 14\u201314, twice attempting to score his first drop goal but missing each time. He ended the series with 18 points from three appearances. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFarrell played his first game in the autumn test series as a substitute and scored a conversion.\nOn 1 December 2012, he started in England's game against [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and scored a total of 17 points in helping England to a record-breaking victory; it was their greatest-ever margin of victory over the All Blacks. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nHe was nominated for [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] Player of the Year, but lost out to the New Zealand stand-off [[Dan Carter]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFarrell started in the [[Calcutta Cup]] match against Scotland, only missing one kick in a near-faultless display.

He went on to start in England's first World Cup warm-up match on 15 August, against France, scoring two out of three conversions and consequently helping England win the game 19\u201314. Farrell was picked by Lancaster as one of two fly-halves in the 31-man World Cup squad.\n\nFarrell came on as a replacement for [[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] in the opening match of the world cup against [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], a 35\u201311 win where Farrell did not miss any kicks. Farrell played for the full 80 minutes in England's second 2015 World Cup match, a 25\u201328 loss to Wales, scoring 20 points after failing to miss any kicks for the second straight match. He subsequently kept his place to face Australia the following weekend, on 2 October 2015, which England went on to lose 13\u201333 after Farrell was sin-binned in the 70th minute. This was the first time that England failed to make the playoffs of a Rugby World Cup, having lost to both Wales and Australia now. Farrell started at inside centre in England's final pool match, a 60\u20133 win over Uruguay. Farrell was subbed off for [[Jonathan Joseph (rugby union)|Jonathan Joseph]] in the 59th minute after missing two of his six kicks.\n\nIn January 2016, after his fine displays for Saracens, Farrell was selected in the first squad of new England head coach [[Eddie Jones (rugby union)|Eddie Jones]]. With injuries to [[Henry Slade]] and [[Manu Tuilagi]] leaving few choices at inside centre, Farrell was selected at 12 in Jones' first two matches, away to Scotland and Italy respectively. [[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] became a regular starter at 10 in Farrell's place. He was selected as one of England's vice-captains for the Six Nations, along with [[Mike Brown (rugby union)|Mike Brown]] and [[Billy Vunipola]], under [[Dylan Hartley]]'s captaincy. In the first two matches, Farrell contributed 22 points including a try against Italy, and assumed the captaincy when Hartley was substituted late on.\n\nFarrell went on to start at inside centre in all five of England's games during the Six Nations tournament, winning his first major international trophy as part of England's Grand Slam-winning side. Farrell finished the tournament as the leading scorer with 69 points, bringing his personal tally for England to 412 and making him the second-highest points scorer in the history of the England national team, with only [[Jonny Wilkinson]] having scored more.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, England embarked on a three-match series in Australia. Farrell was initially picked to start at fly-half for the first test, however, he was soon reverted to inside centre with Ford assuming the No.10 shirt. England would go on to win the series 3\u20130, with Farrell playing a pivotal role, being named man of the match in the third test and scoring 66 points on tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2016/06/25/owen-farrell-praises-jonny-wilkinsons-kicking-tuition-after-star/|title=Owen Farrell praises Jonny Wilkinson's kicking tuition after star turn in England's series win over Australia|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>\nOwen was nominated for the six-man shortlist for the 2016 World Player of the Year Award for the second time in his career, alongside his Saracens teammates Billy Vunipola and [[Maro Itoje]].\n\n====2017\u20132018====\nFarrell played all 80 minutes every test in the 2017 [[Six Nations Championship]] and helped [[England Rugby|England]] retaining the Six Nations title despite missing out the Grand Slam after losing the final game to Ireland. The highlight of Farrell's 2017 Six Nations was on 11 March 2017 when he scored 26 points against Scotland in a 61\u201321 win for England.\n\nFarrell had a huge workload in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] and played in every minute of the competition. Farrell scored a try against Italy on 4 February 2018 and also set one up for first-five George Ford. Disappointingly however, Farrell only kicked 5/8 of his goals against Italy, which disallowed England from putting 50 points on Italy, leaving England to win 46\u201315. On 24 February, Farrell scored all of England's points against Scotland, including a try. This was not enough however, with Farrell's second try of the match disallowed. Scotland went on to upset England 25\u201313, with Farrell's game not doing enough to get England a win.\n\nOn 10 March 2018, Farrell captained England for the first time in his career when they faced France in [[Stade de France]] in Paris. Farrell did not miss any kicks against France in the match and defended well, but England lost 22\u201316 due to giving away penalties to French scrum-half [[Maxime Machenaud]] who managed to convert them into points. Farrell later admitted to media that England's lack of discipline cost them the test.\n\nEngland went onto lose their final 6 Nations match against Ireland, with Hartley back as captain. Farrell started the match at fly-half, with George Ford dropping to the bench, his first start in the ten jersey for England since June 2016.\n\n====2018-2019 and the captaincy====\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=January 2020}}\nAfter England captain [[Dylan Hartley]] sustained another concussion in 2018 and was subsequently ruled out of England's three-test series against South Africa, Farrell was promoted to captain in Hartley's absence, leading England to a 2\u20131 series defeat. Although England rushed to a 24\u20133 lead early in the first test, with Farrell scoring a try, South Africa came back into the test eventually winning 42\u201339. England won the final test 25\u201310 for Farrell's first victory as England captain. Farrell returned to 12 for the series, with Ford back at 10 for the first two games, which England lost, before Danny Cipriani was installed at 10 for the final game.\n\nDuring the autumn, Dylan Hartley again returned from injury, but Farrell was selected as co-captain. The pair led England to victories over South Africa (12-11) and Australia (37-20), and a defeat to New Zealand (16-15), while Farrell came off the bench during a 35\u201315 victory over Japan (George Ford captained this game). For the three matches he started, Farrell started at 10 again, with Ben Te\u2019o preferred at 12 outside him.\n\nFarrell was retained at 10 and as the sole England Captain during the 2019 6 Nations, with Hartley missing the whole tournament.\n\nEngland started the tournament with a shock 32\u201320 victory against the Irish in Dublin, avenging the previous year's loss for their first away win against the Irish since 2013, and only their third ever during the 6 Nations era. It was also Ireland's first home defeat since New Zealand beat them in November 2016, and Ireland went into the match having lost only one of their last eighteen games. The game was cited as England's best under Eddie Jones, and was backed up with a 44\u20138 win over France at Twickenham, their largest win in over 90 years against the French, with Farrell picking up a try as well as 12 points from the boot.\n\nDespite leading 10\u20133 at half time, in England's third match they came up short against Wales in Cardiff, losing 21\u201313 to the eventual 2019 Grand Slam winners.\n\nTheir final two matches saw a 57\u201314 victory over Italy before their final match against Scotland, both games at home. England scored 24 tries across the tournament, the most of any team since England scored 29 in 2001. Farrell contributed 59 points to this, finishing the 2019 tournaments top scorer. However, their final match against Scotland ended in a 38 all draw, with England leading 31\u20137 at the break before Scotland made a magnificent comeback to lead 38\u201331 by the 80th minute. Farrell was substituted with ten minutes left, and it was his replacement, George Ford, who proved the saviour for England to score after the clock had gone red to rescue the match for a draw. It was Scotland's first draw at Twickenham since 1989, and the first time they had retained the Calcutta Cup since 1984.\n\nFarrell was selected as England's captain for 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, where England would face France, Argentina, Tonga and the United States in Pool C. He also started and captained two of England's four warm-up matches, starting at 12 against Ireland in a record 57\u201315 victory, and at 10 against Italy in England's first ever match at St James\u2019 Park in Newcastle\n\nEngland performed well at the 2019 World Cup, topping their pool with big wins over Argentina, Tonga and the USA (their match against France was cancelled due to a typhoon), and following this up with a record equalling win over Australia in the Quarter-Final. Farrell went on to lead England to victory over New Zealand in the semi final, winning 19\u20137. Farrell captained England against South Africa in the Final, South Africa upset the favourites for the game and won 32\u201312.\n\nThe Semi-Final win against New Zealand made Farrell just the fourth England Captain (after Martin Johnson, Jeff Pullin and Will Carling) to lead England to victories against all of the \u201cBig Three\u201d Southern Hemisphere sides (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia). As captain, he has 2 wins against Australia, 2 against South Africa, and one against New Zealand.\n\n===British and Irish Lions===\nFarrell was selected as part of the [[British and Irish Lions]] squad for the [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2013 tour to Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22352825|title=Lions 2013: Jonny Wilkinson out but Sam Warburton is captain|date=30 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Farrell started for the Lions in Hong Kong on 1 June against the Barbarians, kicking three penalties and three conversions in a convincing 59\u20138 win for the Lions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22732236|title=Barbarians 8\u201359 Lions|date=1 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\nIn his second game against [[Western Force]], Farrell started on the bench, came on in the 66th minute and scored a try with his first touch, helping the Lions towards a 69\u201317 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22773458|title=Lions 2013: Healy injury mars nine-try win over Western Forces|date=5 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He gained his first Lions test cap, coming off the bench to replace [[Jonathan Sexton]], in the 16\u201341 series decider.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/23210389|title=British and Irish Lions thrash Australia to seal series win|date=6 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Farrell was named again as part of the Lions squad for the [[2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|tour to New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/39639299|title=British and Irish Lions 2017: Sam Warburton captain, Dylan Hartley out|date=19 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He played a pivotal role in the series, starting in all three tests against the All Blacks.

Farrell was picked by Lancaster as one of two fly-halves in the 31-man World Cup squad.\n\nFarrell came on as a replacement for [[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] in the opening match of the world cup against [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]], a 35\u201311 win where Farrell did not miss any kicks. Farrell played for the full 80 minutes in England's second 2015 World Cup match, a 25\u201328 loss to Wales, scoring 20 points after failing to miss any kicks for the second straight match.

This was the first time that England failed to make the playoffs of a Rugby World Cup, having lost to both Wales and Australia now.

[[George Ford (rugby union)|George Ford]] became a regular starter at 10 in Farrell's place. He was selected as one of England's vice-captains for the Six Nations, along with [[Mike Brown (rugby union)|Mike Brown]] and [[Billy Vunipola]], under [[Dylan Hartley]]'s captaincy. In the first two matches, Farrell contributed 22 points including a try against Italy, and assumed the captaincy when Hartley was substituted late on.\n\nFarrell went on to start at inside centre in all five of England's games during the Six Nations tournament, winning his first major international trophy as part of England's Grand Slam-winning side. Farrell finished the tournament as the leading scorer with 69 points, bringing his personal tally for England to 412 and making him the second-highest points scorer in the history of the England national team, with only [[Jonny Wilkinson]] having scored more.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, England embarked on a three-match series in Australia. Farrell was initially picked to start at fly-half for the first test, however, he was soon reverted to inside centre with Ford assuming the No.10 shirt. England would go on to win the series 3\u20130, with Farrell playing a pivotal role, being named man of the match in the third test and scoring 66 points on tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2016/06/25/owen-farrell-praises-jonny-wilkinsons-kicking-tuition-after-star/|title=Owen Farrell praises Jonny Wilkinson's kicking tuition after star turn in England's series win over Australia|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref>\nOwen was nominated for the six-man shortlist for the 2016 World Player of the Year Award for the second time in his career, alongside his Saracens teammates Billy Vunipola and [[Maro Itoje]].\n\n====2017\u20132018====\nFarrell played all 80 minutes every test in the 2017 [[Six Nations Championship]] and helped [[England Rugby|England]] retaining the Six Nations title despite missing out the Grand Slam after losing the final game to Ireland. The highlight of Farrell's 2017 Six Nations was on 11 March 2017 when he scored 26 points against Scotland in a 61\u201321 win for England.\n\nFarrell had a huge workload in the [[2018 Six Nations Championship]] and played in every minute of the competition. Farrell scored a try against Italy on 4 February 2018 and also set one up for first-five George Ford. Disappointingly however, Farrell only kicked 5/8 of his goals against Italy, which disallowed England from putting 50 points on Italy, leaving England to win 46\u201315. On 24 February, Farrell scored all of England's points against Scotland, including a try. This was not enough however, with Farrell's second try of the match disallowed. Scotland went on to upset England 25\u201313, with Farrell's game not doing enough to get England a win.\n\nOn 10 March 2018, Farrell captained England for the first time in his career when they faced France in [[Stade de France]] in Paris. Farrell did not miss any kicks against France in the match and defended well, but England lost 22\u201316 due to giving away penalties to French scrum-half [[Maxime Machenaud]] who managed to convert them into points. Farrell later admitted to media that England's lack of discipline cost them the test.\n\nEngland went onto lose their final 6 Nations match against Ireland, with Hartley back as captain. Farrell started the match at fly-half, with George Ford dropping to the bench, his first start in the ten jersey for England since June 2016.\n\n====2018-2019 and the captaincy====\n{{Unreferencedsect|date=January 2020}}\nAfter England captain [[Dylan Hartley]] sustained another concussion in 2018 and was subsequently ruled out of England's three-test series against South Africa, Farrell was promoted to captain in Hartley's absence, leading England to a 2\u20131 series defeat. Although England rushed to a 24\u20133 lead early in the first test, with Farrell scoring a try, South Africa came back into the test eventually winning 42\u201339. England won the final test 25\u201310 for Farrell's first victory as England captain. Farrell returned to 12 for the series, with Ford back at 10 for the first two games, which England lost, before Danny Cipriani was installed at 10 for the final game.\n\nDuring the autumn, Dylan Hartley again returned from injury, but Farrell was selected as co-captain. The pair led England to victories over South Africa (12-11) and Australia (37-20), and a defeat to New Zealand (16-15), while Farrell came off the bench during a 35\u201315 victory over Japan (George Ford captained this game). For the three matches he started, Farrell started at 10 again, with Ben Te\u2019o preferred at 12 outside him.\n\nFarrell was retained at 10 and as the sole England Captain during the 2019 6 Nations, with Hartley missing the whole tournament.\n\nEngland started the tournament with a shock 32\u201320 victory against the Irish in Dublin, avenging the previous year's loss for their first away win against the Irish since 2013, and only their third ever during the 6 Nations era. It was also Ireland's first home defeat since New Zealand beat them in November 2016, and Ireland went into the match having lost only one of their last eighteen games. The game was cited as England's best under Eddie Jones, and was backed up with a 44\u20138 win over France at Twickenham, their largest win in over 90 years against the French, with Farrell picking up a try as well as 12 points from the boot.\n\nDespite leading 10\u20133 at half time, in England's third match they came up short against Wales in Cardiff, losing 21\u201313 to the eventual 2019 Grand Slam winners.\n\nTheir final two matches saw a 57\u201314 victory over Italy before their final match against Scotland, both games at home. England scored 24 tries across the tournament, the most of any team since England scored 29 in 2001. Farrell contributed 59 points to this, finishing the 2019 tournaments top scorer. However, their final match against Scotland ended in a 38 all draw, with England leading 31\u20137 at the break before Scotland made a magnificent comeback to lead 38\u201331 by the 80th minute. Farrell was substituted with ten minutes left, and it was his replacement, George Ford, who proved the saviour for England to score after the clock had gone red to rescue the match for a draw. It was Scotland's first draw at Twickenham since 1989, and the first time they had retained the Calcutta Cup since 1984.\n\nFarrell was selected as England's captain for 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, where England would face France, Argentina, Tonga and the United States in Pool C. He also started and captained two of England's four warm-up matches, starting at 12 against Ireland in a record 57\u201315 victory, and at 10 against Italy in England's first ever match at St James\u2019 Park in Newcastle\n\nEngland performed well at the 2019 World Cup, topping their pool with big wins over Argentina, Tonga and the USA (their match against France was cancelled due to a typhoon), and following this up with a record equalling win over Australia in the Quarter-Final. Farrell went on to lead England to victory over New Zealand in the semi final, winning 19\u20137. Farrell captained England against South Africa in the Final, South Africa upset the favourites for the game and won 32\u201312.\n\nThe Semi-Final win against New Zealand made Farrell just the fourth England Captain (after Martin Johnson, Jeff Pullin and Will Carling) to lead England to victories against all of the \u201cBig Three\u201d Southern Hemisphere sides (South Africa, New Zealand and Australia). As captain, he has 2 wins against Australia, 2 against South Africa, and one against New Zealand.\n\n===British and Irish Lions===\nFarrell was selected as part of the [[British and Irish Lions]] squad for the [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2013 tour to Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22352825|title=Lions 2013: Jonny Wilkinson out but Sam Warburton is captain|date=30 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Farrell started for the Lions in Hong Kong on 1 June against the Barbarians, kicking three penalties and three conversions in a convincing 59\u20138 win for the Lions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22732236|title=Barbarians 8\u201359 Lions|date=1 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\nIn his second game against [[Western Force]], Farrell started on the bench, came on in the 66th minute and scored a try with his first touch, helping the Lions towards a 69\u201317 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/22773458|title=Lions 2013: Healy injury mars nine-try win over Western Forces|date=5 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He gained his first Lions test cap, coming off the bench to replace [[Jonathan Sexton]], in the 16\u201341 series decider.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/23210389|title=British and Irish Lions thrash Australia to seal series win|date=6 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Farrell was named again as part of the Lions squad for the [[2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand|tour to New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/39639299|title=British and Irish Lions 2017: Sam Warburton captain, Dylan Hartley out|date=19 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> He played a pivotal role in the series, starting in all three tests against the All Blacks.

The algorithm uses a '''key pair''' consisting of a '''public key''' and a '''private key'''. The private key is used to generate a '''digital signature''' for a message, and such a signature can be '''verified''' by using the signer's corresponding public key. The digital signature provides message [[Message authentication|authentication]] (the receiver can verify the origin of the message), [[Data integrity|integrity]] (the receiver can verify that the message has not been modified since it was signed) and [[non-repudiation]] (the sender cannot falsely claim that they have not signed the message).\n\n==History==\nIn 1982 the U.S government solicited proposals for a public key signature standard. In August 1991 the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS). Initially there was significant criticism, especially from software companies that had already invested effort in developing digital signature software based on the [[RSA cryptosystem]].<ref name=\"schneier\">{{cite book|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|date=1996|title=Applied Cryptography|url=https://archive.org/details/Applied_Cryptography_2nd_ed._B._Schneier|isbn=0-471-11709-9}}</ref>{{rp|484}} Nevertheless, NIST adopted DSA as a Federal standard (FIPS 186) in 1994.

In the rare case that <math>g=1</math> try again with a different <math>h</math>. Commonly <math>h=2</math> is used. This [[modular exponentiation]] can be computed efficiently even if the values are large.\nThe algorithm parameters are (<math>p</math>, <math>q</math>, <math>g</math>). These may be shared between different users of the system.\n\n====Per-user keys====\nGiven a set of parameters, the second phase computes the key pair for a single user:\n* Choose an integer <math>x</math> randomly from <math>\\{ 1 \\ldots q-1 \\}</math>.\n* Compute <math>y := g^x \\mod p</math>.\n<math>x</math> is the private key and <math>y</math> is the public key.\n\n===Key distribution===\nThe signer should publish the public key <math>y</math>. That is, they should send the key to the receiver via a reliable, but not necessarily secret, mechanism. The signer should keep the private key <math>x</math> secret.\n\n===Signing===\nA message <math>m</math> is signed as follows:\n* Choose an integer <math>k</math> randomly from <math>\\{ 1 \\ldots q-1 \\}</math>\n* Compute <math>r := \\left(g^{k}\\bmod\\,p\\right)\\bmod\\,q</math>. In the unlikely case that <math>r=0</math>, start again with a different random <math>k</math>.\n* Compute <math>s := \\left(k^{-1}\\left(H(m)+xr\\right)\\right)\\bmod\\,q</math>. In the unlikely case that <math>s=0</math>, start again with a different random <math>k</math>.\nThe signature is <math>\\left(r,s\\right)</math>\n\nThe calculation of <math>k</math> and <math>r</math> amount to creating a new per-message key. The modular exponentiation in computing <math>r</math> is the most computationally expensive part of the signing operation, but it may be computed before the message is known.\nCalculating the modular inverse <math>k^{-1}\\bmod\\,q</math> is the second most expensive part, and it may also be computed before the message is known. It may be computed using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] or using [[Fermat's little theorem]] as <math>k^{q-2}\\bmod\\,q</math>.\n\n===Verifying a signature===\nOne can verify that a signature <math>\\left(r,s\\right)</math> is a valid signature for a message <math>m</math> as follows:\n* Verify that <math>0 < r < q</math> and <math>0 < s < q</math>.\n* Compute <math>  w := s^{-1} \\bmod\\,q</math>.\n* Compute <math>u_1 := H(m) \\cdot w\\, \\bmod\\,q</math>.\n* Compute <math>u_2 := r \\cdot w\\, \\bmod\\,q</math>.\n* Compute <math>  v := \\left(g^{u_1}y^{u_2} \\bmod\\,p\\right) \\bmod\\,q</math>.\n* The signature is valid if and only if <math>v = r</math>.\n\n==Correctness of the algorithm==\nThe signature scheme is correct in the sense that the verifier will always accept genuine signatures. This can be shown as follows:\n\nFirst, since <math display=\"inline\">g=h^{(p-1)/q}~\\text{mod}~p</math>, it follows that <math display=\"inline\">g^q \\equiv h^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod p</math> by [[Fermat's little theorem]]. Since <math>g>0</math> and <math>q</math> is prime, <math>g</math> must have order&nbsp;<math>q</math>.\n\nThe signer computes\n\n:<math>s=k^{-1}(H(m)+xr)\\bmod\\,q</math>\n\nThus\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nk & \\equiv H(m)s^{-1}+xrs^{-1}\\\\\n  & \\equiv H(m)w + xrw \\pmod{q}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSince <math>g</math> has order <math>q~(\\text{mod}~p)</math> we have\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ng^k & \\equiv g^{H(m)w}g^{xrw}\\\\\n    & \\equiv g^{H(m)w}y^{rw}\\\\\n    & \\equiv g^{u_1}y^{u_2} \\pmod{p}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFinally, the correctness of DSA follows from\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n r &= (g^k \\bmod\\,p) \\bmod\\,q\\\\\n   &= (g^{u_1}y^{u_2} \\bmod\\,p) \\bmod\\,q\\\\\n   &= v\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Sensitivity==\nWith DSA, the entropy, secrecy, and uniqueness of the random signature value <math>k</math> are critical. It is so critical that violating any one of those three requirements can reveal the entire private key to an attacker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/17/the-debian-pgp-disaster-that-almost-was/|title=The Debian PGP disaster that almost was|work=root labs rdist}}</ref> Using the same value twice (even while keeping <math>k</math> secret), using a predictable value, or leaking even a few bits of <math>k</math> in each of several signatures, is enough to reveal the private key <math>x</math>.<ref>[https://rdist.root.org/2010/11/19/dsa-requirements-for-random-k-value/ DSA <math>k</math>-value Requirements]</ref>\n\nThis issue affects both DSA and [[ECDSA]] \u2013 in December 2010, a group calling itself ''fail0verflow'' announced recovery of the [[ECDSA]] private key used by [[Sony]] to sign software for the [[PlayStation 3]] game console.

The algorithm uses a '''key pair''' consisting of a '''public key''' and a '''private key'''. The private key is used to generate a '''digital signature''' for a message, and such a signature can be '''verified''' by using the signer's corresponding public key. The digital signature provides message [[Message authentication|authentication]] (the receiver can verify the origin of the message), [[Data integrity|integrity]] (the receiver can verify that the message has not been modified since it was signed) and [[non-repudiation]] (the sender cannot falsely claim that they have not signed the message).\n\n==History==\nIn 1982 the U.S government solicited proposals for a public key signature standard. In August 1991 the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS). Initially there was significant criticism, especially from software companies that had already invested effort in developing digital signature software based on the [[RSA cryptosystem]].<ref name=\"schneier\">{{cite book|last=Schneier|first=Bruce|date=1996|title=Applied Cryptography|url=https://archive.org/details/Applied_Cryptography_2nd_ed._B._Schneier|isbn=0-471-11709-9}}</ref>{{rp|484}} Nevertheless, NIST adopted DSA as a Federal standard (FIPS 186) in 1994.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of [[primary producer]]s. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny [[phytoplankton]] which grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of [[primary production]]. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as [[climax forest|mature forests]], grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the [[zooplankton]] that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, zooplankton  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea. In this way, phytoplankton sequester about 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the ocean each year, causing the ocean to become a sink of carbon dioxide holding about 90% of all sequestered carbon.<ref name=\"EarthTimes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/scitech/role-marine-plankton-sequestration-carbon/1062/|title=The role of marine plankton in sequestration of carbon |author=Campbell, Mike |date=22 June 2011 |website=EarthTimes|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> The ocean produces about half of the world's oxygen and stores 50 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere.<ref>[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/why-care-about-ocean.html Why should we care about the ocean?] ''NOAA: National Ocean Service''.

Phytoplankton autotrophically produces biomass by converting [[inorganic compound]]s into [[organic compound|organic]] ones. In this way, phytoplankton functions as the foundation of the marine food web by supporting all other life in the ocean. The second central process in the marine food web is the [[microbial loop]]. This loop degrades [[marine bacteria]] and [[marine archaea|archaea]], [[remineralise]]s organic and inorganic matter, and then recycles the products either within the pelagic food web or by depositing them as sediment on the seafloor.<ref>Heinrichs, M.E., Mori, C. and Dlugosch, L.

This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\nThe fourth trophic level consists of predatory fish, marine mammals and seabirds that consume forage fish. Examples are [[swordfish]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[gannet]]s.\n\nApex predators, such as [[orca]]s, which can consume seals, and [[shortfin mako shark]]s, which can consume swordfish, make up a fifth trophic level. [[Baleen whale]]s can consume zooplankton and krill directly, leading to a food chain with only three or four trophic levels.\n\nIn practice, trophic levels are [[Trophic level#Fractional trophic levels|not always simple integers]] because the same consumer species often feeds across more than one trophic level.<ref>[[William Eugene Odum|Odum, W.

Chlorophyll in the water changes the way it reflects and absorbs sunlight, allowing scientists to map the amount and location of phytoplankton.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\n{{clear right}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Phytoplankton form the base of the ocean foodchain\">\nFile:phytopla.gif|Phytoplankton\nFile:Noctiluca scintillans unica.jpg|Dinoflagellate\nFile:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|Diatoms\n</gallery>\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea.

Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\n{{clear right}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=180px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Phytoplankton form the base of the ocean foodchain\">\nFile:phytopla.gif|Phytoplankton\nFile:Noctiluca scintillans unica.jpg|Dinoflagellate\nFile:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|Diatoms\n</gallery>\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern.

Such disturbances in energy transfer can potentially lead to a decrease in food availability for top predators, which in turn, can lead to negative impacts for many marine species within these food webs... \"Whilst climate change increased the productivity of plants, this was mainly due to an expansion of cyanobacteria (small blue-green algae),\" said Mr Ullah. \"This increased primary productivity does not support food webs, however, because these cyanobacteria are largely unpalatable and they are not consumed by herbivores. Understanding how ecosystems function under the effects of global warming is a challenge in ecological research. Most research on ocean warming involves simplified, short-term experiments based on only one or a few species.\"<ref name=ScienceDaily2018 />\n\n[[File:Global distribution of anthropogenic stressors to marine species.png|thumb|upright=1.7|left| The distribution of anthropogenic stressors faced by marine species threatened with extinction in various marine regions of the world.
