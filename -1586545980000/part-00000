The character is also related to Atkinson's bumbling spy character from a series of adverts in the United Kingdom for [[Barclaycard]] in the 1990s.\n\nReleased theatrically in the United States on 18 July 2003, the film met with mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful, having grossed $160 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\"/> The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 11 April 2003 and topped the country's box office for the next three weekends, before being overtaken by ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030411|title=Weekend box office 11th April 2003 - 13th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030418|title=Weekend box office 18th April 2003 - 20th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030425|title=Weekend box office 25th April 2003 - 27th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> Due to its commercial success, it was followed by two sequels, ''[[Johnny English Reborn]]'' and ''[[Johnny English Strikes Again]]'', in 2011 and 2018, respectively.\n\n== Plot ==\nJohnny English is a kindhearted but inept [[MI7]] employee, working a desk job while dreaming of being their most trusted agent. After Agent One dies in a [[submarine]] accident unknowingly caused by English, the remaining agents are killed by a bombing at Agent One's funeral, again due to English's incompetence, leaving English as the lone surviving agent capable of finishing Agent One\u2019s mission.\n\nAssigned to thwart a plot to steal the newly restored [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]], English meets the mysterious Lorna Campbell at the jewels' unveiling at the [[Tower of London]]. During a sudden blackout, the jewels are stolen. In the chaotic aftermath, English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and pretends to fight an imaginary \"assailant\" to cover his mistakes; he makes up a false description of the suspect to MI7 head Pegasus.\n\nEnglish and his assistant Angus Bough discover the jewels were removed via a hole dug beneath their display case. Following the tunnel, they confront the German thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a [[hearse]]. After pursuing the wrong hearse, English gatecrashes a funeral. Bough comes to his rescue, pretending English is an escaped mental patient and posing as a doctor from the \"Lunatic Response Unit\".\n\nEnglish connects the thieves to Pascal Sauvage, a French prison entrepreneur who helped restore the jewels. Pegasus finds English\u2019s claims absurd and warns English not to involve Sauvage. In the car park, English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta but are unharmed. English again encounters Campbell in a [[YO! Sushi]] restaurant, recognising her pink [[motorcycle]]. Having seen her at two crime scenes, English\u2019s suspicions deepen when her records cannot be found on any government computer.\n\nEnglish and Bough parachute into Sauvage's headquarters, but English mistakenly lands on an identical tower, the City Hospital. Reaching the correct building, the two learn that Sauvage, a descendant of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], plans to make himself king, using an impostor to impersonate the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Campbell arrives, revealed to be an [[Interpol]] agent tracking Sauvage. With evidence of Sauvage's involvement, English crashes a reception hosted by Sauvage but is suspended by Pegasus for his clumsy actions.\n\nSauvage scraps his plan to use the fake Archbishop and instead sends his minions to force Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to abdicate by threatening her [[Queen Elizabeth's corgis|corgis]], causing the entire [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] to be swept clean for Sauvage to become king. Campbell, now placed in charge of the assignment by Pegasus, visits the depressed English and convinces him to travel with her to Sauvage's French [[ch\u00e2teau]] to investigate. Eavesdropping on Sauvage's meeting with internationally renowned criminals, English and Campbell learn he plans to transform all of England into the world's biggest prison. The agents are exposed when English accidentally activates a microphone, and they are taken prisoner.\n\nBough rescues English and Campbell and they race to stop Sauvage's coronation. English crashes the coronation and discovers the Archbishop in attendance is genuine. Undeterred, English orders Bough to play the incriminating DVD, only to find it is footage of himself lip-syncing to [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\" in his underclothes; Sauvage had bugged English's flat. Sneaking away, English swings in to steal [[St. Edward\u2019s Crown]] from the Archbishop. Sauvage attempts to kill English, who drops the crown. However, English falls from the wire, lands on the throne, and is crowned instead; the laws of succession mean English is now technically the King of England. In his singular act as king, English has Sauvage arrested and restores the Queen to the throne, simply requesting a [[knighthood]] as a reward.\n\nSauvage is awaiting trial for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], while English and Campbell drive to southern [[France]] for a romantic holiday, only for English to accidentally eject her out of his car while leaning in to kiss her. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Lorna lands in a hotel swimming pool, where Bough is vacationing alongside a man identical to the fictitious assailant English described to Pegasus.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Johnny English\n* [[Natalie Imbruglia]] as Lorna Campbell, an INTERPOL agent\n* [[Ben Miller]] as Angus Bough, English's partner in the field\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Pascal Edward Sauvage, the main antagonist, the distant descendant of [[James II of England|James II]]\n* [[Oliver Ford Davies]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Pegasus\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as the Prime Minister\n* Douglas McFerran as Klaus Vendetta\n* Steve Nicolson as Dieter Klein\n* [[Greg Wise]] as Agent One\n* Tim Berrington as Roger\n* [[Prunella Scales]] as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n* [[Tasha de Vasconcelos]] as Countess Alexandra\n* [[Nina Young]] as Pegasus' Secretary\n* [[Sam Beazley]] as Elderly Man at the Hospital\n* Kevin Moore as Doctor\n* Jack Raymond as French Reception Waiter\n* [[Jenny Galloway]] as the Foreign Secretary\n* [[Chris Tarrant]] as Radio DJ\n* [[Trevor McDonald]] as Newsreader\n\n== Production ==\nIn March 2000, before the release of ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]'', Atkinson signed up to star as a spoof 007, with the news becoming official.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/02/news|title=Rowan Atkinson to star as spoof 007|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2000|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002, ''Johnny English'' [[principal photography]] commenced .

Western painter [[Frederic Remington]] (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel ''Stover at Yale'' (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school.

Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[athletic letters]] for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>Roberta J.

There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President [[Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, A. [[Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.<ref>John S., Watterson III, \"The Football Crisis of 1909\u20131910: the Response of the Eastern 'Big Three',\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 1981 8(1): 33\u201349</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:View of Connecticut Hall Old Campus Yale College New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753]]\n\nYale expanded gradually, establishing the [[Yale School of Medicine]] (1810), [[Yale Divinity School]] (1822), [[Yale Law School]] (1843), [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1847), the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (1847),<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E.

In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of [[Timothy Dwight&nbsp;V]], Yale College was renamed Yale University, with the name [[Yale College]] subsequently applied to the undergraduate college. The university would later add the [[Yale School of Music]] (1894), the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900), the [[Yale School of Public Health]] (1915), the [[Yale School of Nursing]] (1923), the [[Yale School of Drama]](1955), the [[Yale Physician Associate Program]] (1973), the [[Yale School of Management]] (1976), and the [[Jackson School of Global Affairs]] which will open in 2022.<ref name=\"The Future of Jackson\">{{Cite web|url=https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|title=The Future of Jackson|website=Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821223916/https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|archive-date=August 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School.\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. [[Noah Porter]], moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>George Levesque, \"Noah Porter Revisited,\" ''Perspectives on the History of Higher Education'' 2007 26: 29\u201366,</ref> He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture.

The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to \"improve mankind\" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President [[James R. Angell]] and psychobiologist [[Robert M. Yerkes]], tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.<ref>Kersten Jacobson Biehn, \"Psychobiology, Sex Research and Chimpanzees: Philanthropic Foundation Support for the Behavioral Sciences at Yale University, 1923\u201341,\" ''History of the Human Sciences'' 2008 21(2): 21\u201343,</ref>\n\n[[File:A View of the Buildings of Yale College at New Haven 1807.jpg|thumb|Old Brick Row in 1807]]\n\n====Biology====\nSlack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were [[Ross Granville Harrison]], [[Grace E. Pickford]], and [[G.&nbsp;Evelyn Hutchinson]], and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.<ref>Nancy G. Slack, \"Are Research Schools Necessary?

Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>Howard Spiro and Priscilla Waters Norton, \"Dean Milton C.

[[Norman Holmes Pearson]], who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty.

The [[Beinecke Rare Book Library]] has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library]] includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The [[Lewis Walpole Library]] contains the largest collection of 18th\u2011century British literary works. The [[Elizabethan Club]], technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The [[Yale University Art Gallery]], the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartout and Kahn buildings. The latter, [[Louis Kahn]]'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The [[Yale Center for British Art]], the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of [[Paul Mellon]] and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\nThe [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The [[Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments]], affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from [[Peru]] by Yale history professor [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] in his Yale-financed expedition to [[Machu Picchu]] in 1912 \u2013 when the removal of such artifacts was legal.

Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]\". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.\n\nSince summer 2010, Yale has also been host to [[Yale Publishing Course]].\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].\n\n==Campus life==\nYale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic backgrounds, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010\u20132011 freshman class, 10% are non\u2011U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |title=Yale Factsheet |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080525/http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |archivedate=April 3, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n===Residential colleges===\n{{Main|Residential colleges of Yale University}}\nYale's [[residential college]] system was established in 1933 by [[Edward S. Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy.

The Reverend [[Ezra Stiles]], president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient [[Bible|Biblical texts]] in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05dd ([[Urim and Thummim]]) on the Yale seal.

Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[athletic letters]] for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>Roberta J. Park, \"Muscle, Mind, and 'Agon:' Intercollegiate Debating and Athletics at Harvard and Yale, 1892\u20131909,\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 1987 14(3): 263\u2013285</ref>\n\nIn 1909\u201310, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905\u201306 to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President [[Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, A. [[Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.<ref>John S., Watterson III, \"The Football Crisis of 1909\u20131910: the Response of the Eastern 'Big Three',\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 1981 8(1): 33\u201349</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:View of Connecticut Hall Old Campus Yale College New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753]]\n\nYale expanded gradually, establishing the [[Yale School of Medicine]] (1810), [[Yale Divinity School]] (1822), [[Yale Law School]] (1843), [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1847), the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (1847),<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E. Sheffield]].</ref> and the [[Yale School of Art|Yale School of Fine Arts]] (1869). In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of [[Timothy Dwight&nbsp;V]], Yale College was renamed Yale University, with the name [[Yale College]] subsequently applied to the undergraduate college. The university would later add the [[Yale School of Music]] (1894), the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900), the [[Yale School of Public Health]] (1915), the [[Yale School of Nursing]] (1923), the [[Yale School of Drama]](1955), the [[Yale Physician Associate Program]] (1973), the [[Yale School of Management]] (1976), and the [[Jackson School of Global Affairs]] which will open in 2022.<ref name=\"The Future of Jackson\">{{Cite web|url=https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|title=The Future of Jackson|website=Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821223916/https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|archive-date=August 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School.\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. [[Noah Porter]], moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>George Levesque, \"Noah Porter Revisited,\" ''Perspectives on the History of Higher Education'' 2007 26: 29\u201366,</ref> He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n[[File:Rummell, Richard Yale University cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus, facing north]]\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Behavioral sciences====\nBetween 1925 and 1940, [[Foundation (non-profit)|philanthropic foundations]], especially ones connected with the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], contributed about $7&nbsp;million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate [[Biology]]. The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to \"improve mankind\" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President [[James R. Angell]] and psychobiologist [[Robert M. Yerkes]], tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.<ref>Kersten Jacobson Biehn, \"Psychobiology, Sex Research and Chimpanzees: Philanthropic Foundation Support for the Behavioral Sciences at Yale University, 1923\u201341,\" ''History of the Human Sciences'' 2008 21(2): 21\u201343,</ref>\n\n[[File:A View of the Buildings of Yale College at New Haven 1807.jpg|thumb|Old Brick Row in 1807]]\n\n====Biology====\nSlack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were [[Ross Granville Harrison]], [[Grace E. Pickford]], and [[G.&nbsp;Evelyn Hutchinson]], and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.<ref>Nancy G. Slack, \"Are Research Schools Necessary? Contrasting Models of 20th Century Research at Yale Led by Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford and G. Evelyn Hutchinson,\" ''Journal of the History of Biology'' 2003 36(3): 501\u2013529,</ref>\n\n====Medicine====\nMilton Winternitz led the [[Yale School of Medicine]] as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>Howard Spiro and Priscilla Waters Norton, \"Dean Milton C. Winternitz at Yale,\" ''Perspectives in Biology & Medicine'' 2003 46(3): 403\u2013412,</ref>\n\n====Faculty====\nBefore [[World War&nbsp;II]], most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.<ref>William Palmer, \"On or about 1950 or 1955 History Departments Changed: A Step in the Creation of the Modern History Department,\" ''Journal of the Historical Society'' (1529921x); 2007 7(3): 385\u2013405</ref>\n\n====History and American studies====\nThe American studies program reflected the worldwide anti-Communist ideological struggle. [[Norman Holmes Pearson]], who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose.<ref>Michael Holzman, \"The Ideological Origins of American Studies at Yale,\" ''American Studies'' 40:2 (Summer 1999): 71\u201399</ref> Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire [[William Robertson Coe]] made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming.

Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]\". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.\n\nSince summer 2010, Yale has also been host to [[Yale Publishing Course]].\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the University. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].\n\n==Campus life==\nYale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic backgrounds, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010\u20132011 freshman class, 10% are non\u2011U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |title=Yale Factsheet |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080525/http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |archivedate=April 3, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n===Residential colleges===\n{{Main|Residential colleges of Yale University}}\nYale's [[residential college]] system was established in 1933 by [[Edward S. Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas,\" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.<ref>{{cite news |author1-last=Lloyd-Thomas |author1-first=Matthew |author2-last=Rodrigues |author2-first=Adrian |title=New colleges to help reduce overcrowding |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=April 15, 2014 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |accessdate=September 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907085326/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |archive-date=September 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the [[Old Campus]], the university's oldest precinct.\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] or [[Collegiate Gothic]] in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, [[Morse College|Morse]] and [[Ezra Stiles College|Ezra Stiles]] Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history.

{"title_page": "Who Were the Shudras?", "text_new": "{{over-quotation|date=March 2019}}\n'''''Who Were the Shudras?''''' is a history book published by Indian social reformer and polymath [[B. R. Ambedkar]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dr. B.R. Ambedkar|first1=|title=Who were the Shudras?|date=1949|publisher=Thackers|location=Bombay}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last1=Karmarkar|first1=A.P.|title=Review: Who were the Shudras? by Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar|date=1946|journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute |volume=30 |issue=1-2 |pages=158\u2013160 |jstor=41784527}}</ref> The book discusses the origin of the Shudra [[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]. Ambedkar dedicated the book to [[Jyotirao Phule]] (1827\u20131890).\n\n==Subject of the book==\nIn the book Ambedkar, citing [[Rigveda]], [[Mahabharata]] and other ancient vedic scriptures, estimates that the [[Shudra]]s were originally [[Mulniwasi The Real Owners of India]]s  . They were a part of the Farmers. \n\nAmbedkar writes in the preface of the book,\n\n\"''Undoubtedly the conclusions which I have reached as a result of my investigations. Two questions are raised in this book: (1) Who were the Shudras? and (2) How they came to be the fourth Varna of the Indo-Aryan society? My answers to them are summarised below.''\n\n# ''The Shudras were one of the Mulniwasi communities of the solar race\"\n# ''There was a time when the Mulniwasi society recognised only three Varnas, namely. Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.''\n# ''The Shudras did not form a separate Varna. They ranked as part of the [[Kshatriya]] Varna in the Mulniwasi society.''\n# ''There was a continuous feud between the Shudra kings and the [[Brahmins]] in which the Brahmins were subjected to many tyrannies and indignities.''\n# ''As a result of the hatred towards the Shudras generated by their tyrannies and oppressions, the Brahmins refused to perform the [[Upanayana]] of the Shudras.''\n# ''Owing to the denial of Upanayana, the Shudras who were Kshatriyas became socially degraded, fell below the rank of the [[Vaishyas]] and thus came to form the fourth Varna.''\"<ref>http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/38A.%20Who%20were%20the%20Shudras%20Preface.htm#PRE</ref>\n\nImportantly, Ambedkar states that the Shudras of Hindu society are entirely different from Shudras of ancient Mulniwasi Society. He writes,\n\n\"''...Such an inference is without any foundation, for the Shudras of the Mulniwasi Society are absolutely different in race from the Shudras of the Hindu Society. The Shudras of the Hindu Society are not the racial descendants of the Shudras of the Mulniwasi Society. This confusion has arisen because of the failure to realise that the meaning of the word 'Shudras' in the Mulniwasi society is quite different from the meaning it has in the Hindu society. In the Indo-Aryans the word Shudra was proper name of one single people. It was the name of a people who belonged to a particular race. The word Shudra, as used in the Hindu society, is not a proper name at all. It is an epithet for a low uncultured class of people. It is a general cognomen of a miscellaneous and heterogeneous collection of tribes and groups, who have nothing in common except that they happen to be on a lower plane of culture. It is wrong to call them by the name Shudras. They have very little to do with their namesakes of the Mulniwasi society, who had offended the Brahmins. It is a pity that these innocent and backward people of later days have been rolled up with the original Shudras and subjected to the same penalties for which they had given no cause.''\"<ref>http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/38C2.%20Who%20were%20the%20Shudras%20PART%20II.htm#a11</ref>\n\nAmbedkar also discusses [[Mulniwasi race]] theory and rejects [[Mulniwasi migration theory]]<ref name=\"Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51\">Bryant, Edwin (2001). ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 50\u201351. {{ISBN|9780195169478}}</ref> in the book.<ref>http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/38B2.%20Who%20were%20the%20Shudras%20PART%20I.htm#a04</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Arvind Sharma]], Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''an\u0101s'' in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].<ref name=\"Sharma, Arvind 2005\">{{cite journal|ref=Sharma|author=Sharma, Arvind |title=Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India|journal= Journal of the American Academy of Religion|year= 2005|volume= 73 |issue=3|pages=849|jstor=4139922 |doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfi081}}</ref> Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:\n\n{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word.

Ambedkar dedicated the book to [[Jyotirao Phule]] (1827\u20131890).\n\n==Subject of the book==\nIn the book Ambedkar, citing [[Rigveda]], [[Mahabharata]] and other ancient vedic scriptures, estimates that the [[Shudra]]s were originally [[Aryan]]s. They were a part of the Kshatriya Varna. \n\nAmbedkar writes in the preface of the book,\n\n\"''Undoubtedly the conclusions which I have reached as a result of my investigations. Two questions are raised in this book: (1) Who were the Shudras? and (2) How they came to be the fourth Varna of the Indo-Aryan society? My answers to them are summarised below.''\n\n# ''The Shudras were one of the Aryan communities of the solar race\"\n# ''There was a time when the Aryan society recognised only three Varnas, namely. Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.''\n# ''The Shudras did not form a separate Varna. They ranked as part of the [[Kshatriya]] Varna in the Indo-Aryan society.''\n# ''There was a continuous feud between the Shudra kings and the [[Brahmins]] in which the Brahmins were subjected to many tyrannies and indignities.''\n# ''As a result of the hatred towards the Shudras generated by their tyrannies and oppressions, the Brahmins refused to perform the [[Upanayana]] of the Shudras.''\n# ''Owing to the denial of Upanayana, the Shudras who were Kshatriyas became socially degraded, fell below the rank of the [[Vaishyas]] and thus came to form the fourth Varna.''\"<ref>http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/38A.%20Who%20were%20the%20Shudras%20Preface.htm#PRE</ref>\n\nImportantly, Ambedkar states that the Shudras of Hindu society are entirely different from Shudras of ancient Indo-Aryan Society. He writes,\n\n\"''...Such an inference is without any foundation, for the Shudras of the Indo-Aryan Society are absolutely different in race from the Shudras of the Hindu Society. The Shudras of the Hindu Society are not the racial descendants of the Shudras of the Indo-Aryan Society. This confusion has arisen because of the failure to realise that the meaning of the word 'Shudras' in the Indo-Aryan society is quite different from the meaning it has in the Hindu society. In the Indo-Aryans the word Shudra was proper name of one single people. It was the name of a people who belonged to a particular race. The word Shudra, as used in the Hindu society, is not a proper name at all. It is an epithet for a low uncultured class of people. It is a general cognomen of a miscellaneous and heterogeneous collection of tribes and groups, who have nothing in common except that they happen to be on a lower plane of culture. It is wrong to call them by the name Shudras. They have very little to do with their namesakes of the Aryan society, who had offended the Brahmins. It is a pity that these innocent and backward people of later days have been rolled up with the original Shudras and subjected to the same penalties for which they had given no cause.''\"<ref>http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/38C2.%20Who%20were%20the%20Shudras%20PART%20II.htm#a11</ref>\n\nAmbedkar also discusses [[Aryan race]] theory and rejects [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]]<ref name=\"Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51\">Bryant, Edwin (2001). ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 50\u201351. {{ISBN|9780195169478}}</ref> in the book.<ref>http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/38B2.%20Who%20were%20the%20Shudras%20PART%20I.htm#a04</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Arvind Sharma]], Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''an\u0101s'' in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].<ref name=\"Sharma, Arvind 2005\">{{cite journal|ref=Sharma|author=Sharma, Arvind |title=Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India|journal= Journal of the American Academy of Religion|year= 2005|volume= 73 |issue=3|pages=849|jstor=4139922 |doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfi081}}</ref> Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:\n\n{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.<ref name=\"Sharma, Arvind 2005\"/>}}\n\n== Contents ==\nPreface\n\n=== Part I ===\n# Chapter I - The Riddle of the Shudras\n# Chapter II - The Brahmanic Theory of the Origin of the Shudras\n# Chapter III - The Brahmanic Theory of the Status of the Shudras\n# Chapter IV - Shudras Versus Aryans\n# Chapter V - Aryans Against Aryans\n# Chapter VI - Shudras And Dasas\n\n=== Part II ===\n# Chapter VII - The Shudras were Kshatriyas\n# Chapter VIII - The Number of Varnas, Three or Four?\n# Chapter IX - Brahmins Versus Shudras\n# Chapter X - The Degradation of the Shudras\n# Chapter XI - The Story of Reconciliation\n# Chapter XII - The Theory in the Crucible\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Caste system in India]]\n*[[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]]\n*[[Dalit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation | last =Sharma | first =Arvind | year =2005  |title =Dr. B.

The first Rizla Blue fine-weight rolling papers were produced in 1910, with thinner paper and a more pronounced tobacco flavour. RizLa also released one of the first [[rolling machine]]s.\n\nIn 1942, the Rizla brand revolutionized the world of rolling papers when the Lacroix brothers acquired a patent for applying [[Natural gum|gum]] to the edge of rolling papers. This new feature solidified Rizla's position as a leader in the rolling paper industry, placing them at the top of the market.\n\nIn 1977, thirty-three years after the brand name change, Rizla released the first of their [[Kingsize|King Size]] rolling papers. The normal papers measure 69x35mm. In most countries they are packed in a single interleaved stack of 50 papers, but in Belgium the packages contain two parallel stacks totalling 100 papers, which typically retail for \u20ac0.80-\u20ac1.00.\n\nDifferent thicknesses are colour-coded as follows:\n* 26.5 gm<sup>-2</sup> liquorice\n* 23 white\n* 20 orange\n* 17.5 red (with cut corners green)\n* 14.5 blue, pink\n* 13.5 silver\n\nIn 1978 Fernand Painblanc took control of Rizla, bringing the tradition of Lacroix family ownership to an end.\n\nThe [[Licorice|liquorice]]-flavoured paper was released in 1981. In 1986, Rizla began rapid growth and large-scale advertising. One successful advertising campaign in 1986 was a popular series of calendars, T-Shirts and posters. A caf\u00e9 franchise, which was featured at various concerts in the UK in 1996, was also extremely popular. In 1997 they produced a limited edition King Size Rizla+ Purple medium-weight, extra width, king size rolling paper, in celebration of the Phoenix music festival.\n\nIn 1997, Rizla was sold to [[Imperial Tobacco]].\n\nIn 1998, Rizla continued their string of expansion and large-scale advertising, going so far as to release their own line of clothing, sold at their caf\u00e9s. In 2002 Rizla closed a deal with Suzuki and became one of their top motor-bike racing sponsors, forming the Rizla-Suzuki racing team. The [[Caterham Cars|Caterham]] Superlight R500 sports is available with Rizla markings following its launch in collaboration with Rizla-Suzuki.\n\nRizla added a new paper to its lineup in 2003, with the introduction of the Rizla+ Silver, Ultra-Thin, King Size rolling paper. In 2003 the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Agency]] upheld a complaint that Rizla+ had alluded to their products' association with cannabis in a print advertisement that bore the caption \"twist and burn\".\n\nIn 2004, two more types of Rizla papers were released; one, the Rizla Red, Medium Weight, Slim paper is exclusive to the United Kingdom and The Republic of Ireland. The other variety released in 2003 was the Rizla+ Silver (regular size) Ultra-Thin rolling paper.\n\nIn 2002, Imperial Tobacco closed Rizla's historic factory at [[Maz\u00e8res-sur-Salat]] near [[Saint-Gaudens, Haute-Garonne|Saint-Gaudens]] (south of France). In September 2005 [[Imperial Tobacco]] announced the closure of Rizla's Treforest factory at [[Pontypridd]] near [[Cardiff]] in South Wales with a loss of 134 jobs.  After the closure of the factory, Rizla production is now concentrated at [[Wilrijk]], Belgium.\n\nFrom 2006 until 2011, Rizla sponsored the [[Suzuki]] [[MotoGP]] bike under [[Rizla Suzuki]] MotoGP team, which was ridden by [[\u00c1lvaro Bautista]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{In popular culture|section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:RizlaWarning2010.jpg|thumb|Current expiry warning]]\n* The brand is mentioned several times in [[Alex Garland]]\u2019s 1996 novel ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]''.\n* In the 2014 film [[Kingsman: The Secret Service|Kingsman]], Dean and his mother ask Eggsy if he has any Rizla.\n* [[Amy Winehouse]] mentions Rizla in her 2003 song \"Bestfriends, right\".\n* [[QBoy]] mentions Rizla in his rap in the single \"DragOn\" - a weed smoking hip hop anthem in 2015; \"''Blue Slims and a fat 20 bag of Lemon Haze''\".\n* [[Parquet Courts]] mentions Rizla in the song \"Yonder is Closer to the Heart\" off the 2012 album ''[[Light Up Gold]]''.<ref>\"Parquet Courts - Yonder Is Closer To The Heart Lyrics | MetroLyrics.\" http://www.metrolyrics.com/yonder-is-closer-to-the-heart-lyrics-parquet-courts.html.

The first Rizla Blue fine-weight rolling papers were produced in 1910, with thinner paper and a more pronounced tobacco flavour. RizLa also released one of the first [[rolling machine]]s.\n\nIn 1942, the Rizla brand revolutionized the world of rolling papers when the Lacroix brothers acquired a patent for applying [[Natural gum|gum]] to the edge of rolling papers. This new feature solidified Rizla's position as a leader in the rolling paper industry, placing them at the top of the market.\n\nIn 1977, thirty-three years after the brand name change, Rizla released the first of their [[Kingsize|King Size]] rolling papers. The normal papers measure 69x35mm. In most countries they are packed in a single interleaved stack of 50 papers, but in Belgium the packages contain two parallel stacks totalling 100 papers, which typically retail for \u20ac0.80-\u20ac1.00.\n\nDifferent thicknesses are colour-coded as follows:\n* 26.5 gm<sup>-2</sup> liquorice\n* 23 white\n* 20 orange\n* 17.5 red (with cut corners green)\n* 14.5 blue, pink\n* 13.5 silver\n\nIn 1978 Fernand Painblanc took control of Rizla, bringing the tradition of Lacroix family ownership to an end.\n\nThe [[Licorice|liquorice]]-flavoured paper was released in 1981. In 1986, Rizla began rapid growth and large-scale advertising. One successful advertising campaign in 1986 was a popular series of calendars, T-Shirts and posters. A caf\u00e9 franchise, which was featured at various concerts in the UK in 1996, was also extremely popular. In 1997 they produced a limited edition King Size Rizla+ Purple medium-weight, extra width, king size rolling paper, in celebration of the Phoenix music festival.\n\nIn 1997, Rizla was sold to [[Imperial Tobacco]].\n\nIn 1998, Rizla continued their string of expansion and large-scale advertising, going so far as to release their own line of clothing, sold at their caf\u00e9s. In 2002 Rizla closed a deal with Suzuki and became one of their top motor-bike racing sponsors, forming the Rizla-Suzuki racing team. The [[Caterham Cars|Caterham]] Superlight R500 sports is available with Rizla markings following its launch in collaboration with Rizla-Suzuki.\n\nRizla added a new paper to its lineup in 2003, with the introduction of the Rizla+ Silver, Ultra-Thin, King Size rolling paper. In 2003 the UK [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Agency]] upheld a complaint that Rizla+ had alluded to their products' association with cannabis in a print advertisement that bore the caption \"twist and burn\".\n\nIn 2004, two more types of Rizla papers were released; one, the Rizla Red, Medium Weight, Slim paper is exclusive to the United Kingdom and The Republic of Ireland. The other variety released in 2003 was the Rizla+ Silver (regular size) Ultra-Thin rolling paper.\n\nIn 2002, Imperial Tobacco closed Rizla's historic factory at [[Maz\u00e8res-sur-Salat]] near [[Saint-Gaudens, Haute-Garonne|Saint-Gaudens]] (south of France). In September 2005 [[Imperial Tobacco]] announced the closure of Rizla's Treforest factory at [[Pontypridd]] near [[Cardiff]] in South Wales with a loss of 134 jobs.  After the closure of the factory, Rizla production is now concentrated at [[Wilrijk]], Belgium.\n\nFrom 2006 until 2011, Rizla sponsored the [[Suzuki]] [[MotoGP]] bike under [[Rizla Suzuki]] MotoGP team, which was ridden by [[\u00c1lvaro Bautista]].\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{In popular culture|section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:RizlaWarning2010.jpg|thumb|Current expiry warning]]\n* The brand is mentioned several times in [[Alex Garland]]\u2019s 1996 novel ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]''.\n* In the 2014 film [[Kingsman: The Secret Service|Kingsman]], Dean and his mother ask Eggsy if he has any Rizla.\n* [[Amy Winehouse]] mentions Rizla in her 2003 song \"Bestfriends, right\".\n* [[QBoy]] mentions Rizla in his rap in the single \"DragOn\" - a weed smoking hip hop anthem in 2015; \"''Blue Slims and a fat 20 bag of Lemon Haze''\".\n* [[Parquet Courts]] mentions Rizla in the song \"Yonder is Closer to the Heart\" off the 2012 album ''[[Light Up Gold]]''.<ref>\"Parquet Courts - Yonder Is Closer To The Heart Lyrics | MetroLyrics.\" http://www.metrolyrics.com/yonder-is-closer-to-the-heart-lyrics-parquet-courts.html.

It was rumored that the themes of trust and betrayal, particularly certain lyrics from the songs \"A Minor Variation\" and \"The Great Wall of China\", stem from Joel's legal disputes with his former manager and ex-brother-in-law, Frank Weber, who reportedly embezzled millions of dollars from Joel and used dubious accounting practices to cover it up.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Andrew|title=Billy Joel on Not Working and Not Giving Up Drinking|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/billy-joel-on-not-working-and-not-giving-up-drinking.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSince the release of the album, Joel has eschewed recording studio albums as a performer, but continues to tour, record occasional singles and released a classical album featuring solo piano performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo|Hyung-ki \"Richard\" Joo]] titled ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'' in 2001.\n\nThe album cover was a painting by Joel's then-wife, [[Christie Brinkley]].

''River of Dreams'' presented a much more serious tone from Joel than found in his previous albums, dealing with issues such as trust and long-lasting love. It was rumored that the themes of trust and betrayal, particularly certain lyrics from the songs \"A Minor Variation\" and \"The Great Wall of China\", stem from Joel's legal disputes with his former manager and ex-brother-in-law, Frank Weber, who reportedly embezzled millions of dollars from Joel and used dubious accounting practices to cover it up.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldman|first=Andrew|title=Billy Joel on Not Working and Not Giving Up Drinking|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/magazine/billy-joel-on-not-working-and-not-giving-up-drinking.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSince the release of the album, Joel has eschewed recording studio albums as a performer, but continues to tour, record occasional singles and released a classical album featuring solo piano performed by [[Hyung-ki Joo|Hyung-ki \"Richard\" Joo]] titled ''[[Fantasies & Delusions]]'' in 2001.\n\nThe album cover was a painting by Joel's then-wife, [[Christie Brinkley]]. In 1993, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave her the ''Top Picks'' award for \"The Best Album Cover of the Year\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Christie Brinkley biography|publisher=Official website|url=http://www.christiebrinkley.com/bio.html|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>\n\nThe music video for the title track has over 25 million views on YouTube as of July 25, 2019.<ref>{{Citation|last=billyjoelVEVO|title=Billy Joel \u2013 The River of Dreams|date=2009-10-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSq4B_zHqPM|accessdate=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nIn the summer of 1992, Billy Joel held a series of writing and recording sessions on Shelter Island, New York;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onefinalserenade.com/river-of-dreams-article.html|title=River of Dreams article|website=ONE FINAL SERENADE: THE SONGS OF BILLY JOEL (BILLY JOEL FAN SITE)|language=en|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> these sessions eventually produced seven tracks,<ref>{{Citation|last=Tony Walker|title=Billy Joel Shelter Island Sessions Part 1-No Mans Land-Large.m4v|date=2011-12-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZIkWYsGmcA&list=PL-HzNWxgD9K6r63hh4oRLvb9TtkmjENrZ|access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref> self-produced by Joel.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Billy Joel|last=Schruers|first=Fred|publisher=Crown Archetype|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8041-4019-5|location=|pages=218\u2013220}}</ref>\n\nJoel was dissatisfied with the results, and so, on the recommendation of [[Don Henley]], he brought in session guitarist [[Danny Kortchmar]] for another take on the songs. Kortchmar agreed to produce, provided he be allowed to use session musicians on the recordings, to which Joel agreed.
