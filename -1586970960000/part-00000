He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.\" According to the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel; Genesis 35:10) had 12 sons and at least one daughter ([[Dinah]]) by two wives and two concubines. The twelve sons fathered the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]].\n* When the land of Israel was apportioned among the tribes in the days of [[Joshua]], the [[Levite|Tribe of Levi]], being chosen as priests, did not receive land ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:33|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|14:3|HE}}). However, the tribe of Levi were given cities. Six cities were to be refuge cities for all men of Israel, which were to be controlled by the Levites. Three of these cities were located on each side of the Jordan River. In addition, 42 other cities (and their respective open spaces), totaling 48 cities, were given to the Tribe of Levi. ({{bibleverse||Numbers|35|HE}})\n* Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] (the two sons of Joseph by his Egyptian wife [[Asenath]]) ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:50|HE}}) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the [[Tribe of Joseph]] (Genesis 48:5). Each tribe received its own land and had its own encampment during the 40 years of wandering in the desert.\n\nThus, the two divisions of the tribes are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Northern Kingdom came into existence in about the 930s BCE after the northern [[tribes of Israel]] rejected Solomon's son [[Rehoboam]] as their king. Nine landed tribes formed the Northern Kingdom: the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]]. In addition, some members of the Tribe of Levi, who had no land allocation, were found in the Northern Kingdom. The tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] remained loyal to Rehoboam, and formed the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (or the Southern Kingdom). Members of Levi and the remnant of [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] were also found in the Southern Kingdom.\n\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|HE}}, members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] \"fled\" to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]] (c. 911\u2013870 BCE). Whether these groups were absorbed into the population or remained distinct groups or returned to their tribal lands is not indicated.\n\nIn c. 732 BCE, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] sacked [[Damascus]] and Israel, annexing [[Aramea]]<ref name=Grabbe>Lester L. Grabbe, ''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?''

People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] system in Assyria/Mesopotamia. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janohah|Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of [[Naphtali]]. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|HE}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\n\nIsrael continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom subject to Assyria until around [[725 BCE|725]]\u2013[[720 BCE]], when it was again invaded by Assyria and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, leaving only the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]] who lived among them of the original Israelite tribes in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, [[Israel Finkelstein]] estimated that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser V]], and [[Sargon II]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Israel |last2=Silberman |first2=Neil Asher |title=The Bible unearthed: archaeology's new vision of ancient Israel and the origin of its sacred texts |date=2001 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9780684869124}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2018}} Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water ([[Siloam]]) to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etTUEorS1zMC&pg=PA174|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1841272019}}</ref> Furthermore, {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-11|HE}} explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians\u2014in particular, members of Dan, Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, and Zebulun\u2014and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem at that time.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible does not use the phrase \"ten lost tribes\", leading some to question the number of tribes involved. {{bibleref2|1 Kings|11:31|HE}} states that the kingdom would be taken from [[Solomon]] and ten tribes given to [[Jeroboam]]:\n\n{{quote|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:31|HE}}}}\n\n{{quote|But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:35|HE}}}}\n\n===Biblical apocrypha===\nAccording to Zvi Ben-Dor Benite:\n\n<blockquote>Centuries after their disappearance, the ten lost tribes sent an indirect but vital sign ...

(Since the [[Edict of Expulsion]] in 1290, Jews had been prohibited by law from living in [[England]].) With the approach of 1666, considered a significant date, Cromwell was allegedly interested in the return of the Jews to England because of the many theories circulating related to millennial thinking about the [[End Time|end of the world]]. Many of these ideas were fixed upon the year 1666 and the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] who were looking for the return of [[Jesus]] as the [[Messiah]]; he was expected to establish a final kingdom to rule the physical world for a thousand years. Messianic believers supported Cromwell's Republic in the expectation that it was a preparation for the ''[[fifth monarchy]]''\u2014that is, the monarchy that should succeed the [[Babylonia]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world empires.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nApocryphal accounts concerning the Lost Tribes, based to varying degrees on biblical accounts, have been produced by both [[Jew]]s and [[Christianity|Christians]] since at least the 17th century.<ref name=Benite/>{{rp|59}} An [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish tradition speaks of these tribes as ''Die Roite Yiddelech'', \"the little [[red Jews]]\", cut off from the rest of Jewry by the legendary river [[Sambation]], \"whose foaming waters raise high up into the sky a wall of fire and smoke that is impossible to pass through\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rosen |first1=Moses |editor1-last=Riff |editor1-first=Michael |title=The face of survival : Jewish life in Eastern Europe past and present |date=1992 |publisher=Valentine Mitchell |location=London |isbn=9780853032298 |url=https://archive.org/details/faceofsurvival00mich |url-access=registration |chapter=Epilogue: The Recipe|oclc=28236867|page=[https://archive.org/details/faceofsurvival00mich/page/215 215]}}</ref>\n\nHistorians generally concluded that the groups referred to as the Lost Tribes merged with the local population.

As people come to a knowledge of Jesus Christ, receiving the ordinances of salvation and keeping the associated covenants, they become 'the children of the covenant' ([[Third Nephi|3 Nephi]] 20:26).\"\n\nThe church also teaches that \"The power and authority to direct the work of gathering the house of Israel was given to [[Joseph Smith]] by the prophet Moses, who appeared in 1836 in the Kirtland Temple.&nbsp;... The Israelites are to be gathered spiritually first and then physically. They are gathered spiritually as they join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and make and keep sacred covenants.&nbsp;...

He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.\" According to the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], [[Jacob]] (who was later named Israel; Genesis 35:10) had 12 sons and at least one daughter ([[Dinah]]) by two wives and two concubines. The twelve sons fathered the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]].\n* When the land of Israel was apportioned among the tribes in the days of [[Joshua]], the [[Levite|Tribe of Levi]], being chosen as priests, did not receive land ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:33|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|14:3|HE}}). However, the tribe of Levi were given cities. Six cities were to be refuge cities for all men of Israel, which were to be controlled by the Levites. Three of these cities were located on each side of the Jordan River. In addition, 42 other cities (and their respective open spaces), totaling 48 cities, were given to the Tribe of Levi. ({{bibleverse||Numbers|35|HE}})\n* Jacob elevated the descendants of [[Ephraim]] and [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Manasseh]] (the two sons of Joseph by his Egyptian wife [[Asenath]]) ({{bibleverse||Genesis|41:50|HE}}) to the status of full tribes in their own right, replacing the [[Tribe of Joseph]] (Genesis 48:5). Each tribe received its own land and had its own encampment during the 40 years of wandering in the desert.\n\nThus, the two divisions of the tribes are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Northern Kingdom came into existence in about the 930s BCE after the northern [[tribes of Israel]] rejected Solomon's son [[Rehoboam]] as their king. Nine landed tribes formed the Northern Kingdom: the tribes of [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]], [[Tribe of Issachar|Issachar]], [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]], [[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]]. In addition, some members of the Tribe of Levi, who had no land allocation, were found in the Northern Kingdom. The tribes of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] remained loyal to Rehoboam, and formed the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (or the Southern Kingdom). Members of Levi and the remnant of [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] were also found in the Southern Kingdom.\n\nAccording to {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|15:9|HE}}, members of the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]], and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]] \"fled\" to Judah during the reign of [[Asa of Judah]] (c. 911\u2013870 BCE). Whether these groups were absorbed into the population or remained distinct groups or returned to their tribal lands is not indicated.\n\nIn c. 732 BCE, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] sacked [[Damascus]] and Israel, annexing [[Aramea]]<ref name=Grabbe>Lester L. Grabbe, ''Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It?''

People from these tribes, including the Reubenite leader, were taken captive and resettled in the region of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] system in Assyria/Mesopotamia. Tiglath-Pilesar also captured the territory of [[Tribe of Naphtali|Naphtali]] and the city of [[Janohah|Janoah]] in [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]], and an Assyrian governor was placed over the region of [[Naphtali]]. According to {{Bibleverse|2|Kings|16:9|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|15:29|HE}}, the population of Aram and the annexed part of Israel was deported to Assyria.\n\nIsrael continued to exist within the reduced territory as an independent kingdom subject to Assyria until around [[725 BCE|725]]\u2013[[720 BCE]], when it was again invaded by Assyria and the rest of the population deported. The Bible relates that the population of Israel was exiled, leaving only the [[Tribe of Judah]], the [[Tribe of Simeon]] (that was \"absorbed\" into Judah), the [[Tribe of Benjamin]], and the people of the [[Tribe of Levi]] who lived among them of the original Israelite tribes in the southern Kingdom of Judah. However, [[Israel Finkelstein]] estimated that only a fifth of the population (about 40,000) were actually resettled out of the area during the two deportation periods under [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Shalmaneser V]], and [[Sargon II]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelstein |first1=Israel |last2=Silberman |first2=Neil Asher |title=The Bible unearthed: archaeology's new vision of ancient Israel and the origin of its sacred texts |date=2001 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9780684869124}}</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2018}} Many also fled south to Jerusalem, which appears to have expanded in size fivefold during this period, requiring a new wall to be built, and a new source of water ([[Siloam]]) to be provided by King [[Hezekiah]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etTUEorS1zMC&pg=PA174|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1841272019}}</ref> Furthermore, {{Bibleverse|2|Chronicles|30:1-11|HE}} explicitly mentions northern Israelites who had been spared by the Assyrians\u2014in particular, members of Dan, Ephraim, Manasseh, Asher, and Zebulun\u2014and how members of the latter three returned to worship at the Temple in Jerusalem at that time.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible does not use the phrase \"ten lost tribes\", leading some to question the number of tribes involved. {{bibleref2|1 Kings|11:31|HE}} states that the kingdom would be taken from [[Solomon]] and ten tribes given to [[Jeroboam]]:\n\n{{quote|And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:31|HE}}}}\n\n{{quote|But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.|{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:35|HE}}}}\n\n===Biblical apocrypha===\nAccording to Zvi Ben-Dor Benite:\n\n<blockquote>Centuries after their disappearance, the ten lost tribes sent an indirect but vital sign ...

With the approach of 1666, considered a significant date, Cromwell was allegedly interested in the return of the Jews to England because of the many theories circulating related to millennial thinking about the [[End Time|end of the world]]. Many of these ideas were fixed upon the year 1666 and the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]] who were looking for the return of [[Jesus]] as the [[Messiah]]; he was expected to establish a final kingdom to rule the physical world for a thousand years.

Between 1810 and the early 1820s, numerous settlers visited the Oxford area, primarily to hunt and [[animal trapping|trap]]. The first documented sale of [[public land]] in this area was recorded in 1823 to Elbridge Deming, who later built a [[log cabin]] on land in [[section (land)|section 9]] (in the area of [[M-24 (Michigan highway)|M-24]] and Metamora Road) of the township, around the spring of 1832.\n\nOxford Township was not officially created until after Michigan became a state in 1837. It was originally part of [[Oakland Charter Township, Michigan|Oakland Township]], as were [[Addison Township, Michigan|Addison Township]] and [[Orion Township, Michigan|Orion Township]]; Oxford Township was split away and separately organized in 1837. The 1830s saw an influx of settlers to the area, originally known as Demingsburgh, Demings Corners, and Oxford Corners, before becoming known as Oxford in 1836. The [[family name]]s of many early settlers to the area are evident today in names of streets and buildings, such as Powell, Hovey, Burdick, and Axford.\n\nNew residents continued the trek to Oxford Township, many settling in sections 22 and 27 of what was to become the village of [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]] in 1876. Along with residents came commerce and industry. A downtown area was built in the village, but much of the area south of Burdick Street and west of Washington Street burned to the ground in 1878. When rebuilt, most of the buildings were of [[brick]] and [[masonry]] construction and are still in use today. The 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s found Oxford a prospering commercial center, with such businesses as Oxford Carriage Factory, Oxford Machine Works, Oxford Valley Mills, Oxford Brewery and several furniture and cabinetry shops.\n\nIn addition to the village of Oxford, two other smaller communities developed in other areas of the township. The first developed near Baldwin and Oakwood roads, on the boundary with [[Brandon Township, Michigan|Brandon Township]]; the community of Oakwood reached a population of nearly 200 people by 1876 with a [[foundry]] and \"the usual shops and stores\".\n\nA [[railroad station]] and facilities were necessary near the northern edge of the township, and so the second community, Thomas, was developed. The place was platted by John Thomas in 1871.<ref name=mst/>  Thomas had a store, hotel, [[grain elevator]] and [[gristmill]] by the late 1870s.\n\nThomas and Oakwood continued to prosper until May 1896, when they were largely devastated by a monster [[tornado]] which traveled across the entire north end of Oakland County. The tornado killed 41 people and injured 46 others in northern Oakland and southern Lapeer counties. Seventeen of the fatalities were in the northern portion of Oxford Township, from the Oakwood village area to Thomas. While many of the homes in Oakwood and Thomas were rebuilt, the two communities were never again centers of commerce. Railroads were largely responsible for change and continued growth in the Oxford area. No longer isolated from [[Detroit]], and now joined with communities to the north, Oxford's commerce thrived. In addition to its businesses and factories, agriculture was a mainstay for the community. At one time in the 1880s, Oxford earned the nickname, Bagatown, from the large number of [[rutabaga]]s shipped out by train.\n\nThe early 1880s saw a second railroad constructed from the [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] area, through Oxford to [[Port Austin, Michigan|Port Austin]]. Known as the Pontiac, Oxford, and Port Austin Railroad, or P.O. and P.A., it later became the Pontiac, Oxford, and Northern (P.O. and N.), and finally the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]]. With the expansion of the second rail line through town, it now became possible to travel to the tip of [[the Thumb|Michigan's thumb]] in one day. By 1900, a third, all electric powered passenger rail line known as the [[Detroit United Railway]] (D.U.R.) was extended through Oxford from Detroit to [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and was noted for maintaining limited cars daily, both north and southbound. Over the years, the D.U.R. was involved in many collisions with automobiles, often resulting in death or injury to those whose automobiles tangled with the interurban cars at grade crossings. As automobile transportation became more reliable and roads improved, a growing percentage of the populace chose to travel by these means, forcing the demise of the D.U.R. in 1931.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|35.2|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|33.9|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.3|sqmi}}, or 3.78%, is water.\n{{Geographic location\n| Center = Oxford Township\n| North     = [[Metamora Township, Michigan|Metamora Township]]<br />[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]]\n| Northwest = [[Hadley Township, Michigan|Hadley Township]]<br />[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]]\n| Northeast = [[Dryden Township, Michigan|Dryden Township]]<br />[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]]\n| East      = [[Addison Township, Michigan|Addison Township]]\n| Southeast = [[Oakland Charter Township, Michigan|Oakland Township]]\n| South     = [[Orion Township, Michigan|Orion Township]]\n| Southwest = [[Independence Township, Michigan|Independence Township]]\n| West      = [[Brandon Township, Michigan|Brandon Township]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 16,025 people, 5,787 households, and 4,317 families residing in the township.

For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.9 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $63,494, and the median income for a family was $75,216. Males had a median income of $52,083 versus $32,258 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the township was $26,601. About 2.1% of families and 4.3% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.9% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 and over.\n\n==Notable people==\nOne of the most recognizable voices throughout the nation in the 1940s and 1950s was that of [[Brace Beemer]], the radio voice of the [[Lone Ranger]]. \nBeemer lived in Oxford Township on a 300-acre ranch on Drahner Road.  There is a street named for him in the southwest part of the township, where he lived.\nHis collection of Lone Ranger items is on display in the Northeast Oakland Historical Museum in Oxford.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Michigan}}\n* [http://www.oxfordtownship.org/ Oxford Township]\n*[http://www.oxparkrec.org/ Oxford Township Parks & Recreation]\n\n{{Oakland County, Michigan}}\n{{Metro Detroit}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1837 establishments in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1837]]\n[[Category:Townships in Oakland County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Charter townships in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Townships in Michigan]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Oxford Township, Michigan\n|official_name            = Charter Township of Oxford\n|settlement_type          = [[Charter township]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = Washingtonstoxford.JPG\n|imagesize                = 275\n|image_caption            = Village of [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]] within Oxford Township\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n|pushpin_map            =Michigan\n|pushpin_label_position =left<!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_label          =Oxford Township\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location within the state of Michigan\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|image_map                = Oxford Charter Township, MI location.png\n|mapsize                  = 250\n|map_caption              = Location within [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]] (red) and the administered village of [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]] (pink)\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Michigan]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Michigan|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]]\n\n<!-- Government -->\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = Supervisor\n|leader_name              = William Dunn\n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = Established\n|established_date         = 1837\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|unit_pref  =  Imperial\n|area_footnotes           = \n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = 91.2\n|area_land_km2            = 87.8\n|area_water_km2           = 3.4\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 35.2\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 33.9\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 1.3\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_footnotes     = \n|population_total         = 20526\n|population_density_km2   = auto\n|population_density_sq_mi =\n|population_metro         = 4296250 ([[Metro Detroit]])\t\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern (EST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = EDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_m              = 316\n|elevation_ft             = 1037\n|coordinates              = {{coord|42|49|25|N|83|16|14|W|region:US-MI|display=inline,title}}\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP Code|ZIP code(s)]]\n|postal_code              = 48371\n|area_code                = [[Area codes 248 and 947|248]] and [[Area code 810|810]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 26-62040<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref>\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 1626877<ref>{{gnis|1626877}}</ref>\n|website                  = {{URL|http://oxfordtownship.net/|Official website}}\n|footnotes                = \n}}\n'''Charter Township of Oxford''' is a [[charter township]] of [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]].

Between 1810 and the early 1820s, numerous settlers visited the Oxford area, primarily to hunt and [[animal trapping|trap]]. The first documented sale of [[public land]] in this area was recorded in 1823 to Elbridge Deming, who later built a [[log cabin]] on land in [[section (land)|section 9]] (in the area of [[M-24 (Michigan highway)|M-24]] and Metamora Road) of the township, around the spring of 1832.\n\nOxford Township was not officially created until after Michigan became a state in 1837. It was originally part of [[Oakland Charter Township, Michigan|Oakland Township]], as were [[Addison Township, Michigan|Addison Township]] and [[Orion Township, Michigan|Orion Township]]; Oxford Township was split away and separately organized in 1837. The 1830s saw an influx of settlers to the area, originally known as Demingsburgh, Demings Corners, and Oxford Corners, before becoming known as Oxford in 1836. The [[family name]]s of many early settlers to the area are evident today in names of streets and buildings, such as Powell, Hovey, Burdick, and Axford.\n\nNew residents continued the trek to Oxford Township, many settling in sections 22 and 27 of what was to become the village of [[Oxford, Michigan|Oxford]] in 1876. Along with residents came commerce and industry. A downtown area was built in the village, but much of the area south of Burdick Street and west of Washington Street burned to the ground in 1878. When rebuilt, most of the buildings were of [[brick]] and [[masonry]] construction and are still in use today. The 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s found Oxford a prospering commercial center, with such businesses as Oxford Carriage Factory, Oxford Machine Works, Oxford Valley Mills, Oxford Brewery and several furniture and cabinetry shops.\n\nIn addition to the village of Oxford, two other smaller communities developed in other areas of the township. The first developed near Baldwin and Oakwood roads, on the boundary with [[Brandon Township, Michigan|Brandon Township]]; the community of Oakwood reached a population of nearly 200 people by 1876 with a [[foundry]] and \"the usual shops and stores\".\n\nA [[railroad station]] and facilities were necessary near the northern edge of the township, and so the second community, Thomas, was developed. The place was platted by John Thomas in 1871.<ref name=mst/>  Thomas had a store, hotel, [[grain elevator]] and [[gristmill]] by the late 1870s.\n\nThomas and Oakwood continued to prosper until May 1896, when they were largely devastated by a monster [[tornado]] which traveled across the entire north end of Oakland County. The tornado killed 41 people and injured 46 others in northern Oakland and southern Lapeer counties. Seventeen of the fatalities were in the northern portion of Oxford Township, from the Oakwood village area to Thomas. While many of the homes in Oakwood and Thomas were rebuilt, the two communities were never again centers of commerce. Railroads were largely responsible for change and continued growth in the Oxford area. No longer isolated from [[Detroit]], and now joined with communities to the north, Oxford's commerce thrived. In addition to its businesses and factories, agriculture was a mainstay for the community. At one time in the 1880s, Oxford earned the nickname, Bagatown, from the large number of [[rutabaga]]s shipped out by train.\n\nThe early 1880s saw a second railroad constructed from the [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] area, through Oxford to [[Port Austin, Michigan|Port Austin]]. Known as the Pontiac, Oxford, and Port Austin Railroad, or P.O. and P.A., it later became the Pontiac, Oxford, and Northern (P.O. and N.), and finally the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]]. With the expansion of the second rail line through town, it now became possible to travel to the tip of [[the Thumb|Michigan's thumb]] in one day. By 1900, a third, all electric powered passenger rail line known as the [[Detroit United Railway]] (D.U.R.) was extended through Oxford from Detroit to [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and was noted for maintaining limited cars daily, both north and southbound. Over the years, the D.U.R. was involved in many collisions with automobiles, often resulting in death or injury to those whose automobiles tangled with the interurban cars at grade crossings. As automobile transportation became more reliable and roads improved, a growing percentage of the populace chose to travel by these means, forcing the demise of the D.U.R. in 1931.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|35.2|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|33.9|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.3|sqmi}}, or 3.78%, is water.\n{{Geographic location\n| Center = Oxford Township\n| North     = [[Metamora Township, Michigan|Metamora Township]]<br />[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]]\n| Northwest = [[Hadley Township, Michigan|Hadley Township]]<br />[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]]\n| Northeast = [[Dryden Township, Michigan|Dryden Township]]<br />[[Lapeer County, Michigan|Lapeer County]]\n| East      = [[Addison Township, Michigan|Addison Township]]\n| Southeast = [[Oakland Charter Township, Michigan|Oakland Township]]\n| South     = [[Orion Township, Michigan|Orion Township]]\n| Southwest = [[Independence Township, Michigan|Independence Township]]\n| West      = [[Brandon Township, Michigan|Brandon Township]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 16,025 people, 5,787 households, and 4,317 families residing in the township.

The name derives from the direction of the winds that blow from the  northeast. The original use of the term in North America is associated with storms that impact the upper north Atlantic coast of the [[United States]] and the Atlantic Provinces of [[Canada]].\n\nTypically, such storms originate as a [[atmospheric pressure|low-pressure]] area that forms within {{convert|100|mi|km}} of the shore between [[North Carolina]] and [[Massachusetts]]. The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical storm]]s. Nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy [[rain]] or [[snow]], and can cause severe [[coastal flooding]], [[coastal erosion]], [[Beaufort Scale|hurricane-force]] winds, or [[Blizzard|blizzard conditions]]. Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in [[New England]] and [[Atlantic Canada]]. They thrive on converging air masses\u2014the cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the water\u2014and are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|author=Multi-Community Environmental Storm Observatory|title=Nor'easters|year=2006|publisher=Multi-community Environmental Storm Observatory |url=http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009034304/http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"noaafeature\">{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/features/03_protecting/noreasters.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214123432/http://www.noaa.gov/features/03_protecting/noreasters.html|archivedate=February 14, 2016|title=Know the dangers of nor\u2019easters|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref><ref name=\"disc2\">{{cite web|author=How stuff works|title=What are nor'easters?|year=2006|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2008|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question595.htm}}</ref>\n\nNor'easters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of October and April, although they can (much less commonly) develop during other parts of the year as well.

One of the earliest uses of this term is recorded in the Bible. In the book of Acts, the author Luke refers to a storm on the Mediterranean as a northeaster. The original Greek refers to this storm with the word [[Euroclydon]], which is defined as \"a storm with an east wind\" or just \"the east wind.\" <ref>Acts 27:14</ref> <ref>https://levendwater.org/bible_interlinear/greek/2148.htm</ref> <ref>https://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/NTpdf/act27.pdf</ref> Other early recorded uses of the contraction ''nor'' (for ''north'') in combinations such as ''nor'-east'' and ''nor-nor-west'', as reported by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', date to the late 16th century, as in John Davis's 1594 ''The Seaman's Secrets'': \"Noreast by North raiseth a degree in sayling 24 leagues.\"<ref>\"nor'-east, n., adj., and adv.\" [[OED]] Online. Oxford University Press, January 2018. Web. March 13, 2018.</ref> The spelling appears, for instance, on a [[Compass rose|compass card]] published in 1607. Thus, the manner of pronouncing from memory the 32 [[points of the compass]], known in maritime training as \"boxing the compass\", is described by Ansted<ref>Ansted. ''A Dictionary of Sea Terms'', Brown Son & Ferguson, Glasgow, 1933</ref> with pronunciations \"Nor'east (or west),\" \"Nor' Nor'-east (or west),\" \"Nor'east b' east (or west),\" and so forth. According to the OED, the first recorded use of the term \"nor'easter\" occurs in 1836 in a translation of [[Aristophanes]]. The term \"nor'easter\" naturally developed from the historical spellings and pronunciations of the compass points and the direction of wind or sailing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nAs noted in a January 2006 editorial by William Sisson, editor of ''Soundings'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundingsonline.com |title=Featuring Boating News, Stories and More |publisher=Soundings Online |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref> use of \"nor'easter\" to describe the storm system is common along the U.S. East Coast. Yet it has been asserted by linguist Mark Liberman (see below) that \"nor'easter\" as a contraction for \"northeaster\" has no basis in regional New England dialect; the [[Boston accent]] would elide the \"R\": ''no'theastuh'''.  He describes nor'easter as a \"fake\" word. However, this view neglects the little-known etymology and the historical maritime usage described above.\n\n19th-century Downeast mariners pronounced the compass point \"north northeast\" as \"no'nuth-east\", and so on.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} For decades, Edgar Comee, of [[Brunswick, Maine]], waged a determined battle against use of the term \"nor'easter\" by the press, which usage he considered \"a pretentious and altogether lamentable affectation\" and \"the odious, even loathsome, practice of landlubbers who would be seen as salty as the sea itself\". His efforts, which included mailing hundreds of postcards, were profiled, just before his death at the age of 88, in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref>{{cite web | last =McGrath | first =Ben | title =Nor\u2019Easter | work =The New Yorker: Tsk-Tsk Dept. | publisher =Cond\u00e9 Nast | date =September 5, 2005 | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/05/050905ta_talk_mcgrath | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite the efforts of Comee and others, use of the term continues by the press. According to ''Boston Globe'' writer [[Jan Freeman]], \"from 1975 to 1980, journalists used the nor\u2019easter spelling only once in five mentions of such storms; in the past year (2003), more than 80 percent of northeasters were spelled nor'easter\".<ref>{{cite web | last =Freeman | first =Jan | title =Guys and dolls | work =Boston Globe: The Word | publisher =The New York Times Company | date =December 21, 2003 | url =http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/12/21/guys_and_dolls/ | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[University of Pennsylvania]] linguistics professor [[Mark Liberman]] has pointed out that while the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples dating back to 1837, these examples represent the contributions of a handful of non-New England poets and writers. Liberman posits that \"nor'easter\" may have originally been a [[Syncope (phonology)|literary affectation]], akin to \"e'en\" for \"even\" and \"th'only\" for \"the only\", which is an indication in spelling that two syllables count for only one position in metered verse, with no implications for actual pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web | last =Liberman | first =Mark | title =Nor\u2019Easter Considered Fake | work =Language Log | date =January 25, 2004 | url =http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000386.html | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite these assertions, the term can be found in the writings of New Englanders, and was frequently used by the press in the 19th century.\n* ''[[The Hartford Times]]'' reported on a storm striking New York in December 1839, and observed, \"We Yankees had a share of this same \"noreaster,\" but it was quite moderate in comparison to the one of the 15h inst.\"<ref>\"Snow Storm\", ''[[The Hartford Times]]'', Hartford, December 28, 1836</ref>\n* [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], in his semi-autobiographical work ''[[The Story of a Bad Boy]]'' (1870), wrote \"We had had several slight flurries of hail and snow before, but this was a regular nor'easter\".<ref name=\"Aldrich1911\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Bailey Aldrich|title=The Story of a Bad Boy|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofbadboy00aldr|accessdate=May 19, 2013|year=1911|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin}}</ref>\n* In her story \"In the Gray Goth\" (1869) [[Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward]] wrote \"...and there was snow in the sky now, setting in for a regular nor'easter\".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/WarnerCharles-1896v38-15625 |title=Library of the World's Best Literature |author=Charles Dudley Warner |date=1896 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>\n* John H.

The corridor in yellow gives the position of the Gulf Stream]]\n\n===Formation===\nNor'easters develop in response to the sharp contrast in the warm [[Gulf Stream]] ocean current coming up from the tropical Atlantic and the cold air masses coming down from Canada. When the very cold and dry air rushes southward and meets up with the warm Gulf stream current, which is often near {{convert|70|F|C}} even in mid-winter, intense low pressure develops.\n\nIn the [[upper atmosphere]], the strong winds of the [[jet stream]] remove and replace rising air from the Atlantic more rapidly than the Atlantic air is replaced at lower levels; this and the [[Coriolis force]] help develop a strong storm. The storm tracks northeast along the East Coast, normally from North Carolina to Long Island, then moves toward the area east of [[Cape Cod]]. Counterclockwise winds around the [[low-pressure system]] blow the moist air over land. The relatively warm, moist air meets cold air coming southward from Canada. The low increases the surrounding pressure difference, which causes the very different air masses to collide at a faster speed. When the difference in temperature of the air masses is larger, so is the storm's instability, turbulence, and thus severity.<ref name=autogenerated1/><ref name=\"disc1\">{{cite web|author=Storm-E|title=Nor'easters|year=2007|accessdate=January 22, 2008|url=http://www3.cet.edu/weather2/h17.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626044252/http://www3.cet.edu/weather2/h17.html|archivedate=June 26, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe nor'easters taking the East Coast track usually indicates the presence of a [[High pressure|high-pressure]] area in the vicinity of [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=\"disc4\">{{cite web|author = The Weather Channel|title = Nor'easters|year = 2007|publisher = [[The Weather Channel]]|accessdate = January 24, 2016|url = http://dw.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/noreast.html|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160408114440/http://dw.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/noreast.html|archivedate = April 8, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Sometimes a nor'easter will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain (New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, etc.) and snow in New England (Boston northward). On occasion, nor'easters can pull cold air as far south as Virginia or North Carolina, bringing as wet snow inland in those areas for a brief time. <ref name=\"disc3\">{{cite web|author=Multi-Community Environmental Storm Observatory|title=Nor'easters|year=2006|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2008 |url=http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009034304/http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}</ref> Such a storm will rapidly intensify, tracking northward and following the topography of the East Coast, sometimes continuing to grow stronger during its entire existence. A nor'easter usually reaches its peak intensity while off the [[Canada|Canadian coast]]. The storm then reaches Arctic areas, and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]. It then meanders throughout the [[North Atlantic]] and can last for several weeks.<ref name=\"disc3\"/>\n\n===Characteristics===\nNor'easters are usually formed by an area of [[vorticity]] associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop. Such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms, a \"parent storm\", and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet stream.\n\nUntil the nor'easter passes, thick, dark, low-level clouds often block out the sun. Temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction. During a single storm, the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist. All precipitation types can occur in a nor'easter. High wind gusts, which can reach hurricane strength, are also associated with a nor'easter. On very rare occasions, such as in the [[Northeastern United States Blizzard of 1978|nor'easter in 1978]], [[North American blizzard of 2006]], and [[January 2018 North American blizzard]], the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a [[hurricane]] and have a small \"dry slot\" near the center, which can be mistaken for an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], although it is not an eye.\n\n====Difference from tropical cyclones====\nOften, people mistake nor'easters for [[tropical cyclones]] and do not differentiate between the two weather systems. Nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor'easters are cold-core low-pressure systems, meaning that they thrive on drastic changes in temperature of Canadian air and warm Atlantic waters.  Tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems, which means they thrive on purely warm temperatures.\n\n====Difference from other extratropical storms====\nA nor'easter is formed in a strong [[extratropical cyclone]], usually experiencing [[bombogenesis]]. While this formation occurs in many places around the world, nor'easters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds. Nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the Pacific Northeast (northern Japan and northwards) with winds from NW-N. In Europe, similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible; the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow, though NE winds can be strong.\n\n===Geography===\nThe eastern United States, from [[North Carolina]] to Maine, and [[Eastern Canada]] can experience nor'easters, though most often they affect the areas from New England northward. The effects of a nor'easter sometimes bring high surf and strong winds as far south as coastal [[South Carolina]]. Nor'easters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas, as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areas.\n\nBiologists at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] on [[Cape Cod]] have determined nor'easters are an environmental factor for [[red tide]]s on the Atlantic coast.\n\n==List of nor'easters==\n{{See also|List of Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale winter storms|List of Regional Snowfall Index Category 5 winter storms}}\nA list of nor'easters with short description about the events.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=top\n! width=200 | Event\n!

Two people were killed.\n|- valign=top\n| [[2011 Halloween nor'easter]]\n| October 28 \u2013 November 1, 2011\n| A rare, historic nor'easter, which produced record breaking snowfall for October in many areas of the Northeastern U.S., especially New England. The storm produced a maximum of {{convert|32|in|cm}} of snow in [[Peru, Massachusetts]], and killed 39 people. After the storm, the rest of the winter for New England remained very quiet, with much less than average snowfall and no other significant storms to strike the region for the rest of the season.\n|- valign=top\n| [[November 2012 nor'easter]]\n| November 7\u201310, 2012\n| A moderately strong nor'easter that struck the same regions that were impacted by [[Hurricane Sandy]] a week earlier.

It also left several residents in the Northeast without power again after their power was restored following Hurricane Sandy. Highest snowfall total from the storm was {{convert|13|in|cm}}, recorded in [[Clintonville, Connecticut]].\n|- valign=top\n| [[Late December 2012 North American storm complex]]\n| December 17\u201331, 2012\n| A major nor'easter that was known for its [[tornado outbreak]] across the [[Gulf Coast]] states on [[Christmas]] day as well as giving areas such as northeastern [[Texas]] a white Christmas. The low underwent secondary [[cyclogenesis]] near the coast of North Carolina and dumped a swath of heavy snow across northern New England and New York, caused blizzard conditions across the [[Ohio Valley]], as well as an [[ice storm]] in the mountains of the Virginia and West Virginia.\n|- valign=top\n| [[Early February 2013 North American blizzard]]\n| February 7\u201318, 2013\n| An extremely powerful and historic nor'easter that dumped heavy snow and unleashed hurricane-force wind gusts across New England. Many areas received well over {{convert|2|ft|cm}} of snow, especially Connecticut, Rhode Island, and eastern Massachusetts. The highest amount recorded was {{convert|40|in|cm}} in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], and Gorham, Maine, received a record {{convert|35.5|in|cm}}. Over 700,000 people were left without power and travel in the region came to a complete standstill. On the afternoon of February 9, when the storm was pulling away from the Northeastern United States, a well defined eye was seen in the center. The eye feature was no longer there the next day and the storm quickly moved out to sea. The nor'easter later moved on to impact the [[United Kingdom]], before finally dissipating on February 20. The storm killed 18 people.\n|- valign=top\n| [[March 2013 nor'easter]]\n| March 1\u201321, 2013\n| A large and powerful nor'easter that ended up stalling along the eastern seaboard due to a blocking ridge of high pressure in [[Newfoundland]] and pivoted back heavy snow and strong winds into the Northeast United States for a period of 2 to 3 days. Many officials and residents were caught off guard as local weather stations predicted only a few inches (several centimeters) of snow and a change over to mostly rain. Contrary to local forecasts, many areas received over {{convert|1|ft|cm|spell=in}} of snow, with the highest amount being {{convert|29|in|cm}} in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Several schools across the region, particularly in the [[Boston, Massachusetts]], metropolitan area, remained in session during the height of the storm, not knowing the severity of the situation. Rough surf and rip currents were felt all the way southwards towards Florida's east coast.\n|- valign=top\n| [[January 2015 North American blizzard]]\n| January 23\u201331, 2015\n| Unlike recent historical winter storms, there was no indication that a storm of this magnitude was coming until about 3 days in advance. The [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|European computer model (ECMWF)]] first picked up on the potential for the nor'easter sometime before January 24. By the afternoon of January 24, most if not all major computer models were forecasting the storm to be much more severe than previously indicated earlier in the week. On the same day, the National Weather Service said they were aware about the potential for a major, crippling snowstorm but decided to hold off on winter weather headlines due to still being in the middle of another nor'easter. The Blizzard began as an [[Alberta Clipper]] in the Midwestern States, which was forecast to transfer its energy to a new, secondary Low Pressure off the coast of the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid Atlantic]] and move northeastward and pass to the south and east of New England. Before the transition began, most of the area was being affected by generally light snow on the morning and afternoon of January 26. It wasn't until the evening into the early morning hours of January 27, that the storm was forecast to begin rapid deepening, stall, and also do a loop. It did stall for a time, however, the loop of the storm that was forecast did not happen. Due to this the storm began to slowly pull away to the northeast, a little quicker than expected. Contrary to local forecasts, western portions of the area, including western Connecticut and New York City only receiving a general {{convert|4|to|6|in|cm}} of snow, with a maximum of {{convert|9|in|cm}} recorded at [[Central Park]]. Further to the east, the storm brought over {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow to much of the area, with several reports of over {{convert|30|in|cm}} across the State of Massachusetts, breaking many records. A maximum of {{convert|36|in|cm}} was recorded in at least four towns across [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] in Massachusetts and the city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] itself received {{convert|34.5|in|cm}}, marking the city's largest storm snowfall accumulation on record. The city of Boston recorded {{convert|24.6|in|cm}}, making it the largest storm snowfall accumulation during the month of January and the city's sixth largest storm snowfall accumulation on record. On the coast of Massachusetts, Hurricane Force gusts up to around {{cvt|80|mph|km/h}} along with sustained winds between {{cvt|50|and|55|mph|km/h}} at times, were reported. The storm also caused severe coastal flooding and [[storm surge]]. The storm bottomed out to a central pressure of {{cvt|970|mb}}. By January 28, the storm began to pull away from the area.\n|- valign=top\n| [[October 2015 North American storm complex]] \n| September 29 \u2013 October 2, 2015\n| In early October, a low pressure system formed in the Atlantic, Tapping into moisture from [[Hurricane Joaquin]], the storm dumped a huge amount of rain, mostly in [[South Carolina]].\n|- valign=top\n| [[January 2016 United States blizzard]] (also known as Winter Storm Jonas, Snowzilla, or The Blizzard of 2016 by media outlets)\n| January 19\u201329, 2016\n| This system dumped {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm}} of snow in the East Coast of the United States. States of Emergencies were declared in 12 States in advance of the storm as well as by the Mayor of [[Washington D.C.]]. The blizzard also caused significant storm surge in New Jersey and Delaware that was equal to or worse than Hurricane Sandy. Sustained damaging winds over {{cvt|50|mph|km/h}} were recorded in many coastal communities, with a maximum gust to {{cvt|85|mph|km/h}} on [[Assateague Island]], Virginia. A total of 55 people died due to the storm.\n|- valign=top\n| [[February 2017 United States blizzard]] (also known as Winter Storm Niko and The Blizzard of 2017 by media outlets)\n| February 6\u201311, 2017\n| Forming as an Alberta clipper in the northern United States on February 6, the system initially produced light snowfall from the Midwest to the Ohio Valley as it tracked southeastwards. It eventually reached the East Coast of the United States on February 9 and began to rapidly grow into a powerful nor'easter, dumping {{convert|1|to|2|ft|cm}} across the Northeast Megapolis. The storm also produced prolific thunder and lightning across [[Southern New England]]. Prior to the blizzard, unprecedented and record-breaking warmth had enveloped the region, with record highs of above {{cvt|60|F|C}} recorded in several areas, including Central Park in New York City. Some were caught off guard by the warmth and had little time to prepare for the snowstorm.\n|- valign=top\n| October 2017 nor'easter\n| October 28\u201331, 2017\n| An extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Philippe (2017)#Preparations and impact|Tropical Storm Philippe]]. The combined systems became an extremely powerful nor'easter that wreaked havoc across the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada. The storm produced sustained tropical storm force winds along with hurricane-force wind gusts. The highest wind gust recorded was {{cvt|93|mph|km/h}} in [[Popponesset, Massachusetts]]. The storm caused over 1,400,000 power outages. Damage across New England, especially in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, was extreme. This was due to the combination of the high winds, heavy rainfall, saturated ground, and most trees still being fully leaved. Autumn foliage in parts of northern New England was removed from the landscape in a matter of hours due to high winds. Some residents in Connecticut were without power for nearly a week following the storm. Heavy rain in [[Quebec]] and [[Eastern Ontario]], with up to {{cvt|98|mm|in}} in the Canadian capital region of [[Ottawa]], greatly interfered with transportation.\n|- valign=top\n| [[January 2018 North American blizzard]] \n| January 2\u20136, 2018\n| A powerful blizzard that caused severe disruption along the East Coast of the United States and Canada. It dumped snow and ice in places that rarely receive wintry precipitation, even in the winter, such as Florida and Georgia, and produced snowfall accumulations of over 2 feet (61&nbsp;cm) in the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and Atlantic Canada. The storm originated on January 3 as an area of low pressure off the coast of the Southeast. Moving swiftly to the northeast, the storm explosively deepened while moving parallel to the Eastern Seaboard, causing significant snowfall accumulations. The storm received various unofficial names, such as Winter Storm Grayson, Blizzard of 2018 and Storm Brody. The storm was also dubbed a \"historic bomb cyclone\", with a minimum central pressure of 948 mb, similar to that of a Category 3 or 4 hurricane \n|- valign=top\n| [[March 1-3, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Riley or False Tropical Storm Riley by media outlets)\n| March 1\u20135, 2018\n| A very powerful nor'easter that caused major impacts in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. It originated as the northernmost low of a stationary front over the Midwest on March 1, which moved eastward into the Northeast later that night. A new low pressure system rapidly formed off the coast on March 2 as it slowly meandered near the coastline. It peaked later that day and began to gradually move out to sea by March 3. Producing over 2 feet (24&nbsp;in) of snow in some areas, it was one of the most significant March snowstorms in many areas, particularly in Upstate New York. In other areas, it challenged storm surge records set by other significant storms, such as Hurricane Sandy. It also produced widespread damaging winds, with gusts well over Hurricane force strength in some areas across Eastern New England as well as on the back side in the Mid-Atlantic via a [[sting jet]]. Over 2.2 million customers were left without power.\n|- valign=top\n| [[March 6-8, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Quinn by media outlets) \n| March 2\u20139, 2018\n| A powerful nor'easter that affected the Northeast United States. It came just days after [[March 1-3, 2018 nor'easter|another nor'easter]] devastated much of the Northeast. Frequent cloud to ground [[Thundersnow]] as well as snowfall rates of up to 3 inches (7.6&nbsp;cm) an hour were reported in areas around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-State Area]], signaling the rapid intensification of the storm. Late in the afternoon, an eye-like feature was spotted near the center of the storm. It dumped over 2 feet of snow in many areas across the Northeast, including many areas in [[New England]] where the predominant precipitation type was rain for the previous storm. Over 1 million power outages were reported at the height of the storm due to the weight of the heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines. Many people who lost power in the previous storm found themselves in the dark again.\n|- valign=top\n| [[2017\u201318 North American winter#March nor'easters|March 12\u201314, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Skylar by media outlets) \n| March 11\u201314, 2018\n| A powerful nor'easter that affected portions of the Northeast United States. The storm underwent [[Explosive cyclogenesis|rapid intensification]] with a central [[Millibar|millibaric pressure]] dropping down from 1001 mb to 974 mb in just 24 hours. This was the third major storm to strike the area within a period of 11 days. The storm dumped over up 2 feet of snow and brought Hurricane-force wind gusts to portions of Eastern New England. Hundreds of public school districts including, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] were closed on Tuesday, March 13.\n|-valign=top \n| [[March 20\u201322, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Toby and Four'Easter by media outlets)\n| March 20\u201322, 2018  \n| A powerful nor'easter that became the fourth major nor'easter to affect the Northeast United States in a period of less than three weeks. It caused a [[List of United States tornadoes from January to March 2018|severe weather outbreak]] over the Southern United States on March 19 before moving off of the [[North Carolina]] coast on March 20 and spreading freezing rain and snow into the Mid-Atlantic States after shortly dissipating later that night. A new low pressure center then formed off of [[Chesapeake Bay]] on March 21 and then became the primary nor'easter. Dry air prevented most of the precipitation from reaching the ground in areas in [[New England]] such as [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], all of which received little to no accumulation, in contrast with what local forecasts had originally predicted. In [[Islip, New York]] at the height of the storm, snowfall rates of up to 5 inches per hour were reported. 8 inches was reported at [[Central Park]] and over 12 inches was reported in many locations on [[Long Island]] as well in and around [[New York City]] and in parts of [[New Jersey]]. Over 100,000 customers lost power at the peak of the storm, mostly due to the weight of the heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines, with a majority of the outages being in New Jersey. \n|-valign=top \n| July 21\u201322, 2018 nor'easter \n| July 21\u201322, 2018 \n| A rare summertime nor'easter that developed off the coast of North Carolina along the [[warm front]] of a powerful upper level low during July 21 and retrograded to the west into Delaware and Pennsylvania then rapidly weakened in [[Upstate New York]] on the morning of July 22. An extremely rare summertime [[Wind Advisory]] was issued for parts of New Jersey, New York City, Long Island, and Connecticut. The storm produced strong to damaging winds that created [[tropical storm]] conditions for much of New Jersey, New York City, and Long Island. The western side of the storm also brought excessive rainfall and extensive flooding in several metropolitan areas in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] while the tail of the storm channeled a huge moisture feed into [[Southern New England]] along with the threat for [[waterspouts]] and [[tornadoes]], though none were reported. \n|-valign=top\n| October 25\u201328 nor'easter \n| October 25\u201328, 2018 \n| An early season nor'easter that developed along the Gulf Coast near [[Louisiana]] and trekked northeastward then northward into [[Long Island]] and [[Southern New England]]. It formed on October 25 and absorbed the remnant moisture from [[Hurricane Willa]]. It brought severe weather along the [[Gulf Coast]], [[Florida]], and the [[Carolinas]], though only minor instances were reported. The nor'easter intensified on October 26 and the morning of October 27th, before becoming [[Occluded front|occluded]] and moving inland late on the 27th. The storm brought strong to damaging winds for many coastal areas in the Northeast as well as moderate to major coastal flooding for [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], and parts of [[Connecticut]], with levels coming close to what was experienced during [[Hurricane Sandy]], especially in western parts of [[Long Island Sound]]. The storm was also responsible for an early season snow to parts of [[Upstate New York]] and [[Northern New England]]. Accumulations were minor. \n|-valign=top\n| April 2\u20134 nor'easter\n| April 2\u20134, 2019 \n| A very significant, large, and intense late season Nor'easter that brushed parts of the [[East Coast of the United States]] while undergoing [[Explosive cyclogenesis|explosive cyclogensis]]. Impacts were thankfully very minor and limited to light to moderate rain in parts of Eastern North Carolina and in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. Some snow, however was reported in downtown [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and nearby locations in North Carolina during the afternoon of April 2, though no accumulation was reported. Minor accumulations were reported in parts of [[Downeast Maine]] as well as in the higher terrain areas of Northern [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]] before daybreak on April 3. Behind the storm, many of these same areas that experienced snow warmed significantly in a matter of a few hours from around 30 degrees to above 60 degrees on strong westerly winds of 50&nbsp;mph. The winds prompted several [[Red flag warning|Red Flag Warnings]] across the [[Northeastern United States]], mainly west of the [[Hudson River Valley]]. On April 4, while the winds were weaker, Red Flag Warnings were then expanded to all of Southern New England and Long Island. Winds of 50&nbsp;mph continued across Eastern Maine as the nor'easter continued to pull into the [[Canadian Maritimes]]. \n|-valign=top\n| March 5\u20138 nor'easter \n| March 5\u20138, 2020 \n| An extremely significant and powerful Nor'easter that nearly missed the [[Northeastern United States]]. It underwent [[Explosive cyclogenesis|bombogensis]] and developed into a Hurricane Force [[Low Pressure]] as it passed well south and east of the 40 North/70 West Benchmark. The same storm was responsible for a [[Tornado outbreak of March 2-3, 2020|a Tornado Outbreak in the Southeastern United States]] days prior. Impacts along the East Coast were limited to light rain and snow showers for most with [[High Wind Warning]] conditions and minor snow accumulations and near Blizzard conditions for [[Cape Cod]] and the Islands. A buoy to the southeast of [[Nantucket]] reported Sustained Winds of 55 mph and Gusts up to 74 mph before going offline. An eye-like feature was seen on radar on the morning of March 7th as the storm pulled away. \n|-valign=top\n| March 31 \u2013 April 4 nor'easter\n| March 31 \u2013 April 4, 2020 \n| A very significant, large, and intense late season Nor'easter that narrowly missed the [[East Coast of the United States]] while undergoing bombogensis into a Hurricane Force Low with a very large wind field. It stalled and looped over the open Atlantic due to the Greenland Block and came close enough to parts of Southern New England to bring rain and snow as well as gusty to damaging winds while looping, especially in Eastern Massachusetts. Similar to Tropical Cyclones, the Nor'easter exhibited an eye-like feature while at its peak intensity, which was less than 980 millibars at one point. \n|-valign=top\n| [[2020 Easter tornado outbreak|April 12-13 nor'easter]]\n| April 12-13, 2020\n| A very large and significant extratropical cyclone developed from moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on April 10. A series of destructive tornadoes affected the Southeastern United States on Easter Sunday and Monday, April 12\u201313, 2020. Several were responsible for prompting tornado emergencies, including the first one to be issued by the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina. A large squall line formed and tracked through the mid-Atlantic on April 13, prompting multiple tornado warnings and watches. Fifteen total watches were produced during the course of the event, two of which were designated Particularly Dangerous Situations. With 34 tornadic fatalities reported, it was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the U.S. since the April 2014 tornado outbreak. The nor'easter moved up the east coast, affecting areas such as New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, [[Washington D.C.]], Virginia, and North Carolina with 70 mph winds. A wind gust of 82 mph was reported in New Jersey.\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black nor'easter]]\n* [[Alberta clipper]]\n* [[Cold-core low]]\n* [[Panhandle hook]]\n* [[Sudestada]]\n* [[Winter storm]]\n* [[Pacific Northwest windstorm]]\n* [[Aleutian low]]\n* [[European windstorm]]\n* [[Polar vortex]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nor'easters}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQeU4tMS8fQ Blizzard Video: Dec 9, 2005] (duration: 9m59sec)\n* Archived issues of [https://web.archive.org/web/20061208172105/http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/noreaster/ ''NOR'EASTER''] (Magazine of the Northeast Sea Grant Programs), published until 1999.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071222203840/http://journals.aol.com/monponsett/HighAboveCourtside/entries/2007/04/17/april-noreaster-the-beast-of-the-east/1741 Duxbury, Massachusetts April 2007 Nor'easter photos]\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2018}}\n\n{{Extratropical cyclones}}\n\n[[Category:Nor'easters| ]]\n[[Category:Extratropical cyclones]]\n[[Category:Weather events in the United States]]\n[[Category:Weather events in Canada]]\n[[Category:Blizzards in the United States|*]]\n[[Category:Blizzards in Canada|*]]\n[[Category:Culture of New England]]\n[[Category:Northeastern United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{multiple image\n | width = 220\n | direction = vertical\n | image1 = Early_January_2018_Nor'easter_2018-01-04_1345Z.jpg\n | caption1 = Satellite image of  the \nintense nor'easter responsible for the [[January 2018 North American blizzard]].

The name derives from the direction of the winds that blow from the  northeast. The original use of the term in North America is associated with storms that impact the upper north Atlantic coast of the [[United States]] and the Atlantic Provinces of [[Canada]].\n\nTypically, such storms originate as a [[atmospheric pressure|low-pressure]] area that forms within {{convert|100|mi|km}} of the shore between [[North Carolina]] and [[Massachusetts]]. The precipitation pattern is similar to that of other [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical storm]]s. Nor'easters are usually accompanied by very heavy [[rain]] or [[snow]], and can cause severe [[coastal flooding]], [[coastal erosion]], [[Beaufort Scale|hurricane-force]] winds, or [[Blizzard|blizzard conditions]]. Nor'easters are usually most intense during winter in [[New England]] and [[Atlantic Canada]]. They thrive on converging air masses\u2014the cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the water\u2014and are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greater.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|author=Multi-Community Environmental Storm Observatory|title=Nor'easters|year=2006|publisher=Multi-community Environmental Storm Observatory |url=http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009034304/http://www.mcwar.org/articles/noreasters/NorEasters.html |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"noaafeature\">{{cite web|url=http://www.noaa.gov/features/03_protecting/noreasters.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214123432/http://www.noaa.gov/features/03_protecting/noreasters.html|archivedate=February 14, 2016|title=Know the dangers of nor\u2019easters|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration}}</ref><ref name=\"disc2\">{{cite web|author=How stuff works|title=What are nor'easters?|year=2006|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2008|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question595.htm}}</ref>\n\nNor'easters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of October and April, although they can (much less commonly) develop during other parts of the year as well.

One of the earliest uses of this term is recorded in the Bible. In the book of Acts, the author Luke refers to a storm on the Mediterranean as a northeaster. The original Greek refers to this storm with the word [[Euroclydon]], which is defined as \"a storm with an east wind\" or just \"the east wind.\" <ref>Acts 27:14</ref> <ref>https://levendwater.org/bible_interlinear/greek/2148.htm</ref> <ref>https://www.scripture4all.org/OnlineInterlinear/NTpdf/act27.pdf</ref> Other early recorded uses of the contraction ''nor'' (for ''north'') in combinations such as ''nor'-east'' and ''nor-nor-west'', as reported by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', date to the late 16th century, as in John Davis's 1594 ''The Seaman's Secrets'': \"Noreast by North raiseth a degree in sayling 24 leagues.\"<ref>\"nor'-east, n., adj., and adv.\" [[OED]] Online. Oxford University Press, January 2018. Web. March 13, 2018.</ref> The spelling appears, for instance, on a [[Compass rose|compass card]] published in 1607. Thus, the manner of pronouncing from memory the 32 [[points of the compass]], known in maritime training as \"boxing the compass\", is described by Ansted<ref>Ansted. ''A Dictionary of Sea Terms'', Brown Son & Ferguson, Glasgow, 1933</ref> with pronunciations \"Nor'east (or west),\" \"Nor' Nor'-east (or west),\" \"Nor'east b' east (or west),\" and so forth. According to the OED, the first recorded use of the term \"nor'easter\" occurs in 1836 in a translation of [[Aristophanes]]. The term \"nor'easter\" naturally developed from the historical spellings and pronunciations of the compass points and the direction of wind or sailing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nAs noted in a January 2006 editorial by William Sisson, editor of ''Soundings'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundingsonline.com |title=Featuring Boating News, Stories and More |publisher=Soundings Online |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref> use of \"nor'easter\" to describe the storm system is common along the U.S. East Coast. Yet it has been asserted by linguist Mark Liberman (see below) that \"nor'easter\" as a contraction for \"northeaster\" has no basis in regional New England dialect; the [[Boston accent]] would elide the \"R\": ''no'theastuh'''.  He describes nor'easter as a \"fake\" word. However, this view neglects the little-known etymology and the historical maritime usage described above.\n\n19th-century Downeast mariners pronounced the compass point \"north northeast\" as \"no'nuth-east\", and so on.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} For decades, Edgar Comee, of [[Brunswick, Maine]], waged a determined battle against use of the term \"nor'easter\" by the press, which usage he considered \"a pretentious and altogether lamentable affectation\" and \"the odious, even loathsome, practice of landlubbers who would be seen as salty as the sea itself\". His efforts, which included mailing hundreds of postcards, were profiled, just before his death at the age of 88, in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref>{{cite web | last =McGrath | first =Ben | title =Nor\u2019Easter | work =The New Yorker: Tsk-Tsk Dept. | publisher =Cond\u00e9 Nast | date =September 5, 2005 | url =http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/09/05/050905ta_talk_mcgrath | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite the efforts of Comee and others, use of the term continues by the press. According to ''Boston Globe'' writer [[Jan Freeman]], \"from 1975 to 1980, journalists used the nor\u2019easter spelling only once in five mentions of such storms; in the past year (2003), more than 80 percent of northeasters were spelled nor'easter\".<ref>{{cite web | last =Freeman | first =Jan | title =Guys and dolls | work =Boston Globe: The Word | publisher =The New York Times Company | date =December 21, 2003 | url =http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/12/21/guys_and_dolls/ | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[University of Pennsylvania]] linguistics professor [[Mark Liberman]] has pointed out that while the Oxford English Dictionary cites examples dating back to 1837, these examples represent the contributions of a handful of non-New England poets and writers. Liberman posits that \"nor'easter\" may have originally been a [[Syncope (phonology)|literary affectation]], akin to \"e'en\" for \"even\" and \"th'only\" for \"the only\", which is an indication in spelling that two syllables count for only one position in metered verse, with no implications for actual pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web | last =Liberman | first =Mark | title =Nor\u2019Easter Considered Fake | work =Language Log | date =January 25, 2004 | url =http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000386.html | accessdate = June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, despite these assertions, the term can be found in the writings of New Englanders, and was frequently used by the press in the 19th century.\n* ''[[The Hartford Times]]'' reported on a storm striking New York in December 1839, and observed, \"We Yankees had a share of this same \"noreaster,\" but it was quite moderate in comparison to the one of the 15h inst.\"<ref>\"Snow Storm\", ''[[The Hartford Times]]'', Hartford, December 28, 1836</ref>\n* [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], in his semi-autobiographical work ''[[The Story of a Bad Boy]]'' (1870), wrote \"We had had several slight flurries of hail and snow before, but this was a regular nor'easter\".<ref name=\"Aldrich1911\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Bailey Aldrich|title=The Story of a Bad Boy|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofbadboy00aldr|accessdate=May 19, 2013|year=1911|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin}}</ref>\n* In her story \"In the Gray Goth\" (1869) [[Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward]] wrote \"...and there was snow in the sky now, setting in for a regular nor'easter\".<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/WarnerCharles-1896v38-15625 |title=Library of the World's Best Literature |author=Charles Dudley Warner |date=1896 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>\n* John H.

The corridor in yellow gives the position of the Gulf Stream]]\n\n===Formation===\nNor'easters develop in response to the sharp contrast in the warm [[Gulf Stream]] ocean current coming up from the tropical Atlantic and the cold air masses coming down from Canada. When the very cold and dry air rushes southward and meets up with the warm Gulf stream current, which is often near {{convert|70|F|C}} even in mid-winter, intense low pressure develops.\n\nIn the [[upper atmosphere]], the strong winds of the [[jet stream]] remove and replace rising air from the Atlantic more rapidly than the Atlantic air is replaced at lower levels; this and the [[Coriolis force]] help develop a strong storm. The storm tracks northeast along the East Coast, normally from North Carolina to Long Island, then moves toward the area east of [[Cape Cod]]. Counterclockwise winds around the [[low-pressure system]] blow the moist air over land. The relatively warm, moist air meets cold air coming southward from Canada. The low increases the surrounding pressure difference, which causes the very different air masses to collide at a faster speed. When the difference in temperature of the air masses is larger, so is the storm's instability, turbulence, and thus severity.<ref name=autogenerated1/><ref name=\"disc1\">{{cite web|author=Storm-E|title=Nor'easters|year=2007|accessdate=January 22, 2008|url=http://www3.cet.edu/weather2/h17.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626044252/http://www3.cet.edu/weather2/h17.html|archivedate=June 26, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe nor'easters taking the East Coast track usually indicates the presence of a [[High pressure|high-pressure]] area in the vicinity of [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=\"disc4\">{{cite web|author = The Weather Channel|title = Nor'easters|year = 2007|publisher = [[The Weather Channel]]|accessdate = January 24, 2016|url = http://dw.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/noreast.html|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160408114440/http://dw.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/noreast.html|archivedate = April 8, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Sometimes a nor'easter will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain (New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, etc.) and snow in New England (Boston northward).

A nor'easter usually reaches its peak intensity while off the [[Canada|Canadian coast]]. The storm then reaches Arctic areas, and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]. It then meanders throughout the [[North Atlantic]] and can last for several weeks.<ref name=\"disc3\"/>\n\n===Characteristics===\nNor'easters are usually formed by an area of [[vorticity]] associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop. Such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms, a \"parent storm\", and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet stream.\n\nUntil the nor'easter passes, thick, dark, low-level clouds often block out the sun. Temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction. During a single storm, the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist. All precipitation types can occur in a nor'easter. High wind gusts, which can reach hurricane strength, are also associated with a nor'easter. On very rare occasions, such as in the [[Northeastern United States Blizzard of 1978|nor'easter in 1978]], [[North American blizzard of 2006]], and [[January 2018 North American blizzard]], the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a [[hurricane]] and have a small \"dry slot\" near the center, which can be mistaken for an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], although it is not an eye.\n\n====Difference from tropical cyclones====\nOften, people mistake nor'easters for [[tropical cyclones]] and do not differentiate between the two weather systems. Nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that nor'easters are cold-core low-pressure systems, meaning that they thrive on drastic changes in temperature of Canadian air and warm Atlantic waters.  Tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems, which means they thrive on purely warm temperatures.\n\n====Difference from other extratropical storms====\nA nor'easter is formed in a strong [[extratropical cyclone]], usually experiencing [[bombogenesis]]. While this formation occurs in many places around the world, nor'easters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds. Nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the Pacific Northeast (northern Japan and northwards) with winds from NW-N. In Europe, similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible; the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow, though NE winds can be strong.\n\n===Geography===\nThe eastern United States, from [[North Carolina]] to Maine, and [[Eastern Canada]] can experience nor'easters, though most often they affect the areas from New England northward. The effects of a nor'easter sometimes bring high surf and strong winds as far south as coastal [[South Carolina]]. Nor'easters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas, as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areas.\n\nBiologists at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] on [[Cape Cod]] have determined nor'easters are an environmental factor for [[red tide]]s on the Atlantic coast.\n\n==List of nor'easters==\n{{See also|List of Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale winter storms|List of Regional Snowfall Index Category 5 winter storms}}\nA list of nor'easters with short description about the events.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=top\n! width=200 | Event\n!

After the storm, the rest of the winter for New England remained very quiet, with much less than average snowfall and no other significant storms to strike the region for the rest of the season.\n|- valign=top\n| [[November 2012 nor'easter]]\n| November 7\u201310, 2012\n| A moderately strong nor'easter that struck the same regions that were impacted by [[Hurricane Sandy]] a week earlier. The storm exacerbated the problems left behind by Sandy, knocking down trees that were weakened by Sandy. It also left several residents in the Northeast without power again after their power was restored following Hurricane Sandy. Highest snowfall total from the storm was {{convert|13|in|cm}}, recorded in [[Clintonville, Connecticut]].\n|- valign=top\n| [[Late December 2012 North American storm complex]]\n| December 17\u201331, 2012\n| A major nor'easter that was known for its [[tornado outbreak]] across the [[Gulf Coast]] states on [[Christmas]] day as well as giving areas such as northeastern [[Texas]] a white Christmas. The low underwent secondary [[cyclogenesis]] near the coast of North Carolina and dumped a swath of heavy snow across northern New England and New York, caused blizzard conditions across the [[Ohio Valley]], as well as an [[ice storm]] in the mountains of the Virginia and West Virginia.\n|- valign=top\n| [[Early February 2013 North American blizzard]]\n| February 7\u201318, 2013\n| An extremely powerful and historic nor'easter that dumped heavy snow and unleashed hurricane-force wind gusts across New England. Many areas received well over {{convert|2|ft|cm}} of snow, especially Connecticut, Rhode Island, and eastern Massachusetts. The highest amount recorded was {{convert|40|in|cm}} in [[Hamden, Connecticut]], and Gorham, Maine, received a record {{convert|35.5|in|cm}}. Over 700,000 people were left without power and travel in the region came to a complete standstill. On the afternoon of February 9, when the storm was pulling away from the Northeastern United States, a well defined eye was seen in the center. The eye feature was no longer there the next day and the storm quickly moved out to sea. The nor'easter later moved on to impact the [[United Kingdom]], before finally dissipating on February 20. The storm killed 18 people.\n|- valign=top\n| [[March 2013 nor'easter]]\n| March 1\u201321, 2013\n| A large and powerful nor'easter that ended up stalling along the eastern seaboard due to a blocking ridge of high pressure in [[Newfoundland]] and pivoted back heavy snow and strong winds into the Northeast United States for a period of 2 to 3 days. Many officials and residents were caught off guard as local weather stations predicted only a few inches (several centimeters) of snow and a change over to mostly rain. Contrary to local forecasts, many areas received over {{convert|1|ft|cm|spell=in}} of snow, with the highest amount being {{convert|29|in|cm}} in [[Milton, Massachusetts]]. Several schools across the region, particularly in the [[Boston, Massachusetts]], metropolitan area, remained in session during the height of the storm, not knowing the severity of the situation. Rough surf and rip currents were felt all the way southwards towards Florida's east coast.\n|- valign=top\n| [[January 2015 North American blizzard]]\n| January 23\u201331, 2015\n| Unlike recent historical winter storms, there was no indication that a storm of this magnitude was coming until about 3 days in advance. The [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|European computer model (ECMWF)]] first picked up on the potential for the nor'easter sometime before January 24. By the afternoon of January 24, most if not all major computer models were forecasting the storm to be much more severe than previously indicated earlier in the week. On the same day, the National Weather Service said they were aware about the potential for a major, crippling snowstorm but decided to hold off on winter weather headlines due to still being in the middle of another nor'easter. The Blizzard began as an [[Alberta Clipper]] in the Midwestern States, which was forecast to transfer its energy to a new, secondary Low Pressure off the coast of the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid Atlantic]] and move northeastward and pass to the south and east of New England. Before the transition began, most of the area was being affected by generally light snow on the morning and afternoon of January 26. It wasn't until the evening into the early morning hours of January 27, that the storm was forecast to begin rapid deepening, stall, and also do a loop. It did stall for a time, however, the loop of the storm that was forecast did not happen. Due to this the storm began to slowly pull away to the northeast, a little quicker than expected. Contrary to local forecasts, western portions of the area, including western Connecticut and New York City only receiving a general {{convert|4|to|6|in|cm}} of snow, with a maximum of {{convert|9|in|cm}} recorded at [[Central Park]]. Further to the east, the storm brought over {{convert|20|in|cm}} of snow to much of the area, with several reports of over {{convert|30|in|cm}} across the State of Massachusetts, breaking many records. A maximum of {{convert|36|in|cm}} was recorded in at least four towns across [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] in Massachusetts and the city of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] itself received {{convert|34.5|in|cm}}, marking the city's largest storm snowfall accumulation on record. The city of Boston recorded {{convert|24.6|in|cm}}, making it the largest storm snowfall accumulation during the month of January and the city's sixth largest storm snowfall accumulation on record. On the coast of Massachusetts, Hurricane Force gusts up to around {{cvt|80|mph|km/h}} along with sustained winds between {{cvt|50|and|55|mph|km/h}} at times, were reported. The storm also caused severe coastal flooding and [[storm surge]]. The storm bottomed out to a central pressure of {{cvt|970|mb}}. By January 28, the storm began to pull away from the area.\n|- valign=top\n| [[October 2015 North American storm complex]] \n| September 29 \u2013 October 2, 2015\n| In early October, a low pressure system formed in the Atlantic, Tapping into moisture from [[Hurricane Joaquin]], the storm dumped a huge amount of rain, mostly in [[South Carolina]].\n|- valign=top\n| [[January 2016 United States blizzard]] (also known as Winter Storm Jonas, Snowzilla, or The Blizzard of 2016 by media outlets)\n| January 19\u201329, 2016\n| This system dumped {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm}} of snow in the East Coast of the United States. States of Emergencies were declared in 12 States in advance of the storm as well as by the Mayor of [[Washington D.C.]]. The blizzard also caused significant storm surge in New Jersey and Delaware that was equal to or worse than Hurricane Sandy. Sustained damaging winds over {{cvt|50|mph|km/h}} were recorded in many coastal communities, with a maximum gust to {{cvt|85|mph|km/h}} on [[Assateague Island]], Virginia. A total of 55 people died due to the storm.\n|- valign=top\n| [[February 2017 United States blizzard]] (also known as Winter Storm Niko and The Blizzard of 2017 by media outlets)\n| February 6\u201311, 2017\n| Forming as an Alberta clipper in the northern United States on February 6, the system initially produced light snowfall from the Midwest to the Ohio Valley as it tracked southeastwards. It eventually reached the East Coast of the United States on February 9 and began to rapidly grow into a powerful nor'easter, dumping {{convert|1|to|2|ft|cm}} across the Northeast Megapolis. The storm also produced prolific thunder and lightning across [[Southern New England]]. Prior to the blizzard, unprecedented and record-breaking warmth had enveloped the region, with record highs of above {{cvt|60|F|C}} recorded in several areas, including Central Park in New York City. Some were caught off guard by the warmth and had little time to prepare for the snowstorm.\n|- valign=top\n| October 2017 nor'easter\n| October 28\u201331, 2017\n| An extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of [[Tropical Storm Philippe (2017)#Preparations and impact|Tropical Storm Philippe]]. The combined systems became an extremely powerful nor'easter that wreaked havoc across the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada. The storm produced sustained tropical storm force winds along with hurricane-force wind gusts. The highest wind gust recorded was {{cvt|93|mph|km/h}} in [[Popponesset, Massachusetts]]. The storm caused over 1,400,000 power outages. Damage across New England, especially in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, was extreme. This was due to the combination of the high winds, heavy rainfall, saturated ground, and most trees still being fully leaved. Autumn foliage in parts of northern New England was removed from the landscape in a matter of hours due to high winds. Some residents in Connecticut were without power for nearly a week following the storm. Heavy rain in [[Quebec]] and [[Eastern Ontario]], with up to {{cvt|98|mm|in}} in the Canadian capital region of [[Ottawa]], greatly interfered with transportation.\n|- valign=top\n| [[January 2018 North American blizzard]] \n| January 2\u20136, 2018\n| A powerful blizzard that caused severe disruption along the East Coast of the United States and Canada. It dumped snow and ice in places that rarely receive wintry precipitation, even in the winter, such as Florida and Georgia, and produced snowfall accumulations of over 2 feet (61&nbsp;cm) in the Mid-Atlantic states, New England, and Atlantic Canada. The storm originated on January 3 as an area of low pressure off the coast of the Southeast. Moving swiftly to the northeast, the storm explosively deepened while moving parallel to the Eastern Seaboard, causing significant snowfall accumulations. The storm received various unofficial names, such as Winter Storm Grayson, Blizzard of 2018 and Storm Brody. The storm was also dubbed a \"historic bomb cyclone\", with a minimum central pressure of 948 mb, similar to that of a Category 3 or 4 hurricane \n|- valign=top\n| [[March 1-3, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Riley or False Tropical Storm Riley by media outlets)\n| March 1\u20135, 2018\n| A very powerful nor'easter that caused major impacts in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States. It originated as the northernmost low of a stationary front over the Midwest on March 1, which moved eastward into the Northeast later that night. A new low pressure system rapidly formed off the coast on March 2 as it slowly meandered near the coastline. It peaked later that day and began to gradually move out to sea by March 3. Producing over 2 feet (24&nbsp;in) of snow in some areas, it was one of the most significant March snowstorms in many areas, particularly in Upstate New York. In other areas, it challenged storm surge records set by other significant storms, such as Hurricane Sandy. It also produced widespread damaging winds, with gusts well over Hurricane force strength in some areas across Eastern New England as well as on the back side in the Mid-Atlantic via a [[sting jet]]. Over 2.2 million customers were left without power.\n|- valign=top\n| [[March 6-8, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Quinn by media outlets) \n| March 2\u20139, 2018\n| A powerful nor'easter that affected the Northeast United States. It came just days after [[March 1-3, 2018 nor'easter|another nor'easter]] devastated much of the Northeast. Frequent cloud to ground [[Thundersnow]] as well as snowfall rates of up to 3 inches (7.6&nbsp;cm) an hour were reported in areas around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-State Area]], signaling the rapid intensification of the storm. Late in the afternoon, an eye-like feature was spotted near the center of the storm. It dumped over 2 feet of snow in many areas across the Northeast, including many areas in [[New England]] where the predominant precipitation type was rain for the previous storm. Over 1 million power outages were reported at the height of the storm due to the weight of the heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines. Many people who lost power in the previous storm found themselves in the dark again.\n|- valign=top\n| [[2017\u201318 North American winter#March nor'easters|March 12\u201314, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Skylar by media outlets) \n| March 11\u201314, 2018\n| A powerful nor'easter that affected portions of the Northeast United States. The storm underwent [[Explosive cyclogenesis|rapid intensification]] with a central [[Millibar|millibaric pressure]] dropping down from 1001 mb to 974 mb in just 24 hours. This was the third major storm to strike the area within a period of 11 days. The storm dumped over up 2 feet of snow and brought Hurricane-force wind gusts to portions of Eastern New England. Hundreds of public school districts including, [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] were closed on Tuesday, March 13.\n|-valign=top \n| [[March 20\u201322, 2018 nor'easter]] (also known as Winter Storm Toby and Four'Easter by media outlets)\n| March 20\u201322, 2018  \n| A powerful nor'easter that became the fourth major nor'easter to affect the Northeast United States in a period of less than three weeks. It caused a [[List of United States tornadoes from January to March 2018|severe weather outbreak]] over the Southern United States on March 19 before moving off of the [[North Carolina]] coast on March 20 and spreading freezing rain and snow into the Mid-Atlantic States after shortly dissipating later that night. A new low pressure center then formed off of [[Chesapeake Bay]] on March 21 and then became the primary nor'easter. Dry air prevented most of the precipitation from reaching the ground in areas in [[New England]] such as [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], all of which received little to no accumulation, in contrast with what local forecasts had originally predicted. In [[Islip, New York]] at the height of the storm, snowfall rates of up to 5 inches per hour were reported. 8 inches was reported at [[Central Park]] and over 12 inches was reported in many locations on [[Long Island]] as well in and around [[New York City]] and in parts of [[New Jersey]]. Over 100,000 customers lost power at the peak of the storm, mostly due to the weight of the heavy, wet snow on trees and power lines, with a majority of the outages being in New Jersey. \n|-valign=top \n| July 21\u201322, 2018 nor'easter \n| July 21\u201322, 2018 \n| A rare summertime nor'easter that developed off the coast of North Carolina along the [[warm front]] of a powerful upper level low during July 21 and retrograded to the west into Delaware and Pennsylvania then rapidly weakened in [[Upstate New York]] on the morning of July 22. An extremely rare summertime [[Wind Advisory]] was issued for parts of New Jersey, New York City, Long Island, and Connecticut. The storm produced strong to damaging winds that created [[tropical storm]] conditions for much of New Jersey, New York City, and Long Island. The western side of the storm also brought excessive rainfall and extensive flooding in several metropolitan areas in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] while the tail of the storm channeled a huge moisture feed into [[Southern New England]] along with the threat for [[waterspouts]] and [[tornadoes]], though none were reported. \n|-valign=top\n| October 25\u201328 nor'easter \n| October 25\u201328, 2018 \n| An early season nor'easter that developed along the Gulf Coast near [[Louisiana]] and trekked northeastward then northward into [[Long Island]] and [[Southern New England]]. It formed on October 25 and absorbed the remnant moisture from [[Hurricane Willa]]. It brought severe weather along the [[Gulf Coast]], [[Florida]], and the [[Carolinas]], though only minor instances were reported. The nor'easter intensified on October 26 and the morning of October 27th, before becoming [[Occluded front|occluded]] and moving inland late on the 27th. The storm brought strong to damaging winds for many coastal areas in the Northeast as well as moderate to major coastal flooding for [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], and parts of [[Connecticut]], with levels coming close to what was experienced during [[Hurricane Sandy]], especially in western parts of [[Long Island Sound]]. The storm was also responsible for an early season snow to parts of [[Upstate New York]] and [[Northern New England]]. Accumulations were minor. \n|-valign=top\n| April 2\u20134 nor'easter\n| April 2\u20134, 2019 \n| A very significant, large, and intense late season Nor'easter that brushed parts of the [[East Coast of the United States]] while undergoing [[Explosive cyclogenesis|explosive cyclogensis]]. Impacts were thankfully very minor and limited to light to moderate rain in parts of Eastern North Carolina and in Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts. Some snow, however was reported in downtown [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and nearby locations in North Carolina during the afternoon of April 2, though no accumulation was reported. Minor accumulations were reported in parts of [[Downeast Maine]] as well as in the higher terrain areas of Northern [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]] before daybreak on April 3. Behind the storm, many of these same areas that experienced snow warmed significantly in a matter of a few hours from around 30 degrees to above 60 degrees on strong westerly winds of 50&nbsp;mph. The winds prompted several [[Red flag warning|Red Flag Warnings]] across the [[Northeastern United States]], mainly west of the [[Hudson River Valley]]. On April 4, while the winds were weaker, Red Flag Warnings were then expanded to all of Southern New England and Long Island. Winds of 50&nbsp;mph continued across Eastern Maine as the nor'easter continued to pull into the [[Canadian Maritimes]]. \n|-valign=top\n| March 5\u20138 nor'easter \n| March 5\u20138, 2020 \n| An extremely significant and powerful Nor'easter that nearly missed the [[Northeastern United States]]. It underwent [[Explosive cyclogenesis|bombogensis]] and developed into a Hurricane Force [[Low Pressure]] as it passed well south and east of the 40 North/70 West Benchmark. The same storm was responsible for a [[Tornado outbreak of March 2-3, 2020|a Tornado Outbreak in the Southeastern United States]] days prior. Impacts along the East Coast were limited to light rain and snow showers for most with [[High Wind Warning]] conditions and minor snow accumulations and near Blizzard conditions for [[Cape Cod]] and the Islands. A buoy to the southeast of [[Nantucket]] reported Sustained Winds of 55 mph and Gusts up to 74 mph before going offline. An eye-like feature was seen on radar on the morning of March 7th as the storm pulled away. \n|-valign=top\n| March 31 \u2013 April 4 nor'easter\n| March 31 \u2013 April 4, 2020 \n| A very significant, large, and intense late season Nor'easter that narrowly missed the [[East Coast of the United States]] while undergoing bombogensis into a Hurricane Force Low with a very large wind field. It stalled and looped over the open Atlantic due to the Greenland Block and came close enough to parts of Southern New England to bring rain and snow as well as gusty to damaging winds while looping, especially in Eastern Massachusetts. Similar to Tropical Cyclones, the Nor'easter exhibited an eye-like feature while at its peak intensity, which was less than 980 millibars at one point. \n|-valign=top\n| [[2020 Easter Tornado Outbreak|April 12-13 nor'easter]]\n| April 12-13, 2020\n| A very large and significant extratropical cyclone developed from moisture from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on April 10. A series of destructive tornadoes affected the Southeastern United States on Easter Sunday and Monday, April 12\u201313, 2020. Several were responsible for prompting tornado emergencies, including the first one to be issued by the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina. A large squall line formed and tracked through the mid-Atlantic on April 13, prompting multiple tornado warnings and watches. Fifteen total watches were produced during the course of the event, two of which were designated Particularly Dangerous Situations. With 34 tornadic fatalities reported, it was the deadliest tornado outbreak in the U.S. since the April 2014 tornado outbreak. The nor'easter moved up the east coast, affecting areas such as New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, [[Washington D.C.]], Virginia, and North Carolina with 70 mph winds.

It was launched in support of the group's 2006 album ''[[Eyes Open (album)|Eyes Open]]''. The band visited numerous international venues from 2006 through 2007. The tour is the collective name of many smaller tours and festivals Snow Patrol has played in support of their album. The tour officially commenced on 14 February 2006 with a \"secret gig\" called SG#3.\n\nThe tour saw the band visit continents like Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. The band headlined on almost all dates, and various acts supported them throughout. The tour was however marred by cancellations, mainly because of vocalist [[Gary Lightbody]]'s throat problems and bassist [[Paul Wilson (musician)|Paul Wilson]]'s shoulder injury. Additionally, other events happened with all other band members but no dates were affected. Drummer [[Jonny Quinn]] broke his arm, but no shows were cancelled as friend [[Graham Hopkins]] pitched in to take up drumming duties. Keyboardist [[Tom Simpson (musician)|Tom Simpson]] was arrested for drug charges, but was released in time for the next concert. Guitarist [[Nathan Connolly]] sprained his ankle and foot, but sat through shows till the injury healed. The band visited countries like New Zealand and Mexico for the first time and played their first concert in [[Southeast Asia]] during the course of the tour. The Eyes Open Tour also introduced the Tour Reporter feature, where fans were given the chance of covering their local concert.\n\nSnow Patrol finished the tour, which went on for a year and a half, in September 2007 in Australia. The full tour spanned 214 dates and had 37 cancellations.\n\n==Tickets==\n===Secret gigs and charity shows===\nSnow Patrol's official website initially offered tickets for the secret gig SG#3 to registered members on the forum.

It was launched in support of the group's 2006 album ''[[Eyes Open (album)|Eyes Open]]''. The band visited numerous international venues from 2006 through 2007. The tour is the collective name of many smaller tours and festivals Snow Patrol has played in support of their album. The tour officially commenced on 14 February 2006 with a \"secret gig\" called SG#3.\n\nThe tour saw the band visit continents like Europe, North America, Australia and Asia. The band headlined on almost all dates, and various acts supported them throughout. The tour was however marred by cancellations, mainly because of vocalist [[Gary Lightbody]]'s throat problems and bassist [[Paul Wilson (musician)|Paul Wilson]]'s shoulder injury. Additionally, other events happened with all other band members but no dates were affected. Drummer [[Jonny Quinn]] broke his arm, but no shows were cancelled as friend [[Graham Hopkins]] pitched in to take up drumming duties. Keyboardist [[Tom Simpson (musician)|Tom Simpson]] was arrested for drug charges, but was released in time for the next concert. Guitarist [[Nathan Connolly]] sprained his ankle and foot, but sat through shows till the injury healed. The band visited countries like New Zealand and Mexico for the first time and played their first concert in [[Southeast Asia]] during the course of the tour. The Eyes Open Tour also introduced the Tour Reporter feature, where fans were given the chance of covering their local concert.\n\nSnow Patrol finished the tour, which went on for a year and a half, in September 2007 in Australia. The full tour spanned 214 dates and had 37 cancellations.\n\n==Tickets==\n===Secret gigs and charity shows===\nSnow Patrol's official website initially offered tickets for the secret gig SG#3 to registered members on the forum.

It was first introduced ahead of the North American Tour of 2006. Fans interested in becoming tour reporters were required to fill in their details and tell why they were the ones for the job. One winner was chosen from each town where the band was to play a show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/news/default.aspx?nid=6024|title=Be a Snow Patrol tour reporter!|publisher=snowpatrol.com|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> Each tour reporter received two tickets and a photo pass for the respective show. They were required to send the band photos of the show and write a blog sharing their experience. The photos and blogs were then posted on Snow Patrol's official website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/news/default.aspx?nid=6389|title=Tour reporter reviews \u2013 New photos added!|publisher=snowpatrol.com|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe idea was a success, so the same concept was again introduced for the next leg of the tour, which saw the band play in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/news/default.aspx?nid=6467|title=Euroean tour reporters!|publisher=snowpatrol.com|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> The next leg, the UK & Ireland Winter Arena Tour also featured fan tour reporters. This time, two fans were chosen as winners for each show to be the official Snow Patrol Tour Reporters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/news/default.aspx?nid=6733|title=Become an official Snow Patrol tour reporter|publisher=snowpatrol.com|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nSnow Patrol took the tour reporter feature \"to the next level\" for the Australian, New Zealand, Japanese and North American tours of February\u2013April 2007. This time, two fans are chosen as winners for each date specifically to handle the job of reporter and photographer. The method of applying for the job was the same as before. This feature was dubbed as \"Tour Reporter Pro\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/news/default.aspx?nid=7188|title=Tour reporter pro!|publisher=snowpatrol.com|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> and it saw Diana Gualda cover her own benefit show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/news/default.aspx?nid=7567|title=Update from the road!|publisher=snowpatrol.com|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> As the time came for Snow Patrol to play at the Isle of Wight Festival, a new feature of the tour reporter, dubbed \"Tour Reporter Lite\" was introduced. This enabled anybody who was to see the band perform at the festival to share their experience and photos from the event with everyone. Fans were required to log in the member's area and post in the tour reporters section.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snowpatrol.com/news/default.aspx?nid=8088|title=Tour reporter lite|publisher=snowpatrol.com|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.snowpatrol.com}}\n\n{{Snow Patrol}}\n\n[[Category:2006 concert tours]]\n[[Category:2007 concert tours]]\n[[Category:Snow Patrol concert tours]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Open_Tour"}

He also was the first [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in the history of the [[expansion team|expansion]] edition of the Senators (now the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]), serving from 1961 through May 21, 1963, and was a [[coach (baseball)|coach]] for four MLB teams between 1960 and 1982.\n\nHe retired as a player in 1960 with 2,495 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], and holds the major league record for career [[double play]]s at first base (2,044). He has the [[American League]] (AL) record for career games (2,227), [[putout]]s (19,754), [[assist (baseball)|assists]] (1,444) and [[total chances]] (21,408). The lanky Vernon was listed as {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} tall and {{convert|170|lb}}; he batted and threw left-handed.\n\n==Early life==\nMickey Vernon was born in [[Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania]], and attended [[Villanova University]], before making his major league debut on July 8, 1939. He was the father of Gay Vernon.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Navy]], missing the 1944 and 1945 seasons. He served with major league players [[Larry Doby]] and [[Billy Goodman]] on [[Ulithi]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]] in 1945; both Goodman and Vernon personally inspired Doby to become a major league baseball player; Doby became the first [[African-American]] to break the [[baseball color line]] in the [[American League]] in 1947 with the Cleveland Indians.\n\n==Baseball career==\n===Playing career===\nVernon played for 14 full major league seasons (400 [[at bat]]s or more) in his 20-year career. He wound up [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] over .335 twice, over .300 five times, and over .290 nine times. He was a two-time [[American League]] batting champion. In {{mlby|1946}}, his .353 batting mark eclipsed [[Ted Williams]]' .342 by 11 points. Then, in {{mlby|1953}}, Vernon's .337 average denied Cleveland's [[Al Rosen]] (.336) the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] by just one one-thousandth of a point.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/sports/baseball/al-rosen-who-missed-triple-crown-by-a-hit-dies-at-91.html Goldstein, Richard (14 March 2015), \"Al Rosen, Who Missed Triple Crown by a Step, Dies at 91.\" [[The New York Times]]]</ref> The following year, {{mlby|1954}}, Vernon had a career high 20 home runs, 97 RBIs, and a career high 14 [[triple (baseball)|triples]]. He led the AL in doubles with a total of 33. He also had 294 [[total bases]], which was second in the AL, behind [[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso]].\n\nOver time, Vernon became one of the best-liked ballplayers, mainly through his unique personality and charismatic, but quiet, style. On September 1, 1960, after a season spent as the Pittsburgh Pirates' first-base [[coach (baseball)|coach]], Vernon was placed on the active list when MLB rosters expanded to 40 men. He appeared in nine regular-season games as a [[pinch hitter]] for Pittsburgh, notching an RBI [[single (baseball)|single]] and an [[intentional walk]] in his nine [[plate appearance]]s to become one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in a major league game in four decades. By his final game played, on September 27, 1960, he was, at 42, the oldest player in the [[National League]] by almost a year, and one of the most popular figures in the game. He appeared in 2,409 MLB games without playing in the postseason, third most in history behind [[Ernie Banks]] and [[Luke Appling]].<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_gamesnops.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref>  Notably, on September 25, 1960, during Vernon's time on the active list, the Pirates clinched the NL [[pennant (sports)|pennant]]; but he was not on the Pirate playing roster for the [[1960 World Series]], resuming his full-time coaching duties. He earned a World Series ring when the Bucs triumphed in seven games over the [[New York Yankees]].\n\nVernon posted a career .286 batting average with 172 home runs and 1,311 RBIs in 2,409 games. The left-hander averaged 88 RBIs a year, and had 11 seasons with 80 or more, 3 with 90 or more. He scored 1,196 runs with 137&nbsp;stolen bases and a .359 on-base percentage. His career [[slugging percentage]] was .428, with a career high of .518 in 1953. He compiled 2,495 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], with 490 doubles and 120 triples, in 8,731 at bats. He had 3,741 career total bases, with his career high coming in 1953 (315).\n\n===Coaching and managing===\n[[File:Mickey Vernon 1963.jpg|thumb|160px|Vernon in 1963]]\nVernon's career as a coach and manager began during his 1960 stint on the staff of his longtime friend, Pirates' skipper [[Danny Murtaugh]]. \n\nThe following year, in {{baseball year|1961}}, he returned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] when he was named manager of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|expansion Senators]] in their first [[1961 Washington Senators season|year]] of existence. Inheriting the name and [[Griffith Stadium|home field]] of the 1901\u201360 Washington franchise, now the [[Minnesota Twins]], the expansion Senators were hastily constructed with an undercapitalized ownership, an MLB roster of castoff players,<ref>[https://sabr.org/research/mis-management-101-american-league-expansion-1961 McCue, Andy, and Thompson, Eric (2011), \"Mismanagement 101: The American League's Expansion of 1961.\" ''The National Pastime 2011,'' [[Society for American Baseball Research]]]</ref> and an almost-nonexistent [[farm system]]. In Vernon's two full seasons at the helm, 1961 and {{mlby|1962}}, the Senators lost a combined 201 games. They were 14\u201326 and last in the ten-team American League when Vernon was fired on [[1963 in baseball|May 21, 1963]]. He finished with a career record of 135\u2013227, a .373&nbsp;[[winning percentage]].\n\nVernon remained in the game into the 1980s as a major league coach for the Pirates (returning there for a second term in 1964), [[St.&nbsp;Louis Cardinals]] (1965), [[Montreal Expos]] (1977\u201378) and Yankees (1982). He also managed at the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] and [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] levels of the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], and served as a roving batting instructor for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Kansas City Royals]] and Yankees before retiring from baseball.\n\n==Death==\nVernon died from a stroke at age 90, on September 24, 2008. He had resided in [[Media, Pennsylvania]].\n\n==MLB highlights==\n* MLB Record: Double plays at first base (2,044)\n* American League All-Star (1946, 1948, 1953-1956, 1958)\n* American League batting champion (1946, 1953)\n* American League leader in doubles (1946, 1953, 1954)\n* American League leader in extra base hits (1954)\n* American League leader in [[Fielding percentage|fielding average]] (1950-1952, 1954)\n* American League top 10 in [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP voting]] (1946, 1953, 1954)\n* American League top 10 in triples (1941, 1943, 1946, 1947, 1951-1955)\n\n==Legacy==\nIn August 2008, he was named as one of the ten former players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the [[Veterans Committee]] for induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|2009]].\n\nPlaying in four different decades (1939\u201360), Vernon ended his career with 2,237 games at first base, second to only [[Jake Beckley]] (2,377) in major league history. He led the American League in [[fielding percentage]] four times, and the majors twice.\n\nHe became one of the few first basemen to finish his career with a .990 [[fielding percentage]], and participated in more double plays than any other.\n\nThe Mickey Vernon Museum Collection in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]], honors Vernon's career, military service, and friendship with Murtaugh, among

Baseball batting champions|AL batting champion]] (1946, 1953)\n}}\n'''James Barton \"Mickey\" Vernon''' (April 22, 1918 \u2013 September 24, 2008) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[first baseman]] who played for the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] (1939\u201348, 1950\u201355), [[Cleveland Indians]] (1949\u201350, 1958), [[Boston Red Sox]] (1956\u201357), [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]] (1959), and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] (1960). He also was the first [[manager (baseball)|manager]] in the history of the [[expansion team|expansion]] edition of the Senators (now the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]), serving from 1961 through May 21, 1963, and was a [[coach (baseball)|coach]] for four MLB teams between 1960 and 1982.\n\nHe retired as a player in 1960 with 2,495 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], and holds the major league record for career [[double play]]s at first base (2,044). He has the [[American League]] (AL) record for career games (2,227), [[putout]]s (19,754), [[assist (baseball)|assists]] (1,444) and [[total chances]] (21,408). The lanky Vernon was listed as {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} tall and {{convert|170|lb}}; he batted and threw left-handed.\n\n==Early life==\nMickey Vernon was born in [[Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania]], and attended [[Villanova University]], before making his major league debut on July 8, 1939. He was the father of Gay Vernon.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Navy]], missing the 1944 and 1945 seasons. He served with major league players [[Larry Doby]] and [[Billy Goodman]] on [[Ulithi]] in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]] in 1945; both Goodman and Vernon personally inspired Doby to become a major league baseball player; Doby became the first [[African-American]] to break the [[baseball color line]] in the [[American League]] in 1947 with the Cleveland Indians.\n\n==Baseball career==\n===Playing career===\nVernon played for 14 full major league seasons (400 [[at bat]]s or more) in his 20-year career. He wound up [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] over .335 twice, over .300 five times, and over .290 nine times. He was a two-time [[American League]] batting champion. In {{mlby|1946}}, his .353 batting mark eclipsed [[Ted Williams]]' .342 by 11 points. Then, in {{mlby|1953}}, Vernon's .337 average denied Cleveland's [[Al Rosen]] (.336) the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] by just one one-thousandth of a point.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/sports/baseball/al-rosen-who-missed-triple-crown-by-a-hit-dies-at-91.html Goldstein, Richard (14 March 2015), \"Al Rosen, Who Missed Triple Crown by a Step, Dies at 91.\" [[The New York Times]]]</ref> The following year, {{mlby|1954}}, Vernon had a career high 20 home runs, 97 RBIs, and a career high 14 [[triple (baseball)|triples]]. He led the AL in doubles with a total of 33. He also had 294 [[total bases]], which was second in the AL, behind [[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso]].\n\nOver time, Vernon became one of the best-liked ballplayers, mainly through his unique personality and charismatic, but quiet, style. On [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|September 1, 1960]], after a season spent as the Pittsburgh Pirates' first-base [[coach (baseball)|coach]], Vernon was placed on the active list when MLB rosters expanded to 40 men. He appeared in nine regular-season games as a [[pinch hitter]] for Pittsburgh, notching an RBI [[single (baseball)|single]] and an [[intentional walk]] in his nine [[plate appearance]]s to become one of only 29 players in baseball history to have appeared in a major league game in four decades. By his final game played, on September 27, 1960, he was, at 42, the oldest player in the [[National League]] by almost a year, and one of the most popular figures in the game. He appeared in 2,409 MLB games without playing in the postseason, third most in history behind [[Ernie Banks]] and [[Luke Appling]].<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_gamesnops.shtml Baseball Reference]</ref>  Notably, on September 25, 1960, during Vernon's time on the active list, the Pirates clinched the NL [[pennant (sports)|pennant]]; but he was not on the Pirate playing roster for the [[1960 World Series]], resuming his full-time coaching duties. He earned a World Series ring when the Bucs triumphed in seven games over the [[New York Yankees]].\n\nVernon posted a career .286 batting average with 172 home runs and 1,311 RBIs in 2,409 games. The left-hander averaged 88 RBIs a year, and had 11 seasons with 80 or more, 3 with 90 or more. He scored 1,196 runs with 137&nbsp;stolen bases and a .359 on-base percentage. His career [[slugging percentage]] was .428, with a career high of .518 in 1953. He compiled 2,495 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], with 490 doubles and 120 triples, in 8,731 at bats. He had 3,741 career total bases, with his career high coming in 1953 (315).\n\n===Coaching and managing===\n[[File:Mickey Vernon 1963.jpg|thumb|160px|Vernon in 1963]]\nVernon's career as a coach and manager began during his 1960 stint on the staff of his longtime friend, Pirates' skipper [[Danny Murtaugh]]. \n\nThe following year, in {{baseball year|1961}}, he returned to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] when he was named manager of the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|expansion Senators]] in their first [[1961 Washington Senators season|year]] of existence. Inheriting the name and [[Griffith Stadium|home field]] of the 1901\u201360 Washington franchise, now the [[Minnesota Twins]], the expansion Senators were hastily constructed with an undercapitalized ownership, an MLB roster of castoff players,<ref>[https://sabr.org/research/mis-management-101-american-league-expansion-1961 McCue, Andy, and Thompson, Eric (2011), \"Mismanagement 101: The American League's Expansion of 1961.\" ''The National Pastime 2011,'' [[Society for American Baseball Research]]]</ref> and an almost-nonexistent [[farm system]]. In Vernon's two full seasons at the helm, 1961 and {{mlby|1962}}, the Senators lost a combined 201 games. They were 14\u201326 and last in the ten-team American League when Vernon was fired on [[1963 in baseball|May 21, 1963]]. He finished with a career record of 135\u2013227, a .373&nbsp;[[winning percentage]].\n\nVernon remained in the game into the 1980s as a major league coach for the Pirates (returning there for a second term in 1964), [[St.&nbsp;Louis Cardinals]] (1965), [[Montreal Expos]] (1977\u201378) and Yankees (1982). He also managed at the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] and [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] levels of the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], and served as a roving batting instructor for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Kansas City Royals]] and Yankees before retiring from baseball.\n\n==Death==\nVernon died from a stroke at age 90, on September 24, 2008. He had resided in [[Media, Pennsylvania]].\n\n==MLB highlights==\n* MLB Record: Double plays at first base (2,044)\n* American League All-Star (1946, 1948, 1953-1956, 1958)\n* American League batting champion (1946, 1953)\n* American League leader in doubles (1946, 1953, 1954)\n* American League leader in extra base hits (1954)\n* American League leader in [[Fielding percentage|fielding average]] (1950-1952, 1954)\n* American League top 10 in [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP voting]] (1946, 1953, 1954)\n* American League top 10 in triples (1941, 1943, 1946, 1947, 1951-1955)\n\n==Legacy==\nIn August 2008, he was named as one of the ten former players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the [[Veterans Committee]] for induction into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|2009]].\n\nPlaying in four different decades (1939\u201360), Vernon ended his career with 2,237 games at first base, second to only [[Jake Beckley]] (2,377) in major league history. He led the American League in [[fielding percentage]] four times, and the majors twice.\n\nHe became one of the few first basemen to finish his career with a .990 [[fielding percentage]], and participated in more double plays than any other.\n\nThe Mickey Vernon Museum Collection in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]], honors Vernon's career, military service, and friendship with Murtaugh, among other artifacts.<ref>[http://mickeyvernonsportsmuseum.com The Mickey Vernon Sports Museum]</ref>\n\nVernon is interred at the Lawn Croft Cemetery in [[Linwood, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=vernomi01 Baseball Almanac]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Baseball}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career hits leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career triples leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual doubles leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball players who played in four decades]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle]]\n* [[List of St. Louis Cardinals coaches]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/news/2007/election/vc/vernon.htm |title=Line-drive hitting Vernon won pair of batting titles for Washington Senators |first=Dawn |last=Klemish |website=baseballhalloffame.org |date=February 24, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070423153846/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/news/2007/election/vc/vernon.htm |archivedate=April 23, 2007 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}\n*{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Mickey-Vernon-Gentleman-First-Baseman/dp/0940159945/ |title=Mickey Vernon: The Gentleman First Baseman |first=Rich |last=Westcott |publisher=Camino Books Inc. |date=2005 |isbn=0940159945}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/7aa63aab |title=Mickey Vernon |first=Rich |last=Westcott |website=[[Society for American Baseball Research|SABR]]}}\n\n==External links==\n{{baseballstats|mlb=123711|espn=|br=v/vernomi01|fangraphs=|brm=vernon001jam|retro=V/Pvernm101}}\n{{baseball-reference manager|vernomi01}}\n*[https://cdm16014.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p4014coll27/id/34/rec/63 Interview with Mickey Vernon] conducted by [[Eugene Murdock]], February 19, 1974, in Marietta, Ohio (40 minutes)\n*{{findagrave}}\n:<br>\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-ach|ach}}\n{{succession box| before = [[Bill Salkeld]] | title = [[Hitting for the cycle]]| years = May 19, 1946 | after = [[Ted Williams]]}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Pittsburgh Pirates]] [[coach (baseball)|first-base coach]]|years=1960<br>1964|before=[[George Detore]]<br>[[Ron Northey]]|after=[[Ron Northey]]<br>[[Johnny Pesky]]}}\n{{succession box|title=[[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[coach (baseball)|first-base coach]]|years=1965|before=[[Joe Schultz]]|after=[[Dick Sisler]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{1960 Pittsburgh Pirates}}\n{{AL batting title}}\n{{Texas Rangers managers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vernon, Mickey}}\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:2008 deaths]]\n[[Category:American League All-Stars]]\n[[Category:American League batting champions]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Boston Red Sox players]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Indians players]]\n[[Category:Jersey City Giants players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Dodgers coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball first basemen]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball hitting coaches]]\n[[Category:Milwaukee Braves players]]\n[[Category:Montreal Expos coaches]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees coaches]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees scouts]]\n[[Category:People from Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:People from Media, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh Pirates coaches]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals coaches]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Delaware County, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Springfield Nationals players]]\n[[Category:Villanova Wildcats baseball players]]\n[[Category:Washington Senators (1901\u201360) players]]\n[[Category:Washington Senators (1961\u20131971) managers]]\n", "name_user": "98.200.14.24", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Vernon"}
