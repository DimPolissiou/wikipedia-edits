After 1948 they were allowed rights similar to Egyptian nationals, and in 1963 they were allowed to own agricultural land, nor did they have to acquire work visas. In 1964 the government decreed that Palestinian refugees had to obtain an exit visa, an entry visa or a transit visa. In 1976 a law was passed stating that no foreigners could own real property, although Palestinians were later granted the right to own agricultural land. In 1978 the ability of Palestinians to work in the civil service was revoked.

Before the last attack in February, a Sinai armed group of ISIS broadcast a video message threatening the lives of Copts and claiming responsibility for bombing of a [[Cairo]] church in December 2016 that killed at least 25 people. Due to the latest attacks in Egypt, at least 150 Coptic Christian families have fled al-Arish, seeking shelter in the neighborhood of [[Ismailia]]. As the report mentioned, Majid Halim fled [[Arish|al-Arish]] to Cairo with seven of his family members after his father, who runs a stationery shop in al-Arish, had received many threats over the past two years, and his photo had been published on Facebook pages alongside a message inciting violence against Coptic Christians and demanding that they had to leave the town.  On 22 February 2017, Nabila's son in law, Sameh Mansour, was told by his neighbor that two masked men came to his home and knocked on his door while he was out making arrangements the burial of his two relatives murdered by ISIS. That same day one of his neighbors, Kamel Abu Romany, who lived 150 meters away from Mansour's house, was also killed by armed gunmen.

The temper in Egypt is against homosexuality.\" A government spokesman said the Queen Boat incident was not a violation of human rights but, \"actually an interpretation of the norms of our society, the family values of our society.

In 1976 a law was passed stating that no foreigners could own real property, although Palestinians were later granted the right to own agricultural land. In 1978 the ability of Palestinians to work in the civil service was revoked.

Notre Dame trailed 3\u20130 in the second half and had been unable to move the ball effectively.  [[Noble Kizer]], the one [[Presbyterian]] player on the Notre Dame team, stopped play and said to his teammates, \"Boys, let's have a Hail Mary.\"  They all prayed, and [[Elmer Layden]] scored a touchdown.  On the next possession, Kizer said, \"Let's have another Hail Mary,\" and Layden scored another touchdown.  After the game, Kizer said, \"Say, that Hail Mary is the best play we've got.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Alan Gould (AP sports editor)|title=Sport Slants|date=January 9, 1932|newspaper=Reading Eagle|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8Y8zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=V-EFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3503,1338948&dq=hail-mary+football&hl=en}}</ref>  An account written in 1935 presented a variation on the 1922 \"Hail Mary\" play as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In the huddle the boys were surprised to hear the non-Catholic say: 'C'mon fellows let's have a 'Hail Mary.'  The boys said the quick prayer and on the next play [[Jim Crowley|Jimmy Crowley]] dashed 30 yards for a touchdown.  Some time later Notre Dame was again stopped and again this non-Catholic called on the boys for a Hail Mary.  On the next play [[Harry Stuhldreher|Stuhldreher]] tossed a 25 yard pass to Layden for a score.  In between halves this same lad was chuckling to himself.  He turned to one of his teammates and said, 'Boy that Hail Mary is a ________ of a play.'<ref>{{cite news|title=Sport Slants|newspaper=Chester Times, Chester, PA|date=October 16, 1935}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n* '''1935''' \u2014 On November 2, 1935, Notre Dame faced an undefeated [[1935 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State team]] and trailed 13\u20130 at the start of the fourth quarter.  Notre Dame scored two touchdowns to cut Ohio State's lead to 13\u201312.  With less than a minute left in the game, Notre Dame quarterback [[Andy Pilney]] ran 30 yards to the Ohio State 19-yard line.  Pilney was injured and had to be carried off the field on a stretcher.  [[William Shakespeare (American football)|William Shakespeare]] (nicknamed the \"Merchant of Menace\") replaced Pilney.  With the clock running out, the ball was snapped to the fullback who handed it to Shakespeare on what appeared to be a reverse.  Shakespeare threw a pass into the end zone, which was caught by Wayne Millner on his knees for an 18\u201313 win. [[Red Barber]], who broadcast the game on radio, later called it \"the greatest college football game I ever called.\"<ref name=Sperber>{{cite book|author=Murray Sperber|title=Shake Down the Thunder: The Creation of Notre Dame Football|pages=435\u2013436}}(\"Bill Shakespeare was nicknamed 'The Merchant of Menace' and, according to classmates, did not do well in English.\")</ref>  Radio announcer Tom Manning added, \"I always said Shakespeare had a pair of rosary beads and a bottle of holy water in his back pocket.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ted Patterson, Keith Jackson|title=The Golden Voices of Football, Volume 1|page=69}}</ref>  The media picked up stories of the Catholic faithful praying for Notre Dame as they listened to the game on the radio.

The game is known as the \"[[1980 Holiday Bowl|Miracle Bowl]]\" because the Cougars overcame Southern Methodist's 45\u201325 lead with four minutes left in the game, sealing the victory with a touchdown and kick after time expired.  Brown's catch remains one of the most spectacular Hail Mary receptions in football history.  He was completely surrounded by Southern Methodist defenders in the end zone, but he outjumped all of them and managed to hold on to the ball during the subsequent pileup.\n* '''1984''' \u2014 [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] vs. [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]]: Boston College quarterback [[Doug Flutie]] threw a 48-yard Hail Mary to [[Gerard Phelan]] for the 47\u201345 victory. The play is known as \"[[Hail Flutie]]\" and is generally credited with winning Flutie the Heisman Trophy later that season.\n* '''1989''' \u2014 [[Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles football|Southern Mississippi]] vs. [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]]: With Southern Mississippi on its own 21 yard line and only six seconds remaining, [[Brett Favre]] heaved a pass that bounced off of the helmet of the Eagles' Michael Jackson and over to wide receiver Darryl Tillman. Tillman scored as time expired, breaking a 10\u201310 deadlock. At 79 yards, the throw was probably the longest Hail Mary pass ever completed and was later voted on as one of the \"Top 5 Memorable Moments\" in college football history during an ESPN.com online vote.\n* '''1994''' \u2014 [[1994 Colorado Buffaloes football team|Colorado]] vs. [[1994 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]: Down by 5 points, with 6 seconds to play, #7 Colorado lined up in a formation called 'Jets' \u2013 4-wideouts with trips left.  Colorado quarterback [[Kordell Stewart]] had good protection, dropped back to his 27-yard line, scrambled a bit, and heaved the ball 73 yards in the air down to the opposing 1-yard line.  The play, known as 'Rocket Left', called for [[Michael Westbrook]] to tip the ball into the end zone for backup wideout Blake Anderson, but it was in fact Anderson in the middle of a cluster of players who tipped it to Westbrook for a 64-yard touchdown pass on the last play of the game. Colorado won 27\u201326, and the play (which Colorado had also run at the end of the first half, resulting in #4 Michigan intercepting it) became known as \"[[The Miracle at Michigan]]\" and took home an [[ESPY Awards|ESPY]] for College Football Play of the Year.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=2896389 | title=Stewart to Westbrook silenced Big House crowd | author=Ivan Maisel | publisher=ESPN.com | date=June 7, 2007 | accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref>\n* '''2000''' \u2014 [[2000 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] vs. [[2000 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]]: Northwestern quarterback [[Zak Kustok]] completed a 45-yard Hail Mary to wide receiver Sam Simmons.

The play was dubbed \"Big Ben\" (an old Atlanta Falcon name for the Hail Mary pass) and helped Roethlisberger earn the nickname that he would later be known by.\n* '''2002''' \u2014 [[2002 LSU Tigers football team|Louisiana State University]] vs. [[2002 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]]: This game ended in a 75-yard Hail Mary pass, thrown by Louisiana State quarterback [[Marcus Randall]], deflected by Kentucky into the hands of Louisiana State receiver [[Devery Henderson]]. Before the play, Kentucky players gave a \"Gatorade bath\" to the head coach thinking they would win. After the play, fireworks were then fired into the air over the stadium and Kentucky fans rushed onto the field and even started tearing down the goal posts in the opposite [[end zone]], not knowing that they had lost.

The second tip was performed by Ravens safety [[James Ihedigbo]] who could have easily knocked the ball to the ground, except he accidentally tipped the ball up behind him where Green was waiting.

The Vikings went into halftime up 14-9 and eventually won 27-9.\n\n==List of unsuccessful Hail Marys==\nThe sheer improbability of completing such a long pass with so many defenders in position to stop it makes even some unsuccessful Hail Mary attempts worth mentioning. Below is a list of such attempts and explanations as to why the plays were noteworthy.\n\n* '''1978''' \u2014 [[Atlanta Falcons]] vs. [[New Orleans Saints]]: Just two weeks after the Falcons beat the Saints 20\u201317 on the \"Big Ben\" pass play, the Falcons beat them again by the same score on the final play of the game after an intercepted Hail Mary pass when Saint defensive back [[Mo Spencer]] was called for pass interference by side judge Grover Klemmer. The Falcons scored on a run from the 1 yard line on the next play. The play became known as \"Big Ben II.\"  In this particular instance, the NFL later acknowledged that the interference call was the wrong call, and the case was cited by some as an early example for the need for football officiating crews to have access to instant replays. Though incomplete in this game, the pass play really began to be used by other teams significantly more often after this game, as a pass interference penalty that would move the ball to the 1 yard line was now viewed as a possible result from the play \u2014 if not an even more likely result than completing the pass itself. However, officials have actually proved very reluctant to call pass interference during Hail Marys since this game, possibly because it appears difficult to determine in real time just who made contact with whom, with so many players congregating in one place to catch the ball \u2014 not to mention the high stakes of making an incorrect call with the outcome of the game in balance. Also, in the 1980s, pass interference rules were relaxed in cases where defenders made contact but were making an honest attempt for the ball (see more about the first \"Big Ben\" attempt above).\n* '''1990''' \u2014 [[LSU Tigers football|Louisiana State University]] vs. [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]: Louisiana State completed a Hail Mary pass against Vanderbilt. It was perhaps the only time where offensive pass interference has reversed the outcome of the play, despite a traditional reluctance of officiating crews to call a penalty on any one player during a play consisting of a cluster of flailing players and so much on the line. With the touchdown called back, Vanderbilt won its only game of the season, 24\u201321. According to LSU Student Media, during a press conference in the week after the game, Louisiana State's head coach, Mike Archer, showed reporters replays of the play, frame-by-frame, explaining why the penalty was a poor call. Louisiana State completed the season with a 5\u20136 record, and Archer was pressured to resign, with the loss to the eventual 1\u201310 team often being cited as the likely primary reason for his dismissal.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''1995''' \u2014 [[1995 AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship Game]] \u2014 [[Indianapolis Colts]] vs. [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]: With five seconds on the clock and the underdog [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] trailing the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] 20\u201316, Colts quarterback [[Jim Harbaugh]] (who earned the name \"Captain Comeback\" during the season) fired a Hail Mary pass into the end zone. After deflecting off several Steelers defenders, the ball made a rough landing in Colts wide receiver [[Aaron Bailey (American football)|Aaron Bailey]]'s stomach, but his arms were impeded from wrapping onto the ball and it rolled on its side and touched the turf before he was able to slap both hands onto it. The play was close enough that NBC commentators [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Phil Simms]] both initially declared on-air that the ball had been caught, and Bailey raised his arms with the ball as if he were celebrating a touchdown, but replays showed that the incomplete call was correct.<ref>{{youtube|id=d5hxVk9XdUE|title=1995 AFC Championship Ending}}</ref>\n* '''1996''' \u2014 [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: Jaguars quarterback [[Mark Brunell]] threw a pass to Willie Jackson for 55 yards that appeared to win the game. The officials ruled Jackson down at the 1, though Jaguars fans insist that replays show that Jackson crossed the goal-line. The Patriots then prevailed 28\u201325 in overtime. Brunell also completed a 51-yard Hail Mary in the same game before halftime, as well as 41 and 61-yard touchdown passes in the second half, to erase the Patriots' 22\u20130 first-half lead (see more about the first Hail Mary attempt above).\n* '''1997''' \u2014 [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] vs. [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]]: With three seconds remaining, Navy's Chris McCoy threw a pass from the Irish 29 that bounced off of the helmet of Irish player Deke Cooper and into the hands of Pat McGrew at the 18. McGrew was finally tackled by Allen Rossum when he had nearly reached the 1 yard line, allowing Notre Dame to hold on and win 21\u201317. Had McGrew scored, it would have ended the nation's all-time longest losing streak in an annual college football series. However, as a result of the loss, Navy continued its string of losses to the Fighting Irish \u2014 not finally ending it once and for all until [[2007 Navy vs. Notre Dame football game|2007]], at 43 games.\n* '''2002''' \u2014 [[Atlanta Falcons]] vs. [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]: With 1 second remaining in overtime, Steelers quarterback [[Tommy Maddox]] dropped back from his own 49-yard line and fired the ball towards the end zone. Wide receiver [[Plaxico Burress]] leapt into a group of Falcons defenders and Steelers receivers and grabbed the pass in mid-air, but when Burress landed on the turf, the upper half of his body (with his arms wrapped around the ball) crashed down at the 1-yard line with his lower body landing in the end zone. With no penalties on Atlanta and the clock reading 0:00, Maddox and Burress' spectacular completion was the final exclamation point in the first tie the NFL had seen since 1997. This play is not counted as a success, because it did not result in a team scoring a touchdown.\n* '''2008''' \u2014 [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] vs. Middle Tennessee: Six years after Kentucky lost the [[Bluegrass Miracle]] game on a similar pass play, Middle Tennessee's Eldred King caught a tipped 61-yard throw from Joe Craddock on the game's final play. King was tackled on the 1 yard line to preserve a 20\u201314 UK victory and prevent a second Bluegrass Miracle from happening. Middle Tennessee completed a similar pass play against Florida Atlantic later in the same season (see more about the second Hail Mary attempt above).\n* '''2009''' \u2014 [[Magnolia Bowl]] \u2014 [[2009 LSU Tigers football team|Louisiana State University]] vs. [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Mississippi]]: Louisiana State's [[Jordan Jefferson]], under a heavy pass rush, was forced to heave an under-thrown 43-yard Hail Mary pass that Terrance Toliver was able to catch with between two and three seconds remaining in regulation \u2014 but still 6 yards short of the end zone. After the completion, the clock was not halted for the first down until one second remained, giving Louisiana State too little time to set up and run a follow-up play. Ole Miss prevailed, 25\u201323. This play was a rare completed Hail Mary pass with time remaining, but was under-thrown and time ran out. The loss subsequently led to harsh criticism of Louisiana State's [[Les Miles]] for his clock management efforts \u2014 especially since it appeared that the team was going to try to spike the ball as time ran out \u2014 and led to a significant movement over the next year to remove him as head coach. He later signed a contract extension after a much more successful season the following year, and continued coaching the Tigers until losing his job four games into the 2016 season.\n* '''2012''' \u2014 [[Super Bowl XLVI]] \u2013 [[New York Giants]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: After a touchdown run by [[Ahmad Bradshaw]] to make the score 21\u201317, in favor of the Giants, the New England Patriots received the ball with 59 seconds to play. After running a few plays, 4 seconds remained on the clock. The Patriots, at their own 49-yard line, elected to go for the Hail Mary. [[Tom Brady]] threw a pass deep into the [[end zone]] intended for tight end [[Aaron Hernandez]]. A mass of players jumped up for the ball, and the ball landed a yard in front of tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]] as time expired. \n* '''2012''' \u2014 NFC divisional playoff game \u2014 [[Seattle Seahawks]] vs. [[Atlanta Falcons]]: After a late fourth quarter rally by the Falcons to take a 2-point lead, Atlanta attempted a surprise [[onside kick]], however the play failed. As a result, it set up the Seahawks to attempt a Hail Mary. With 2 seconds left, Seahawks' quarterback [[Russell Wilson]] spiraled a 60-yard pass into the end zone only to be intercepted by Falcons' wide receiver [[Julio Jones]] with no time remaining.<ref>{{youtube|id=HPwO0SjwzZc|title=Julio Jones on defense?!}}</ref>\n* '''2014''' \u2014 [[San Francisco 49ers]] vs. [[New Orleans Saints]]: The 49ers had just tied the score at 24\u201324 with 44 seconds left in regulation, leaving the Saints with enough time to try for the win. On the final play of the 4th quarter, Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]] fired a pass from his own 48 yard line towards the end zone where tight end [[Jimmy Graham]] caught it for what appeared to be the game-winning touchdown. However, officials called offensive pass interference on Graham for shoving 49ers defensive back [[Perrish Cox]] to the ground before making the catch. Cox appeared to have 'flopped,' or exaggerate the contact from Graham, and Graham claimed that the penalty should not have been called. The 49ers went on to win the game in overtime, 27\u201324. A few days after the game, the NFL issued a statement saying that offensive pass interference was correctly called on the failed Hail Mary.\n* '''2015''' \u2014 [[Baltimore Ravens]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: The New England Patriots' wide receiver [[Brandon LaFell]] caught a 23-yard [[touchdown pass]] with 5:13 left in the 4th quarter. On the ensuing drive, Patriots safety [[Duron Harmon]] intercepted Ravens quarterback [[Joe Flacco]], but were unable to run out the clock. After the subsequent [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]], the Baltimore Ravens received the ball with 0:04 to play. The Ravens selected a Hail Mary play for the final play. The Ravens lined up at their own 48-yard line, with Flacco lining up in the [[shotgun formation]]. Flacco scrambled around the pocket, and heaved a deep ball to the end zone. A mass of players leaped for the ball, however, the ball was knocked out. The ball bounced off wide receiver [[Torrey Smith]]'s body and hit the turf, ending the game. The New England Patriots would go on to win [[Super Bowl XLIX]].\n* '''2015''' \u2014 [[Minnesota Vikings]] vs. [[Green Bay Packers]]: Although Aaron Rodgers completed two other Hail Marys in the 2015 season, he was not successful on this attempt. In week 17, with the Packers down to the Vikings 20\u201313, Rodgers threw the ball about 50 yards to the end zone, but the pass was knocked down. The victory gave Minnesota the [[NFC North]] championship.\n* '''2018''' \u2014 [[Super Bowl LII]] \u2013 [[Philadelphia Eagles]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: In the waning moments, the Patriots were trailing 41\u201333 to the Eagles. Patriots quarterback and league most valuable player [[Tom Brady]] led his team to midfield, and attempted a Hail Mary pass intended for tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]] as time expired, similar to [[Super Bowl XLVI]].  The pass was knocked down by Eagles cornerback [[Ronald Darby]], and the Eagles won Super Bowl LII by the aforementioned score for their first-ever Super Bowl championship.\n* '''2018''' \u2014 [[New England Patriots]] vs. [[Chicago Bears]]: With 2 seconds remaining in regulation trailing 38\u201331, Bears quarterback [[Mitchell Trubisky]] completed a 54 yard Hail Mary pass to wide receiver Kevin White, only to have White stopped at the 1-yard line as the Patriots held on for the win.\n\n==List of passes often mistakenly referred to as a \"Hail Mary\"==\nA number of games over the years have been decided by long, last-second touchdown throws but were not, strictly-speaking, Hail Mary passes. Below is a list of such games with explanations as to why it has been improper to describe them as Hail Marys. Usually, the touchdowns were more conventional pass plays with designated receivers and not of the unscripted, \"jump ball\" throws that are normally associated with Hail Mary-styled passes.\n\n* '''1972''' \u2014 AFC Divisional Playoffs \u2014 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] vs. [[Oakland Raiders]]: Pittsburgh trailed in this game 7\u20136 and faced fourth down and 10 from their own 40 with 22 seconds remaining. Pittsburgh's [[Terry Bradshaw]] threw to halfback [[Frenchy Fuqua]] but the Raiders' [[Jack Tatum]] collided with him and the ball was deflected towards the Steelers' [[Franco Harris]], who then scored a controversial touchdown. This play has become known as the [[Immaculate Reception]].  The pass is usually not considered a \"Hail Mary\" pass in that it was a scripted play intended for a specific receiver and not thrown desperately \"up for grabs\" like Hail Marys usually are. It also was not thrown anywhere near the Raiders' end zone by design.\n* '''1974''' \u2014 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] \u2014 [[Washington Redskins]] vs [[Dallas Cowboys]]: Dallas reserve quarterback and rookie [[Clint Longley]], filling in for an injured [[Roger Staubach]], threw two touchdown passes including the game winning 50-yarder to [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] to push the Cowboys to a 24\u201323 victory and, in the process, keeping the Cowboys in the playoff hunt. This pass was more of a traditional, late-game \"bomb\" throw with a scripted post route for Pearson. There were 35 seconds remained when the play was attempted.\n* '''1997''' \u2014 [[1997 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] vs. [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]]: Nebraska quarterback [[Scott Frost]]'s last-second pass to [[Shevin Wiggins]] was deflected, then before the ball touched the ground, Wiggins kicked the ball towards the back of the end zone where teammate [[Matt Davidson (hockey)|Matt Davidson]] scoped the ball up just before it hit the ground.  The touchdown sent the game into overtime, when the top ranked Cornhuskers won. Nebraska went on to share the national title that season. This play is also known as the [[Flea Kicker]]. It is generally{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} not considered a Hail Mary pass as it was very short \u2014 attempted within the red zone \u2014 and was more of a traditional, scripted pass play that just ended up having an unusual result.\n* '''2003''' \u2014 [[Arizona Cardinals]] vs. [[Minnesota Vikings]]: The Cardinals stunned the Vikings on a 28-yard touchdown pass as time expired from [[Josh McCown]] to [[Nate Poole]] to win 18\u201317. The pass, which was made in just McCown's third start, appears to have been intended for strictly for Poole, one of two reasons it is not historically viewed as a Hail Mary (the other is that it was a relatively short play, as Hail Mary plays have usually traveled at least 50 yards to completion). The loss was costly for the Vikings as they not only lost the game, but lost the NFC North title to the Packers and were eliminated from playoff contention. The reception is noted for the fact that under NFL rules at the time, Poole was given the touchdown reception even though he did not get both feet inbounds because he was shoved out of bounds by a Viking defender after making the catch and getting 1 foot in; the league has since changed this rule, and under current standards the pass would have been incomplete.<ref>ESPN.com [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=231228022 McCown tosses 28-yarder to Poole]</ref>\n* '''2005''' \u2014 [[Capital One Bowl]] \u2014 [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] vs. [[2005 LSU Tigers football team|Louisiana State University]]: With 14 seconds left, Iowa quarterback [[Drew Tate]] completed a 56-yard touchdown pass to [[Warren Holloway]], left open due to a Louisiana State defensive breakdown, to give Iowa a 30\u201325 victory on the game's final play.<ref>ESPN.com [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?confId=&gameId=250012294 Tate-to-Holloway caps Hawkeyes rally]</ref> This play is usually not considered a Hail Mary pass per se and varies from the traditional definition of one in that the throw was intended for a specific receiver and not tossed \"up for grabs.\"\n* '''2009''' \u2014 [[Minnesota Vikings]] vs. [[San Francisco 49ers]]: The 49ers were up 24\u201320 with 11 seconds left in the game. The Vikings had the ball at the 49ers' 32 yard line. [[Brett Favre]] rolled out right and avoided a defender by using a pump fake. Then, he threw it from about the 39 yard line and connected to [[Greg Lewis (wide receiver)|Greg Lewis]] in the very back of the end zone. Lewis just got both of his feet in, making a spectacular catch. This play isn't considered a Hail Mary because there were two seconds left on the clock, and another play (which ''would'' have been a Hail Mary attempt) would have been run by Minnesota if Lewis' reception had been called off.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n* '''2012''' \u2014 AFC Divisional Playoffs \u2014 [[Baltimore Ravens]] vs [[Denver Broncos]]: With 45 seconds remaining and at their own 30 down by 7, the Ravens needed a miracle against the Broncos. Ravens quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] launched the ball to [[Jacoby Jones]] on the right sideline, who caught it at the Broncos' 20 yard line and scampered in for the touchdown. This would send the game to overtime and the Ravens would kick a field goal in the second overtime to win the game. This play, known as the [[Mile High Miracle]], was not a Hail Mary was because the play called in the situation might have been too deep; also, the play did not consist of several players jumping up for the ball, or \"up for grabs\".\n* '''2013''' \u2014 [[2013 Fordham Rams football team|Fordham]] vs. [[2013 Temple Owls football team|Temple]]: With Temple leading 29\u201323, Fordham quarterback [[Michael Nebrich]], with 13 seconds left, rolled to his right after taking the snap and then threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Sam Ajala]] with 4 seconds left, giving Fordham a 30\u201329 victory with the extra point, their first ever victory over an Football Bowl Series opponent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?id=332570218 |title=Fordham holds off late rally to beat Temple 30\u201329 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=September 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}</ref> The play cannot be considered a Hail Mary because it took place on third down,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=332570218&period=4 |title=Fordham 30, Temple 29: 4th Quarter Play by Play |publisher=ESPN.com |date=September 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}</ref> meaning that Fordham would have had one more chance at a touchdown had the pass been incomplete.\n* '''2013''' \u2014 [[2013 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] vs. [[2013 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]]: With the game tied 17\u201317, Florida State quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] took the snap with 1 second left at the Seminole 45 in the first half, dodged several tacklers, and threw a bomb to [[Kenny Shaw]] that was caught at the 2 yard line before Shaw dove for the end zone. The Seminoles would eventually win by a final score of 48\u201334, en route to winning the [[2013 BCS Championship Game|BCS Championship Game]]. This is not considered a Hail Mary play because although the pass was completed as the half ended, it did not consist of several players jumping up for the ball (there was only one safety on Shaw when he made the catch).\n* '''[[2017-18 NFL playoffs|2017]]''' \u2014 NFC Divisional Playoffs \u2014 [[New Orleans Saints]] vs. [[Minnesota Vikings]]: The \"[[Minneapolis Miracle]]\": After a furious last four minutes with three lead changes, Minnesota was down by 1 with the ball on their own 39 and just 10 seconds left.  On the next play, [[Case Keenum]] completed a 30-yard throw to Stephon Diggs who was near the sideline, within field goal range. The Saints defender aggressively moved to block Diggs from getting out of bounds as the Vikings had no time-outs. Diggs easily avoided the defender and sprinted down the sideline for a walk-off touchdown. Although it occurred without any time left on the clock, this play is not a Hail Mary because it was not a desperation heave into the end zone.

Notre Dame trailed 3\u20130 in the second half and had been unable to move the ball effectively.  [[Noble Kizer]], the one [[Presbyterian]] player on the Notre Dame team, stopped play and said to his teammates, \"Boys, let's have a Hail Mary.\"  They all prayed, and [[Elmer Layden]] scored a touchdown.

The boys said the quick prayer and on the next play [[Jim Crowley|Jimmy Crowley]] dashed 30 yards for a touchdown.  Some time later Notre Dame was again stopped and again this non-Catholic called on the boys for a Hail Mary.  On the next play [[Harry Stuhldreher|Stuhldreher]] tossed a 25 yard pass to Layden for a score.  In between halves this same lad was chuckling to himself.

Notre Dame scored two touchdowns to cut Ohio State's lead to 13\u201312.  With less than a minute left in the game, Notre Dame quarterback [[Andy Pilney]] ran 30 yards to the Ohio State 19-yard line.  Pilney was injured and had to be carried off the field on a stretcher.  [[William Shakespeare (American football)|William Shakespeare]] (nicknamed the \"Merchant of Menace\") replaced Pilney.  With the clock running out, the ball was snapped to the fullback who handed it to Shakespeare on what appeared to be a reverse.

The game is known as the \"[[1980 Holiday Bowl|Miracle Bowl]]\" because the Cougars overcame Southern Methodist's 45\u201325 lead with four minutes left in the game, sealing the victory with a touchdown and kick after time expired.  Brown's catch remains one of the most spectacular Hail Mary receptions in football history.  He was completely surrounded by Southern Methodist defenders in the end zone, but he outjumped all of them and managed to hold on to the ball during the subsequent pileup.\n* '''1984''' \u2014 [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] vs. [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]]: Boston College quarterback [[Doug Flutie]] threw a 48-yard Hail Mary to [[Gerard Phelan]] for the 47\u201345 victory.

Tillman scored as time expired, breaking a 10\u201310 deadlock.

The play, known as 'Rocket Left', called for [[Michael Westbrook]] to tip the ball into the end zone for backup wideout Blake Anderson, but it was in fact Anderson in the middle of a cluster of players who tipped it to Westbrook for a 64-yard touchdown pass on the last play of the game. Colorado won 27\u201326, and the play (which Colorado had also run at the end of the first half, resulting in #4 Michigan intercepting it) became known as \"[[The Miracle at Michigan]]\" and took home an [[ESPY Awards|ESPY]] for College Football Play of the Year.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=2896389 | title=Stewart to Westbrook silenced Big House crowd | author=Ivan Maisel | publisher=ESPN.com | date=June 7, 2007 | accessdate=June 7, 2007}}</ref>\n* '''2000''' \u2014 [[2000 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] vs. [[2000 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]]: Northwestern quarterback [[Zak Kustok]] completed a 45-yard Hail Mary to wide receiver Sam Simmons.

The Vikings went into halftime up 14-9 and eventually won 27-9.\n\n==List of unsuccessful Hail Marys==\nThe sheer improbability of completing such a long pass with so many defenders in position to stop it makes even some unsuccessful Hail Mary attempts worth mentioning. Below is a list of such attempts and explanations as to why the plays were noteworthy.\n\n* '''1978''' \u2014 [[Atlanta Falcons]] vs. [[New Orleans Saints]]: Just two weeks after the Falcons beat the Saints 20\u201317 on the \"Big Ben\" pass play, the Falcons beat them again by the same score on the final play of the game after an intercepted Hail Mary pass when Saint defensive back [[Mo Spencer]] was called for pass interference by side judge Grover Klemmer. The Falcons scored on a run from the 1 yard line on the next play. The play became known as \"Big Ben II.\"  In this particular instance, the NFL later acknowledged that the interference call was the wrong call, and the case was cited by some as an early example for the need for football officiating crews to have access to instant replays. Though incomplete in this game, the pass play really began to be used by other teams significantly more often after this game, as a pass interference penalty that would move the ball to the 1 yard line was now viewed as a possible result from the play \u2014 if not an even more likely result than completing the pass itself. However, officials have actually proved very reluctant to call pass interference during Hail Marys since this game, possibly because it appears difficult to determine in real time just who made contact with whom, with so many players congregating in one place to catch the ball \u2014 not to mention the high stakes of making an incorrect call with the outcome of the game in balance. Also, in the 1980s, pass interference rules were relaxed in cases where defenders made contact but were making an honest attempt for the ball (see more about the first \"Big Ben\" attempt above).\n* '''1990''' \u2014 [[LSU Tigers football|Louisiana State University]] vs. [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]: Louisiana State completed a Hail Mary pass against Vanderbilt. It was perhaps the only time where offensive pass interference has reversed the outcome of the play, despite a traditional reluctance of officiating crews to call a penalty on any one player during a play consisting of a cluster of flailing players and so much on the line. With the touchdown called back, Vanderbilt won its only game of the season, 24\u201321. According to LSU Student Media, during a press conference in the week after the game, Louisiana State's head coach, Mike Archer, showed reporters replays of the play, frame-by-frame, explaining why the penalty was a poor call. Louisiana State completed the season with a 5\u20136 record, and Archer was pressured to resign, with the loss to the eventual 1\u201310 team often being cited as the likely primary reason for his dismissal.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''1995''' \u2014 [[1995 AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship Game]] \u2014 [[Indianapolis Colts]] vs. [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]: With five seconds on the clock and the underdog [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] trailing the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] 20\u201316, Colts quarterback [[Jim Harbaugh]] (who earned the name \"Captain Comeback\" during the season) fired a Hail Mary pass into the end zone. After deflecting off several Steelers defenders, the ball made a rough landing in Colts wide receiver [[Aaron Bailey (American football)|Aaron Bailey]]'s stomach, but his arms were impeded from wrapping onto the ball and it rolled on its side and touched the turf before he was able to slap both hands onto it. The play was close enough that NBC commentators [[Dick Enberg]] and [[Phil Simms]] both initially declared on-air that the ball had been caught, and Bailey raised his arms with the ball as if he were celebrating a touchdown, but replays showed that the incomplete call was correct.<ref>{{youtube|id=d5hxVk9XdUE|title=1995 AFC Championship Ending}}</ref>\n* '''1996''' \u2014 [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: Jaguars quarterback [[Mark Brunell]] threw a pass to Willie Jackson for 55 yards that appeared to win the game. The officials ruled Jackson down at the 1, though Jaguars fans insist that replays show that Jackson crossed the goal-line. The Patriots then prevailed 28\u201325 in overtime. Brunell also completed a 51-yard Hail Mary in the same game before halftime, as well as 41 and 61-yard touchdown passes in the second half, to erase the Patriots' 22\u20130 first-half lead (see more about the first Hail Mary attempt above).\n* '''1997''' \u2014 [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] vs. [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]]: With three seconds remaining, Navy's Chris McCoy threw a pass from the Irish 29 that bounced off of the helmet of Irish player Deke Cooper and into the hands of Pat McGrew at the 18. McGrew was finally tackled by Allen Rossum when he had nearly reached the 1 yard line, allowing Notre Dame to hold on and win 21\u201317. Had McGrew scored, it would have ended the nation's all-time longest losing streak in an annual college football series. However, as a result of the loss, Navy continued its string of losses to the Fighting Irish \u2014 not finally ending it once and for all until [[2007 Navy vs. Notre Dame football game|2007]], at 43 games.\n* '''2002''' \u2014 [[Atlanta Falcons]] vs. [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]: With 1 second remaining in overtime, Steelers quarterback [[Tommy Maddox]] dropped back from his own 49-yard line and fired the ball towards the end zone. Wide receiver [[Plaxico Burress]] leapt into a group of Falcons defenders and Steelers receivers and grabbed the pass in mid-air, but when Burress landed on the turf, the upper half of his body (with his arms wrapped around the ball) crashed down at the 1-yard line with his lower body landing in the end zone. With no penalties on Atlanta and the clock reading 0:00, Maddox and Burress' spectacular completion was the final exclamation point in the first tie the NFL had seen since 1997. This play is not counted as a success, because it did not result in a team scoring a touchdown.\n* '''2008''' \u2014 [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] vs. Middle Tennessee: Six years after Kentucky lost the [[Bluegrass Miracle]] game on a similar pass play, Middle Tennessee's Eldred King caught a tipped 61-yard throw from Joe Craddock on the game's final play. King was tackled on the 1 yard line to preserve a 20\u201314 UK victory and prevent a second Bluegrass Miracle from happening. Middle Tennessee completed a similar pass play against Florida Atlantic later in the same season (see more about the second Hail Mary attempt above).\n* '''2009''' \u2014 [[Magnolia Bowl]] \u2014 [[2009 LSU Tigers football team|Louisiana State University]] vs. [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Mississippi]]: Louisiana State's [[Jordan Jefferson]], under a heavy pass rush, was forced to heave an under-thrown 43-yard Hail Mary pass that Terrance Toliver was able to catch with between two and three seconds remaining in regulation \u2014 but still 6 yards short of the end zone. After the completion, the clock was not halted for the first down until one second remained, giving Louisiana State too little time to set up and run a follow-up play. Ole Miss prevailed, 25\u201323. This play was a rare completed Hail Mary pass with time remaining, but was under-thrown and time ran out. The loss subsequently led to harsh criticism of Louisiana State's [[Les Miles]] for his clock management efforts \u2014 especially since it appeared that the team was going to try to spike the ball as time ran out \u2014 and led to a significant movement over the next year to remove him as head coach. He later signed a contract extension after a much more successful season the following year, and continued coaching the Tigers until losing his job four games into the 2016 season.\n* '''2012''' \u2014 [[Super Bowl XLVI]] \u2013 [[New York Giants]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: After a touchdown run by [[Ahmad Bradshaw]] to make the score 21\u201317, in favor of the Giants, the New England Patriots received the ball with 59 seconds to play. After running a few plays, 4 seconds remained on the clock. The Patriots, at their own 49-yard line, elected to go for the Hail Mary. [[Tom Brady]] threw a pass deep into the [[end zone]] intended for tight end [[Aaron Hernandez]]. A mass of players jumped up for the ball, and the ball landed a yard in front of tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]] as time expired. \n* '''2012''' \u2014 NFC divisional playoff game \u2014 [[Seattle Seahawks]] vs. [[Atlanta Falcons]]: After a late fourth quarter rally by the Falcons to take a 2-point lead, Atlanta attempted a surprise [[onside kick]], however the play failed. As a result, it set up the Seahawks to attempt a Hail Mary. With 2 seconds left, Seahawks' quarterback [[Russell Wilson]] spiraled a 60-yard pass into the end zone only to be intercepted by Falcons' wide receiver [[Julio Jones]] with no time remaining.<ref>{{youtube|id=HPwO0SjwzZc|title=Julio Jones on defense?!}}</ref>\n* '''2014''' \u2014 [[San Francisco 49ers]] vs. [[New Orleans Saints]]: The 49ers had just tied the score at 24\u201324 with 44 seconds left in regulation, leaving the Saints with enough time to try for the win. On the final play of the 4th quarter, Saints quarterback [[Drew Brees]] fired a pass from his own 48 yard line towards the end zone where tight end [[Jimmy Graham]] caught it for what appeared to be the game-winning touchdown. However, officials called offensive pass interference on Graham for shoving 49ers defensive back [[Perrish Cox]] to the ground before making the catch. Cox appeared to have 'flopped,' or exaggerate the contact from Graham, and Graham claimed that the penalty should not have been called. The 49ers went on to win the game in overtime, 27\u201324. A few days after the game, the NFL issued a statement saying that offensive pass interference was correctly called on the failed Hail Mary.\n* '''2015''' \u2014 [[Baltimore Ravens]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: The New England Patriots' wide receiver [[Brandon LaFell]] caught a 23-yard [[touchdown pass]] with 5:13 left in the 4th quarter. On the ensuing drive, Patriots safety [[Duron Harmon]] intercepted Ravens quarterback [[Joe Flacco]], but were unable to run out the clock. After the subsequent [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]], the Baltimore Ravens received the ball with 0:04 to play. The Ravens selected a Hail Mary play for the final play. The Ravens lined up at their own 48-yard line, with Flacco lining up in the [[shotgun formation]]. Flacco scrambled around the pocket, and heaved a deep ball to the end zone. A mass of players leaped for the ball, however, the ball was knocked out. The ball bounced off wide receiver [[Torrey Smith]]'s body and hit the turf, ending the game. The New England Patriots would go on to win [[Super Bowl XLIX]].\n* '''2015''' \u2014 [[Minnesota Vikings]] vs. [[Green Bay Packers]]: Although Aaron Rodgers completed two other Hail Marys in the 2015 season, he was not successful on this attempt. In week 17, with the Packers down to the Vikings 20\u201313, Rodgers threw the ball about 50 yards to the end zone, but the pass was knocked down. The victory gave Minnesota the [[NFC North]] championship.\n* '''2018''' \u2014 [[Super Bowl LII]] \u2013 [[Philadelphia Eagles]] vs. [[New England Patriots]]: In the waning moments, the Patriots were trailing 41\u201333 to the Eagles. Patriots quarterback and league most valuable player [[Tom Brady]] led his team to midfield, and attempted a Hail Mary pass intended for tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]] as time expired, similar to [[Super Bowl XLVI]].  The pass was knocked down by Eagles cornerback [[Ronald Darby]], and the Eagles won Super Bowl LII by the aforementioned score for their first-ever Super Bowl championship.\n* '''2018''' \u2014 [[New England Patriots]] vs. [[Chicago Bears]]: With 2 seconds remaining in regulation trailing 38\u201331, Bears quarterback [[Mitchell Trubisky]] completed a 54 yard Hail Mary pass to wide receiver Kevin White, only to have White stopped at the 1-yard line as the Patriots held on for the win.\n\n==List of passes often mistakenly referred to as a \"Hail Mary\"==\nA number of games over the years have been decided by long, last-second touchdown throws but were not, strictly-speaking, Hail Mary passes. Below is a list of such games with explanations as to why it has been improper to describe them as Hail Marys. Usually, the touchdowns were more conventional pass plays with designated receivers and not of the unscripted, \"jump ball\" throws that are normally associated with Hail Mary-styled passes.\n\n* '''1972''' \u2014 AFC Divisional Playoffs \u2014 [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] vs. [[Oakland Raiders]]: Pittsburgh trailed in this game 7\u20136 and faced fourth down and 10 from their own 40 with 22 seconds remaining. Pittsburgh's [[Terry Bradshaw]] threw to halfback [[Frenchy Fuqua]] but the Raiders' [[Jack Tatum]] collided with him and the ball was deflected towards the Steelers' [[Franco Harris]], who then scored a controversial touchdown. This play has become known as the [[Immaculate Reception]].  The pass is usually not considered a \"Hail Mary\" pass in that it was a scripted play intended for a specific receiver and not thrown desperately \"up for grabs\" like Hail Marys usually are. It also was not thrown anywhere near the Raiders' end zone by design.\n* '''1974''' \u2014 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] \u2014 [[Washington Redskins]] vs [[Dallas Cowboys]]: Dallas reserve quarterback and rookie [[Clint Longley]], filling in for an injured [[Roger Staubach]], threw two touchdown passes including the game winning 50-yarder to [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] to push the Cowboys to a 24\u201323 victory and, in the process, keeping the Cowboys in the playoff hunt. This pass was more of a traditional, late-game \"bomb\" throw with a scripted post route for Pearson. There were 35 seconds remained when the play was attempted.\n* '''1997''' \u2014 [[1997 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] vs. [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]]: Nebraska quarterback [[Scott Frost]]'s last-second pass to [[Shevin Wiggins]] was deflected, then before the ball touched the ground, Wiggins kicked the ball towards the back of the end zone where teammate [[Matt Davidson (hockey)|Matt Davidson]] scoped the ball up just before it hit the ground.  The touchdown sent the game into overtime, when the top ranked Cornhuskers won. Nebraska went on to share the national title that season. This play is also known as the [[Flea Kicker]]. It is generally{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} not considered a Hail Mary pass as it was very short \u2014 attempted within the red zone \u2014 and was more of a traditional, scripted pass play that just ended up having an unusual result.\n* '''2003''' \u2014 [[Arizona Cardinals]] vs. [[Minnesota Vikings]]: The Cardinals stunned the Vikings on a 28-yard touchdown pass as time expired from [[Josh McCown]] to [[Nate Poole]] to win 18\u201317. The pass, which was made in just McCown's third start, appears to have been intended for strictly for Poole, one of two reasons it is not historically viewed as a Hail Mary (the other is that it was a relatively short play, as Hail Mary plays have usually traveled at least 50 yards to completion). The loss was costly for the Vikings as they not only lost the game, but lost the NFC North title to the Packers and were eliminated from playoff contention. The reception is noted for the fact that under NFL rules at the time, Poole was given the touchdown reception even though he did not get both feet inbounds because he was shoved out of bounds by a Viking defender after making the catch and getting 1 foot in; the league has since changed this rule, and under current standards the pass would have been incomplete.<ref>ESPN.com [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=231228022 McCown tosses 28-yarder to Poole]</ref>\n* '''2005''' \u2014 [[Capital One Bowl]] \u2014 [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] vs. [[2005 LSU Tigers football team|Louisiana State University]]: With 14 seconds left, Iowa quarterback [[Drew Tate]] completed a 56-yard touchdown pass to [[Warren Holloway]], left open due to a Louisiana State defensive breakdown, to give Iowa a 30\u201325 victory on the game's final play.<ref>ESPN.com [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?confId=&gameId=250012294 Tate-to-Holloway caps Hawkeyes rally]</ref> This play is usually not considered a Hail Mary pass per se and varies from the traditional definition of one in that the throw was intended for a specific receiver and not tossed \"up for grabs.\"\n* '''2009''' \u2014 [[Minnesota Vikings]] vs. [[San Francisco 49ers]]: The 49ers were up 24\u201320 with 11 seconds left in the game. The Vikings had the ball at the 49ers' 32 yard line. [[Brett Favre]] rolled out right and avoided a defender by using a pump fake. Then, he threw it from about the 39 yard line and connected to [[Greg Lewis (wide receiver)|Greg Lewis]] in the very back of the end zone. Lewis just got both of his feet in, making a spectacular catch. This play isn't considered a Hail Mary because there were two seconds left on the clock, and another play (which ''would'' have been a Hail Mary attempt) would have been run by Minnesota if Lewis' reception had been called off.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n* '''2012''' \u2014 AFC Divisional Playoffs \u2014 [[Baltimore Ravens]] vs [[Denver Broncos]]: With 45 seconds remaining and at their own 30 down by 7, the Ravens needed a miracle against the Broncos. Ravens quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] launched the ball to [[Jacoby Jones]] on the right sideline, who caught it at the Broncos' 20 yard line and scampered in for the touchdown. This would send the game to overtime and the Ravens would kick a field goal in the second overtime to win the game. This play, known as the [[Mile High Miracle]], was not a Hail Mary was because the play called in the situation might have been too deep; also, the play did not consist of several players jumping up for the ball, or \"up for grabs\".\n* '''2013''' \u2014 [[2013 Fordham Rams football team|Fordham]] vs. [[2013 Temple Owls football team|Temple]]: With Temple leading 29\u201323, Fordham quarterback [[Michael Nebrich]], with 13 seconds left, rolled to his right after taking the snap and then threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Sam Ajala]] with 4 seconds left, giving Fordham a 30\u201329 victory with the extra point, their first ever victory over an Football Bowl Series opponent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?id=332570218 |title=Fordham holds off late rally to beat Temple 30\u201329 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=September 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}</ref> The play cannot be considered a Hail Mary because it took place on third down,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=332570218&period=4 |title=Fordham 30, Temple 29: 4th Quarter Play by Play |publisher=ESPN.com |date=September 14, 2013 |accessdate=December 12, 2013}}</ref> meaning that Fordham would have had one more chance at a touchdown had the pass been incomplete.\n* '''2013''' \u2014 [[2013 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] vs. [[2013 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]]: With the game tied 17\u201317, Florida State quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] took the snap with 1 second left at the Seminole 45 in the first half, dodged several tacklers, and threw a bomb to [[Kenny Shaw]] that was caught at the 2 yard line before Shaw dove for the end zone. The Seminoles would eventually win by a final score of 48\u201334, en route to winning the [[2013 BCS Championship Game|BCS Championship Game]]. This is not considered a Hail Mary play because although the pass was completed as the half ended, it did not consist of several players jumping up for the ball (there was only one safety on Shaw when he made the catch).\n* '''[[2017-18 NFL playoffs|2017]]''' \u2014 NFC Divisional Playoffs \u2014 [[New Orleans Saints]] vs. [[Minnesota Vikings]]: The \"[[Minneapolis Miracle]]\": After a furious last four minutes with three lead changes, Minnesota was down by 1 with the ball on their own 39 and just 10 seconds left.  On the next play, [[Case Keenum]] completed a 30-yard throw to Stephon Diggs who was near the sideline, within field goal range. The Saints defender aggressively moved to block Diggs from getting out of bounds as the Vikings had no time-outs. Diggs easily avoided the defender and sprinted down the sideline for a walk-off touchdown. Although it occurred without any time left on the clock, this play is not a Hail Mary because it was not a desperation heave into the end zone.  The play was immediately named the \"Minneapolis Miracle\" on air by Vikings radio announcer Paul Allen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000907045/article/minnesota-miracle-made-all-sorts-of-nfl-history|title=Minnesota Miracle made all sorts of NFL history|date=2018-01-15|work=nfl.com|access-date=2018-01-16}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hail Marys in American football}}\n[[Category:College football-related lists]]\n[[Category:National Football League lists]]\n[[Category:American football-related lists]]\n", "name_user": "214.26.77.245", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eProfessional football)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hail_Mary_passes_in_American_football"}

On 29 May 1953, Hillary and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] mountaineer [[Tenzing Norgay]] became the [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions|first climbers]] confirmed to have reached the summit of [[Mount Everest]]. They were part of the [[1953 British Mount Everest expedition|ninth British expedition to Everest]], led by [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]]. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's [[List of High Commissioners of New Zealand to India|High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh]] and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal.\n\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of [[Mount Ollivier]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Sir Edmund Hillary Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=   https://www.achievement.org/achiever/sir-edmund-hillary/#interview}}</ref> He served in the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] as a [[navigator]] during [[World War II]] and was wounded in an accident. Prior to the Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the [[1951 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|British reconnaissance expedition]] to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb [[Cho Oyu]] in 1952. As part of the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] he reached the [[South Pole]] overland in 1958.

[[mountaineering|mountaineer]], explorer, and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]]. On 29 May 1953, Hillary and [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] mountaineer [[Tenzing Norgay]] became the [[Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions|first climbers]] confirmed to have reached the summit of [[Mount Everest]]. They were part of the [[1953 British Mount Everest expedition|ninth British expedition to Everest]], led by [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]]. From 1985 to 1988 he served as New Zealand's [[List of High Commissioners of New Zealand to India|High Commissioner to India and Bangladesh]] and concurrently as Ambassador to Nepal.\n\nHillary became interested in mountaineering while in secondary school. He made his first major climb in 1939, reaching the summit of [[Mount Ollivier]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Sir Edmund Hillary Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=   https://www.achievement.org/achiever/sir-edmund-hillary/#interview}}</ref> He served in the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] as a [[navigator]] during [[World War II]] and was wounded in an accident. Prior to the Everest expedition, Hillary had been part of the [[1951 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|British reconnaissance expedition]] to the mountain in 1951 as well as an unsuccessful attempt to climb [[Cho Oyu]] in 1952. As part of the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] he reached the [[South Pole]] overland in 1958. He subsequently reached the [[North Pole]], making him the first person to reach both poles and summit Everest.\n\nFollowing his ascent of Everest, Hillary devoted himself to assisting the Sherpa people of Nepal through the [[Himalayan Trust]], which he established. His efforts are credited with the construction of many schools and hospitals in Nepal. Hillary had numerous honours conferred upon him, including the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1995. Upon his death in 2008, he was given a [[state funeral]] in New Zealand.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Gertrude Clark, mother of Edmund Hillary, 1909.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hillary's mother Gertrude Clark, 1909]]\nHillary was born to Percival Augustus and Gertrude (n\u00e9e Clark) Hillary in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, on 20 July 1919.<ref name=\"Christchurch\">{{cite web|website=Christchurch City Libraries|url=http://library.christchurch.org.nz/Kids/FamousNewZealanders/more/SirEdmundHillary.asp |title=Famous New Zealanders|accessdate=23 January 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"NZHistory\">{{cite web|title=Edmund Hillary|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/edmund-hillary|website=New Zealand History|publisher=Research and Publishing Group of the New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=15 February 2018|location= Wellington, New Zealand}}</ref> His father Percy had served at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] with the 15th (North Auckland) Regiment, and was discharged \"medically unfit\" from the Army in 1916; he had married Gertrude after his return to New Zealand.
