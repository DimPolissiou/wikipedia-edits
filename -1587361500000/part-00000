Tico operated a cattle ranch on the land and moved his large family to an adobe in the lower valley. Tico sold the entire Rancho Ojai in 1853.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp. 16-18</ref> The rancho changed hands several more times before it was purchased in 1864 by [[Thomas A. Scott]], a Pennsylvania oil and railroad baron. The petroleum exploration of the Ojai Basin was the result of a report of [[petroleum seep|oil seeps]] (oil springs) along the Sulphur Mountain area. In 1866, Scott's nephew [[Thomas Bard]] used a steam-powered cable-tool [[drilling rig]] on the north side of Sulphur Mountain.  On May 29, 1867, Ojai No. 6 produced an [[oil gusher]], at a depth of 550 feet, and the Ojai Field eventually produced 10-20 [[barrels of oil]] a day.  Also in 1866, [[Leland Stanford]]'s brother Josiah dug oil tunnels on the south side of Sulphur Mountain, producing 20 barrels a day for the Stanford Brothers refinery in San Francisco. For economic reasons, falling oil prices at the end of the Civil War and cheaper imports from the east, Scott and Stanford ceased oil exploration in the valley area.  Thomas Bard then began selling the surface rights to parcels of Rancho Ojai in late 1867.  As the president of [[Unocal]], Bard would return in the 1890s to dig about 50 oil tunnels into Sulphur Mountain, which produced until 1998.<ref>Sheridan, Solomon Neill.

Surdam]] and named Nordhoff in honor of the writer [[Charles Nordhoff (journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]] who had written a book about California titled, ''California for Health, Pleasure and Residence: A Book for Travelers and Settlers''. Most early settlers to the valley had one or more family members who were ill, particularly with respiratory illnesses, and the Ojai Valley developed a reputation for having healthy air quality. Many did get well after moving to the valley. Charles Nordhoff had not visited the Ojai Valley when his book came out in 1873, but made several visits to his namesake town in the early 1880s, and he mentioned the Ojai Valley in the revised 1882 version of his popular book.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp. 30-31</ref> The discovery of hot springs in Matilija Canyon and subsequent development of hot springs resorts in the late 1800s contributed to the valley's healing mystique.\n\nThe public high school in Ojai is still named [[Nordhoff High School]].

The elite Foothills Hotel, which catered to them, was built on a mountain overlooking the town in 1903. Visitors enjoyed dining, music concerts, horseback riding, and hunting and fishing trips into the back country. Some of these businessmen built homes in the valley and contributed to the community's development. Among these winter visitors were Edward Drummond Libbey and his wife Florence. Their first winter in Ojai was in 1907. Libbey was the owner of the Libbey Glass Company of Toledo, Ohio. He fell in love with the valley, bought property in the Foothills tract in 1909, and built a Craftsman-style house designed by Myron Hunt and Elmer Grey.<ref>Walker, Craig. ''Ojai by Design: Fine Architecture of the Ojai Valley''. Arts Commission of the City of Ojai. 2017. p.12</ref>\n\nSteeped in City Beautiful ideals, Libbey began thinking about what could be done to beautify the existing rustic town. He bought up all the properties on the south side of Ojai Avenue (where Libbey Park is today) and most of the buildings there were demolished. In 1916, he hired the architectural firm of Frank Mead and Richard Requa of San Diego to transform Nordhoff into the Spanish-style town center seen today. The project included a Mission-style arcade along the main street, a bell-tower reminiscent of the famous campanile of the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Havana, Cuba (also known as the Havana Cathedral), and a pergola with two arches opposite the arcade. In March 1917, just after completion of the renovation project, the name of the town was changed to Ojai. The valley had always been known as \"The Ojai\" and it made sense with the town's new image to change its name as well.<ref>Lewis, Mark. \"Inventing Ojai,\" ''Ojai Quarterly'', Winter 2016-17, pp.120-126</ref>\n\nLeading up to and during World War I, American sentiment became increasingly [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]]. Across the United States, German and German-sounding place names were changed. Some Ojai writers in the past have speculated that anti-German sentiment contributed to the name change of Nordhoff to Ojai in 1917.<ref>{{cite news|title=Looking for Charles Nordhoff|last=Meltzer|first=Betty Kikumi|date=2005-08-21|work=Redlands Daily Facts|location=Redlands, Calif.|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rediscovering the Lost Horizon: Shangri-la Does Exist - It's in California and It's Idyllic, says Angela Wigglesworth|last=Wigglesworth|first=Angela|date=1998-08-29|work=Financial Times|location=London (UK)|page=18|df=mdy-all}}</ref> There is no clear evidence that this was the case for the name change in Ojai.\n\nTo thank Libbey for his gifts to the town, the citizens proposed a celebration in the new Civic Center Park (later changed to Libbey Park) that they wished to call \"Libbey Day,\" but Libbey suggested \"Ojai Day\" instead. The first Ojai Day took place April 7, 1917.<ref>\"Idealized Ojai Receives Recognition As Does Also Its Benefactor,\" ''The Ojai'', April 13, 1917, 1</ref> Ojai Day was celebrated each year until 1928. Local schoolteacher Craig Walker revived Ojai Day in 1991 and it has been celebrated each since.<ref name=\":2\">Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt, and Craig Walker.

Ojai, California. p.225, pp. 333-334</ref> The Ojai Day celebration takes place in October.\n\nIn 1917 two fires struck the community. The first started in Matilija Canyon on June 16 and burned 60 buildings in its path including many homes and the Foothills Hotel. The newly Spanish-style structures in the downtown were not affected. On November 28 of 1917, a fire started in a gasoline stove in a store in the Arcade and the stores in the western half of the Arcade burned down. Part of the Arcade suffered smoke damage but did not burn down.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp.188-189</ref>  A new Spanish-style Foothills Hotel was built in 1919\u20131920 to replace the one that burned down.\n\nThe Taormina neighborhood was established as the first historic district in the city in 2016.  The housing development was built in the style of French [[architecture of Normandy]] in the 1960s and 1970s by members of the [[Theosophical Society in America|Theosophy movement]] adjacent to the [[Krotona Institute of Theosophy]]. Taormina's founder, theosophist Ruth Wilson, envisioned the development as a [[retirement community]] for fellow theosophists but in the early 1980s a court ruling required the community to be open to residents of all faiths and backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/communities/ojai/2016/08/31/ojai-names-taormina-its-first-historic-district/89496504/ |title=Ojai names Taormina its first historic district |first=Claudia |last=Boyd-Barrett |date=31 August 2016 |newspaper=[[Ventura County Star]] |access-date=2 September 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOjai is situated in a small east\u2013west eponymous valley, north of [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and east of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kamin|first=Debra|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/realestate/ojai-calif-a-valley-of-wellness-but-no-chain-stores-in-ventura-county.html|title=Ojai, Calif.: A Valley of Wellness (but No Chain Stores) in Ventura County|date=2020-03-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The city is approximately {{convert|745|ft|m}} above sea level and borders the [[Los Padres National Forest]] to the north.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Ojai Valley is bounded by mountains on the north and south and is actively shaped by a web of earthquake faults. The Santa Ynez Mountains lie to the north, while Sulphur Mountain and the lower Black Mountain lie to the south. The mountains to the west of the Ojai Valley are drained by the Coyote, Matilija and Santa Ana creeks. These empty into the Ventura River. The Matilija Dam, Casitas Dam and Lake Casitas Reservoir alter the historic drainage of these creeks and the river. The creeks that drain the mountains directly north of Ojai empty into San Antonio Creek, as does Lion Canyon Creek that lies between Black Mountain and Sulphur Mountain. San Antonio Creek drains into the Ventura River just north of Casitas Springs. The [[Ventura River]] flows through the Ventura River Valley and empties into the Pacific Ocean at the city of Ventura.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''.

These creeks flow into the Santa Clara River at Santa Paula. The high mountains above the Ojai Valley and further east are drained by Sespe Creek, which empties into the Santa Clara River at Fillmore. In 1991, 31.5 miles of the 55-mile-long Sespe Creek was given federal Wild & Scenic River status.<ref>Keep the Sespe Wild Committee. http://www.sespewild.org/</ref>\n\n[[File:Topa Topa Mountains from Ojai.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | alt= photo of Topa's from Ojai |\nView of the Topatopa Mountains from Upper Ojai.]]\nNordhoff Ridge, the western extension of the [[Topatopa Mountains]], towers over the north side of the valley at more than {{convert|5000|ft|m}}.

During dry spells with continental air, morning temperatures, due to Ojai's valley location, can drop well below most of Southern California, with the record being {{convert|13|F|C|1}} on January 6 and 7 of 1913. In contrast, Ojai is far enough from the sea to minimize marine cooling, and very hot days can occur during summer, with the record being {{convert|119|F|C|1}} on June 16, 1917 \u2013 when it fell as low as {{convert|65|F|C|1}} in the morning due to clear skies and dry air.\n\nAs is typical for much of coastal southern California, most precipitation falls in the form of rain between the months of October and April, with intervening dry summers. As with all of Southern California, rain falls on few days, but when it does rain it is often extremely heavy: the record being {{convert|9.05|in|mm|1}} on February 24, 1913, followed by {{convert|8.15|in|mm|1}} on January 26, 1914. During the wettest month on record of January 1969, {{convert|25.76|in|mm|1|disp=or}} fell, with a whopping {{convert|23.46|in|mm|1}} in eight days from January 19 to January 26. In contrast, the median annual rainfall for all years in Ojai is only around {{convert|18.1|in|mm|0|disp=or}} and in the driest \"rain year\" from July 2006 to June 2007, just {{convert|6.87|in|mm|1|disp=or}} fell in twelve months.

The newspaper was called ''The Ojai'' until 1958. A newspaper called ''The Ojai Valley News'' was founded in competition to ''The Ojai'' in 1949. In 1958, J. Frank Knebel bought ''The Ojai'', ''The Ojai Valley News'' and another small paper called ''The Oaks Gazette''. He called this combined paper the ''Ojai Valley News and Oaks Gazette.''  A competition newspaper called ''The Ojai Press'' was founded in 1959 and another called ''The Oaks Sentinel'' came out the following year. When both of these papers floundered a group of over 100 people called \"Voice of the Valley\" pitched in to take over these papers and began publishing the ''Press Sentinel''. Members of the Voice of the Valley group felt strongly that there needed to be an alternative viewpoint in the valley from the views expressed in Knebel's paper. The ''Press Sentinel'' was published for two years. When Fred Volz purchased ''The Ojai Valley News and Oaks Gazette'' in 1962, changing the name to ''Ojai Valley News,'' the ''Press Sentinel'' ceased publication.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''.

Tico operated a cattle ranch on the land and moved his large family to an adobe in the lower valley. Tico sold the entire Rancho Ojai in 1853.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp. 16-18</ref> The rancho changed hands several more times before it was purchased in 1864 by [[Thomas A. Scott]], a Pennsylvania oil and railroad baron. The petroleum exploration of the Ojai Basin was the result of a report of [[petroleum seep|oil seeps]] (oil springs) along the Sulphur Mountain area. In 1866, Scott's nephew [[Thomas Bard]] used a steam-powered cable-tool [[drilling rig]] on the north side of Sulphur Mountain.  On May 29, 1867, Ojai No. 6 produced an [[oil gusher]], at a depth of 550 feet, and the Ojai Field eventually produced 10-20 [[barrels of oil]] a day.  Also in 1866, [[Leland Stanford]]'s brother Josiah dug oil tunnels on the south side of Sulphur Mountain, producing 20 barrels a day for the Stanford Brothers refinery in San Francisco. For economic reasons, falling oil prices at the end of the Civil War and cheaper imports from the east, Scott and Stanford ceased oil exploration in the valley area.  Thomas Bard then began selling the surface rights to parcels of Rancho Ojai in late 1867.

Surdam]] and named Nordhoff in honor of the writer [[Charles Nordhoff (journalist)|Charles Nordhoff]] who had written a book about California titled, ''California for Health, Pleasure and Residence: A Book for Travelers and Settlers''. Most early settlers to the valley had one or more family members who were ill, particularly with respiratory illnesses, and the Ojai Valley developed a reputation for having healthy air quality. Many did get well after moving to the valley. Charles Nordhoff had not visited the Ojai Valley when his book came out in 1873, but made several visits to his namesake town in the early 1880s, and he mentioned the Ojai Valley in the revised 1882 version of his popular book.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp. 30-31</ref> The discovery of hot springs in Matilija Canyon and subsequent development of hot springs resorts in the late 1800s contributed to the valley's healing mystique.\n\nThe public high school in Ojai is still named [[Nordhoff High School]].

The elite Foothills Hotel, which catered to them, was built on a mountain overlooking the town in 1903. Visitors enjoyed dining, music concerts, horseback riding, and hunting and fishing trips into the back country. Some of these businessmen built homes in the valley and contributed to the community's development. Among these winter visitors were Edward Drummond Libbey and his wife Florence. Their first winter in Ojai was in 1907. Libbey was the owner of the Libbey Glass Company of Toledo, Ohio. He fell in love with the valley, bought property in the Foothills tract in 1909, and built a Craftsman-style house designed by Myron Hunt and Elmer Grey.<ref>Walker, Craig. ''Ojai by Design: Fine Architecture of the Ojai Valley''. Arts Commission of the City of Ojai. 2017. p.12</ref>\n\nSteeped in City Beautiful ideals, Libbey began thinking about what could be done to beautify the existing rustic town. He bought up all the properties on the south side of Ojai Avenue (where Libbey Park is today) and most of the buildings there were demolished. In 1916, he hired the architectural firm of Frank Mead and Richard Requa of San Diego to transform Nordhoff into the Spanish-style town center seen today. The project included a Mission-style arcade along the main street, a bell-tower reminiscent of the famous campanile of the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Havana, Cuba (also known as the Havana Cathedral), and a pergola with two arches opposite the arcade. In March 1917, just after completion of the renovation project, the name of the town was changed to Ojai. The valley had always been known as \"The Ojai\" and it made sense with the town's new image to change its name as well.<ref>Lewis, Mark. \"Inventing Ojai,\" ''Ojai Quarterly'', Winter 2016-17, pp.120-126</ref>\n\nLeading up to and during World War I, American sentiment became increasingly [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]]. Across the United States, German and German-sounding place names were changed. Some Ojai writers in the past have speculated that anti-German sentiment contributed to the name change of Nordhoff to Ojai in 1917.<ref>{{cite news|title=Looking for Charles Nordhoff|last=Meltzer|first=Betty Kikumi|date=2005-08-21|work=Redlands Daily Facts|location=Redlands, Calif.|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rediscovering the Lost Horizon: Shangri-la Does Exist - It's in California and It's Idyllic, says Angela Wigglesworth|last=Wigglesworth|first=Angela|date=1998-08-29|work=Financial Times|location=London (UK)|page=18|df=mdy-all}}</ref> There is no clear evidence that this was the case for the name change in Ojai.\n\nTo thank Libbey for his gifts to the town, the citizens proposed a celebration in the new Civic Center Park (later changed to Libbey Park) that they wished to call \"Libbey Day,\" but Libbey suggested \"Ojai Day\" instead. The first Ojai Day took place April 7, 1917.<ref>\"Idealized Ojai Receives Recognition As Does Also Its Benefactor,\" ''The Ojai'', April 13, 1917, 1</ref> Ojai Day was celebrated each year until 1928.

The first started in Matilija Canyon on June 16 and burned 60 buildings in its path including many homes and the Foothills Hotel. The newly Spanish-style structures in the downtown were not affected. On November 28 of 1917, a fire started in a gasoline stove in a store in the Arcade and the stores in the western half of the Arcade burned down. Part of the Arcade suffered smoke damage but did not burn down.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''. Ojai Valley Museum. 2017. pp.188-189</ref>  A new Spanish-style Foothills Hotel was built in 1919\u20131920 to replace the one that burned down.\n\nThe Taormina neighborhood was established as the first historic district in the city in 2016.  The housing development was built in the style of French [[architecture of Normandy]] in the 1960s and 1970s by members of the [[Theosophical Society in America|Theosophy movement]] adjacent to the [[Krotona Institute of Theosophy]]. Taormina's founder, theosophist Ruth Wilson, envisioned the development as a [[retirement community]] for fellow theosophists but in the early 1980s a court ruling required the community to be open to residents of all faiths and backgrounds.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/communities/ojai/2016/08/31/ojai-names-taormina-its-first-historic-district/89496504/ |title=Ojai names Taormina its first historic district |first=Claudia |last=Boyd-Barrett |date=31 August 2016 |newspaper=[[Ventura County Star]] |access-date=2 September 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOjai is situated in a small east\u2013west eponymous valley, north of [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and east of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Kamin|first=Debra|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/realestate/ojai-calif-a-valley-of-wellness-but-no-chain-stores-in-ventura-county.html|title=Ojai, Calif.: A Valley of Wellness (but No Chain Stores) in Ventura County|date=2020-03-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The city is approximately {{convert|745|ft|m}} above sea level and borders the [[Los Padres National Forest]] to the north.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} inland from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Ojai Valley is bounded by mountains on the north and south and is actively shaped by a web of earthquake faults. The Santa Ynez Mountains lie to the north, while Sulphur Mountain and the lower Black Mountain lie to the south. The mountains to the west of the Ojai Valley are drained by the Coyote, Matilija and Santa Ana creeks. These empty into the Ventura River. The Matilija Dam, Casitas Dam and Lake Casitas Reservoir alter the historic drainage of these creeks and the river. The creeks that drain the mountains directly north of Ojai empty into San Antonio Creek, as does Lion Canyon Creek that lies between Black Mountain and Sulphur Mountain. San Antonio Creek drains into the Ventura River just north of Casitas Springs. The [[Ventura River]] flows through the Ventura River Valley and empties into the Pacific Ocean at the city of Ventura.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''.

These creeks flow into the Santa Clara River at Santa Paula. The high mountains above the Ojai Valley and further east are drained by Sespe Creek, which empties into the Santa Clara River at Fillmore. In 1991, 31.5 miles of the 55-mile-long Sespe Creek was given federal Wild & Scenic River status.<ref>Keep the Sespe Wild Committee. http://www.sespewild.org/</ref>\n\n[[File:Topa Topa Mountains from Ojai.jpg | thumb | 220x124px | right | alt= photo of Topa's from Ojai |\nView of the Topatopa Mountains from Upper Ojai.]]\nNordhoff Ridge, the western extension of the [[Topatopa Mountains]], towers over the north side of the valley at more than {{convert|5000|ft|m}}.

The newspaper was called ''The Ojai'' until 1958. A newspaper called ''The Ojai Valley News'' was founded in competition to ''The Ojai'' in 1949. In 1958, J. Frank Knebel bought ''The Ojai'', ''The Ojai Valley News'' and another small paper called ''The Oaks Gazette''. He called this combined paper the ''Ojai Valley News and Oaks Gazette.''  A competition newspaper called ''The Ojai Press'' was founded in 1959 and another called ''The Oaks Sentinel'' came out the following year. When both of these papers floundered a group of over 100 people called \"Voice of the Valley\" pitched in to take over these papers and began publishing the ''Press Sentinel''. Members of the Voice of the Valley group felt strongly that there needed to be an alternative viewpoint in the valley from the views expressed in Knebel's paper. The ''Press Sentinel'' was published for two years. When Fred Volz purchased ''The Ojai Valley News and Oaks Gazette'' in 1962, changing the name to ''Ojai Valley News,'' the ''Press Sentinel'' ceased publication.<ref>Fry, Patricia, Elise DePuydt & Craig Walker, ''The Ojai Valley: An Illustrated History''.

Meanwhile the police arrest the mad professor. At the cemetery, Stan and Ollie get into a series of comical misadventures trying to enter the grounds and while digging up a fresh grave. Ledoux manages to slip into the grave while covered in a white sack. Stan and Ollie take Ledoux from the grave. With Ledoux's \"corpse\" slung over Stan's back, Ledoux's legs rip through the bottom of the sack\u2014and he walks step for step behind Stan. Stan and Ollie realize their stolen corpse is still alive and begin to run in panic.
