A prominent critic of the [[European Union]], he is a vocal supporter of [[Brexit]]. He is also complete waste of oxygen, Tim enjoys making people starve or suffer, especially if you happen to work for him. He shows a complete disregard for anyone he employs, refusing to pay staff and telling them all to find work elsewhere.\nTim bears the appearance of a potato. One that has been left out in the sun for a while.\nHe can typically be found roaming the streets, stealing from the needy and kicking anyone he feels is \"beneath him\", just for a bit of a laugh.\nIf morality and humility were ranked out of Ten Tim wouldn't even reach the zero.\nAvoid at all costs.\n\n==Early life==\nMartin was born on 28 April 1955 in [[Norwich]].<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |author=Andrew Clark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/jan/05/theeuro.europeanunion |title=Interview: Tim Martin, chairman, JD Wetherspoon |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=19 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Births, Marriages, Deaths records online|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?r=211067863:7194&d=bmd_1578958416 |accessdate=22 January 2020}}</ref> His father served in the [[Royal Air Force]] and then worked for brewing multinational [[Guinness Brewery|Guinness plc]] and became Malaysian marketing director.

She was involved in protracted negotiations to buy Nelson\u2019s uniform coat and waistcoat (eventually bought by [[Albert, Prince Consort|The Prince Consort]] for [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]] in 1845, later passing from there to the National Maritime Museum). Horatia only realised she was Lord Nelson's biological daughter in 1845 after Sir Nicholas Harris published volume 3 of his intensively researched Dispatches and Letters of Vice-Admiral Nelson, which included copies of correspondence which conclusively proved that Nelson was her father<ref>G\u00e9rin, Winifred. Horatia Nelson, Clarendon, 1970, page 297</ref> (she refused, however, to ever accept that Emma, Lady Hamilton was her mother<ref>G\u00e9rin, Winifred. Horatia Nelson, Clarendon, 1970, page 299</ref>). This growing public interest in Nelson ([[Nelson's Column]] and [[Trafalgar Square]] were erected in 1843, for example) brought her recompense for the perceived national neglect of her immediately after Nelson's death.  An appeal committee of Lord Nelson's friends and naval colleagues met frequently in London by Horatia herself, brought about a deputation to the [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Prime Minister]] and a national appeal (launched in 1850 and closed four years later; it raised only \u00a31457). At Horatia's insistence, the money thus raised was divided between her three sons in military service (Marmaduke, Philip and William), and so that same year (1854) [[Queen Victoria]] stepped in and allocated public funds for a \u00a3100 annual pension for each Nelson-Ward daughter.\n\nTwo of their nine children are buried with her (Edmund and her eldest daughter), though the couple do have living descendants, including Anna Horatia Tribe and her descendants, the Style Ward branch (who are also descended from Nelson's sister, Catherine Matcham, through the marriage of Horatia's son William to Catherine's granddaughter, Catherine Blanckley <ref>http://www.emmahamiltonsociety.co.uk/#!blank-4/fmtiu</ref> and the Nelson-Ward family branch.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4361780.stm Family pride at Nelson events], BBC News</ref>  Philip died from a liver problem soon after returning to England from India (he is commemorated by a plaque near the altar in St Mildred's, on the south wall), and her eldest daughter Eleanor Philippa (whilst still unmarried) was knocked down by a horse bolting from an innyard - the Queen's Head in [[Pinner]] High Street, carried into a draper's shop near to where the accident occurred, and died there. Horatia was also predeceased by her husband who died  suddenly on 16 January 1859 and was buried at the east of St Mildred's Tenterden with his children, Caroline Mary and Edmund Nelson (a memorial stained glass window was also put up to him in the church).<ref name=\"findagrave\">{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6884289/horatia-ward|title=Findagrave memorial to Horatia Ward|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Horatia Ward n\u00e9e Nelson as an old lady.jpg|thumb|Horatia Ward n\u00e9e Nelson as an old lady]]\nAfter her husband's death in January 1859 she had to leave Tenterden.

She was involved in protracted negotiations to buy Nelson\u2019s uniform coat and waistcoat (eventually bought by [[Albert, Prince Consort|The Prince Consort]] for [[Greenwich Hospital, London|Greenwich Hospital]] in 1845, later passing from there to the National Maritime Museum). Horatia only realised she was Lord Nelson's biological daughter in 1845 after Sir Nicholas Harris published volume 3 of his intensively researched Dispatches and Letters of Vice-Admiral Nelson, which included copies of correspondence which conclusively proved that Nelson was her father<ref>G\u00e9rin, Winifred. Horatia Nelson, Clarendon, 1970, page 297</ref> (she refused, however, to ever accept that Emma, Lady Hamilton was her mother<ref>G\u00e9rin, Winifred. Horatia Nelson, Clarendon, 1970, page 299</ref>). This growing public interest in Nelson ([[Nelson's Column]] and [[Trafalgar Square]] were erected in 1843, for example) brought her recompense for the perceived national neglect of her immediately after Nelson's death.  An appeal committee of Lord Nelson's friends and naval colleagues met frequently in London by Horatia herself, brought about a deputation to the [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Prime Minister]] and a national appeal (launched in 1850 and closed four years later; it raised only \u00a31457). At Horatia's insistence, the money thus raised was divided between her three sons in military service (Marmaduke, Philip and William), and so that same year (1854) [[Queen Victoria]] stepped in and allocated public funds for a \u00a3100 annual pension for each Nelson-Ward daughter.\n\nTwo of their nine children are buried with her (Edmund and her eldest daughter), though the couple do have living descendants, including Anna Horatia Tribe and her descendants, the Style Ward branch (who are also descended from Nelson's sister, Catherine Matcham, through the marriage of Horatia's son William to Catherine's granddaughter, Catherine Blanckley <ref>http://www.emmahamiltonsociety.co.uk/#!blank-4/fmtiu</ref> and the Nelson-Ward family branch.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4361780.stm Family pride at Nelson events], BBC News</ref>  Philip died from a liver problem soon after returning to England from India (he is commemorated by a plaque near the altar in St Mildred's, on the south wall), and her eldest daughter Eleanor Philippa (whilst still unmarried) was knocked down by a horse bolting from an innyard - the Queen's Head in [[Pinner]] High Street, carried into a draper's shop near to where the accident occurred, and died there. Horatia was also predeceased by her husband who died  suddenly on 16 January 1859 and was buried at the east of St Mildred's Tenterden with his children, Caroline Mary and Edmund Nelson (a memorial stained glass window was also put up to him in the church).<ref name=\"findagrave\">{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6884289/horatia-ward|title=Findagrave memorial to Horatia Ward|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\n[[File:Horatia Ward n\u00e9e Nelson as an old lady.jpg|thumb|Horatia Ward n\u00e9e Nelson as an old lady]]\nAfter her husband's death in January 1859 she had to leave Tenterden. She moved to a house called Elmdene in Church Lane, [[Pinner]] and later at Beaufort Villas, Woodridings (a former estate in Pinner), where she died 22 years later; both were near to her son Nelson.

However, Royal Museums Greenwich have stated, \"we no longer think the woman in white is Horatia. She has some likeness to Nelson, but Horatia did not have such a marked resemblance from other portraits of her in youth (we have a bust by Christopher Prosperi showing her as a child and an oil portrait of her in early teens).\nWhere this identification started is not clear: the provenance of the item stops with its exhibition in 1889 when in the hands of a Bond Street dealer and the only link with the Nelson-Ward family is that they had a copy of made, probably at that time and relying on his identification of it, not theirs. There is, so far, no evidence it was ever in Nelson-Ward family possession (or other branches of the Nelson family), which is the obvious place to have expected to find it, or at least information linking it to them - but there is none.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Winifred G\u00e9rin]], ''Horatia Nelson'', Clarendon, 1970\n*[[Tom Pocock]], ''Nelson\u2019s Women'', Andre Deutsch, 1999, chapters 10 and 11\n*[[Kate Williams (historian)|Kate Williams]], ''England's Mistress - The Infamous Life of Emma Hamilton'', Hutchinson, London, 2006\n\n==External links==\n*{{Find a Grave|6884289}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nelson, Horatia}}\n[[Category:1801 births]]\n[[Category:1881 deaths]]\n[[Category:Daughters of viscounts]]\n[[Category:Horatio Nelson]]\n[[Category:People from Tenterden]]\n", "name_user": "Gonker44", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLater life and death:Link to Historic England Website, with information of her grave.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatia_Nelson"}

This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between {{convert|8|and|15.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and reaches {{convert|40|\u2013|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulders. It was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. Two [[subspecies]] are recognized: ''L. p. pardalis'' and ''L. p. mitis''.\n\nTypically active during [[twilight]] and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]. It is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as [[armadillo]], [[opossum]] and  . Both sexes become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at around two years of age; they can breed throughout the year, though the peak mating season varies geographically. After a [[gestation]] period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a litter of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own territories.\n\nThe ocelot prefers areas with dense vegetation cover, high prey availability, and proximity to water sources. It is listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]], hunting and [[traffic]] accidents. Populations are decreasing in many parts of its range. The association of the ocelot with humans dates back to the [[Aztec Civilisation|Aztec]] and [[Incan civilization|Incan]] civilizations; it has occasionally been owned as a [[pet]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"ocelot\" comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word {{lang|nci|\u014dc\u0113l\u014dtl}} ({{IPA-nah|o\u02d0\u02c8se\u02d0lo\u02d0t\u0361\u026c|pron}}), which generally refers to the [[jaguar]] rather than the ocelot.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =ocelot, ''n.'' |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=F. |last=Karttunen |year=1983 |authorlink=Frances Karttunen |title=An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=176}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=J. |last=Lockhart |authorlink=James Lockhart (historian) |year=2001 |title=Nahuatl as Written: Lessons in Older Written Nahuatl, with Copious Examples and Texts |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=228}}</ref> Another possible origin for the name is the Latin {{lang|la|ocellatus}} (\"having little eyes\" or \"marked with eye-like spots\"), in reference to the cat's spotted coat.<ref name=\"Sunquist\">{{cite book |last1=Sunquist |first1=M. |last2=Sunquist |first2=F. |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, US |isbn=978-0-226-77999-7 |pages=120\u2013129 |chapter=Ocelot ''Leopardus pardalis'' (Linnaeus, 1758) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=IF8nDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA120#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOther vernacular names for the ocelot include {{lang|es-VE|cunagaro}} (Venezuela), {{lang|es-AR|gato onza}} (Argentina), {{lang|es-PA|gato tigre}} (Panama), {{lang|und|heitigrikati}} (Suriname), {{lang|pt-BR|jaguatirica}} (Brazil), {{lang|es-CR|manigordo}} (Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela), {{lang|pt-BR|maracaja}} (Brazil), {{lang|und|mathuntori}}, {{lang|und|ocelote}}, {{lang|und|onsa}}, {{lang|es-BZ|pumillo}}, {{lang|en-BZ|tiger cat}} (Belize), {{lang|es-BO|tigrecillo}} (Bolivia) and {{lang|es-CO|tigrillo}} (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru).<ref name=mammal /><ref name=\"ojasti\">{{cite book |last1=Ojasti |first1=J. |title=Wildlife Utilization in Latin America: Current Situation and Prospects for Sustainable Management |date=1996 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |location=Rome |isbn=978-92-5-103316-6 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n''Felis pardalis'' was the [[scientific name]] proposed for the ocelot by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758.<ref name=\"linnaeus\">{{cite book |last1=Linnaeus |first1=C. |year=1758 |title=Caroli Linn\u00e6i Systema natur\u00e6 per regna tria natur\u00e6, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |page=42 |chapter=''Felis pardalis'' |volume=Tomus I |edition=10th |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000798865#page/41/mode/2up}}</ref> The genus ''[[Leopardus]]'' was proposed by [[John Edward Gray]] in 1842 for several spotted cat skins in the collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London]].<ref name=Gray1842>{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1= J.

This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between {{convert|8|and|15.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and reaches {{convert|40|\u2013|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulders. It was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. Two [[subspecies]] are recognized: ''L. p. pardalis'' and ''L. p. mitis''.\n\nTypically active during [[twilight]] and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and [[Territory (animal)|territorial]]. It is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as [[armadillo]], [[opossum]] and [[lagomorph]]s. Both sexes become [[sexual maturity|sexually mature]] at around two years of age; they can breed throughout the year, though the peak mating season varies geographically. After a [[gestation]] period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a litter of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own territories.\n\nThe ocelot prefers areas with dense vegetation cover, high prey availability, and proximity to water sources. It is listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], and is threatened by [[habitat destruction]], hunting and [[traffic]] accidents. Populations are decreasing in many parts of its range. The association of the ocelot with humans dates back to the [[Aztec Civilisation|Aztec]] and [[Incan civilization|Incan]] civilizations; it has occasionally been owned as a [[pet]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"ocelot\" comes from the [[Nahuatl]] word {{lang|nci|\u014dc\u0113l\u014dtl}} ({{IPA-nah|o\u02d0\u02c8se\u02d0lo\u02d0t\u0361\u026c|pron}}), which generally refers to the [[jaguar]] rather than the ocelot.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =ocelot, ''n.'' |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=F. |last=Karttunen |year=1983 |authorlink=Frances Karttunen |title=An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl |location=Austin, Texas |publisher=University of Texas Press |page=176}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=J. |last=Lockhart |authorlink=James Lockhart (historian) |year=2001 |title=Nahuatl as Written: Lessons in Older Written Nahuatl, with Copious Examples and Texts |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=228}}</ref> Another possible origin for the name is the Latin {{lang|la|ocellatus}} (\"having little eyes\" or \"marked with eye-like spots\"), in reference to the cat's spotted coat.<ref name=\"Sunquist\">{{cite book |last1=Sunquist |first1=M. |last2=Sunquist |first2=F. |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, US |isbn=978-0-226-77999-7 |pages=120\u2013129 |chapter=Ocelot ''Leopardus pardalis'' (Linnaeus, 1758) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=IF8nDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA120#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOther vernacular names for the ocelot include {{lang|es-VE|cunagaro}} (Venezuela), {{lang|es-AR|gato onza}} (Argentina), {{lang|es-PA|gato tigre}} (Panama), {{lang|und|heitigrikati}} (Suriname), {{lang|pt-BR|jaguatirica}} (Brazil), {{lang|es-CR|manigordo}} (Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela), {{lang|pt-BR|maracaja}} (Brazil), {{lang|und|mathuntori}}, {{lang|und|ocelote}}, {{lang|und|onsa}}, {{lang|es-BZ|pumillo}}, {{lang|en-BZ|tiger cat}} (Belize), {{lang|es-BO|tigrecillo}} (Bolivia) and {{lang|es-CO|tigrillo}} (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru).<ref name=mammal /><ref name=\"ojasti\">{{cite book |last1=Ojasti |first1=J. |title=Wildlife Utilization in Latin America: Current Situation and Prospects for Sustainable Management |date=1996 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |location=Rome |isbn=978-92-5-103316-6 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n''Felis pardalis'' was the [[scientific name]] proposed for the ocelot by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758.<ref name=\"linnaeus\">{{cite book |last1=Linnaeus |first1=C. |year=1758 |title=Caroli Linn\u00e6i Systema natur\u00e6 per regna tria natur\u00e6, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |page=42 |chapter=''Felis pardalis'' |volume=Tomus I |edition=10th |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000798865#page/41/mode/2up}}</ref> The genus ''[[Leopardus]]'' was proposed by [[John Edward Gray]] in 1842 for several spotted cat skins in the collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London]].<ref name=Gray1842>{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1= J.

[[Theia (planet)|Theia]], an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.\n\nThe hypothesis requires a collision between a proto-Earth about 90% of the size{{clarify|reason=diameter or mass?|date=June 2019}} of present Earth, and another body the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial diameter and a tenth of its mass). The latter has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the name of the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient [[angular momentum]] to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.\n\n[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tonnes of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to {{cvt|10000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\nThe Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core (compared to other [[rocky planet]]s and moons in the Solar System) is explained by Theia's core mostly merging into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccretion of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]].\n\nThe newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small preexisting satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth\u2013Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.<ref>{{cite web |author = J.

In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.<ref name=wiechert/> Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar System bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected. In 2007, researchers from Caltech showed that the likelihood of Theia having an identical isotopic signature as the Earth is very small (less than 1 percent chance).<ref name=ps2007>{{Cite journal | last1=Pahlevan | first1=Kaveh | last2=Stevenson | first2=David | title=Equilibration in the Aftermath of the Lunar-forming Giant Impact | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume=262 | issue=3\u20134 |date=October 2007 | pages=438\u2013449 | doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2007.07.055 | bibcode=2007E&PSL.262..438P |arxiv = 1012.5323 }}</ref> Published in 2012, an analysis of titanium isotopes in Apollo lunar samples showed that the Moon has the same composition as Earth,<ref name=\"test\">\n[http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/4673/titanium-paternity-test-says-earth-is-the-moons-only-parent Titanium Paternity Test Says Earth is the Moon's Only Parent (University of Chicago)]</ref> which [[Giant impact hypothesis#Difficulties|conflicts]] with the Moon forming far from Earth's orbit.\n\nTo help resolve these problems, a new theory published in 2012 posits that two bodies\u2014each five times the size of Mars\u2014collided, then recollided, forming a large disc of mixed debris that eventually formed Earth and the Moon.<ref name=nasa1/> The paper was called \u201cForming a Moon with an Earth-like composition via a Giant Impact\u201d, by R.&nbsp;M.

Following the impact, the Moon formed closer to Earth than these satellites, and then spiraled outward, colliding with them. (If the Moon was more massive than the other satellites, its tidal effect on Earth would have been greater, making it spiral outward faster.) This led to the Moon being covered with material with the same composition as the satellites, and thus also Earth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n\n\n{{multiple image|align=center\n|title=<center>Moon \u2013 [[Oceanus Procellarum]] (\"Ocean of Storms\")</center> |total_width=600 |width1=614 |height1=228 |image1=14-236-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption1=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 rectangular structure (visible \u2013 topography \u2013 [[Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory|GRAIL gravity gradients]]) (October 1, 2014).|width2=1500  |height2=1500 |image2=PIA18822-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Overall-20141001.jpg|caption2=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 context.|width3=1546 |height3=905 |image3=PIA18821-LunarGrailMission-OceanusProcellarum-Rifts-Closeup-20141001.jpg|caption3=Ancient [[rift valley]]s \u2013 closeup (artist's concept).}}\n\n==Other hypotheses==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:88%; float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n|- bgcolor= style=\"font-size: smaller;\"\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Density'''<ref>[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/moonhab.html#c2 The Formation of the Moon]</ref>\n|-\n!

[[Theia (planet)|Theia]], an early [[protoplanet]] the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta [[escape velocity|escaped]] into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.\n\nThe hypothesis requires a collision between a proto-Earth about 90% of the size{{clarify|reason=diameter or mass?|date=June 2019}} of present Earth, and another body the diameter of [[Mars]] (half of the terrestrial diameter and a tenth of its mass). The latter has sometimes been referred to as [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], the name of the mother of [[Selene]], the Moon [[goddess]] in [[Greek mythology]]. This size ratio is needed in order for the resulting system to have sufficient [[angular momentum]] to match the current orbital configuration. Such an impact would have put enough material into orbit around Earth to have eventually accumulated to form the Moon.\n\n[[Computer simulation]]s show a need for a glancing blow, which causes a portion of the collider to form a long arm of material that then shears off. The asymmetrical shape of the Earth following the collision then causes this material to settle into an orbit around the main mass. The energy involved in this collision is impressive: possibly trillions of tonnes of material would have been vaporized and melted. In parts of the Earth, the temperature would have risen to {{cvt|10000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n\nThe Moon's relatively small [[iron]] core (compared to other [[rocky planet]]s and moons in the Solar System) is explained by Theia's core mostly merging into that of Earth. The lack of [[volatiles]] in the lunar samples is also explained in part by the energy of the collision. The energy liberated during the reaccretion of material in orbit around Earth would have been sufficient to melt a large portion of the Moon, leading to the generation of a [[Lunar magma ocean|magma ocean]].\n\nThe newly formed Moon orbited at about one-tenth the distance that it does today, and spiraled outward because of [[tidal friction]] transferring angular momentum from the rotations of both bodies to the Moon's orbital motion. Along the way, the Moon's rotation became [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth, so that one side of the Moon continually faces toward Earth. Also, the Moon would have collided with and incorporated any small preexisting satellites of Earth, which would have shared the Earth's composition, including isotopic abundances. The geology of the Moon has since been more independent of the Earth. Although this hypothesis explains many aspects of the Earth\u2013Moon system, there are still a few unresolved problems, such as the Moon's volatile [[chemical element|element]]s not being as depleted as expected from such an energetic impact.<ref>{{cite web |author = J.

In 2001, the most precise measurement yet of the [[isotopic signature]]s of [[moon rock]]s was published.<ref name=wiechert/> Surprisingly, the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] lunar samples carried an isotopic signature identical to Earth rocks, but different from other Solar System bodies. Because most of the material that went into orbit to form the Moon was thought to come from Theia, this observation was unexpected.

The EP debuted at number one on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] and yielded two singles: \"VVIP\" and \"What Can I Do\" (Korean: \uc5b4\uca4c\ub77c\uace0; Revised Romanization: ''Eojjeolago'').

He branched into television with the Japanese drama ''Kindaichi Shonen no Jikenbo'' (2013) and the South Korean television series [[Angel Eyes (TV series)|''Angel Eyes'']] (2014).

The EP debuted at number one on the [[Gaon Album Chart]] and yielded two singles: \"VVIP\" and \"What Can I Do\" (Korean: \uc5b4\uca4c\ub77c\uace0; Revised Romanization: ''Eojjeolago'').

In 2018, he released his first Korean studio album, the chart-topper ''[[The Great Seungri]]'' and embarked on his [[The Great Seungri (tour)|first world tour]] as a solo artist.\n\nMaking his theatrical debut with the musical ''Sonagi'' in 2008, Seungri went on to star in films such as ''[[19-Nineteen|Nineteen]]'' and ''Why Did You Come to My House?'', both released in 2009. He branched into television with the Japanese drama ''Kindaichi Shonen no Jikenbo'' (2013) and the South Korean television series [[Angel Eyes (TV series)|''Angel Eyes'']] (2014). In recent years, he's explored other ventures, including opening a dance academy, owning a nightclub and restaurant franchise, founding a record label and investing in other businesses.\n\nOn March 11, 2019, Seungri departed from Big Bang and the entertainment industry and retired after allegations of him supplying prostitutes in 2015; a police investigation is ongoing into the [[Burning Sun scandal]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n===Early beginnings and debut with Big Bang===\n[[File:Seung in Thailand.jpg|thumb|upright|Seungri at the TV show ''Fast Forward'' in [[Thailand]] in December 2007]]\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gwangju]], South Korea, Seungri was noted for his dancing skills growing up,<ref name=\"YG\uc2e0\uc778 \ube45\ubc45, '\ubc30\ud2c0\uc2e0\ud654' \ud0c8\ub77d\uc790 \ud3ec\ud568 '\ub208\uae38'\">{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=YG\uc2e0\uc778 \ube45\ubc45, '\ubc30\ud2c0\uc2e0\ud654' \ud0c8\ub77d\uc790 \ud3ec\ud568 '\ub208\uae38'|date=July 7, 2006| publisher= | url =http://star.mt.co.kr/stview.php?no=2006070620255845157&type=3| work= Star News| pages = | accessdate = January 22, 2010 }}</ref> with the singer participating in the dance group II Hwa.<ref name=\"Seung Ri\">{{cite news| title=Seung Ri| url=http://www.koreanmovie.com/Seung_Ri_ka3268/| work=Koreanmovie.com| accessdate=January 22, 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105165134/http://www.koreanmovie.com/Seung_Ri_ka3268/| archivedate=January 5, 2010| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Hoping to pursue a career in the entertainment industry, Seungri appeared in survival program ''Let's Coke Play!

It was released on 6 October 1974 through [[Island Records]] in the United Kingdom and [[Atlantic Records]] in North America. It was their last studio recording of the 1970s and the last before lead member [[Robert Fripp]] temporarily disbanded the group. Though their lowest-charting album at the time, spending only one week in the UK charts, ''Red'' has received significant critical acclaim.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\nMuch of the material on ''Red'' has origins in improvisation. Motifs that would eventually be used for \"Fallen Angel\" were first played by Robert Fripp in 1972, as part of improvs performed with the quintet lineup that would record ''Larks' Tongues In Aspic''. These improvisations are documented as \"Fallen Angel\" and \"Fallen Angel Hullabaloo\" in the ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings]]'' box set, as well as standalone releases of their respective concerts. The distinctive introduction to \"One More Red Nightmare\" was also deployed by [[John Wetton]] and Robert Fripp in various improvs throughout 1974, which can be heard in the ''[[Starless (box set)]]'' and ''[[The Road to Red]]'' box sets. One notable performance is titled \"The Golden Walnut\". Lastly, \"Providence\" itself was an improv, taken from the group's show on 30 June in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. It has been included in its uncut form as part of various live sets, such as ''[[The Great Deceiver (King Crimson album)|The Great Deceiver]]'', as well as the 40th Anniversary Edition of ''Red'' itself.\n\n\"Red\" was composed solely by Robert Fripp. In an analysis of the piece by [[Andrew Keeling]], he describes \"Red\" as \"an instrumental piece scored for electric guitar (multi-tracked X3), bass guitar and drums,\" as well as \"one of the more muscular pieces of Robert Fripp's, in particular the deployment of open strings and heavily attacked and syncopated bass and drums.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keeling|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Keeling|title=King Crimson: Red \u2013 An Analysis by Andrew Keeling|url=http://www.songsouponsea.com/Keeling/Keeling-Red.html|website=Song Soup on Sea|publisher=Peter Sinfield|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> In an online diary from 2012, Robert Fripp speaks about the development of \"Red\": \"A motif; moved from [the missing piece] \"Blue\" to \"Red\": the opening and closing theme of \"Red\" itself.

At the time, the piece consisted only of the vocal section of the song, and Wetton claims that it got a \"cold reception\" from both Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford. Later, an introductory theme was written by Robert Fripp and performed on violin by [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]], and two additional sections were added after the vocal, one being contributed by Bruford.<ref name=BoffomuInt>{{cite web |last1=Curtiss |first1=Ron |last2=Weiner |first2=Aaron |title=John Wetton (King Crimson, U.K., Asia): The Complete Boffomundo Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hcovFGVW44 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=3 March 2019 |date=June 3, 2016}} Event occurs at 5:15\u20137:01.</ref> The final section reprises various themes from earlier in the song, and it also re-uses a bass part which was originally written for the song \"Fracture\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/tour-dates/295 |title=University of Texas Arlington |last=Smith |first=Sid |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |website=DGM Live |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> This early arrangement of \"Fracture\" can be heard on discs 1 and 25 of the ''[[Starless (box set)|Starless]]'' box set, as well as the standalone releases of their respective concerts.

This led to some occasional confusion amongst listeners about precisely what was being sung, particularly on the song \"One More Red Nightmare.\" The first printing of the lyrics would occur 26 years after the album's initial release, on the 2000 '30th Anniversary Edition' release.\n\nNear the conclusion of King Crimson's 1974 [[North America]]n tour, the decision was made to kick Cross out of the band. [[E.G. Records|EG]], the band's management, urged Fripp not to tell Cross until after the final date of the tour, but he would not be able to anyway; he would not return from the [[United States]] until after Cross would return to [[Europe]].

''Red'' having a heavier tone was largely due to the [[rhythm section]] of John Wetton and Bill Bruford, which Fripp has referred to as \"the flying brick wall\".

In the United States, it reached No. 66 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. However, it remained a popular album with fans and critics.\n\nRetrospective reviews were resoundingly positive. In theirs, [[AllMusic]] declared ''Red'' to be weaker than its two predecessors, but nonetheless a superlative work: \"few intact groups could have gotten an album as good as ''Red'' together. The fact that it was put together by a band in its death throes makes it all the more impressive an achievement.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] also applauded the album, having been generally critical of the group's past work, calling it \"Grand, powerful, grating, and surprisingly lyrical\" and commenting that \"this does for classical-rock fusion what [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s ''[[Devotion (John McLaughlin album)|Devotion]]'' did for jazz-rock fusion.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/> ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' reviewer considered ''Red'' \"a walk down a lightless corridor and an unhappy and ferocious counterbalance to the frolics of King Crimson's beginnings\", and described it as \"dark, brooding and laden with heavily distorted sections and a decidedly melancholic vibe\".<ref name=\"classic\"/>\n\nLike most of King Crimson's catalogue, ''Red'' has been re-released numerous times since its release. First issued on CD in 1986, it has also been released as part of the Definitive Edition and 30th Anniversary Edition series. In 2009, ''Red'' was chosen, alongside ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' and ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'', to launch the 40th Anniversary Edition series. As part of this series, each album is presented in a CD/DVD-A package, with new [[stereo]] and [[surround|5.1 surround]] mixes. Unlike most others in series, however, ''Red'' launched with no new stereo mix. In 2013, Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp produced a stereo remix for ''[[The Road To Red]]'', and this mix was issued separately as part of a 2CD package.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2001, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] named ''Red'' as one of the \"50 Heaviest Albums of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#50+Heaviest|title=Rocklist.net...Q Magazine Lists|website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> and [[Kurt Cobain]] had reportedly cited the album as a major influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Robert_Fripp_in_Rock_and_Folk|title=Interview with Robert Fripp in Rock and Folk \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Bill_Bruford_in_Percussioni_(in_Italian)|title=Interview with Bill Bruford in Percussioni (in Italian) \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> Musicologists Eric Tamm and Edward Macan both consider ''Red'', and particularly the track \"[[Starless]]\", to be the highlight of King Crimson's recorded output.\n\nThe title track was ranked number 87 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530224813/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20947527/page/36 ''Rolling Stone'' \u2013 The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time].

It was released on 6 October 1974 through [[Island Records]] in the United Kingdom and [[Atlantic Records]] in North America. It was their last studio recording of the 1970s and the last before lead member [[Robert Fripp]] temporarily disbanded the group. Though their lowest-charting album at the time, spending only one week in the UK charts, ''Red'' has received significant critical acclaim.\n\n== Writing and recording ==\n\nMuch of the material on ''Red'' has origins in improvisation. Motifs that would eventually be used for \"Fallen Angel\" were first played by Robert Fripp in 1972, as part of improvs performed with the quintet lineup that would record ''Larks' Tongues In Aspic''. These improvisations are documented as \"Fallen Angel\" and \"Fallen Angel Hullabaloo\" in the ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic: The Complete Recordings]]'' box set, as well as standalone releases of their respective concerts. The distinctive introduction to \"One More Red Nightmare\" was also deployed by [[John Wetton]] and Robert Fripp in various improvs throughout 1974, which can be heard in the ''[[Starless (box set)]]'' and ''[[The Road to Red]]'' box sets. One notable performance is titled \"The Golden Walnut\". Lastly, \"Providence\" itself was an improv, taken from the group's show on 30 June in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. It has been included in its uncut form as part of various live sets, such as ''[[The Great Deceiver (King Crimson album)|The Great Deceiver]]'', as well as the 40th Anniversary Edition of ''Red'' itself.\n\n\"Red\" was composed solely by Robert Fripp. In an analysis of the piece by [[Andrew Keeling]], he describes \"Red\" as \"an instrumental piece scored for electric guitar (multi-tracked X3), bass guitar and drums,\" as well as \"one of the more muscular pieces of Robert Fripp's, in particular the deployment of open strings and heavily attacked and syncopated bass and drums.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Keeling|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Keeling|title=King Crimson: Red \u2013 An Analysis by Andrew Keeling|url=http://www.songsouponsea.com/Keeling/Keeling-Red.html|website=Song Soup on Sea|publisher=Peter Sinfield|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> In an online diary from 2012, Robert Fripp speaks about the development of \"Red\": \"A motif; moved from [the missing piece] \"Blue\" to \"Red\": the opening and closing theme of \"Red\" itself.

At the time, the piece consisted only of the vocal section of the song, and Wetton claims that it got a \"cold reception\" from both Robert Fripp and Bill Bruford. Later, an introductory theme was written by Robert Fripp and performed on violin by [[David Cross (musician)|David Cross]], and two additional sections were added after the vocal, one being contributed by Bruford.<ref name=BoffomuInt>{{cite web |last1=Curtiss |first1=Ron |last2=Weiner |first2=Aaron |title=John Wetton (King Crimson, U.K., Asia): The Complete Boffomundo Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hcovFGVW44 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=3 March 2019 |date=June 3, 2016}} Event occurs at 5:15\u20137:01.</ref> The final section reprises various themes from earlier in the song, and it also re-uses a bass part which was originally written for the song \"Fracture\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dgmlive.com/tour-dates/295 |title=University of Texas Arlington |last=Smith |first=Sid |publisher=Discipline Global Mobile |website=DGM Live |access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> This early arrangement of \"Fracture\" can be heard on discs 1 and 25 of the ''[[Starless (box set)|Starless]]'' box set, as well as the standalone releases of their respective concerts.

This led to some occasional confusion amongst listeners about precisely what was being sung, particularly on the song \"One More Red Nightmare.\" The first printing of the lyrics would occur 26 years after the album's initial release, on the 2000 '30th Anniversary Edition' release.\n\nNear the conclusion of King Crimson's 1974 [[North America]]n tour, the decision was made to kick Cross out of the band. [[E.G. Records|EG]], the band's management, urged Fripp not to tell Cross until after the final date of the tour, but he would not be able to anyway; he would not return from the [[United States]] until after Cross would return to [[Europe]]. Fripp reached an agreement with EG that they would tell Cross, \"on proviso that [he] is told that I objected to not telling him personally.\" Despite reaching this agreement, Cross would not be told about the decision for him to leave the band until the day before the recording of ''Red'' began.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fripp |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Fripp |date=2013 |title=The Road To Red |chapter=Robert Fripp Diaries |pages=32 }}</ref> In his stead, the band brought back several contributors to past albums: [[Robin Miller (musician)|Robin Miller]] on [[oboe]], [[Marc Charig]] on [[cornet]], [[Ian McDonald (musician)|Ian McDonald]] and [[Mel Collins]] on [[saxophone]], as well as an uncredited [[cello|cellist]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dgmlive.com/in-depth/red-the-long-view|title=Red \u2013 The Long View|date=2016-11-03|work=DGM Live|access-date=2020-02-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Red'' sees King Crimson follow in the direction established by their previous two albums, ''[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]'' and ''Starless and Bible Black'', but in contrast to those albums, ''Red'' features more layered production with several [[guitar]] [[overdubs]] on certain tracks, as well as the return of earlier instrumentation such as saxophone. ''Red'' having a heavier tone was largely due to the [[rhythm section]] of John Wetton and Bill Bruford, which Fripp has referred to as \"the flying brick wall\".

In the United States, it reached No. 66 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. However, it remained a popular album with fans and critics.\n\nRetrospective reviews were resoundingly positive. In theirs, [[AllMusic]] declared ''Red'' to be weaker than its two predecessors, but nonetheless a superlative work: \"few intact groups could have gotten an album as good as ''Red'' together. The fact that it was put together by a band in its death throes makes it all the more impressive an achievement.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] also applauded the album, having been generally critical of the group's past work, calling it \"Grand, powerful, grating, and surprisingly lyrical\" and commenting that \"this does for classical-rock fusion what [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]'s ''[[Devotion (John McLaughlin album)|Devotion]]'' did for jazz-rock fusion.\"<ref name=\"CG\"/> ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' reviewer considered ''Red'' \"a walk down a lightless corridor and an unhappy and ferocious counterbalance to the frolics of King Crimson's beginnings\", and described it as \"dark, brooding and laden with heavily distorted sections and a decidedly melancholic vibe\".<ref name=\"classic\"/>\n\nLike most of King Crimson's catalogue, ''Red'' has been re-released numerous times since its release. First issued on CD in 1986, it has also been released as part of the Definitive Edition and 30th Anniversary Edition series. In 2009, ''Red'' was chosen, alongside ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' and ''[[Lizard (album)|Lizard]]'', to launch the 40th Anniversary Edition series. As part of this series, each album is presented in a CD/DVD-A package, with new [[stereo]] and [[surround|5.1 surround]] mixes. Unlike most others in series, however, ''Red'' launched with no new stereo mix. In 2013, Steven Wilson and Robert Fripp produced a stereo remix for ''[[The Road To Red]]'', and this mix was issued separately as part of a 2CD package.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2001, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] named ''Red'' as one of the \"50 Heaviest Albums of All Time\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage2.html#50+Heaviest|title=Rocklist.net...Q Magazine Lists|website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> and [[Kurt Cobain]] had reportedly cited the album as a major influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Robert_Fripp_in_Rock_and_Folk|title=Interview with Robert Fripp in Rock and Folk \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephant-talk.com/wiki/Interview_with_Bill_Bruford_in_Percussioni_(in_Italian)|title=Interview with Bill Bruford in Percussioni (in Italian) \u2013 ETWiki|website=Elephant-talk.com|accessdate=19 May 2018}}</ref> Musicologists Eric Tamm and Edward Macan both consider ''Red'', and particularly the track \"[[Starless]]\", to be the highlight of King Crimson's recorded output.\n\nThe title track was ranked number 87 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530224813/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/20947527/page/36 ''Rolling Stone'' \u2013 The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time].
