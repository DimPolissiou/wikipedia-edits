It is the first cat breed from [[Brazil]] to receive international recognition.\n\n==Description==\nThe Brazilian Shorthair is a medium-sized cat of great agility. The breed can be distinguished from the [[American Shorthair]] by its sleek and elegant appearance, though cats of the breed are not as thin as the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]]. The [[Cat coat genetics|coat]] is short and close to the skin and comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns. The space between the eyes should be equal to the size of one eye. Brazilian Shorthairs have dramatically expressive eyes. They are longer than they are tall. Males have bigger heads than females.\n\nThe Brazilian Shorthair Cat had its beginning when the engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi,{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} a cat breeder and founder of the first Cat Federation in Brazil and the first Cat Club in Rio de Janeiro,{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} had the idea to transform certain cats found in the streets of Brazil into a purebred cat. He focused on the Iberian Peninsula cats, brought to Brazil by the Portuguese in their ships around 1500 A.D.  From North to South of Brazil, commissions were created by Dr. Paulo Ruschi to study this animal in all of the country's parks and streets.{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} After long years of experimental breeding program led by traditional breeders, the Brazilian Shorthair was finally approved by the World Cat Federation, with headquarters in Germany, as a Pure Breed cat. Nowadays, the Brazilian Shorthair cat can participate in contests all over the world.\n\n==Appearance==\nThey have medium-sized and muscular bodies. The tail should not be broad at the base, and should slightly taper in the tip. Brazilian Shorthair cats have a slightly curved profile and large, pointed ears, and large, rounded eyes with colour that resembles the coat's colour. The coat is very short, silky and glossy and with no undercoat. Minimal brushing is required. Almost all colours are possible. eto sex\n\n==Temperament==\nThe Brazilian Shorthair is viable as an indoor as well as an outdoor cat, and is keen on human contact. They are very playful as a kitten. As they get older, they sober up a little, though they stay fairly active.\n\n==Origin==\nIts origins can be traced back to the streets of Brazil. Since going from a [[feral cat]] to a purebred, this breed has changed dramatically. This is not the first breed to be developed from street cats, as the [[American Shorthair]], [[European Shorthair]], and [[American Keuda]] all show.\n\nIn 1500 A.D., when the Portuguese arrived in Brazil for the first time, they brought with them felines descended from the Felis Iberia to protect food from rodents. Those cats represent the founding lineage of the beautiful, loving, healthy Brazilian Shorthair purebred cat.\n\n==History==\nThe breed had developed without rules or special cares; until, in the 1980s, Brazilian-born engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi,{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} a cat breeder currently living in New York City, started to settle the rules for the breed after deciding to study genetic and morphological aspects of the cats running in parks, gardens and streets of several cities in Brazil. He noticed that the country had unique cats, and yet, that those street cats had the same appearance and features. Those are the characteristics that define the Brazilian Shorthair cat. In 1998 the World Cat Federation, the largest Cat Federation in the world, gave a status of \"approved breed\" to the first and only Brazilian Recognized Purebred Cat, now with more than 10 generations of pedigreed cats.\n\n==Breeders==\n{{Off topic|date=August 2017}}\nEngineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} was the founder of the first Brazilian Cat Federation, known as FBG - Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira do Gato; founder of the first cat club in Rio de Janeiro, then named Clube Brasileiro do Gato do Rio de Janeiro; and the founder of 7 other cat clubs in Brazil. In 1988, Paulo Samuel Ruschi and his friend Anneliese Hackmann,{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} from Germany, founded the WCF \u2013 World Cat Federation, at the time consisting solely of clubs created by the two of them, but now the largest federation in the world. The Brazilian Shorthair project is managed by the BSICS \u2013 Brazilian Shorthair International Cat Society, which has headquarters in New York City and is member of the WCF (whose President is Paulo Samuel Ruschi).{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}}\n\nSeveral Brazilian Shorthair breeders have taken Paulo's creation {{dubious|date=August 2017}} to pursue the dream - now reality - of the unique Brazilian Shorthair as a purebred cat.

It is the first cat breed from [[Brazil]] to receive international recognition.\n\n==Description==\nThe Brazilian Shorthair is a medium-sized cat of great agility. The breed can be distinguished from the [[American Shorthair]] by its sleek and elegant appearance, though cats of the breed are not as thin as the [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]]. The [[Cat coat genetics|coat]] is short and close to the skin and comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns. The space between the eyes should be equal to the size of one eye. Brazilian Shorthairs have dramatically expressive eyes. They are longer than they are tall. Males have bigger heads than females.\n\nThe Brazilian Shorthair Cat had its beginning when the engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi,{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} a cat breeder and founder of the first Cat Federation in Brazil and the first Cat Club in Rio de Janeiro,{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} had the idea to transform certain cats found in the streets of Brazil into a purebred cat. He focused on the Iberian Peninsula cats, brought to Brazil by the Portuguese in their ships around 1500 A.D.  From North to South of Brazil, commissions were created by Dr. Paulo Ruschi to study this animal in all of the country's parks and streets.{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} After long years of experimental breeding program led by traditional breeders, the Brazilian Shorthair was finally approved by the World Cat Federation, with headquarters in Germany, as a Pure Breed cat. Nowadays, the Brazilian Shorthair cat can participate in contests all over the world.\n\n==Appearance==\nThey have medium-sized and muscular bodies. The tail should not be broad at the base, and should slightly taper in the tip. Brazilian Shorthair cats have a slightly curved profile and large, pointed ears, and large, rounded eyes with colour that resembles the coat's colour. The coat is very short, silky and glossy and with no undercoat. Minimal brushing is required. Almost all colours are possible.\n\n==Temperament==\nThe Brazilian Shorthair is viable as an indoor as well as an outdoor cat, and is keen on human contact. They are very playful as a kitten. As they get older, they sober up a little, though they stay fairly active.\n\n==Origin==\nIts origins can be traced back to the streets of Brazil. Since going from a [[feral cat]] to a purebred, this breed has changed dramatically. This is not the first breed to be developed from street cats, as the [[American Shorthair]], [[European Shorthair]], and [[American Keuda]] all show.\n\nIn 1500 A.D., when the Portuguese arrived in Brazil for the first time, they brought with them felines descended from the Felis Iberia to protect food from rodents. Those cats represent the founding lineage of the beautiful, loving, healthy Brazilian Shorthair purebred cat.\n\n==History==\nThe breed had developed without rules or special cares; until, in the 1980s, Brazilian-born engineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi,{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} a cat breeder currently living in New York City, started to settle the rules for the breed after deciding to study genetic and morphological aspects of the cats running in parks, gardens and streets of several cities in Brazil. He noticed that the country had unique cats, and yet, that those street cats had the same appearance and features. Those are the characteristics that define the Brazilian Shorthair cat. In 1998 the World Cat Federation, the largest Cat Federation in the world, gave a status of \"approved breed\" to the first and only Brazilian Recognized Purebred Cat, now with more than 10 generations of pedigreed cats.\n\n==Breeders==\n{{Off topic|date=August 2017}}\nEngineer Paulo Samuel Ruschi{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}} was the founder of the first Brazilian Cat Federation, known as FBG - Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira do Gato; founder of the first cat club in Rio de Janeiro, then named Clube Brasileiro do Gato do Rio de Janeiro; and the founder of 7 other cat clubs in Brazil. In 1988, Paulo Samuel Ruschi and his friend Anneliese Hackmann,{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} from Germany, founded the WCF \u2013 World Cat Federation, at the time consisting solely of clubs created by the two of them, but now the largest federation in the world. The Brazilian Shorthair project is managed by the BSICS \u2013 Brazilian Shorthair International Cat Society, which has headquarters in New York City and is member of the WCF (whose President is Paulo Samuel Ruschi).{{Citation needed|reason=There is no reference whatsoever on the internet about this person, or in Brazilian security number system|date=August 2017}}\n\nSeveral Brazilian Shorthair breeders have taken Paulo's creation {{dubious|date=August 2017}} to pursue the dream - now reality - of the unique Brazilian Shorthair as a purebred cat. One of the most important of those breeders is Mrs. Sylvia Roriz de Carvalho, a well-known veterinarian, painter and cat breeder, whose Cattery Syarte has been breeding the Brazilian Shorthair for more than a decade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Several other breeders followed in her footsteps.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Now, in all WCF Cat Shows in Brazil, one can see Brazilian Shorthairs whose lineage traces back to several generations - not from feral cats anymore - competing side by side  with other well-known breeds.
