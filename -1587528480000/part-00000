Not only was there nowhere near enough time to find a big-name coach, but [[National Signing Day]] was only three weeks away. Broyles persuaded [[Jack Crowe]], who had just come to Fayetteville as offensive coordinator, to drop his initial plans to follow Hatfield to Clemson and take over as head coach of the Razorbacks. The decision came as something of a surprise, since Crowe had only won five games in two seasons at [[University of West Alabama|Livingston University]] in the late 1970s.  By the start of the season, the Razorbacks had seen [[Barry Foster (American football)|Barry Foster]] give up his senior season to enter the [[1990 NFL Draft]] and had lost numerous other players to disciplinary and academic problems. Under the circumstances, the Razorbacks struggled to a 3-8 record\u2013their first losing season since 1967, and only their fifth sub-.500 record since the 1950s. They barely qualified for a bowl in 1991.<ref name=SI />\n\nThe Razorbacks opened the 1992 season\u2014their first in the [[Southeastern Conference]]\u2014with an upset loss to a [[Division I-AA]] team, [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]]. The next day, Broyles announced that Crowe had resigned and that defensive coordinator [[Joe Kines]] would coach the Razorbacks for the rest of the season.<ref name=\"CroweResign\">{{cite news |title=Kines will replace Crowe at Arkansas |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PPceAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XdgEAAAAIBAJ&dq=jack-crowe&pg=1660%2C1089412 |newspaper=The Gadsden Times |page=B1 |date=September 7, 1992 |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref>  However, Crowe's lawyer subsequently told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that Crowe had been fired, and Broyles admitted that he'd fired Crowe due to concern that the fans no longer had confidence in him.<ref name=SI />  He finished 9-15 in two seasons and one game in Fayetteville.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/jack-crowe-1.html|title=Jack Crowe Coaching Record|website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Danny Ford era (1993\u20131997) ===\nJoe Kines brought [[Danny Ford]] to Arkansas in 1992 to help with the clean-up following [[Frank Broyles]]' firing of [[Jack Crowe]] (Ford's former offensive coordinator at Clemson) after a loss to [[The Citadel (military college)|the Citadel]]. This immediately led to speculation that Ford would be named head coach on a permanent basis.  The speculation bore fruit after the season, when Ford was named head coach. He led Arkansas to an SEC West championship in 1995 on the legs of [[Madre Hill]] and the defensive genius of [[Joe Lee Dunn]], after emerging from two years under Crowe. However, this was one of only two winning seasons the Razorbacks notched in Ford's tenure. Broyles fired Ford following back-to-back 4\u20137 campaigns. Ford finished 26\u201330\u20131 in five seasons with the Razorbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/danny-ford-1.html|title=Danny Ford Coaching Record|website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was ironic that Ford ended up at Arkansas, since his replacement at Clemson was former Razorback head coach [[Ken Hatfield]], who had had his own falling out with Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles. Hatfield took the Clemson job in January 1990, less than a week after Ford resigned, without even visiting the campus.\n\nFord proved to be a solid recruiter, as his replacement at Arkansas, [[Houston Nutt]], went on to win 17 games in the 1998 (9-3) and 1999 (8-4) seasons combined, to include a 1998 SEC West co-championship and a Cotton Bowl championship on January 1, 2000 with a victory over Texas.

The Razorbacks started the season losing 50\u201314, at a home game in Fayetteville, to [[2006 USC Trojans football team|USC]]. Following the loss to the Trojans, Nutt announced that Mustain would replace Robert Johnson as the Hogs' starting quarterback.  Mustain led Arkansas to eight straight wins, including wins against No. 22 [[2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] at home and No. 2 [[2006 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] at Auburn, before losing the starting job to Casey Dick. Dick had been slotted to start at the beginning of the season but was unable to do so due to a back injury suffered in the spring. Dick led the Razorbacks to two victories out of four for a total of 10 wins, including a win over No. 13 Tennessee. The Razorbacks moved to No. 7 in the BCS standings. However, the Hogs lost their last regular season game to the No. 8 [[2006 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]], 31\u201326. Despite the loss, the Hogs were still Western Division Champions of the SEC, and played the 11\u20131, fourth-ranked [[2006 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] for the SEC Championship.

In addition to several occasional years of playing each other, the two teams played each other from 1940\u201347 and 1952\u201362 on an annual basis. The Razorbacks and Rebels also met twice in the [[Sugar Bowl]] played in [[New Orleans]], in 1963 and 1970. Since 1981, the two teams have played each other annually in football. In 2001, Arkansas and Ole Miss had an NCAA record seven-overtime game in Oxford, Mississippi.  The amount of overtimes has since been tied, but has not yet been beaten. (Arkansas won by a final score of 58\u201356) The recent Houston Nutt [[Arkansas\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry#Houston Nutt controversy|controversies and departure to Ole Miss]] has added to and heightened the long-standing rivalry between the schools.

Arkansas has had 47 All-Americans (24 consensus) in its history.<ref name=\"Ark All-American\">{{cite web|title=History, Honors and Letterman |url=http://www.hogwired.com/pdf3/80885.pdf?ATCLID=1147378&SPSID=30726&SPID=2419&DB_OEM_ID=6100 |publisher=Hogwired |accessdate=2008-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517160349/http://www.hogwired.com/pdf3/80885.pdf?ATCLID=1147378&SPSID=30726&SPID=2419&DB_OEM_ID=6100 |archivedate=May 17, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"Consensus 1937\u20131976\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall2 |title=Consensus Football All-America Teams from 1937 through 1976 |work=HickokSports.com |author=Hickok, Ralph |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122634/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall2 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"Consensus 1977\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall3.shtml |title=Consensus Football All-America Teams from 1977 through 2002 |author=Hickok, Ralph |date=2008-01-12 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=Hickoksports.com |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223154335/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall3.shtml |archivedate=February 23, 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Please keep names in alphabetical order by last name.

Not only was there nowhere near enough time to find a big-name coach, but [[National Signing Day]] was only three weeks away. Broyles persuaded [[Jack Crowe]], who had just come to Fayetteville as offensive coordinator, to drop his initial plans to follow Hatfield to Clemson and take over as head coach of the Razorbacks. The decision came as something of a surprise, since Crowe had only won five games in two seasons at [[University of West Alabama|Livingston University]] in the late 1970s.  By the start of the season, the Razorbacks had seen [[Barry Foster (American football)|Barry Foster]] give up his senior season to enter the [[1990 NFL Draft]] and had lost numerous other players to disciplinary and academic problems. Under the circumstances, the Razorbacks struggled to a 3-8 record\u2013their first losing season since 1967, and only their fifth sub-.500 record since the 1950s. They barely qualified for a bowl in 1991.<ref name=SI />\n\nThe Razorbacks opened the 1992 season\u2014their first in the [[Southeastern Conference]]\u2014with an upset loss to a [[Division I-AA]] team, [[The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina|The Citadel]]. The next day, Broyles announced that Crowe had resigned and that defensive coordinator [[Joe Kines]] would coach the Razorbacks for the rest of the season.<ref name=\"CroweResign\">{{cite news |title=Kines will replace Crowe at Arkansas |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PPceAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XdgEAAAAIBAJ&dq=jack-crowe&pg=1660%2C1089412 |newspaper=The Gadsden Times |page=B1 |date=September 7, 1992 |accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref>  However, Crowe's lawyer subsequently told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that Crowe had been fired, and Broyles admitted that he'd fired Crowe due to concern that the fans no longer had confidence in him.<ref name=SI />  He finished 9-15 in two seasons and one game in Fayetteville.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/jack-crowe-1.html|title=Jack Crowe Coaching Record|website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Danny Ford era (1993\u20131997) ===\nJoe Kines brought [[Danny Ford]] to Arkansas in 1992 to help with the clean-up following [[Frank Broyles]]' firing of [[Jack Crowe]] (Ford's former offensive coordinator at Clemson) after a loss to [[The Citadel (military college)|the Citadel]]. This immediately led to speculation that Ford would be named head coach on a permanent basis.  The speculation bore fruit after the season, when Ford was named head coach. He led Arkansas to an SEC West championship in 1995 on the legs of [[Madre Hill]] and the defensive genius of [[Joe Lee Dunn]], after emerging from two years under Crowe. However, this was one of only two winning seasons the Razorbacks notched in Ford's tenure. Broyles fired Ford following back-to-back 4\u20137 campaigns. Ford finished 26\u201330\u20131 in five seasons with the Razorbacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/coaches/danny-ford-1.html|title=Danny Ford Coaching Record|website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was ironic that Ford ended up at Arkansas, since his replacement at Clemson was former Razorback head coach [[Ken Hatfield]], who had had his own falling out with Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles. Hatfield took the Clemson job in January 1990, less than a week after Ford resigned, without even visiting the campus.\n\nFord proved to be a solid recruiter, as his replacement at Arkansas, [[Houston Nutt]], went on to win 17 games in the 1998 (9-3) and 1999 (8-4) seasons combined, to include a 1998 SEC West co-championship and a Cotton Bowl championship on January 1, 2000 with a victory over Texas.

The Razorbacks started the season losing 50\u201314, at a home game in Fayetteville, to [[2006 USC Trojans football team|USC]]. Following the loss to the Trojans, Nutt announced that Mustain would replace Robert Johnson as the Hogs' starting quarterback.  Mustain led Arkansas to eight straight wins, including wins against No. 22 [[2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] at home and No. 2 [[2006 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] at Auburn, before losing the starting job to Casey Dick. Dick had been slotted to start at the beginning of the season but was unable to do so due to a back injury suffered in the spring. Dick led the Razorbacks to two victories out of four for a total of 10 wins, including a win over No. 13 Tennessee. The Razorbacks moved to No. 7 in the BCS standings. However, the Hogs lost their last regular season game to the No. 8 [[2006 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]], 31\u201326. Despite the loss, the Hogs were still Western Division Champions of the SEC, and played the 11\u20131, fourth-ranked [[2006 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] for the SEC Championship.

In addition to several occasional years of playing each other, the two teams played each other from 1940\u201347 and 1952\u201362 on an annual basis. The Razorbacks and Rebels also met twice in the [[Sugar Bowl]] played in [[New Orleans]], in 1963 and 1970. Since 1981, the two teams have played each other annually in football. In 2001, Arkansas and Ole Miss had an NCAA record seven-overtime game in Oxford, Mississippi.  The amount of overtimes has since been tied, but has not yet been beaten. (Arkansas won by a final score of 58\u201356) The recent Houston Nutt [[Arkansas\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry#Houston Nutt controversy|controversies and departure to Ole Miss]] has added to and heightened the long-standing rivalry between the schools.

Arkansas has had 47 All-Americans (24 consensus) in its history.<ref name=\"Ark All-American\">{{cite web|title=History, Honors and Letterman |url=http://www.hogwired.com/pdf3/80885.pdf?ATCLID=1147378&SPSID=30726&SPID=2419&DB_OEM_ID=6100 |publisher=Hogwired |accessdate=2008-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517160349/http://www.hogwired.com/pdf3/80885.pdf?ATCLID=1147378&SPSID=30726&SPID=2419&DB_OEM_ID=6100 |archivedate=May 17, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"Consensus 1937\u20131976\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall2 |title=Consensus Football All-America Teams from 1937 through 1976 |work=HickokSports.com |author=Hickok, Ralph |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122634/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall2 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"Consensus 1977\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall3.shtml |title=Consensus Football All-America Teams from 1977 through 2002 |author=Hickok, Ralph |date=2008-01-12 |accessdate=2008-01-13 |work=Hickoksports.com |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223154335/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/footall3.shtml |archivedate=February 23, 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Please keep names in alphabetical order by last name.

[[Turquoise]] is the colour of monarchists.]]\n'''Iranian monarchism''' is the advocacy of restoring the [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[Iran]], which was abolished after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Revolution]].\n\n==Historical background==\nIran first became a constitutional monarchy in 1906, but underwent a period of autocracy during the years 1925&ndash;1941, after which the [[Majles of Iran|Iranian National Assembly]] was restored to power. During the years 1941 to 1953, Iran remained a constitutional monarchy and active [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] retaining extensive legal executive powers.\n\nIn March 15, 1951, the National Assembly, led by Prime Minister [[Hossein Ala]], unanimously voted to nationalize the oil industry, which at the time was dominated by the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (now [[BP]]). In 1953, the British [[MI6]] and American [[CIA]] orchestrated a coup against [[Mohammed Mossadegh]]'s government. Agents fueled rumors that the republican-minded Mossadegh was planning on abolishing the monarchy and declaring himself President of a new Republic of Iran, leading to a pro-monarchist backlash from the public and leading to a successful result in the coup against the prime minister.\n\nThe Shah, who had gone into exile during the coup, returned to Iran and named General [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] as the new prime minister. Many contemporary sources attribute the coup, or counter [[coup]], entirely to the [[United States|U.S.]] American [[CIA]] ([[CIA]] [[Coup]]) and agents of the British [[MI6]] who are reported to have organized and paid for it.<ref>Kinzer, Stephen, ''All the Shah's Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror'', Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.5, 6, 210</ref>   These sources point to many other coups in which the CIA was instrumental, such as those in Congo (1964), Chile (1973), and Algeria (1991). Monarchists, however, argue that the counter-coup was in fact a popular uprising, and that the foreign intelligence agencies' undeniable involvement was peripheral. At least some historians argue the coup could not have taken place without both CIA organizing and Iranian support.<ref>Keddie, Nikki R., Roots of Revolution, Yale University Press, 1981, p.140</ref><ref>Kinzer, Stephen, ''All the Shah's Men : An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror'', Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p.211</ref>\n\nAfterwards, the era of constitutional monarchy gradually came to an end as the Shah increasingly exercised his executive powers unilaterally, thus leading towards the development of autocracy. By the early 1970s, with most political parties having been banned, Iran had effectively become a one-party state under [[Rastakhiz Party|Rastakhiz]]. [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] leaders like [[Karim Sanjabi]] and moderate traditional Islamic leaders like [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] continued to espouse a constitutional monarchy.\n[[File:Mohammad Pahlavi Coronation.jpg|thumb|Imperial family of Iran at the coronation of Shah Mohammad Reza in 1967]]\nUnder increasing international pressure, particularly from President [[Jimmy Carter]] of the United States, the Shah pushed forward major democratic reforms in the late 1970s, designed to gradually restore the constitutional monarchy as it had originally been. However, several uprisings in 1978 and 1979 culminated in the Shah, who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and had kept the fact secret, to leave the country with his family to seek treatment overseas. Within several days the Shah's government had effectively collapsed and the Second Revolution had begun. The new provisional revolutionary government officially abolished the monarchy and declared Iran to be a republic. The following year, in 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran was established under the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leadership]] of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]].\n\nIn the months following the Revolution, former Field Marshal of the Imperial Armed Forces [[Bahram Aryana]] organized a counter-revolution in exile. Based in [[Paris]], [[France]], with other military officials of the Imperial Armed Forces and Prince [[Shahriar Shafiq]], he established [[Iran Liberation Army|Azadegan]], a paramilitary resistance intended to help restore the constitutional monarchy. Fearing a growing counter-revolution, Prince Shahriar was assassinated in Paris in December 1979 by Khomeinist agents, which was a major setback for the monarchist resistance. Despite a number of successful operations which garnered international media attention in 1980 and 1981, the outbreak of war between Iran and [[Iraq]] officially brought any hope for counter-revolution to an end.\n\nIn the 1990s and the decade following 2000, the Shah's reputation has staged something of a revival, with many Iranians looking back on his era as a time when Iran was more prosperous<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton (2005), p.74</ref><ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iran/2004/5-020204.htm Iran Report] 2 February 2004</ref> and the government less oppressive.<ref>Sciolino, Elaine, ''Persian Mirrors,'' Touchstone, (2000), p.239, 244</ref> Journalist [[Afshin Molavi]] reports even members of the uneducated poor - traditionally core supporters of the revolution that overthrew the Shah - making remarks such as 'God bless the Shah's soul, the economy was better then;' and finds that \"books about the former Shah (even censored ones) sell briskly,\" while \"books of the Rightly Guided Path sit idle.\"<ref>Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton (2005), p.74, 10</ref>\n\n==Monarchist parties==\nMonarchist parties and organizations are strictly prohibited by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and monarchists and their sympathizers are subject to imprisonment if discovered.
