The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] (\"Hill of the Angels\"), a site traditionally considered to be the geographical center of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], also lies within the municipal limits.<ref name=\"cerro\">{{cite web |url= http://www.cerrodelosangeles.es/|title= Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles (Official website)|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=es}}</ref> Getafe is located 13&nbsp;km south of [[Madrid]]'s city centre, within a flat area of Spain's [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]] in the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares River]] basin.\n\nGetafe's proximity to central Madrid fostered industrial development during the 20th and 21st centuries. The city's industrialisation in turn led to an increase in population, reaching 170,115 in 2011. Due to its industrial and social networks, the majority of residents work or study within the city. Getafe hosts an [[Airbus]] factory. The increase in population led to the construction of numerous access roads, an increase in available public services, and the creation of new neighborhoods at the end of the 20th century.\n\n== Etymology ==\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], a number of villages were located in the present-day area of Getafe. One of the main villages was Alarnes, which was very close to the current urban center. In 1326, the villagers united themselves into one town, situated on the royal road that linked Madrid with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. This new town was called ''Xatafi,'' a name which came from the Arab word ''jata'' (\"something long\"). It is assumed that the name ''Xatafi'' referred to the royal road, which also served as the town's main street. The town's name evolved over time, from ''Xetafe'' to ''Jetafee'' to ''Jetaphe'' to ''Jetafe'' to ''Getafe.''\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Vista de Getafe (1878).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Engraving]] of Getafe from the 19th century.]]\nThe history of Getafe can be split into three clearly defined eras. In the first era, which lasted from Prehistory until 1326, there existed distinct villages in the area, though Getafe itself did not exist as a municipality. The second era lasted from the 14th century until the 20th century, during which Getafe was established as a town and developed slowly. In the third era, which began in the 20th century and continues to the present day, Getafe changed in nature from a small agricultural town to a large industrial city, with a noticeable increase in commerce, industry, population and size.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |title=Historia de Getafe |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303230826/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Villa-romana-getafe.JPG|thumb|230px|Ruins of the Roman villa of La Torrecilla.]]\nThe presence of humans in the area of Getafe dates back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period (before 100,000 BCE). Various [[stone tools]], pots, and bracelets from this period have been excavated from the banks of the Manzanares River.\n\nThe Romans dominated the Iberian Peninsula from the 2nd century BCE until the 5th century AD. In the 3rd century AD, the Romans constructed a villa called La Torecilla, whose ruins are still visible on the banks of the Manzanares River. The area was subsequently overrun by a series of [[Germanic tribes]], including [[Suebi]], [[Vandals]] and [[Visigoths]], and the Indoeuropean [[Alans]].\n\nThe area currently encompassed by the Getafe municipal district was invaded by the [[Moors]] in the 8th century. King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] conquered the villages of the area in 1085. In 1326, the inhabitants of the villages moved closer to the royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo, in effect creating a new town, Getafe. In that same century, the primitive hermitage of La Magdalena was built, only to be destroyed several centuries later.\n\n=== Contemporary age ===\n[[File:Getafe-sigloxvii.JPG|thumb|190px|left|Map of 17th century Getafe.]]\nIn 1492, famine and disease devastated Getafe, prompting the construction of the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 in 1529. In 1549, the architect [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] began building the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Magdalena, which has since become the Cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Getafe|Diocese of Getafe]]. The church was built on the foundation of the old hermitage, and in 1610 a new hermitage was built on the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. The college of the Escuelas P\u00edas was founded in 1737. In 1763, King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered the construction of a new road connecting Madrid to [[Aranjuez]] and, further on, to [[C\u00e1diz]], which passed along the foot of the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. Napoleonic troops occupied Getafe from 1808 to 1812. A train line connecting Madrid to Aranjuez, and passing through Getafe, was inaugurated in 1851.\n\n=== Modern age ===\n[[File:Gran-teatro-getafe.JPG|thumb|165px|Getafe's Gran Teatro (''Great Theater'') at the end of the 19th century.]]\nElectric street lights were lit for the first time in Getafe on 22 December 1897. The Getafe Air Force Base was permanently established in 1911, followed by the School of Civil Aviation two years later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] inaugurated the first monument to the [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus on the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] on 30 May 1919. In 1924, [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas S.A.]] built its first factory in the area. That same year, [[Juan de la Cierva]]'s [[autogyro]] was flown for the first time from the air force base.\n\nDue to its proximity to Madrid, Getafe underwent an industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in the city's conversion from agricultural city to industrial city. Industrialization also prompted a rapid boom in population, starting in the 1950s. In 1956, [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] established a factory in Getafe, and a year later, [[Siemens AG]] followed suit. The city was forced to create the neighborhoods of San Isidro, El Bercial, Juan de la Cierva, and [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]] in the 1970s in order to support these new industries.\n\nIn 1961, the [[Canal de Isabel II]] began to provide water to Getafe. The first local democratic elections occurred in 1979, after the ratification of the Constitution in 1978. In 1989, the [[Universidad Carlos III]] was founded. The Sector III neighbourhood was constructed between 1979 and 1988; the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built during the late 1990s; the El Bercial neighbourhood is currently being expanded. In April 2003, Madrid Metro System's [[Line 12 (Madrid Metro)|Line 12]] opened, linking the Madrid region's southern population centres with the capital.\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Getafe is divided vertically into two equal halves that represent the two most important characteristics of the municipal district. The left half contains a heart in the center of a [[Latin cross]], representing the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]\u2014a reference to the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]]. The right half contains a repeated pattern of airplanes representing the aeronautical tradition of the area and referencing the nearby Air Force Base. The [[Royal Spanish Crown]] tops the coat of arms, and symbolizes Getafe's loyalty to the Spanish monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |title=Getafe es As\u00ed |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055541/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n== Politics and government ==\nThe current mayor of Getafe is Sara Hern\u00e1ndez Barroso, socialist, thanks to the support of left wing group [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU) and a political platform close to [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] called 'Ahora Getafe'. In 2011, Juan Soler-Espiauba Gallo, of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), was elected mayor and displaced the incumbent, a socialist, who had held this post since 1983. The most popular political parties in the area, other than the PSOE, are the [[People's Party (Spain)|Peoples' Party]] (PP) and the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU). Getafe has always had a large working population, and left-wing groups, especially the PSOE, have traditionally been very influential.\n\nIn the [[Spanish regional elections, 2007|2007 Spanish regional elections]], the PSOE elected 13 town councillors (44.18% of the vote), PP, 11 (36.09%), and IU 3, (11.73%).<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ Resultados de las elecciones municipales de 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531083056/http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ |date=2007-05-31 }}</ref> Other political associations were not able to muster enough votes to receive representation. Local elections occur every four years, along with the autonomous election. \n\nIn the last Spanish General elections celebrated in 2015, PP obtained 25,65% of the vote, very close to Podemos (24,72%) and PSOE (22,60%). Ciudadanos obtained 16,54% of the vote and IU 7,07%.\n\nCabinet meetings are composed of nine councillors: eight from the PSOE and one from IU. The Municipal Corporation is made up of 27 members, detailed previously. The cabinet is presided over by the mayor. The Getafe city council is divided into a number of different focus groups: treasury, wealth, and social security; equality; urbanism; civil action; and management of waste disposal, cleanliness, the environment, and the home. The council holds sessions every month, in addition to frequently held special sessions, in which councillors debate various topics and problems which affect the municipality.\n\nGetafe is at the forefront of the struggle for workers rights in local industry. The most important trade unions in the city are the [[Workers' Commissions]] (CCOO) and the [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] (UGT). Both unions have branch offices in Getafe and list many local workers as members.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Physical location ===\n[[File:Cerro-buenavista.JPG|thumb|220px|Cerro Buenavista, or ''Buenavista hill'', the area of highest elevation in the Getafe municipality at 704 meters (2309 ft). There is a deposit of water on the summit of the hill from the canal of Isabel II.]]\n[[File:Cerro-angeles.JPG|thumb|right|Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]]\nGetafe is located in the southern zone of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]], Spain, in southwestern Europe. It is physically located in the centre of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], north of the Southern Submeseta (part of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]]), in the Manzanares River basin. Its elevation is 610 \u2013 640 meters above sea level (2000\u20132100&nbsp;feet). Its coordinates are 40\u00b0 18' N 3\u00b0 43' W. The municipal district is 78.74&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with a perimeter of 46.5&nbsp;km. The easternmost part of the municipal district is located within the [[Parque Regional del Sureste]], a protected forest region.\n\n==== Distances ====\nDue to its central location within the Iberian Peninsula, Getafe is no more than 725.6&nbsp;km from any Spanish provincial capital in mainland Spain. The following are the distances to a few major cities, the oceans which surround the Spanish coasts, and the national borders of Portugal and France.\n<center>\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|\n*[[Puerta del Sol]] of [[Madrid]]: 13&nbsp;km\n*[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]: 59&nbsp;km (capital of the nearest [[Provinces of Spain|province]] other than Madrid)\n*[[Girona]]: 725,6&nbsp;km (capital of the furthest province on the mainland)\n*Center of [[Legan\u00e9s]] (adjacent municipality): 4,3&nbsp;km\n*[[Fuenlabrada]] (adjacent municipality): 7,5&nbsp;km\n*[[Parla]] (adjacent municipality): 8&nbsp;km\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n*[[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]): 348&nbsp;km\n*[[Bay of Biscay]] ([[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]): 398&nbsp;km\n*[[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[C\u00e1diz]]): 640&nbsp;km\n*[[Portugal|Portuguese]] Border: 402&nbsp;km\n*[[Francia|French]] Border: 510&nbsp;km\n|}</center>\n\n=== Relief ===\n[[File:Manzanares-rio.JPG|thumb|205px|left|The bank of the Manzanares River. This is the area with the lowest elevation in the province of Madrid (540 m; 1772 ft).]]\nThe municipal district is mostly flat, with a minor inclination of 5% to the east and an elevation of 631&nbsp;m (2070&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The lowest altitude can be found to the extreme east, at the Manzanares River at 540&nbsp;m (1772&nbsp;ft). The highest elevation is found on the extreme west, on Buenavista, a 704&nbsp;m (2310&nbsp;ft) hill which sits on the border between the municipalities of Getafe and [[Legan\u00e9s]], some 12&nbsp;km South of Madrid. The hilliest area, the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, is located in the Southeast and has a maximum elevation of 698&nbsp;m (2290&nbsp;ft). In the center of Getafe is the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, or ''hill of angels'' (670 m; 2198&nbsp;ft).  Pine forests have been planted at the feet of these hills to deter the erosion of the soil.\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n[[File:Lagunas de Perales.jpg|thumb|210px|Lakes of Perales. Because so few remain, these four small lakes are protected.]]\n\nA number of rivers and other natural waterways pass through Getafe. 9.5&nbsp;km of the Manzanares River passes through the eastern-most parts of the municipal district. In the South, 16.5&nbsp;km of the Culebro Waterway winds its way across Getafe, and in the Southeast 2&nbsp;km of the Filipinas gully descent from the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa. There are two man-made canals, one on each side of the Manzanares River. These parallel canals provide water for cultivated land further from the river.\n\nThe lakes of Perals are 2&nbsp;km East of the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]], and are some of the only undisturbed natural lakes left in the region. For this reason, the lakes are part of a protected area to preserve their natural state.\n\nThe Culebra waterway and the Filipinas gully boast heavy water flow during the winter and little to none during the summer. In contrast, the Manzanares carries water year round. For that reason, Getafe is considered to be within the Manzanares [[river basin]], except for a small portion in the southeast which is part of the [[Jarama]] river basin.\n\n=== Borders ===\nThe city of Getafe borders the following municipalities: to the North, Madrid (city districts [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]] and [[Vallecas]]; to the East, [[Rivas Vaciamadrid]]; to the Southeast, [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]; to the South, [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]; to the Southwest, [[Fuenlabrada]]; to the West, [[Legan\u00e9s]].\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width =\"60%\" border = 2 align=\"center\"\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NW:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''N:'' [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NE:'' [[Vallecas]]\n|-----\n| width =\"10%\" align=\"center\" | ''W:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | '''Getafe'''\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''E:'' [[Rivas-Vaciamadrid]]\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SW'' [[Fuenlabrada]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''S:'' [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SE:'' [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]\n|}</center>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Getafe-nevado.jpg|thumb|230px|left|A park in Getafe on a snowy day.]]\nThe climate of Getafe is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]<ref>[http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 Valores clim\u00e1ticos normales de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095428/http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref> and is influenced by urban conditions. Winters are cool, with temperatures dropping below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (46.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) during the day, and frequently below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) at night. Getafe averages three to four snowfalls per year. Summers are very hot, with median temperatures above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (75.2&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July and August, and with maximum temperatures which often reach 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F). Daily temperatures oscillate within range of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (18&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nPrecipitations are regularly distributed throughout the year, excluding the dry summer months. The rainiest month is October, with 50&nbsp;mm  of rainfall, and the driest month is July, with only 9.4&nbsp;mm. Average yearly precipitation is around 365&nbsp;mm (17.52&nbsp;in).\n\nOne of the major problems of Getafe's climate is air pollution, which increases noticeably when the wind blows South or Southeast. The average annual temperature is 15&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the highest temperature on record listed at 41.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (106.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 24 July 1995, and the lowest temperature recorded at -12&nbsp;\u00b0C (10.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 5 February 1963. The average [[relative humidity]] is 71%, average pressure is 1,015.8 millibars, average number of daylight hours per year is 2,850, and the winds blow predominantly from the northeast.\n\nExtreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, never occur in Getafe thanks to its climate and geography. One common problem in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula is [[drought]], which occurs whenever precipitation ceases during various months.\n\n{{Weather box|location= Getafe (1981-2010) <small>(altitude: 620 m, [http://maps.google.es/?q=Est%3AGetafe%4040.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&t=p&ll=40.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&spn=0.182837%2C0.291824&z=11&output=embed satellite view])</small>\n|metric first= Y\n|single line= Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.8\n|Feb record high C = 23.0\n|Mar record high C = 29.0\n|Apr record high C = 30.7\n|May record high C = 36.2\n|Jun record high C = 40.6\n|Jul record high C = 41.6\n|Aug record high C = 40.6\n|Sep record high C = 40.0\n|Oct record high C = 32.0\n|Nov record high C = 25.2\n|Dec record high C = 21.8\n|year record high C = 41.6\n|Jan high C= 10.5\n|Feb high C= 12.7\n|Mar high C= 16.8\n|Apr high C= 18.6\n|May high C= 23.0\n|Jun high C= 29.3\n|Jul high C= 33.2\n|Aug high C= 32.5\n|Sep high C= 27.5\n|Oct high C= 20.6\n|Nov high C= 14.5\n|Dec high C= 10.7\n|year high C= 20.8\n|Jan mean C= 5.9\n|Feb mean C= 7.5\n|Mar mean C= 10.8\n|Apr mean C= 12.7\n|May mean C= 16.8\n|Jun mean C= 22.4\n|Jul mean C= 25.9\n|Aug mean C= 25.4\n|Sep mean C= 21.1\n|Oct mean C= 15.3\n|Nov mean C= 9.8\n|Dec mean C= 6.5\n|year mean C= 15.0\n|Jan low C= 1.2\n|Feb low C= 2.4\n|Mar low C= 4.9\n|Apr low C= 6.9\n|May low C= 10.5\n|Jun low C= 15.6\n|Jul low C= 18.5\n|Aug low C= 18.2\n|Sep low C= 14.6\n|Oct low C= 9.9\n|Nov low C= 5.0\n|Dec low C= 2.4\n|year low C= 9.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.0\n|Feb record low C = -12.0\n|Mar record low C = -6.2\n|Apr record low C = -2.6\n|May record low C = -1.0\n|Jun record low C = 4.2\n|Jul record low C = 8.2\n|Aug record low C = 7.2\n|Sep record low C = 3.6\n|Oct record low C = -2.0\n|Nov record low C = -5.4\n|Dec record low C = -10.0\n|year record low C = -12.0\n|Jan precipitation mm= 30\n|Feb precipitation mm= 32\n|Mar precipitation mm= 24\n|Apr precipitation mm= 38\n|May precipitation mm= 39\n|Jun precipitation mm= 19\n|Jul precipitation mm= 9\n|Aug precipitation mm= 9\n|Sep precipitation mm= 22\n|Oct precipitation mm= 50\n|Nov precipitation mm= 48\n|Dec precipitation mm= 45\n|year precipitation mm= 365\n|Jan precipitation days= 6\n|Feb precipitation days= 5\n|Mar precipitation days= 4\n|Apr precipitation days= 7\n|May precipitation days= 6\n|Jun precipitation days= 3\n|Jul precipitation days= 1\n|Aug precipitation days= 2\n|Sep precipitation days= 3\n|Oct precipitation days= 7\n|Nov precipitation days= 6\n|Dec precipitation days= 7\n|year precipitation days= 56\n|unit precipitation days= 1&nbsp;mm\n|Jan sun= 150\n|Feb sun= 172\n|Mar sun= 222\n|Apr sun= 237\n|May sun= 279\n|Jun sun= 326\n|Jul sun= 368\n|Aug sun= 339\n|Sep sun= 256\n|Oct sun= 202\n|Nov sun= 152\n|Dec sun= 124\n|year sun= 2850\n|source 1= [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]]<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |title       = Gu\u00eda resumida del clima en Espa\u00f1a (1981-2010)\n |publisher   = AEMet\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130526104145/http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |archivedate = 2013-05-26\n}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Flora and Fauna ===\n[[File:Campo-getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] from the middle of the eastern municipal border. Visible are pine trees, olive trees, and extensive wheat fields.]]\n\nThe native vegetation of Getafe is characteristic of the [[mediterranean forest]] biome, consisting mostly of [[Holm Oak|holm]] and [[Cork Oak|cork oaks]]. Native flowering plants include those of the genus ''[[Cistus]]'' and the [[common broom]] (''Cytisus scoparius''), though these species are not abundant. This native forest and underbrush only occupies 16% of the surface of the municipal territory, mostly in the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa and further east. The shores of the Manzanares River and Culebro Waterway contain deciduous trees and reeds.\n\nMost undeveloped land is devoted to the cultivation of cereals (mostly [[wheat]]), and, to a lesser extent, to gardens in the fertile lowlands of the Manzanares river. Some areas have been reforested with [[stone pine]]s (''Pinus pinea'') and [[aleppo pine]]s (''Pinus halepensis''). These areas include the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, the Prado Acedinos, part of the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, and part of the park in the Sector III neighborhood. Common trees in the parks and streets of the city are the [[horse chestnut]] (''Aesculus hippocastanum''), the [[acacia]], the [[elm]] (''Ulmus minor''), and the stone pine. Other less common trees include [[Cedar wood|cedars]], [[Cupressus|cypress]], aleppo pines, [[plum]] trees, [[Populus|poplars]], [[fir]] trees, and [[Arecaceae|palm trees]].\n\nA significant population of small birds live within the city proper, including [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s and [[Columbidae|pigeons]]. Larger birds, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, and weasels can be found in the more easterly parts of the municipality. The world's largest population of the [[Falco tinnunculus|common kestrel]] can be found in the Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood.\n\n== Town Planning  ==\n[[File:Getafe-norte.jpg|thumb|220px|Modern building in the Getafe Norte neighborhood.]]\nThe urban portions of Getafe are organised in an almost longitudinal manner, from northeast to southwest. Thus, the elongated shape of Getafe today is due primarily to the close proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which impedes city growth to the southeast. The most important streets of the city are Calle Madrid and Calle Toledo. These two roads are pedestrian through the center of Getafe, and are part of what was a royal road connecting Madrid and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] during the Middle Ages. Getafe has other important streets and avenues organizing its neighborhoods, such as the Avenida de Espa\u00f1a, Avenida de Los \u00c1ngeles, Avenida de las Ciudades, Avenida Juan Carlos I, and Calle Ferrocarril.\n\nThe popular architectural style in Getafe is generally characterised by two-story buildings with tile roofs, various small [[balcony|balconies]] on the second floor, and a bare brick fa\u00e7ade. These types of houses can be found in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood, though their numbers are decreasing as existing houses are vacated and demolished to make room for new townhouse developments. The average height of buildings in Getafe is five floors, approximately  60 feet (17 metres). This peculiarity is due to the proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which places limits on the height of buildings. Few buildings in Getafe surpass eight stories in height.\n[[File:Perales-iglesia.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Iglesia de Perales del R\u00edo; one of the oldest buildings in the city.]]\nDue to the developmental limitations imposed by the Air Force Base and the municipality borders, the city's parks and green spaces are important conservation areas. Two of the largest parks are located within the Sector III and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhoods. These green zones include an artificial lake and river, two pine forests, and a number of hiking trails. The parks cover an area approximately the size of Getafe Centro, and make up the western part of the urban centre, separated from the east by the [[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]. A series of parks of various sizes are located within the city proper. Outside of the city are two pine forests with picnic areas, fountains, and kiosks.\n\nGetafe's urban centre is undergoing various expansions of its urban centre. One of these is the construction and establishment of the El Bercial neighbourhood. This expansion of El Bercial will quadruple the size of the neighbourhood and will allow the city to expand to the northeast, linking El Bercial to the urban centre. The Los Olivos [[industrial park]] is expanding eastward, while at the same time, the Perales del R\u00edo neighbourhood grows westward, bringing these two neighbourhoods closer together. The \u00c1rea Tecnol\u00f3gica del Sur is being constructed in the southern parts of the municipal district, along the M-50. The \u00c1rea will be an area dedicated to a number of exposition halls and areas for new industrial development.\n\nGetafe township has a number of projects underway to expand urban areas. One of these projects is expanding the Sector III neighborhood by constructing housing at the feel of Buenavista hill. Another project involves creating a residential neighborhood called Los Molinos, located east of Getafe Norte and north of the Los \u00c1ngeles industrial park. A third project calls for the construction of a university, the ''Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Getafe'', which will include three departments and a central building.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:Ermita del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.pav.jpg|thumb|200px|Hermitage del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.]]\n[[File:Plaza-getafe.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Central plaza in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:La alh\u00f3ndiga, getafe.JPG|thumb|200px|Evening in the La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:Viviendas en el Sector 3 de Getafe.jpg|thumb|200px|Houses in Sector III neighbourhood.]]\n\nPrior to the 20th century, Getafe had only one neighbourhood, which encompassed the modern Getafe Centro and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighborhoods. The Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood is also one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the municipality, dating from approximately the 17th century. Since the 1960s, a population boom prompted the creation of new neighbourhoods, such as those of San Isidro, Juan de la Cierva, [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]], and El Bercial. In the 1980s, the Sector III neighbourhood was built and the Perales del R\u00edo was significantly expanded. During the following decade, the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built. Today, Getafe is divided into nine neighbourhoods and five industrial parks.\n\n;Getafe Centro: The oldest neighbourhood in the Getafe municipality, Getafe Centro includes the city centre. It maintains an authentic, traditional, and commercial ambience. The most populous neighbourhood in Getafe, it includes a large number of pedestrian streets. Town hall, the cathedral, the Colegio de Escuelas P\u00edas, and the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 are all located within this neighbourhood.\n;El Bercial: El Bercial is a small neighbourhood isolated from the city centre and merged with the industrial park Legan\u00e9s. Dating from the 1970s, the neighbourhood is currently experiencing significant growth.\n;Getafe Norte: Constructed in the 1990s, Getafe Norte is the northernmost neighbourhood in the city and contains the football stadium [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]].\n;Juan de la Cierva: Juan de la Cierva is a centrally located commercial neighbourhood named after the famous engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]]. Dating back to the 1970s, the neighbourhood is the second-most populous of Getafe.\n;La Alh\u00f3ndiga: One of the oldest and most authentic neighbourhoods of Getafe, La Alh\u00f3ndiga is located west of Getafe Centro, alongside the [[autov\u00eda A-42]] and the University Hospital of Getafe.\n;Las Margaritas: {{main|Las Margaritas (Madrid)}} Las Margaritas is a small neighbourhood located next to the [[Universidad Carlos III]] and its residence halls. It dates back to the 1970s, and is home to an important sports centre.\n;Perales del R\u00edo: Perales del R\u00edo is the neighborhood located furthest from the city centre. It is located alongside the Manzanares River in the extreme east of the Getafe municipality. One of the oldest neighbourhoods, it is experiencing continuous growth.\n;San Isidro: San Isidro is located south of the city centre, and includes an importance sports centre and large parks. It dates back to the 1970s.\n;Sector III: The Sector III neighbourhood consists primarily of single family homes and living areas. It is the largest neighbourhood in the municipality, and the third most populous.  Built in the 1980s, it was expanded in 1997 to include a new development called Arroyo Culebro. The [[Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe]] is here.\n;Five industrial parks: The five industrial parks are spread out across the peripherals of the city. The eastern areas include Los \u00c1ngeles, San Marcos, and Los Olivos parks. Parks south of the city limits include El Culebro and El Ros\u00f3n.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n[[File:Base-getafe.JPG|thumb|220px|Planes at the Getafe Air Force Base.]]\n[[File:Piscina-getafe.jpg|thumb|220px|Public pool of Getafe Norte. The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] in the background.]]\n\nThis city has grown substantially in the past decades, which has caused similar growth in the number of infrastructures.<ref>[http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page Infraestructuras de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228232342/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page |date=2008-02-28 }}</ref> Some of the more notable of these are:\n* The Humanities and Judicial Sciences faculties and the [[Rector (academia)#Europe|academic rector]] of the [[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]]. These installations are in the central neighborhood of Las Margaritas.\n* The student residence halls \"Fernando de los R\u00edos,\" situated 500 meters from the university in the same neighborhood.\n* The University Hospital of Getafe, famous for its burn unit. It is adjacent to the A-42, and is one of the largest hospitals in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The Getafe Air Force Base, one of the first in Spain. It's located Southeast of the urban center, and it is almost exclusively for military use. The runway of the Getafe Air Force Base is shared with engineering and manufacturing facilities of [[Airbus]] (formerly [[EADS CASA|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uiticas]]) and its three divisions: ''Commercial Aircraft'', ''[[Airbus Defence and Space|Defence and Space]]'', and ''[[Airbus Helicopters|Helicopters]]''.\n* The ''Teatro Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca'', a large cultural center located in the Getafe Centro neighborhood. It was constructed during the 1990s and produces a large number of cultural performances.\n* The [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]], the soccer stadium for [[Getafe CF]], is located in the Getafe Norte neighborhood. Inaugurated in 1998, the stadium has a [[seating capacity]] of 14,400.\n* The ''Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe'', located in the Sector III neighborhood. It is the only public musical conservatory in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid]] C-4 train line has passed underground through Getafe since 2001 to minimize noise and divisions. The old train route has been converted into a park.\n* The ''Cementerio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad'' (Cemetery of Our Lady of Peace), located South of the Air Force base, which is no longer accepting new clients due to the construction of a new cemetery.\n* A water purification plant, which purifies the waters of the Manzanares River is located alongside Perales del R\u00edo on the outskirts of Getafe. Another purification plant in Southern Getafe cleans the waters of the Culebro waterway.\n* The bullring, constructed in 2004, is located within the fairgrounds. Bullfights are common here during holidays and festivals.\n* Seven sports centers and three public pools are located within various neighborhoods.\n* Fifteen Catholic churches, eleven civic centers, and five public libraries.\n\n==Media ==\nThe municipality has a number of local newspapers. These include ''El Buz\u00f3n'' and ''El Iceberg'', which can both be found online and in print, ''El Buz\u00f3n de Getafe'', ''Observador'', ''Acci\u00f3n Getafense'', ''Vivir en Getafe'', ''Getafe Ahora'', the sports weekly digest ''Zona Sur'', ''Bolet\u00edn del Ayuntamiento'', ''Getafe al d\u00eda'', ''Getafe Capital'' and ''Mercado'', among others. The local radio broadcast, ''Radio Getafe'', was absorbed by Cadena COPE (101.8 FM). During the 1990s, the city had its own local television station called ''Tele Getafe''. In addition, there exists even more digital-only media.\n\n==Transportation ==\n[[File:Getafe-tren.jpg|thumb|250px|Train and metro station ''Getafe Central''.]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nFour highways and divided highways pass through Getafe: two beltways (A-42 and A-4) and two highways leading through Madrid (M-45 and M-50). Another two-lane road connects Getafe with [[Legan\u00e9s]], and two provincial roads lead to Perales del R\u00edo. The following is a list of major arteries:\n\n;Highways:\n*'''M-45''', highway to Madrid. 4&nbsp;km of this highway is inside Getafe, crossing it from West to East. The road marks the Northern limits of the Getafe Norte and El Bercial neighborhoods.\n*'''M-50''', highway to Madrid. 13.6&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the city center West to East. The road marks the Southern limits of the Sector III neighborhood and the Northern limit of the El Culebro industrial park.\n\n;Motorways ([[Autov\u00eda]]s):\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-4|A-4]]''', the Highway of the South, previously called the N-IV. 7.25&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the center north\u2013south. The road separates the Los \u00c1ngeles and San Marcos industrial parks from the Los Olivos industrial park and the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]].\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]''', the Toledo Highway, previously called the N-401. 6.13&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it cuts across the center in a north\u2013south orientation. The road separates the Section III and El Bercial neighborhoods from the city center. To lessen the isolation of these neighborhoods, the local government has begun a project to create an underground passage for the A-42 as it crosses through Getafe.\n\n;Other roads:\n*M-406, two-lane road. Passes through [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Legan\u00e9s]] and Getafe. Once the M-406 enters Getafe it becomes the Calle Legan\u00e9s.\n*M-301, road which exits [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]], passes through Perales del R\u00edo, and terminates in San Mart\u00edn de la Vega.\n*Road from [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] to Perales del R\u00edo. This road is a continuation of the M-406, and connects central Getafe with Perales del R\u00edo.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe Air Force Base is for military use only. As it is, the city center of Getafe is 26&nbsp;km from [[Madrid Barajas International Airport]], which can be accessed via the M-40.\n\nThe city has eight urban bus lines; eight lines connecting Getafe to Madrid; five lines to the municipalities of Valdemoro, [[Legan\u00e9s]], [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Parla]], [[Serranillos]], Casarrubuelos and Gri\u00f1\u00f3n; and two night lines to Madrid.

From the Middle Ages to 1900, the population varied between 2,500 and 6,000 inhabitants. In 1950, the population was 12,254; in 1970, the population was 69,424; in 1977, 124,601. These figures demonstrate the population growth spurt that began in 1960 and continues to the present day. At present, the city's population is generally growing at a continual, moderate rate, at approximately 1,700 people per year. The year 2006 was the first year since the 17th century that the population actually decreased, falling by 2,043 people.\n\nGetafe is listed as the 41st most populous city in Spain, after [[Salamanca]] and before [[Logro\u00f1o]].

The hills of the Mara\u00f1osa can be seen in the distance.]]\nGetafe's economy was historically agricultural. The first factories were built in the area at the beginning of the 20th century, but it wasn't until the second half of the century that industry gained prominence. By the 1960s, industry had become the primary economic focus.\n\nToday, the economy is mostly industrial, with a large focus on Getafe's five industrial parks. After Madrid, Getafe is the most industrialized city in the community of Madrid, with numerous industries such as [[John Deere]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], and [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA]]. The city boasts five industrial parks spread across the peripheries of the city. The city's industrial activities are divided across several industries: 34% [[metallurgy]], 20% food processing, 14% wood and furniture production, 6% textile, furs, and skins. The remaining 26% includes various other industries, such as paper production, graphic arts, and construction, among others. A number of [[quarry|quarries]] are located in the easterly areas of the municipality which are being mined extensively.\n[[File:Getafe-ayuntamiento1.jpg|thumb|186px|left|Getafe's City hall.]]\nThe service industry began to emerge at the end of the 1990s with the construction of several new malls and entertainment areas. The importance of agriculture on the local economy has decreased significantly in the past century, though eastern parts of the municipality still include good plots of irrigated and nonirrigated land. The major crop is wheat, with smaller cultivations of [[olive trees]], [[Vitis|grape vines]], and vegetables. Herding and livestock are slowly diminishing, though they can still be found in the vicinity of Buenavista hill and the fields along the Manzanares river.\n\nThe median [[per capita income]] of the inhabitants of Getafe is 10,000 \u20ac, which is lower than the 12,500 \u20ac median income of the community of Madrid. The most wealthy neighborhoods are Sector III and Getafe Norte, with a median income of 13,000 \u20ac. The poorest neighborhoods are La Alh\u00f3ndiga, Getafe Centro, and San Isidro, whose median incomes average 9,000 \u20ac. In January 2006, the [[unemployment]] rate was 8.4%\n{{clear}}\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[File:Calle con campanario de iglesia al fondo en Getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|Escuelas P\u00edas, a center of religious education founded in 1609]]\nGetafe has a number of monuments and areas of interest pertaining to its history.

The \"s\u00e1bado de las fiestas\" (''Saturday of the festivities''), as it is popularly known, begins with an address in the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n, following an explosive display of the concussive effects of co-ordinated firecracker and fireworks barrages in the Calle Jardines. A fair is held during these days on the fairgrounds, political parties set up stalls on the Calle Ferrocarril, and there are a number of cultural activities, including concerts and bull fights.

The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] (\"Hill of the Angels\"), a site traditionally considered to be the geographical center of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], also lies within the municipal limits.<ref name=\"cerro\">{{cite web |url= http://www.cerrodelosangeles.es/|title= Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles (Official website)|accessdate=2009-03-02|language=es}}</ref> Getafe is located 13&nbsp;km south of [[Madrid]]'s city centre, within a flat area of Spain's [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]] in the [[Manzanares (river)|Manzanares River]] basin.\n\nGetafe's proximity to central Madrid fostered industrial development during the 20th and 21st centuries. The city's industrialisation in turn led to an increase in population, reaching 170,115 in 2011. Due to its industrial and social networks, the majority of residents work or study within the city. Getafe hosts an [[Airbus]] factory. The increase in population led to the construction of numerous access roads, an increase in available public services, and the creation of new neighborhoods at the end of the 20th century.\n\n== Etymology ==\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], a number of villages were located in the present-day area of Getafe. One of the main villages was Alarnes, which was very close to the current urban center. In 1326, the villagers united themselves into one town, situated on the royal road that linked Madrid with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. This new town was called ''Xatafi,'' a name which came from the Arab word ''jata'' (\"something long\"). It is assumed that the name ''Xatafi'' referred to the royal road, which also served as the town's main street. The town's name evolved over time, from ''Xetafe'' to ''Jetafee'' to ''Jetaphe'' to ''Jetafe'' to ''Getafe.''\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Vista de Getafe (1878).jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Engraving]] of Getafe from the 19th century.]]\nThe history of Getafe can be split into three clearly defined eras. In the first era, which lasted from Prehistory until 1326, there existed distinct villages in the area, though Getafe itself did not exist as a municipality. The second era lasted from the 14th century until the 20th century, during which Getafe was established as a town and developed slowly. In the third era, which began in the 20th century and continues to the present day, Getafe changed in nature from a small agricultural town to a large industrial city, with a noticeable increase in commerce, industry, population and size.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |title=Historia de Getafe |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303230826/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/HistoriaGetafe.html |archivedate=3 March 2009 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Villa-romana-getafe.JPG|thumb|230px|Ruins of the Roman villa of La Torrecilla.]]\nThe presence of humans in the area of Getafe dates back to the [[Lower Paleolithic]] period (before 100,000 BCE). Various [[stone tools]], pots, and bracelets from this period have been excavated from the banks of the Manzanares River.\n\nThe Romans dominated the Iberian Peninsula from the 2nd century BCE until the 5th century AD. In the 3rd century AD, the Romans constructed a villa called La Torecilla, whose ruins are still visible on the banks of the Manzanares River. The area was subsequently overrun by a series of [[Germanic tribes]], including [[Suebi]], [[Vandals]] and [[Visigoths]], and the Indoeuropean [[Alans]].\n\nThe area currently encompassed by the Getafe municipal district was invaded by the [[Moors]] in the 8th century. King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] conquered the villages of the area in 1085. In 1326, the inhabitants of the villages moved closer to the royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo, in effect creating a new town, Getafe. In that same century, the primitive hermitage of La Magdalena was built, only to be destroyed several centuries later.\n\n=== Contemporary age ===\n[[File:Getafe-sigloxvii.JPG|thumb|190px|left|Map of 17th century Getafe.]]\nIn 1492, famine and disease devastated Getafe, prompting the construction of the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 in 1529. In 1549, the architect [[Alonso de Covarrubias]] began building the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de La Magdalena, which has since become the Cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Getafe|Diocese of Getafe]]. The church was built on the foundation of the old hermitage, and in 1610 a new hermitage was built on the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. The college of the Escuelas P\u00edas was founded in 1737. In 1763, King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] ordered the construction of a new road connecting Madrid to [[Aranjuez]] and, further on, to [[C\u00e1diz]], which passed along the foot of the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles. Napoleonic troops occupied Getafe from 1808 to 1812. A train line connecting Madrid to Aranjuez, and passing through Getafe, was inaugurated in 1851.\n\n=== Modern age ===\n[[File:Gran-teatro-getafe.JPG|thumb|165px|Getafe's Gran Teatro (''Great Theater'') at the end of the 19th century.]]\nElectric street lights were lit for the first time in Getafe on 22 December 1897. The Getafe Air Force Base was permanently established in 1911, followed by the School of Civil Aviation two years later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] inaugurated the first monument to the [[Sacred Heart]] of Jesus on the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] on 30 May 1919. In 1924, [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas S.A.]] built its first factory in the area. That same year, [[Juan de la Cierva]]'s [[autogyro]] was flown for the first time from the air force base.\n\nDue to its proximity to Madrid, Getafe underwent an industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in the city's conversion from agricultural city to industrial city. Industrialization also prompted a rapid boom in population, starting in the 1950s. In 1956, [[Deere & Company|John Deere]] established a factory in Getafe, and a year later, [[Siemens AG]] followed suit. The city was forced to create the neighborhoods of San Isidro, El Bercial, Juan de la Cierva, and [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]] in the 1970s in order to support these new industries.\n\nIn 1961, the [[Canal de Isabel II]] began to provide water to Getafe. The first local democratic elections occurred in 1979, after the ratification of the Constitution in 1978. In 1989, the [[Universidad Carlos III]] was founded. The Sector III neighbourhood was constructed between 1979 and 1988; the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built during the late 1990s; the El Bercial neighbourhood is currently being expanded. In April 2003, Madrid Metro System's [[Line 12 (Madrid Metro)|Line 12]] opened, linking the Madrid region's southern population centres with the capital.\n\n== Heraldry ==\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Getafe is divided vertically into two equal halves that represent the two most important characteristics of the municipal district. The left half contains a heart in the center of a [[Latin cross]], representing the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]]\u2014a reference to the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]]. The right half contains a repeated pattern of airplanes representing the aeronautical tradition of the area and referencing the nearby Air Force Base. The [[Royal Spanish Crown]] tops the coat of arms, and symbolizes Getafe's loyalty to the Spanish monarchy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |title=Getafe es As\u00ed |accessdate=7 February 2009 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Getafe |location=Getafe, Spain |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220055541/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/arte.html |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}. {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n== Politics and government ==\nThe current mayor of Getafe is Sara Hern\u00e1ndez Barroso, socialist, thanks to the support of left wing group [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU) and a political platform close to [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] called 'Ahora Getafe'. In 2011, Juan Soler-Espiauba Gallo, of the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP), was elected mayor and displaced the incumbent, a socialist, who had held this post since 1983. The most popular political parties in the area, other than the PSOE, are the [[People's Party (Spain)|Peoples' Party]] (PP) and the [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]] (IU). Getafe has always had a large working population, and left-wing groups, especially the PSOE, have traditionally been very influential.\n\nIn the [[Spanish regional elections, 2007|2007 Spanish regional elections]], the PSOE elected 13 town councillors (44.18% of the vote), PP, 11 (36.09%), and IU 3, (11.73%).<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ Resultados de las elecciones municipales de 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531083056/http://www.elpais.com/comunes/2007/elecciones/municipales/Getafe/28/065/ |date=2007-05-31 }}</ref> Other political associations were not able to muster enough votes to receive representation. Local elections occur every four years, along with the autonomous election. \n\nIn the last Spanish General elections celebrated in 2015, PP obtained 25,65% of the vote, very close to Podemos (24,72%) and PSOE (22,60%). Ciudadanos obtained 16,54% of the vote and IU 7,07%.\n\nCabinet meetings are composed of nine councillors: eight from the PSOE and one from IU. The Municipal Corporation is made up of 27 members, detailed previously. The cabinet is presided over by the mayor. The Getafe city council is divided into a number of different focus groups: treasury, wealth, and social security; equality; urbanism; civil action; and management of waste disposal, cleanliness, the environment, and the home. The council holds sessions every month, in addition to frequently held special sessions, in which councillors debate various topics and problems which affect the municipality.\n\nGetafe is at the forefront of the struggle for workers rights in local industry. The most important trade unions in the city are the [[Workers' Commissions]] (CCOO) and the [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] (UGT). Both unions have branch offices in Getafe and list many local workers as members.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Physical location ===\n[[File:Cerro-buenavista.JPG|thumb|220px|Cerro Buenavista, or ''Buenavista hill'', the area of highest elevation in the Getafe municipality at 704 meters (2309 ft). There is a deposit of water on the summit of the hill from the canal of Isabel II.]]\n[[File:Cerro-angeles.JPG|thumb|right|Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]]\nGetafe is located in the southern zone of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]], Spain, in southwestern Europe. It is physically located in the centre of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], north of the Southern Submeseta (part of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Meseta Central]]), in the Manzanares River basin. Its elevation is 610 \u2013 640 meters above sea level (2000\u20132100&nbsp;feet). Its coordinates are 40\u00b0 18' N 3\u00b0 43' W. The municipal district is 78.74&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, with a perimeter of 46.5&nbsp;km. The easternmost part of the municipal district is located within the [[Parque Regional del Sureste]], a protected forest region.\n\n==== Distances ====\nDue to its central location within the Iberian Peninsula, Getafe is no more than 725.6&nbsp;km from any Spanish provincial capital in mainland Spain. The following are the distances to a few major cities, the oceans which surround the Spanish coasts, and the national borders of Portugal and France.\n<center>\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|\n*[[Puerta del Sol]] of [[Madrid]]: 13&nbsp;km\n*[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]: 59&nbsp;km (capital of the nearest [[Provinces of Spain|province]] other than Madrid)\n*[[Girona]]: 725,6&nbsp;km (capital of the furthest province on the mainland)\n*Center of [[Legan\u00e9s]] (adjacent municipality): 4,3&nbsp;km\n*[[Fuenlabrada]] (adjacent municipality): 7,5&nbsp;km\n*[[Parla]] (adjacent municipality): 8&nbsp;km\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n*[[Mediterranean Sea]] ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]): 348&nbsp;km\n*[[Bay of Biscay]] ([[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]): 398&nbsp;km\n*[[Atlantic Ocean]] ([[C\u00e1diz]]): 640&nbsp;km\n*[[Portugal|Portuguese]] Border: 402&nbsp;km\n*[[Francia|French]] Border: 510&nbsp;km\n|}</center>\n\n=== Relief ===\n[[File:Manzanares-rio.JPG|thumb|205px|left|The bank of the Manzanares River. This is the area with the lowest elevation in the province of Madrid (540 m; 1772 ft).]]\nThe municipal district is mostly flat, with a minor inclination of 5% to the east and an elevation of 631&nbsp;m (2070&nbsp;ft) above sea level. The lowest altitude can be found to the extreme east, at the Manzanares River at 540&nbsp;m (1772&nbsp;ft). The highest elevation is found on the extreme west, on Buenavista, a 704&nbsp;m (2310&nbsp;ft) hill which sits on the border between the municipalities of Getafe and [[Legan\u00e9s]], some 12&nbsp;km South of Madrid. The hilliest area, the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, is located in the Southeast and has a maximum elevation of 698&nbsp;m (2290&nbsp;ft). In the center of Getafe is the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, or ''hill of angels'' (670 m; 2198&nbsp;ft).  Pine forests have been planted at the feet of these hills to deter the erosion of the soil.\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n[[File:Lagunas de Perales.jpg|thumb|210px|Lakes of Perales. Because so few remain, these four small lakes are protected.]]\n\nA number of rivers and other natural waterways pass through Getafe. 9.5&nbsp;km of the Manzanares River passes through the eastern-most parts of the municipal district. In the South, 16.5&nbsp;km of the Culebro Waterway winds its way across Getafe, and in the Southeast 2&nbsp;km of the Filipinas gully descent from the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa. There are two man-made canals, one on each side of the Manzanares River. These parallel canals provide water for cultivated land further from the river.\n\nThe lakes of Perals are 2&nbsp;km East of the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]], and are some of the only undisturbed natural lakes left in the region. For this reason, the lakes are part of a protected area to preserve their natural state.\n\nThe Culebra waterway and the Filipinas gully boast heavy water flow during the winter and little to none during the summer. In contrast, the Manzanares carries water year round. For that reason, Getafe is considered to be within the Manzanares [[river basin]], except for a small portion in the southeast which is part of the [[Jarama]] river basin.\n\n=== Borders ===\nThe city of Getafe borders the following municipalities: to the North, Madrid (city districts [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]] and [[Vallecas]]; to the East, [[Rivas Vaciamadrid]]; to the Southeast, [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]; to the South, [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]; to the Southwest, [[Fuenlabrada]]; to the West, [[Legan\u00e9s]].\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width =\"60%\" border = 2 align=\"center\"\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NW:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''N:'' [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''NE:'' [[Vallecas]]\n|-----\n| width =\"10%\" align=\"center\" | ''W:'' [[Legan\u00e9s]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | '''Getafe'''\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''E:'' [[Rivas-Vaciamadrid]]\n|-----\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SW'' [[Fuenlabrada]]\n| width =\"30%\" align=\"center\" | ''S:'' [[Pinto, Madrid|Pinto]]\n| width =\"35%\" align=\"center\" | ''SE:'' [[San Mart\u00edn de la Vega]]\n|}</center>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Getafe-nevado.jpg|thumb|230px|left|A park in Getafe on a snowy day.]]\nThe climate of Getafe is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]<ref>[http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 Valores clim\u00e1ticos normales de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095428/http://www.inm.es/cgi-bin/valnor.sh.2001?NOMBRE=3200 |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref> and is influenced by urban conditions. Winters are cool, with temperatures dropping below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (46.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) during the day, and frequently below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) at night. Getafe averages three to four snowfalls per year. Summers are very hot, with median temperatures above 25&nbsp;\u00b0C (75.2&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July and August, and with maximum temperatures which often reach 35&nbsp;\u00b0C (95&nbsp;\u00b0F). Daily temperatures oscillate within range of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C (18&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nPrecipitations are regularly distributed throughout the year, excluding the dry summer months. The rainiest month is October, with 50&nbsp;mm  of rainfall, and the driest month is July, with only 9.4&nbsp;mm. Average yearly precipitation is around 365&nbsp;mm (17.52&nbsp;in).\n\nOne of the major problems of Getafe's climate is air pollution, which increases noticeably when the wind blows South or Southeast. The average annual temperature is 15&nbsp;\u00b0C, with the highest temperature on record listed at 41.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (106.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 24 July 1995, and the lowest temperature recorded at -12&nbsp;\u00b0C (10.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 5 February 1963. The average [[relative humidity]] is 71%, average pressure is 1,015.8 millibars, average number of daylight hours per year is 2,850, and the winds blow predominantly from the northeast.\n\nExtreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, never occur in Getafe thanks to its climate and geography. One common problem in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula is [[drought]], which occurs whenever precipitation ceases during various months.\n\n{{Weather box|location= Getafe (1981-2010) <small>(altitude: 620 m, [http://maps.google.es/?q=Est%3AGetafe%4040.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&t=p&ll=40.2994444444%2C-3.7222222222&spn=0.182837%2C0.291824&z=11&output=embed satellite view])</small>\n|metric first= Y\n|single line= Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.8\n|Feb record high C = 23.0\n|Mar record high C = 29.0\n|Apr record high C = 30.7\n|May record high C = 36.2\n|Jun record high C = 40.6\n|Jul record high C = 41.6\n|Aug record high C = 40.6\n|Sep record high C = 40.0\n|Oct record high C = 32.0\n|Nov record high C = 25.2\n|Dec record high C = 21.8\n|year record high C = 41.6\n|Jan high C= 10.5\n|Feb high C= 12.7\n|Mar high C= 16.8\n|Apr high C= 18.6\n|May high C= 23.0\n|Jun high C= 29.3\n|Jul high C= 33.2\n|Aug high C= 32.5\n|Sep high C= 27.5\n|Oct high C= 20.6\n|Nov high C= 14.5\n|Dec high C= 10.7\n|year high C= 20.8\n|Jan mean C= 5.9\n|Feb mean C= 7.5\n|Mar mean C= 10.8\n|Apr mean C= 12.7\n|May mean C= 16.8\n|Jun mean C= 22.4\n|Jul mean C= 25.9\n|Aug mean C= 25.4\n|Sep mean C= 21.1\n|Oct mean C= 15.3\n|Nov mean C= 9.8\n|Dec mean C= 6.5\n|year mean C= 15.0\n|Jan low C= 1.2\n|Feb low C= 2.4\n|Mar low C= 4.9\n|Apr low C= 6.9\n|May low C= 10.5\n|Jun low C= 15.6\n|Jul low C= 18.5\n|Aug low C= 18.2\n|Sep low C= 14.6\n|Oct low C= 9.9\n|Nov low C= 5.0\n|Dec low C= 2.4\n|year low C= 9.2\n|Jan record low C = -9.0\n|Feb record low C = -12.0\n|Mar record low C = -6.2\n|Apr record low C = -2.6\n|May record low C = -1.0\n|Jun record low C = 4.2\n|Jul record low C = 8.2\n|Aug record low C = 7.2\n|Sep record low C = 3.6\n|Oct record low C = -2.0\n|Nov record low C = -5.4\n|Dec record low C = -10.0\n|year record low C = -12.0\n|Jan precipitation mm= 30\n|Feb precipitation mm= 32\n|Mar precipitation mm= 24\n|Apr precipitation mm= 38\n|May precipitation mm= 39\n|Jun precipitation mm= 19\n|Jul precipitation mm= 9\n|Aug precipitation mm= 9\n|Sep precipitation mm= 22\n|Oct precipitation mm= 50\n|Nov precipitation mm= 48\n|Dec precipitation mm= 45\n|year precipitation mm= 365\n|Jan precipitation days= 6\n|Feb precipitation days= 5\n|Mar precipitation days= 4\n|Apr precipitation days= 7\n|May precipitation days= 6\n|Jun precipitation days= 3\n|Jul precipitation days= 1\n|Aug precipitation days= 2\n|Sep precipitation days= 3\n|Oct precipitation days= 7\n|Nov precipitation days= 6\n|Dec precipitation days= 7\n|year precipitation days= 56\n|unit precipitation days= 1&nbsp;mm\n|Jan sun= 150\n|Feb sun= 172\n|Mar sun= 222\n|Apr sun= 237\n|May sun= 279\n|Jun sun= 326\n|Jul sun= 368\n|Aug sun= 339\n|Sep sun= 256\n|Oct sun= 202\n|Nov sun= 152\n|Dec sun= 124\n|year sun= 2850\n|source 1= [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]]<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |title       = Gu\u00eda resumida del clima en Espa\u00f1a (1981-2010)\n |publisher   = AEMet\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130526104145/http://www.aemet.es/es/conocermas/publicaciones/detalles/guia_resumida_2010\n |archivedate = 2013-05-26\n}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Flora and Fauna ===\n[[File:Campo-getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|View from the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] from the middle of the eastern municipal border. Visible are pine trees, olive trees, and extensive wheat fields.]]\n\nThe native vegetation of Getafe is characteristic of the [[mediterranean forest]] biome, consisting mostly of [[Holm Oak|holm]] and [[Cork Oak|cork oaks]]. Native flowering plants include those of the genus ''[[Cistus]]'' and the [[common broom]] (''Cytisus scoparius''), though these species are not abundant. This native forest and underbrush only occupies 16% of the surface of the municipal territory, mostly in the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa and further east. The shores of the Manzanares River and Culebro Waterway contain deciduous trees and reeds.\n\nMost undeveloped land is devoted to the cultivation of cereals (mostly [[wheat]]), and, to a lesser extent, to gardens in the fertile lowlands of the Manzanares river. Some areas have been reforested with [[stone pine]]s (''Pinus pinea'') and [[aleppo pine]]s (''Pinus halepensis''). These areas include the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles, the Prado Acedinos, part of the hills of the Mara\u00f1osa, and part of the park in the Sector III neighborhood. Common trees in the parks and streets of the city are the [[horse chestnut]] (''Aesculus hippocastanum''), the [[acacia]], the [[elm]] (''Ulmus minor''), and the stone pine. Other less common trees include [[Cedar wood|cedars]], [[Cupressus|cypress]], aleppo pines, [[plum]] trees, [[Populus|poplars]], [[fir]] trees, and [[Arecaceae|palm trees]].\n\nA significant population of small birds live within the city proper, including [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s and [[Columbidae|pigeons]]. Larger birds, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, and weasels can be found in the more easterly parts of the municipality. The world's largest population of the [[Falco tinnunculus|common kestrel]] can be found in the Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood.\n\n== Town Planning  ==\n[[File:Getafe-norte.jpg|thumb|220px|Modern building in the Getafe Norte neighborhood.]]\nThe urban portions of Getafe are organised in an almost longitudinal manner, from northeast to southwest. Thus, the elongated shape of Getafe today is due primarily to the close proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which impedes city growth to the southeast. The most important streets of the city are Calle Madrid and Calle Toledo. These two roads are pedestrian through the center of Getafe, and are part of what was a royal road connecting Madrid and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] during the Middle Ages. Getafe has other important streets and avenues organizing its neighborhoods, such as the Avenida de Espa\u00f1a, Avenida de Los \u00c1ngeles, Avenida de las Ciudades, Avenida Juan Carlos I, and Calle Ferrocarril.\n\nThe popular architectural style in Getafe is generally characterised by two-story buildings with tile roofs, various small [[balcony|balconies]] on the second floor, and a bare brick fa\u00e7ade. These types of houses can be found in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood, though their numbers are decreasing as existing houses are vacated and demolished to make room for new townhouse developments. The average height of buildings in Getafe is five floors, approximately  60 feet (17 metres). This peculiarity is due to the proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which places limits on the height of buildings. Few buildings in Getafe surpass eight stories in height.\n[[File:Perales-iglesia.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Iglesia de Perales del R\u00edo; one of the oldest buildings in the city.]]\nDue to the developmental limitations imposed by the Air Force Base and the municipality borders, the city's parks and green spaces are important conservation areas. Two of the largest parks are located within the Sector III and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhoods. These green zones include an artificial lake and river, two pine forests, and a number of hiking trails. The parks cover an area approximately the size of Getafe Centro, and make up the western part of the urban centre, separated from the east by the [[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]. A series of parks of various sizes are located within the city proper. Outside of the city are two pine forests with picnic areas, fountains, and kiosks.\n\nGetafe's urban centre is undergoing various expansions of its urban centre. One of these is the construction and establishment of the El Bercial neighbourhood. This expansion of El Bercial will quadruple the size of the neighbourhood and will allow the city to expand to the northeast, linking El Bercial to the urban centre. The Los Olivos [[industrial park]] is expanding eastward, while at the same time, the Perales del R\u00edo neighbourhood grows westward, bringing these two neighbourhoods closer together. The \u00c1rea Tecnol\u00f3gica del Sur is being constructed in the southern parts of the municipal district, along the M-50. The \u00c1rea will be an area dedicated to a number of exposition halls and areas for new industrial development.\n\nGetafe township has a number of projects underway to expand urban areas. One of these projects is expanding the Sector III neighborhood by constructing housing at the feel of Buenavista hill. Another project involves creating a residential neighborhood called Los Molinos, located east of Getafe Norte and north of the Los \u00c1ngeles industrial park. A third project calls for the construction of a university, the ''Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Getafe'', which will include three departments and a central building.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:Ermita del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.pav.jpg|thumb|200px|Hermitage del Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.]]\n[[File:Plaza-getafe.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Central plaza in the Getafe Centro neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:La alh\u00f3ndiga, getafe.JPG|thumb|200px|Evening in the La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighbourhood.]]\n[[File:Viviendas en el Sector 3 de Getafe.jpg|thumb|200px|Houses in Sector III neighbourhood.]]\n\nPrior to the 20th century, Getafe had only one neighbourhood, which encompassed the modern Getafe Centro and La Alh\u00f3ndiga neighborhoods. The Perales del R\u00edo neighborhood is also one of the oldest neighbourhoods in the municipality, dating from approximately the 17th century. Since the 1960s, a population boom prompted the creation of new neighbourhoods, such as those of San Isidro, Juan de la Cierva, [[Las Margaritas (Madrid)|Las Margaritas]], and El Bercial. In the 1980s, the Sector III neighbourhood was built and the Perales del R\u00edo was significantly expanded. During the following decade, the Getafe Norte neighbourhood was built. Today, Getafe is divided into nine neighbourhoods and five industrial parks.\n\n;Getafe Centro: The oldest neighbourhood in the Getafe municipality, Getafe Centro includes the city centre. It maintains an authentic, traditional, and commercial ambience. The most populous neighbourhood in Getafe, it includes a large number of pedestrian streets. Town hall, the cathedral, the Colegio de Escuelas P\u00edas, and the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9 are all located within this neighbourhood.\n;El Bercial: El Bercial is a small neighbourhood isolated from the city centre and merged with the industrial park Legan\u00e9s. Dating from the 1970s, the neighbourhood is currently experiencing significant growth.\n;Getafe Norte: Constructed in the 1990s, Getafe Norte is the northernmost neighbourhood in the city and contains the football stadium [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]].\n;Juan de la Cierva: Juan de la Cierva is a centrally located commercial neighbourhood named after the famous engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]]. Dating back to the 1970s, the neighbourhood is the second-most populous of Getafe.\n;La Alh\u00f3ndiga: One of the oldest and most authentic neighbourhoods of Getafe, La Alh\u00f3ndiga is located west of Getafe Centro, alongside the [[autov\u00eda A-42]] and the University Hospital of Getafe.\n;Las Margaritas: {{main|Las Margaritas (Madrid)}} Las Margaritas is a small neighbourhood located next to the [[Universidad Carlos III]] and its residence halls. It dates back to the 1970s, and is home to an important sports centre.\n;Perales del R\u00edo: Perales del R\u00edo is the neighborhood located furthest from the city centre. It is located alongside the Manzanares River in the extreme east of the Getafe municipality. One of the oldest neighbourhoods, it is experiencing continuous growth.\n;San Isidro: San Isidro is located south of the city centre, and includes an importance sports centre and large parks. It dates back to the 1970s.\n;Sector III: The Sector III neighbourhood consists primarily of single family homes and living areas. It is the largest neighbourhood in the municipality, and the third most populous.  Built in the 1980s, it was expanded in 1997 to include a new development called Arroyo Culebro. The [[Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe]] is here.\n;Five industrial parks: The five industrial parks are spread out across the peripherals of the city. The eastern areas include Los \u00c1ngeles, San Marcos, and Los Olivos parks. Parks south of the city limits include El Culebro and El Ros\u00f3n.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n[[File:Base-getafe.JPG|thumb|220px|Planes at the Getafe Air Force Base.]]\n[[File:Piscina-getafe.jpg|thumb|220px|Public pool of Getafe Norte. The [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] in the background.]]\n\nThis city has grown substantially in the past decades, which has caused similar growth in the number of infrastructures.<ref>[http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page Infraestructuras de Getafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228232342/http://www.getafe.es/CIUDAD/Universidad_CarlosIII.page |date=2008-02-28 }}</ref> Some of the more notable of these are:\n* The Humanities and Judicial Sciences faculties and the [[Rector (academia)#Europe|academic rector]] of the [[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]]. These installations are in the central neighborhood of Las Margaritas.\n* The student residence halls \"Fernando de los R\u00edos,\" situated 500 meters from the university in the same neighborhood.\n* The University Hospital of Getafe, famous for its burn unit. It is adjacent to the A-42, and is one of the largest hospitals in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The Getafe Air Force Base, one of the first in Spain. It's located Southeast of the urban center, and it is almost exclusively for military use. The runway of the Getafe Air Force Base is shared with engineering and manufacturing facilities of [[Airbus]] (formerly [[EADS CASA|Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uiticas]]) and its three divisions: ''Commercial Aircraft'', ''[[Airbus Defence and Space|Defence and Space]]'', and ''[[Airbus Helicopters|Helicopters]]''.\n* The ''Teatro Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca'', a large cultural center located in the Getafe Centro neighborhood. It was constructed during the 1990s and produces a large number of cultural performances.\n* The [[Coliseum Alfonso P\u00e9rez]], the soccer stadium for [[Getafe CF]], is located in the Getafe Norte neighborhood. Inaugurated in 1998, the stadium has a seating capacity of 14,400.\n* The ''Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe'', located in the Sector III neighborhood. It is the only public musical conservatory in the Southern region of the [[Madrid (autonomous community)|autonomous community of Madrid]].\n* The [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid]] C-4 train line has passed underground through Getafe since 2001 to minimize noise and divisions. The old train route has been converted into a park.\n* The ''Cementerio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad'' (Cemetery of Our Lady of Peace), located South of the Air Force base, which is no longer accepting new clients due to the construction of a new cemetery.\n* A water purification plant, which purifies the waters of the Manzanares River is located alongside Perales del R\u00edo on the outskirts of Getafe. Another purification plant in Southern Getafe cleans the waters of the Culebro waterway.\n* The bullring, constructed in 2004, is located within the fairgrounds. Bullfights are common here during holidays and festivals.\n* Seven sports centers and three public pools are located within various neighborhoods.\n* Fifteen Catholic churches, eleven civic centers, and five public libraries.\n\n==Media ==\nThe municipality has a number of local newspapers. These include ''El Buz\u00f3n'' and ''El Iceberg'', which can both be found online and in print, ''El Buz\u00f3n de Getafe'', ''Observador'', ''Acci\u00f3n Getafense'', ''Vivir en Getafe'', ''Getafe Ahora'', the sports weekly digest ''Zona Sur'', ''Bolet\u00edn del Ayuntamiento'', ''Getafe al d\u00eda'', ''Getafe Capital'' and ''Mercado'', among others. The local radio broadcast, ''Radio Getafe'', was absorbed by Cadena COPE (101.8 FM). During the 1990s, the city had its own local television station called ''Tele Getafe''. In addition, there exists even more digital-only media.\n\n==Transportation ==\n[[File:Getafe-tren.jpg|thumb|250px|Train and metro station ''Getafe Central''.]]\n\n=== Roads ===\nFour highways and divided highways pass through Getafe: two beltways (A-42 and A-4) and two highways leading through Madrid (M-45 and M-50). Another two-lane road connects Getafe with [[Legan\u00e9s]], and two provincial roads lead to Perales del R\u00edo. The following is a list of major arteries:\n\n;Highways:\n*'''M-45''', highway to Madrid. 4&nbsp;km of this highway is inside Getafe, crossing it from West to East. The road marks the Northern limits of the Getafe Norte and El Bercial neighborhoods.\n*'''M-50''', highway to Madrid. 13.6&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the city center West to East. The road marks the Southern limits of the Sector III neighborhood and the Northern limit of the El Culebro industrial park.\n\n;Motorways ([[Autov\u00eda]]s):\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-4|A-4]]''', the Highway of the South, previously called the N-IV. 7.25&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the center north\u2013south. The road separates the Los \u00c1ngeles and San Marcos industrial parks from the Los Olivos industrial park and the [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]].\n*'''[[Autov\u00eda A-42|A-42]]''', the Toledo Highway, previously called the N-401. 6.13&nbsp;km of this highway run through Getafe, and it cuts across the center in a north\u2013south orientation. The road separates the Section III and El Bercial neighborhoods from the city center. To lessen the isolation of these neighborhoods, the local government has begun a project to create an underground passage for the A-42 as it crosses through Getafe.\n\n;Other roads:\n*M-406, two-lane road. Passes through [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Legan\u00e9s]] and Getafe. Once the M-406 enters Getafe it becomes the Calle Legan\u00e9s.\n*M-301, road which exits [[Villaverde (Madrid)|Villaverde]], passes through Perales del R\u00edo, and terminates in San Mart\u00edn de la Vega.\n*Road from [[Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles]] to Perales del R\u00edo. This road is a continuation of the M-406, and connects central Getafe with Perales del R\u00edo.\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nThe Air Force Base is for military use only. As it is, the city center of Getafe is 26&nbsp;km from [[Madrid Barajas International Airport]], which can be accessed via the M-40.\n\nThe city has eight urban bus lines; eight lines connecting Getafe to Madrid; five lines to the municipalities of Valdemoro, [[Legan\u00e9s]], [[Alcorc\u00f3n]], [[Parla]], [[Serranillos]], Casarrubuelos and Gri\u00f1\u00f3n; and two night lines to Madrid.

More than 85% of the population consider themselves Catholic, but only 20% of these people are actual active members of Catholic congregations.\n\nThe population of Getafe has experienced strong growth during the second half of the 20th century. From the Middle Ages to 1900, the population varied between 2,500 and 6,000 inhabitants. In 1950, the population was 12,254; in 1970, the population was 69,424; in 1977, 124,601. These figures demonstrate the population growth spurt that began in 1960 and continues to the present day. At present, the city's population is generally growing at a continual, moderate rate, at approximately 1,700 people per year. The year 2006 was the first year since the 17th century that the population actually decreased, falling by 2,043 people.\n\nGetafe is listed as the 41st most populous city in Spain, after [[Salamanca]] and before [[Logro\u00f1o]]. Within the community of Madrid, Getafe is the 7th most populous city, after [[Alcorc\u00f3n]] and before [[Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz]]. An inhabitant of Getafe is called ''getafe\u00f1o'' or ''getafense'', though the latter is more common.

The hills of the Mara\u00f1osa can be seen in the distance.]]\nGetafe's economy was historically agricultural. The first factories were built in the area at the beginning of the 20th century, but it wasn't until the second half of the century that industry gained prominence. By the 1960s, industry had become the primary economic focus.\n\nToday, the economy is mostly industrial, with a large focus on Getafe's five industrial parks. After Madrid, Getafe is the most industrialized city in the community of Madrid, with numerous industries such as [[John Deere]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], and [[Construcciones Aeron\u00e1uticas SA]]. The city boasts five industrial parks spread across the peripheries of the city. The city's industrial activities are divided across several industries: 34% [[metallurgy]], 20% food processing, 14% wood and furniture production, 6% textile, furs, and skins. The remaining 26% includes various other industries, such as paper production, graphic arts, and construction, among others. A number of [[quarry|quarries]] are located in the easterly areas of the municipality which are being mined extensively.\n[[File:Getafe-ayuntamiento1.jpg|thumb|186px|left|Getafe's City hall.]]\nThe service industry began to emerge at the end of the 1990s with the construction of several new malls and entertainment areas. The importance of agriculture on the local economy has decreased significantly in the past century, though eastern parts of the municipality still include good plots of irrigated and nonirrigated land. The major crop is wheat, with smaller cultivations of [[olive trees]], [[Vitis|grape vines]], and vegetables. Herding and livestock are slowly diminishing, though they can still be found in the vicinity of Buenavista hill and the fields along the Manzanares river.\n\nThe median [[per capita income]] of the inhabitants of Getafe is 10,000 \u20ac, which is lower than the 12,500 \u20ac median income of the community of Madrid. The most wealthy neighborhoods are Sector III and Getafe Norte, with a median income of 13,000 \u20ac. The poorest neighborhoods are La Alh\u00f3ndiga, Getafe Centro, and San Isidro, whose median incomes average 9,000 \u20ac. In January 2006, the [[unemployment]] rate was 8.4%\n{{clear}}\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[File:Calle con campanario de iglesia al fondo en Getafe.jpg|thumb|250px|Escuelas P\u00edas, a center of religious education founded in 1609]]\nGetafe has a number of monuments and areas of interest pertaining to its history.

Many of these groups have created ''Casas Regionales'' (''Regional Houses''), places were people from similar regional backgrounds can meet for cultural activities. Some of the more prominent Casas Regionales are those of [[Extremadura]], [[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Murcia]], [[Andalusia]], and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]]. The [[Conservatorio Profesional de M\u00fasica de Getafe]] offers concerts of classical music in its 400-seats concert hall.\n\n=== Celebrations and holidays ===\nThe patron saint's day in Getafe is celebrated 40 days after [[Easter Sunday]], which means that the feast day occurs on a different day each year.

The feast officially begin on that Saturday, but celebrations generally begin nine days prior, on the day of the Ascension\u2014the day that the Virgin of the Angels descended from the Cerro de los \u00c1ngeles.\n\nNine days after the ascension, the celebrations begin officially. The \"s\u00e1bado de las fiestas\" (''Saturday of the festivities''), as it is popularly known, begins with an address in the Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n, following an explosive display of the concussive effects of co-ordinated firecracker and fireworks barrages in the Calle Jardines. A fair is held during these days on the fairgrounds, political parties set up stalls on the Calle Ferrocarril, and there are a number of cultural activities, including concerts and bull fights. A week after the beginning of festivities, a procession passes through the center of town, during which caramels and trinkets are thrown into the crowds. The festivities end eight days after the opening address.\n\nA number of cultural activities occur during the days of Christmas, such as special Christmas concerts, a large Christmas pageant in the interior patio of the Hospitalillo de San Jos\u00e9, and the processions of the [[Three Wise Men]] on 5 January.

The climate, the local produce, and history have contributed to the development of this varied gastronomy. The dishes most representative of Getafe are the ''cocido madrile\u00f1o'', tripe ''a la madrile\u00f1a'', chickpea stew, Spanish omelette, sea bream ''a la madrile\u00f1a'', red cabbage, and others.

With his help, the rebels retake the former Medician capital of Manaea and destroy the Vis Electra power plant, a symbol of Ravello's power. In response, troops are sent to destroy the coastal town of Costa del Porto as retribution, only to be defeated by the rebels. Dimah and her team inform Rico and Mario that Di Ravello has been mining Bavarium, a valuable mineral found only on Medici, so that he can use it to build the most powerful arsenal the world has ever seen.\n\nWhile retrieving an experimental scanner for Dimah, Rico discovers his former Agency contact, Tom Sheldon, is also working with the rebellion. As he does not trust Sheldon to have the rebels's interests in mind, he sabotages the scanner before delivering it to him. Mario assigns Rico to rescue Zeno Antithikara, a Bavarium researcher seeking to defect from the regime. In response, Di Ravello has one of his new Bavarium missiles fired directly into the heart of rebel territory, the province of Baia. At the last second, Rico is able to manually maneuver the missile off its course and crash it into Di Ravello\u2019s command base on the southern islands at the top of the mountain Cima Leon. The rebels hold a celebration, during which Rico arrives with wine stolen from Di Ravello's estate.\n\nA few months later, the regime sends a small fleet to kill Mario and Dimah while they are out at sea. In the process of saving them, Rico meets Annika and Teo, a pair of South African smugglers waging their own war on Di Ravello. After Mario sustains a serious wound during the fight, Annika offers to aid the rebellion in exchange for Rico's help in stealing Di Ravello's Imperators, tanks equipped with protective shields powered by Bavarium. In addition to destroying a number of the tanks, Rico also helps the smugglers destroy the regime's Bavarium refineries and mines, as well as test out an experimental EMP device created using technology from the Imperators. However, the rebels begin to suffer a series of defeats on the battlefield, which Rico attributes to a mole in their ranks. In a push to wipe out the rebellion, Di Ravello orders a full-scale attack on Mario's coastal hideout. Rico rallies the rebels to defeat the invasion forces, reducing Di Ravello's control to only one region of Medici after igniting an unstable reactor at another command base at Corda Dracon.\n\nRosa Manuela, a Medician politician and old rival of Di Ravello's, returns to Medici to form a government opposed to his regime. At the same time, Zeno is identified as the mole. With help from the smugglers, Rico destroys a train carrying Bavarium for export and frees the prisoners working in Di Ravello's last remaining mines. WiFi cho 8Sheldon and Dimah, he also prevents Di Ravello from selling a Bavarium bomb by detonating the bomb inside the plane transporting it. Afterwards, Di Ravello orders the military to attack the rebel-held part of the wall, as a diversion to break Zeno out of jail. Zeno attempts to escape by helicopter, but Rico manages to kill him.\n\nThe rebels make a final push to end Di Ravello's rule by attacking his central command at Falco Maxime, during which Dimah sacrifices herself to wipe out all known information about Bavarium, including herself. With his forces in disarray, Di Ravello confronts Rico in an active volcano, piloting his personal Urga Mstitel helicopter. After destroying the chopper, the player is given the choice to shoot Di Ravello dead. If they wait too long, he will commit suicide by throwing himself into a lava pit.

It was released worldwide in December 2015, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\nSet six years after its predecessor, ''Just Cause 3'' follows series protagonist Rico Rodriguez as he returns to his homeland of Medici, a fictional [[Mediterranean]] [[island country]] under the control of dictator General Sebastiano Di Ravello. The game is played from a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]] and allows players to explore the island of Medici in an [[open world]] environment.\n\n''Just Cause 3'' received mixed reviews; critics praised its open-ended gameplay, destruction mechanics and emphasis on player agency, while criticism was directed at its narrative, which some considered clich\u00e9d and uninspired, and performance issues, particularly on the console versions of the game.\n\nA sequel, ''[[Just Cause 4]]'', was released in December 2018.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Just Cause 3 gameplay.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Just Cause 3 gameplay|A screenshot of an ongoing liberation of a town]]\n''Just Cause 3'' is an [[action-adventure game]], played from a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]].

With his help, the rebels retake the former Medician capital of Manaea and destroy the Vis Electra power plant, a symbol of Ravello's power. In response, troops are sent to destroy the coastal town of Costa del Porto as retribution, only to be defeated by the rebels. Dimah and her team inform Rico and Mario that Di Ravello has been mining Bavarium, a valuable mineral found only on Medici, so that he can use it to build the most powerful arsenal the world has ever seen.\n\nWhile retrieving an experimental scanner for Dimah, Rico discovers his former Agency contact, Tom Sheldon, is also working with the rebellion. As he does not trust Sheldon to have the rebels's interests in mind, he sabotages the scanner before delivering it to him. Mario assigns Rico to rescue Zeno Antithikara, a Bavarium researcher seeking to defect from the regime. In response, Di Ravello has one of his new Bavarium missiles fired directly into the heart of rebel territory, the province of Baia. At the last second, Rico is able to manually maneuver the missile off its course and crash it into Di Ravello\u2019s command base on the southern islands at the top of the mountain Cima Leon. The rebels hold a celebration, during which Rico arrives with wine stolen from Di Ravello's estate.\n\nA few months later, the regime sends a small fleet to kill Mario and Dimah while they are out at sea. In the process of saving them, Rico meets Annika and Teo, a pair of South African smugglers waging their own war on Di Ravello. After Mario sustains a serious wound during the fight, Annika offers to aid the rebellion in exchange for Rico's help in stealing Di Ravello's Imperators, tanks equipped with protective shields powered by Bavarium. In addition to destroying a number of the tanks, Rico also helps the smugglers destroy the regime's Bavarium refineries and mines, as well as test out an experimental EMP device created using technology from the Imperators. However, the rebels begin to suffer a series of defeats on the battlefield, which Rico attributes to a mole in their ranks. In a push to wipe out the rebellion, Di Ravello orders a full-scale attack on Mario's coastal hideout. Rico rallies the rebels to defeat the invasion forces, reducing Di Ravello's control to only one region of Medici after igniting an unstable reactor at another command base at Corda Dracon.\n\nRosa Manuela, a Medician politician and old rival of Di Ravello's, returns to Medici to form a government opposed to his regime. At the same time, Zeno is identified as the mole. With help from the smugglers, Rico destroys a train carrying Bavarium for export and frees the prisoners working in Di Ravello's last remaining mines. With Sheldon and Dimah, he also prevents Di Ravello from selling a Bavarium bomb by detonating the bomb inside the plane transporting it. Afterwards, Di Ravello orders the military to attack the rebel-held part of the wall, as a diversion to break Zeno out of jail. Zeno attempts to escape by helicopter, but Rico manages to kill him.\n\nThe rebels make a final push to end Di Ravello's rule by attacking his central command at Falco Maxime, during which Dimah sacrifices herself to wipe out all known information about Bavarium, including herself. With his forces in disarray, Di Ravello confronts Rico in an active volcano, piloting his personal Urga Mstitel helicopter. After destroying the chopper, the player is given the choice to shoot Di Ravello dead. If they wait too long, he will commit suicide by throwing himself into a lava pit. Rosa forms a new Republic of Medici, assuming the office of President.\n\n== Development ==\nThe development of ''Just Cause 3'' began in 2012,<ref name=\"VentureBeatInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/16/just-cause-3-creators-says-we-need-not-so-serious-shooters-interview/|title=Just Cause 3 creators say we need silly shooters, too|first=Dean |last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}</ref> and was handled by Avalanche Studios' satellite studio in New York, which has around 75 staff members, while the main studio in Sweden focused on the development of ''[[Mad Max (2015 video game)|Mad Max]]'', which was announced in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/12/5404214/just-cause-3-avalanche-studios|title=Just Cause, Mad Max and the future of Avalanche Studios|first=Brian |last=Crecente|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}</ref> The game's controls received an overhaul, and several members from [[Criterion Games]], the developer of the racing video game series ''[[Burnout (series)|Burnout]]'', joined the studios and worked on the vehicle handling of the game.<ref name=\"GI Feature 1\" /> Inspiration for the game's asynchronous multiplayer was taken from racing games like ''[[Need for Speed]]'' and ''[[Forza Horizon 2]]'', while the \"Destruction Frenzy\" mechanic was inspired by the ''[[Red Faction (series)|Red Faction]]'' series.<ref name=\"GRadarPreview\" /> Inspirations for the game were drawn from the modding community of ''Just Cause 2''.

However, many Turks pronounce it differently as \"Selam\u00fcn aleyk\u00fcm\".\n* In [[Pakistan]], the greeting is also associated with shaking right hands and is also often accompanied with a hug when meeting infrequently (only between the same gender). In some places, people put a hand on their heart as they shake your hand and greet. Also, the full greeting is preferred versus the shorter greeting, \"salam\". Goodbye is supplanted by a \"Khuda Hafiz\" (secular/less formal or to an acquaintance) or \"Allah Hafiz\" (less secular/generally to strangers, formal), both of which mean \"May God keep you safe\".\n* In [[India]], the greeting mostly among Muslims is accompanied by raising the right hand to the chest (arz hai \"regards\"; adaab \"respect\") or a simple handshake or hug, the shorter greeting \"Salam\" is used in informal situations.

In this way more adherent males and females may greet though touching \u2013 but remain true to the [[Islam]]ic or cultural teachings forbidding physical contact between the genders. Occasionally, the right hand will touch the left breast or heart area after this.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Indonesia's [[Javanese people|Javanese/Sasak]] culture, a remnant of feudalism is retained, where an elder's proffered right hand is taken and pressed briefly against the forehead. Some may instead briefly kiss the hand or the main ring. This is very common for young children to greet older relatives (of their parents' age, though, on occasion, if very polite children, younger). In slang words, this greeting is sometimes referred as \"samlekom\".\n* Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as ''A.S.'', ''As'kum'' (in [[Malaysia]]), or ''AsA'' is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using [[Short Message Service|SMS]] (some scholar forbid to used these shortcut due to no meaning or improper word){{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of [[Peace be upon him (Islam)|''\u1e63all\u0101 ll\u0101hu \u02bfalayhi wa-sallam'']].\n* In [[Chechnya]] and other parts of Caucasus, Salam Aleykum is used to say hi.\n* In [[Senegal]] which has a majority of Islam with [[Sufi]]-orientation, it is a common greeting.

However, many Turks pronounce it differently as \"Selam\u00fcn aleyk\u00fcm\".\n* In [[Pakistan]], the greeting is also associated with shaking right hands and is also often accompanied with a hug when meeting infrequently (only between the same gender). In some places, people put a hand on their heart as they shake your hand and greet. Also, the full greeting is preferred versus the shorter greeting, \"salam\". Goodbye is supplanted by a \"Khuda Hafiz\" (secular/less formal or to an acquaintance) or \"Allah Hafiz\" (less secular/generally to strangers, formal), both of which mean \"May God keep you safe\".\n* In [[India]], the greeting mostly among Muslims is accompanied by raising the right hand to the chest (arz hai \"regards\"; adaab \"respect\") or a simple handshake or hug, the shorter greeting \"Salam\" is used in informal situations.

In this way more adherent males and females may greet though touching \u2013 but remain true to the [[Islam]]ic or cultural teachings forbidding physical contact between the genders. Occasionally, the right hand will touch the left breast or heart area after this.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Indonesia's [[Javanese people|Javanese/Sasak]] culture, a remnant of feudalism is retained, where an elder's proffered right hand is taken and pressed briefly against the forehead. Some may instead briefly kiss the hand or the main ring. This is very common for young children to greet older relatives (of their parents' age, though, on occasion, if very polite children, younger). In slang words, this greeting is sometimes referred as \"samlekom\".\n* Shortening the greeting to acronyms, such as ''A.S.'', ''As'kum'' (in [[Malaysia]]), or ''AsA'' is becoming common amongst Internet users in chat rooms and by people using [[Short Message Service|SMS]] (some scholar forbid to used these shortcut due to no meaning or improper word){{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. This trend is similar to writing (S) or SAWS in place of [[Peace be upon him (Islam)|''\u1e63all\u0101 ll\u0101hu \u02bfalayhi wa-sallam'']].\n* In [[Chechnya]] and other parts of Caucasus, Salam Aleykum is used to say hi.\n* In [[Senegal]] which has a majority of Islam with [[Sufi]]-orientation, it is a common greeting.

Abundant water results in clear springs during early summer, but as the season progresses and the water supply decreases, springs change successively to turbid, warm pools, spattering [[mudpot]]s, and finally steaming fumaroles. There are no true [[geyser]]s within Lassen Volcanic National Park.\n\nGases from hot springs are composed mostly of [[steam]] and [[carbon dioxide]], with minor amounts of other gases. These react with the rocks around the springs to ultimately form [[opal]] if temperature and [[acid]]ity are high, or [[Kaolinite|kaolin]] if they are low. Deposits of [[sulfur]], [[pyrite]], [[quartz]] and other substances are also found around the springs and in their runoff channels.\n\n[[Metasomatism|Solfataric alteration]] within the caldera of Mount Tehama covers about five square miles,<ref name=\"NPS-Lassen-Volcanoes/Lava Flows\"/> much more extensive than the present hot springs basins. indicative of its former extent and suggestive of its waning activity.

As part of Mount Tehama's main vent, Bumpass Hell is the result of fissures that tap the volcanic heat, thought to be a cooling mass of andesite, perhaps three miles (5&nbsp;km) below the surface.\n\nIt is named after [[Kendall Vanhook Bumpass]], a [[cowboy]] and early settler who worked in the [[Lassen Peak]] area in the 1860s. Bumpass discovered the geothermal feature and was named on a mining claim for the area. In 1865 the editor of the ''Red Bluff Independent'' newspaper took a trip with Bumpass to see the locale.  During this trip Bumpass broke through a thin crust above a scalding hot mudpot; his leg was badly scalded and eventually had to be [[amputation|amputated]].<ref>[https://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=swbumpas&id=I5006 Entry for \"Bumpass, Kendall VanHook\" at RootsWeb.com]</ref> The area was named in his honor.{{clear}}\n\n== Devils Kitchen ==\nAbout {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Lassen Peak is '''Devils Kitchen'''.

Most of these lie in or are closely adjacent to [[Mount Tehama]]'s caldera. ''Bumpass Hell'' is the most spectacular of these, but others of importance are ''Sulphur Works'', ''Little Hot Springs Valley'', ''Boiling Springs Lake'' and ''Devil's Kitchen''. In each thermal area, the highest temperature of water generally is close to the boiling temperature at the altitude of the particular spring or fumarole&nbsp;\u2014 {{convert|198|F|C|0}} at Bumpass Hell and {{convert|191|F|C|0}} on the northwest flanks of Lassen Peak.<ref name=\"NPS-Lassen-Volcanoes/Lava Flows\">NPS: Lassen Volcanic National Park, Nature & science, Volcanoes / Lava Flows</ref> Temperatures as high as {{convert|230|F|C|0}} have been recorded in the park.\n\nSpring activity varies with water supply. Abundant water results in clear springs during early summer, but as the season progresses and the water supply decreases, springs change successively to turbid, warm pools, spattering [[mudpot]]s, and finally steaming fumaroles. There are no true [[geyser]]s within Lassen Volcanic National Park.\n\nGases from hot springs are composed mostly of [[steam]] and [[carbon dioxide]], with minor amounts of other gases. These react with the rocks around the springs to ultimately form [[opal]] if temperature and [[acid]]ity are high, or [[Kaolinite|kaolin]] if they are low. Deposits of [[sulfur]], [[pyrite]], [[quartz]] and other substances are also found around the springs and in their runoff channels.\n\n[[Metasomatism|Solfataric alteration]] within the caldera of Mount Tehama covers about five square miles,<ref name=\"NPS-Lassen-Volcanoes/Lava Flows\"/> much more extensive than the present hot springs basins. indicative of its former extent and suggestive of its waning activity. It is the altered materials in the caldera that yielded most readily to the forces of [[erosion]]. Diamond Peak is a body of unaltered rock that still remains, because it is more resistant.\n\n==Sulphur Works and Little Hot Springs Valley==\n[[File:Sulpher Works in Lassen VNP-750px.JPG|thumb|Sulphur Works]]\n[[File:Mudpot at Lassen Volcanic National Park in August 2019.webm|thumb|Boiling mudpot, Sulphur Works]]\nAs in many hydrothermally active areas, the rocks at '''Sulphur Works''' and '''Little Hot Springs Valley''' in Lassen Volcanic National Park have been chemically altered into bright-colored [[clay]]s. [[Sulfurous acid]] and [[sulfuric acid]] have broken down hard, gray-green [[andesite]] lavas into red, yellow and buff clays and [[iron oxide]]s. Many visitors pass through Sulphur Works on their way north on [[California State Route 89|State Route 89]] and sense the rotten-egg smell ([[hydrogen sulfide]]) when they pass by a hot vent to the east of the road. Sulphur Works is said to be the volcanic center of the ancestral Mount Tehama.{{clear}}\n\n== {{Visible anchor|Bumpass Hell}} ==<!-- Other articles link here. -->\n[[File:Bumpass Hell in Lassen VNP-1200px.JPG|thumb|Bumpass Hell]]\n[[File:InsideBumpassHellWaterColors.JPG|thumb|Boiling Pools Inside Bumpass Hell]]\nNear Little Hot Springs Valley is '''Bumpass Hell''', a hydrothermally altered [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] area that spans 16 acres (6.5&nbsp;ha) and has hot springs, fumaroles, and boiling mudpots. As part of Mount Tehama's main vent, Bumpass Hell is the result of fissures that tap the volcanic heat, thought to be a cooling mass of andesite, perhaps three miles (5&nbsp;km) below the surface.\n\nIt is named after [[Kendall Vanhook Bumpass]], a [[cowboy]] and early settler who worked in the [[Lassen Peak]] area in the 1860s. Bumpass discovered the geothermal feature and was named on a mining claim for the area. In 1865 the editor of the ''Red Bluff Independent'' newspaper took a trip with Bumpass to see the locale.  During this trip Bumpass broke through a thin crust above a scalding hot mudpot; his leg was badly scalded and eventually had to be [[amputation|amputated]].<ref>[https://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=swbumpas&id=I5006 Entry for \"Bumpass, Kendall VanHook\" at RootsWeb.com]</ref> The area was named in his honor.{{clear}}\n\n== Devils Kitchen ==\nAbout {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Lassen Peak is '''Devils Kitchen'''. In this geothermal area the hot springs are so [[acid]]ic that they have eaten pits and holes in the [[bedrock]].\n\n==Terminal Geyser==\n[[File:Terminal Geyser Lassen NP.jpg|thumb|Terminal Geyser]]\nLocated in the southeast corner of the park, '''Terminal Geyser''' is not actually a geyser, but rather a cold stream flowing over a steam vent. This is about 100 feet (30 m) from the site of a geothermal [[Boring (earth)|boring]] operation that took place in 1962 and 1978. The 4,008-foot (1,222 m) well is now plugged and abandoned.{{clear}}\n\n==Boiling Springs Lake==\n[[File:Boiling Springs Lake Lassen NP.jpg|thumb|Boiling Springs Lake is acidic and very hot.

Unlike the more heavily visited areas of the park, this area is not developed with [[boardwalk]]s or signs and offers a chance to view thermal features in a more natural setting.\n\nIn 2012, scientists studying the [[virus]]es in Boiling Springs Lake found the first known case of a natural hybrid or \"[[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]\" virus, apparently made of two different groups of viruses that [[recombination|recombined]] into a single [[organism]].<ref name=\"Diemer 2012 Viral chimera\">Diemer, Geoffrey S., Kenneth M.
