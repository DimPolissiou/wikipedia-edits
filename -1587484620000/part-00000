This position is equivalent to the position of [[Pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (France)|pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]] in France.\n\n=== Executive chairperson ===\nExecutive chairperson is an office separate from that of CEO, where the titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as [[Larry Ellison]] of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Douglas Flint]] of [[HSBC]] and [[Steve Case]] of the former [[WarnerMedia|AOL Time Warner]]. In particular, the group chair of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Before the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chair essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairperson oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html HSBC investors against Michael Geoghegan becoming chairman].

In some organizations they have the authority to hire staff and make financial decisions. In others they only make recommendations to a [[board of directors]], and or may have no executive powers, in which case they are mainly a [[spokesperson]] for the organization. The power given depends upon the type of organization, its structure, and the rules it has created for itself.\n\n=== Disciplinary procedures ===\nIf the chairperson exceeds their authority, engages in misconduct, or fails to perform their duties, they may face disciplinary procedures. Such procedures may include [[censure]], suspension, or [[Declare the chair vacant|removal from office]]. The rules of the organization would provide details on who can perform these disciplinary procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title=Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|website=The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher=The Robert's Rules Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112102258/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate=2004-11-12|url-status=dead|accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> Usually, whoever appointed or elected the chairperson has the power to discipline them.\n\n== Public corporations ==\nThere are three common types of chairperson in public corporations.\n\n=== Chairperson and CEO{{Anchor|Chairperson and CEO}}===\nThe CEO may also hold the title of chairperson, in which case the board frequently names an independent member of the board as a lead director. This position is equivalent to the position of [[Pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (France)|pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]] in France.\n\n=== Executive chairperson ===\nExecutive chairperson is an office separate from that of CEO, where the titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as [[Larry Ellison]] of [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Douglas Flint]] of [[HSBC]] and [[Steve Case]] of the former [[WarnerMedia|AOL Time Warner]]. In particular, the group chair of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Before the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chair essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairperson oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8019235/HSBC-investors-against-Michael-Geoghegan-becoming-chairman.html HSBC investors against Michael Geoghegan becoming chairman].

Across the world, many companies have separated the roles of chairperson and CEO, saying that this move improves corporate governance. The non-executive chairperson's duties are typically limited to matters directly related to the board, such as:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hvs.com/Jump/?aid=1033|title=The Non-Executive Chairman Comes of Age|last=Kefgen|first=Keith|date=2004-05-11|work=HVS web site|accessdate=2011-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027135952/http://www.hvs.com/Jump/?aid=1033|archive-date=27 October 2007|url-status=dead|publisher=HVS}}</ref>\n\n* Chairing the meetings of the board.\n* Organizing and coordinating the board's activities, such as by setting its annual agenda.\n* Reviewing and evaluating the performance of the CEO and the other board members.\n\n=== Examples ===\n[[File:Christina Magnuson group 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Christina Magnuson]] as Chairman<ref>{{cite web |title=We at Confidencen: Board and General Management |url=http://www.confidencen.se/en/vi-pa-confidencen/ |accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref> presides over the 2016 annual meeting of the Friends of the [[Confidencen|Ulriksdal Palace Theater]]]]\nMany US companies have an executive chairperson; this method of organization is sometimes called the American model.

Because the Russian-made Kornet is an accurate, laser-guided weapon, it appeared that the bus was intentionally targeted. The attackers were never apprehended. Hamas claimed the bus was traveling on a road used by Israeli military vehicles and it did not know that schoolchildren were on board. Israel said the yellow color of the bus made it easily identifiable and accused Hamas of \"crossing a line. The missile hit the bus after all but one of the children had been dropped off.

The suspect then shot the man and a child. An ambulance took the man to John Peter Smith Hospital, while the 10-year-old was taken to Cook Children's Hospital in a private vehicle. The boy was expected to undergo surgery, possibly to retrieve a projectile. The game was not a school-sponsored event. The shooting also did not involve any  students.
