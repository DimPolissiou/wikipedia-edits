The Chairperson of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the Presidents of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, and the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] (if they are a member of an EPP member party) are all ''ex officio'' Vice-Presidents.\n[[File:Donald_Tusk_(6165309851)_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|250px|President of the EPP [[Donald Tusk]]]]\n\nAs of November 2019 the Presidency<ref>{{Cite web|title = EPP Presidency|url = http://www.epp.eu/structure/presidency/|website = European People's Party}}</ref> of the EPP is (Vice Presidents in the order of votes received at the EPP Congress in Zagreb):\n\n*{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Donald Tusk]] \u2013 President (former Prime Minister and President of the European Council)\n*{{flagicon|Spain}} [[Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White]] \u2013 Secretary General (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Bulgaria}} [[Mariya Gabriel]] \u2013 Vice President (EU Commissioner)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[David McAllister]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP, former Minister-President)\n*{{flagicon|Ireland}} [[Helen McEntee]] \u2013 Vice President (Minister)\n*{{flagicon|Austria}} [[Johannes Hahn]] \u2013 Vice President (EU Commissioner)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Esther de Lange]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Antonio Tajani]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP, former European Parliament President, former Commission Vice President)\n*{{flagicon|Romania}} [[Siegfried Mure\u0219an]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Franck Proust]] \u2013 Vice President (former MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Paulo Rangel]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Petteri Orpo]] \u2013 Vice President (Leader of Kokoomus, former Minister of Finance)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Christian Schmidt (politician)|Christian Schmidt]] \u2013 Treasurer (MP, former Minister)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Ursula von der Leyen]] \u2013 ''Ex officio'' Vice-President (President-elect of the European Commission) \n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Manfred Weber]] \u2013 ''Ex officio'' Vice-President (Chairperson of the EPP Group in European Parliament) \n*{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] \u2013 Honorary President (President of Finland)\n\n===Political Assembly===\nThe Political Assembly defines the political positions of the EPP between Congresses, and decides on membership applications, political guidelines and the budget. The Political Assembly is composed of designated delegates from EPP member parties, associated parties, member associations and other affiliated groups. The Political Assembly meets at least three times a year.\n\n===Congress===\nThe Congress is the highest decision-making body of the EPP. It is composed of delegates from member parties, EPP associations, [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]] MEPs, the EPP Presidency, national heads of party and government, and European Commissioners who belong to a member party, with the numbers of delegates being weighted according to the EPP's share of MEPs, and individual delegates being elected by member parties according to member parties' rules.{{sfn|Jansen|Van Hecke|2011|p=109}}\n\nUnder the EPP's statutes the Congress must meet once every three years, but it also meets normally during the years of elections for the European Parliament (every five years), and extraordinary Congresses have also been summoned. The Congress elects the EPP Presidency every three years, decides on the main policy documents and electoral programmes, and provides a platform for the EPP's heads of government and party leaders.\n\n==Activities within the party==\n\n===Summit===\nEPP leaders meet for the EPP Summit a few hours before each meeting of the [[European Council]] in order to formulate common positions. Invitations are sent by the EPP President and attendees include, besides the members of the EPP's Presidency, all Presidents and Prime Ministers who are members of the European Council and belong to the EPP; the Presidents of the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Council]], as well as the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative for Foreign Affairs]], provided that they belong to the EPP; Deputy Prime Ministers or other ministers in those cases where the Prime Minister of a country does not belong to an EPP member party; and, where no EPP member party is part of a government, the leaders of the main EPP opposition party.\n\n[[File:EPP Summit March 2011 (65).jpg|thumb|center|600px|Reunion Picture at 2011 Summit]]\n\n===Ministerial meetings===\nFollowing the pattern of the EPP Summit the party also organises regular EPP Ministerial meetings before each meeting of the [[Council of the European Union]], with ministers, deputy ministers, secretaries of state and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] in the specific policy field attending:\n* General Affairs\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Economy and Finance\n* Home Affairs\n* Justice\n* Defence\n* Employment and Social Affairs\n* Industry\n* Agriculture\n* Energy\n* Environment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |title=EPP website |accessdate=23 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908152009/http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |archivedate=8 September 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nThe EPP also organises working groups on different issues and on an ad hoc basis, as well as meetings with its affiliated members in the [[European Commission]]. It also invites individual Commissioners to the EPP Summit meetings and to EPP Ministerial meetings.\n\nFollowing amendments to the EU Regulation that governs [[Europarties]] in 2007, the EPP, like the other \"Europarties\", is responsible for organising a pan-European campaign for the [[European elections]] every five years. According to the [[Lisbon Treaty]], the parties must present candidates for [[President of the European Commission]], but the EPP had already done this by endorsing [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] for a second term in April 2009.\n\nThe year 2014 saw the first fully fledged campaign of the EPP ahead of the [[2014 European Parliament election|European elections of that year]]. The party nominated former Luxembourgish Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] as its candidate for President of the European Commission and led a pan-European campaign in coordination with the national campaigns of all its member parties.\n\n== Activities within European institutions ==\nAs of December 2019, the EPP will hold the Presidency of the European Commission with [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (CDU).\n\n===Overview of the European institutions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The CES includes as members all the major national think tanks and foundations affiliated to EPP member parties: the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] (CDU), the [[Hanns Seidel Foundation]] (CSU), the [[FAES|Foundation for Analysis and Social Studies]] (PP), the [[Constantinos Karamanlis Institute for Democracy]] (ND), the [[Jarl Hjalmarson Foundation]] (MOD), the [[Political Academy of the Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) and others. During the European Parliament election campaign in 2009 the CES launched a web-based campaign module, tellbarroso.eu, to support [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], the EPP's candidate for re-election as Commission President.\n\nIn 2014, to honour [[Wilfried Martens]] \u2013 the late President of the EPP who was also President of the CES \u2013 changed its name to [[Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies]] or Martens Centre.\n\nThe current President of the Martens Centre is former Slovak Prime Minister [[Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda]].\n\nThe Budapest-based [[Robert Schuman Institute]] and the Luxembourg-based Robert Schuman Foundation are also affiliated with the European People's Party.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n== EPP associations ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}\n{{update|date=September 2015}}\nThe EPP is linked to several specific associations that focus on specific groups and organise seminars, forums, publications and other activities.\n\n===Small and Medium Entrepreneurs Europe (SME Europe)===\n{{main|SME Europe}}\nSME Europe is the official business organisation of the EPP, and serves as a network for pro-business politicians and political organisations. Its main objective is to shape EU policy in a more SME-friendly way in close cooperation with the SME Circle of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the [[Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (European Commission)|DG Enterprise]] and the pro-business organisations of the EPP's member parties. Its top priorities are to reform the legal framework for SMEs all over Europe, and to promote and support the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. SME Europe was founded in May 2012 by three Members of the European Parliament, [[Paul R\u00fcbig]], [[Nadezhda Neynsky]] and [[Bendt Bendtsen]].\n\n===European Democrat Students===\n{{main|European Democrat Students}}\nEuropean Democrat Students (EDS) is now the official students' organisation of the EPP, though it was founded in 1961, 15 years before the EPP itself. Led by Virgilio Falco, EDS has 40 member organisations, representing nearly 1,600,000 students and young people<ref>[http://thinkingeurope.eu/publications/students-right-way-european-democrat-students-1961-2011 Students on the Right Way: European Democrat Students 1961\u20132011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203172838/http://thinkingeurope.eu/publications/students-right-way-european-democrat-students-1961-2011 |date=3 February 2014 }}. thinkingeurope.eu.

It also regularly publishes a magazine, ''Bullseye'', and organises topical campaigns.\n\n===European Seniors' Union===\nFounded in [[Madrid]] in 1995 and led by Ann Hermans of the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|CD&V]], the European Seniors' Union (ESU) is the largest political senior citizens' organisation in Europe. The ESU is represented in 26 states with 45 organisations and about 500,000 members.\n\n===European Union of Christian Democratic Workers===\nThe European Union of Christian Democratic Workers (EUCDW) is the labour organisation of the EPP, with 24 member organisations in 18 different countries. As the officially recognised EPP association of workers, the EUCDW is led by [[Elmar Brok]], [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. It aims at the political unification of a democratic Europe, the development of the EPP on the basis of Christian social teaching, and the defence of workers' interests in European policy-making.\n\n===Women of the European People\u2019s Party===\nThe Women of the European People's Party (EPP Women) is recognised by the EPP as the official association of women from all like-minded political parties of Europe. EPP Women has more than 40 member organisations from countries of the European Union and beyond. All of them are women's organisations of political parties that are members of the EPP. EPP Women is led by [[Doris Pack]].\n\n===Youth of the European People\u2019s Party===\n{{main|Youth of the European People's Party}}\nThe Youth of the European People's Party (YEPP), led by L\u00eddia Pereira, is the EPP's official youth organisation. It has 64 member organisations, bringing together between one and two million young people in 40 countries.\n\n== Membership ==\n\nWithin the EPP there are three kinds of member organisations: full members, associate members and observers. Full members are parties from EU states. They have absolute rights to vote in all the EPP's organs and on all matters. Associate members have the same voting rights as full members except for matters concerning the EU's structure or policies. These associate members are parties from EU candidate countries and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] countries. Observer parties can participate in all the activities of the EPP, and attend the Congresses and Political Assemblies, but they do not have any voting rights.\n\nA special status of \"supporting member\" is granted by the Presidency to individuals and associations. Although they do not have voting rights, they can be invited by the President to attend meetings of certain organs of the party.\n\n=== Full member parties ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

It decides on the general political guidelines of the EPP and presides over its Political Assembly. The Presidency is composed of the President, ten Vice-Presidents, the Honorary Presidents, the Secretary General and the Treasurer. The Chairperson of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the Presidents of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, and the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative]] (if they are a member of an EPP member party) are all ''ex officio'' Vice-Presidents.\n[[File:Donald_Tusk_(6165309851)_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|250px|President of the EPP [[Donald Tusk]]]]\n\nAs of November 2019 the Presidency<ref>{{Cite web|title = EPP Presidency|url = http://www.epp.eu/structure/presidency/|website = European People's Party}}</ref> of the EPP is (Vice Presidents in the order of votes received at the EPP Congress in Zagreb):\n\n*{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Donald Tusk]] \u2013 President (former Prime Minister and President of the European Council)\n*{{flagicon|Spain}} [[Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White]] \u2013 Secretary General (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Bulgaria}} [[Mariya Gabriel]] \u2013 Vice President (EU Commissioner)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[David McAllister]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP, former Minister-President)\n*{{flagicon|Ireland}} [[Helen McEntee]] \u2013 Vice President (Minister)\n*{{flagicon|Austria}} [[Johannes Hahn]] \u2013 Vice President (EU Commissioner)\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Esther de Lange]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Antonio Tajani]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP, former European Parliament President, former Commission Vice President)\n*{{flagicon|Romania}} [[Siegfried Mure\u0219an]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Franck Proust]] \u2013 Vice President (former MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Portugal}} [[Paulo Rangel]] \u2013 Vice President (MEP)\n*{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Petteri Orpo]] \u2013 Vice President (Leader of Kokoomus, former Minister of Finance)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Christian Schmidt (politician)|Christian Schmidt]] \u2013 Treasurer (MP, former Minister)\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Ursula von der Leyen]] \u2013 ''Ex officio'' Vice-President (President-elect of the European Commission) \n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Manfred Weber]] \u2013 ''Ex officio'' Vice-President (Chairperson of the EPP Group in European Parliament) \n*{{flagicon|Finland}} [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] \u2013 Honorary President (President of Finland)\n\n===Political Assembly===\nThe Political Assembly defines the political positions of the EPP between Congresses, and decides on membership applications, political guidelines and the budget. The Political Assembly is composed of designated delegates from EPP member parties, associated parties, member associations and other affiliated groups. The Political Assembly meets at least three times a year.\n\n===Congress===\nThe Congress is the highest decision-making body of the EPP. It is composed of delegates from member parties, EPP associations, [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]] MEPs, the EPP Presidency, national heads of party and government, and European Commissioners who belong to a member party, with the numbers of delegates being weighted according to the EPP's share of MEPs, and individual delegates being elected by member parties according to member parties' rules.{{sfn|Jansen|Van Hecke|2011|p=109}}\n\nUnder the EPP's statutes the Congress must meet once every three years, but it also meets normally during the years of elections for the European Parliament (every five years), and extraordinary Congresses have also been summoned. The Congress elects the EPP Presidency every three years, decides on the main policy documents and electoral programmes, and provides a platform for the EPP's heads of government and party leaders.\n\n==Activities within the party==\n\n===Summit===\nEPP leaders meet for the EPP Summit a few hours before each meeting of the [[European Council]] in order to formulate common positions. Invitations are sent by the EPP President and attendees include, besides the members of the EPP's Presidency, all Presidents and Prime Ministers who are members of the European Council and belong to the EPP; the Presidents of the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Commission]] and the [[European Council]], as well as the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative for Foreign Affairs]], provided that they belong to the EPP; Deputy Prime Ministers or other ministers in those cases where the Prime Minister of a country does not belong to an EPP member party; and, where no EPP member party is part of a government, the leaders of the main EPP opposition party.\n\n[[File:EPP Summit March 2011 (65).jpg|thumb|center|600px|Reunion Picture at 2011 Summit]]\n\n===Ministerial meetings===\nFollowing the pattern of the EPP Summit the party also organises regular EPP Ministerial meetings before each meeting of the [[Council of the European Union]], with ministers, deputy ministers, secretaries of state and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] in the specific policy field attending:\n* General Affairs\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Economy and Finance\n* Home Affairs\n* Justice\n* Defence\n* Employment and Social Affairs\n* Industry\n* Agriculture\n* Energy\n* Environment<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |title=EPP website |accessdate=23 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908152009/http://epp.eu/council.asp?z=5D5A |archivedate=8 September 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nThe EPP also organises working groups on different issues and on an ad hoc basis, as well as meetings with its affiliated members in the [[European Commission]]. It also invites individual Commissioners to the EPP Summit meetings and to EPP Ministerial meetings.\n\nFollowing amendments to the EU Regulation that governs [[Europarties]] in 2007, the EPP, like the other \"Europarties\", is responsible for organising a pan-European campaign for the [[European elections]] every five years. According to the [[Lisbon Treaty]], the parties must present candidates for [[President of the European Commission]], but the EPP had already done this by endorsing [[Jose Manuel Barroso]] for a second term in April 2009.\n\nThe year 2014 saw the first fully fledged campaign of the EPP ahead of the [[2014 European Parliament election|European elections of that year]]. The party nominated former Luxembourgish Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] as its candidate for President of the European Commission and led a pan-European campaign in coordination with the national campaigns of all its member parties.\n\n== Activities within European institutions ==\nAs of December 2019, the EPP will hold the Presidency of the European Commission with [[Ursula von der Leyen]] (CDU).\n\n===Overview of the European institutions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its main objective is to shape EU policy in a more SME-friendly way in close cooperation with the SME Circle of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, the [[Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (European Commission)|DG Enterprise]] and the pro-business organisations of the EPP's member parties. Its top priorities are to reform the legal framework for SMEs all over Europe, and to promote and support the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises. SME Europe was founded in May 2012 by three Members of the European Parliament, [[Paul R\u00fcbig]], [[Nadezhda Neynsky]] and [[Bendt Bendtsen]].\n\n===European Democrat Students===\n{{main|European Democrat Students}}\nEuropean Democrat Students (EDS) is now the official students' organisation of the EPP, though it was founded in 1961, 15 years before the EPP itself.

The ESU is represented in 26 states with 45 organisations and about 500,000 members.\n\n===European Union of Christian Democratic Workers===\nThe European Union of Christian Democratic Workers (EUCDW) is the labour organisation of the EPP, with 24 member organisations in 18 different countries. As the officially recognised EPP association of workers, the EUCDW is led by [[Elmar Brok]], [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. It aims at the political unification of a democratic Europe, the development of the EPP on the basis of Christian social teaching, and the defence of workers' interests in European policy-making.\n\n===Women of the European People\u2019s Party===\nThe Women of the European People's Party (EPP Women) is recognised by the EPP as the official association of women from all like-minded political parties of Europe.

It has 64 member organisations, bringing together between one and two million young people in 40 countries.\n\n== Membership ==\n\nWithin the EPP there are three kinds of member organisations: full members, associate members and observers. Full members are parties from EU states. They have absolute rights to vote in all the EPP's organs and on all matters. Associate members have the same voting rights as full members except for matters concerning the EU's structure or policies. These associate members are parties from EU candidate countries and [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] countries. Observer parties can participate in all the activities of the EPP, and attend the Congresses and Political Assemblies, but they do not have any voting rights.\n\nA special status of \"supporting member\" is granted by the Presidency to individuals and associations. Although they do not have voting rights, they can be invited by the President to attend meetings of certain organs of the party.\n\n=== Full member parties ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"

''Split'' is noted as the first solo [[supervillain]] origin movie. It is also Shyamalan's first sequel. The final part of the trilogy, titled ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'', was released in January&nbsp;2019, combining the casts and characters of both previous films.\n\n==Plot==\nCasey Cooke is a withdrawn teenager, having been molested as a child by her uncle and legal guardian, John. After being invited to a birthday party, she accepts a ride home from her classmate Claire's father, who also takes Claire's friend Marcia. As the girls wait in the car, Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), knocks Claire's father unconscious before kidnapping them.\n\nKevin is in therapy with Dr. Karen Fletcher, who has identified 23 distinct personalities formed after Kevin was a abused as a child by his mother after his father left on a train one day and never returned. The dominant personality, \"Barry,\" controls when and which of the others can manifest. \"Barry\" has refused \"Dennis\" or \"Patricia\" to have control tendency due to their undesirable traits and their belief in \"The Beast,\" an 24th personality who plans to rid the world of the \"impure\". Fletcher recognizes in their sessions that \"Dennis\" has recently displaced \"Barry\" as the dominant personality.  \n\n\"Denis\" imprisons the girls in an underground cell. By taking advantage of a childlike personality called \"Hedwig\", the girls attempt to escape and Casey manages to find a walkie-talkie but her attempts to get help are dismissed as a prank. The girls are separated from each other by \"Denis\" and \"Patricia\". Fletcher visits Kevin's quarters, where he reveals that he has met \"The Beast\". Fletcher realises that there is an internal conflict between the personalities and becomes suspicious. She feigns going to the bathroom, finds Claire who is locked in a storage room. \"Dennis\" appears and sedates Fletcher. \"Dennis\" goes to a train station, where he boards an empty train car, which allows \"The Beast\" to take over, who has enhanced physical abilities. Fletcher writes Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before \"The Beast\" arrives and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that \"The Beast\" has already killed and [[Human cannibalism|eaten]] some of Marcia and sees him attack Claire too. Casey finds Fletcher's body and the piece of paper. \"The Beast\" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control for two years, a horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden.\n\nThis prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control and \"Hedwig\" is the victor. Casey is told that \"Kevin\" has been made to sleep far away, and he will not awaken now even if his name is called. \"Hedwig\" gives control over to \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\" and they once again let \"The Beast\" take hold. Casey retrieves the gun and ammunition before escaping into a tunnel, where she shoots \"The Beast\" twice who only sustains minor wounds. She locks herself in a caged area whose bars \"The Beast\" begins to pull apart. He sees faded self-harm scars across her body, considers Casey to be \"pure\" and more evolved due to her being \"broken,\" and spares her.\n\nCasey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where Kevin had been an employee. When Casey is asked by the police if she is ready to return home with her uncle, she hesitates to answer. In another hideout, \"Dennis,\" \"Patricia,\" and \"Hedwig\" discuss the power of \"The Beast\" and their plans to change the world. In a diner, several patrons watch a news report on Kevin's crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous personalities have earned him the nickname \"The Horde.\" A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier and who also received a nickname.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As depicted in the 2000 film ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]''.}} As she tries to remember the nickname, the man sitting next to her, [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], says it was \"[[Glass (2019 film)|Mr. Glass]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Kevin Wendell Crumb / Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Barry / Orwell / Jade / The Horde: a sufferer of dissociative identity disorder (DID), who has 23&nbsp;prominent personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives. Kevin's body chemistry changes with each personality, resulting in his 24th and final personality, \"The Beast\": a grotesque and cannibalistic sociopath with superhuman capabilities, such as inhuman bodily strength, enhanced speed and agility, along with near-invulnerability and unnatural mobility, to the point of being able to scale walls and ceilings, but resulting in his insatiable hunger for raw human flesh.\n* [[Anya Taylor-Joy]] as Casey Cooke, a teenage girl with a traumatic past and a history of [[self-harm]], who is kidnapped by \"Dennis\", one of Kevin's personalities, to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n**Izzie Coffey as 5&nbsp;year-old Casey\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Karen Fletcher, a [[psychologist]] who attempts to help Kevin with his DID, and believes that DID can, in extreme cases, cause physiological changes.\n* [[Haley Lu Richardson]] as Claire Benoit, Mr.&nbsp;Benoit's daughter, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Marcia, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Jessica Sula]] as Marcia, a classmate of Casey and a friend of Claire, who is also kidnapped by \"Dennis\" to be sacrificed to the Beast.\n* [[Brad William Henke]] as John Cooke, Casey's paternal uncle.\n* [[Sebastian Arcelus]] as Mr. Cooke, Casey's father.\n* [[Neal Huff]] as Mr. Benoit, Claire's father.\n* [[Kim Director]] as Hannah.\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as academic moderator.\n* [[M.

He explained, \"In this case I had written the character a while ago, and I had written out a few scenes of it, so I even had dialogue written out, which is really unusual for me. It sat there for a long time, and I really don't have a clear reason why I didn't pull the trigger earlier.

An article from [[CNN]] stated that [[mental health]] advocates warn that the film stigmatizes [[dissociative identity disorder]] and may directly impact those living with it. \"You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate [[symptoms]] in thousands of people who are already suffering,\" [[Psychiatrist]] Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's [[Icahn School of Medicine]], said immediately after seeing the film. In contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. But movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of [[mental illness]] that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some [[psychiatrists]], she said. Amelia Joubert, an 18-year-old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder said she thinks \"Split\" is having a larger impact for younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as \"Psycho\" and \"Identity,\" that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that \"Split\" may deter young people from coming out and seeking help. Joubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nedelman |first1=Michael |title=What Shyamalan's 'Split' gets wrong about dissociative identity disorder |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/shyamalan-split-movie-dissociative-identity-disorder/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=42}}</ref> In a statement about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in [[jail]] over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based [[psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]], said he had not seen the movie \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cWhat concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a [[Mental disorder|disorder]] that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering \u2014 the [[abuse]] of innocent children,\u201d Itzkowitz told [[Healthline]]. He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don\u2019t know how much the person may be affected by their condition. When films and stories \u201cvilify and demonize [[mental illness]] in general, and DID in particular,\u201d the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.

''Split'' is noted as the first solo [[supervillain]] origin movie. It is also Shyamalan's first sequel. The final part of the trilogy, titled ''[[Glass (2019 film)|Glass]]'', was released in January&nbsp;2019, combining the casts and characters of both previous films.\n\n==Plot==\nCasey Cooke is a withdrawn teenager, having been molested as a child by her uncle and legal guardian, John. After being invited to a birthday party, she accepts a ride home from her classmate Claire's father, who also takes Claire's friend Marcia. As the girls wait in the car, Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from [[dissociative identity disorder]] (DID), knocks Claire's father unconscious before kidnapping them.\n\nKevin is in therapy with Dr. Karen Fletcher, who has identified 23 distinct personalities formed after Kevin was a abused as a child by his mother after his father [[Unbreakable (film)|left on a train one day and never returned]]. The dominant personality, \"Barry,\" controls when and which of the others can manifest. \"Barry\" has refused \"Dennis\" or \"Patricia\" to have control tendency due to their undesirable traits and their belief in \"The Beast,\" an 24th personality who plans to rid the world of the \"impure\". Fletcher recognizes in their sessions that \"Dennis\" has recently displaced \"Barry\" as the dominant personality.  \n\n\"Denis\" imprisons the girls in an underground cell. By taking advantage of a childlike personality called \"Hedwig\", the girls attempt to escape and Casey manages to find a walkie-talkie but her attempts to get help are dismissed as a prank. The girls are separated from each other by \"Denis\" and \"Patricia\". Fletcher visits Kevin's quarters, where he reveals that he has met \"The Beast\". Fletcher realises that there is an internal conflict between the personalities and becomes suspicious. She feigns going to the bathroom, finds Claire who is locked in a storage room. \"Dennis\" appears and sedates Fletcher. \"Dennis\" goes to a train station, where he boards an empty train car, which allows \"The Beast\" to take over, who has enhanced physical abilities. Fletcher writes Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before \"The Beast\" arrives and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that \"The Beast\" has already killed and [[Human cannibalism|eaten]] some of Marcia and sees him attack Claire too. Casey finds Fletcher's body and the piece of paper. \"The Beast\" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he has not been in control for two years, a horrified Kevin begs Casey to kill him with a shotgun he has hidden.\n\nThis prompts all 24 personalities to fight for control and \"Hedwig\" is the victor. Casey is told that \"Kevin\" has been made to sleep far away, and he will not awaken now even if his name is called. \"Hedwig\" gives control over to \"Dennis\" and \"Patricia\" and they once again let \"The Beast\" take hold. Casey retrieves the gun and ammunition before escaping into a tunnel, where she shoots \"The Beast\" twice who only sustains minor wounds. She locks herself in a caged area whose bars \"The Beast\" begins to pull apart. He sees faded self-harm scars across her body, considers Casey to be \"pure\" and more evolved due to her being \"broken,\" and spares her.\n\nCasey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the [[Philadelphia Zoo]], where Kevin had been an employee. When Casey is asked by the police if she is ready to return home with her uncle, she hesitates to answer. In another hideout, \"Dennis,\" \"Patricia,\" and \"Hedwig\" discuss the power of \"The Beast\" and their plans to change the world. In a diner, several patrons watch a news report on Kevin's crimes, with the correspondent mentioning that his numerous personalities have earned him the nickname \"The Horde.\" A waitress notes the similarity to a criminal in a wheelchair who was incarcerated fifteen years earlier and who also received a nickname.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|As depicted in the 2000 film ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]''.}} As she tries to remember the nickname, the man sitting next to her, [[David Dunn (character)|David Dunn]], says it was \"[[Glass (2019 film)|Mr. Glass]].\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James McAvoy]] as Kevin Wendell Crumb / Dennis / Patricia / Hedwig / Barry / Orwell / Jade / The Horde: a sufferer of dissociative identity disorder (DID), who has 23&nbsp;prominent personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives.

An article from [[CNN]] stated that [[mental health]] advocates warn that the film stigmatizes [[dissociative identity disorder]] and may directly impact those living with it. \"You are going to upset and potentially exacerbate [[symptoms]] in thousands of people who are already suffering,\" [[Psychiatrist]] Dr. Garrett Marie Deckel, a DID specialist at Mount Sinai's [[Icahn School of Medicine]], said immediately after seeing the film. In contrast with McAvoy's character, Deckel said, people with DID, who may represent over 1% of Americans, are rarely violent. Research has shown that they are far more likely to hurt themselves than to hurt others. But movies tend to portray only \"the most extreme aspects\" of the disorder, she said. This can misrepresent a form of [[mental illness]] that is not well understood by the lay public, and even some [[psychiatrists]], she said. Amelia Joubert, an 18-year-old living with Dissociative Identity Disorder said she thinks \"Split\" is having a larger impact for younger people with DID; they're less familiar with older films, such as \"Psycho\" and \"Identity,\" that also contain violent characters with multiple personalities. She is afraid that \"Split\" may deter young people from coming out and seeking help. Joubert said that she is not against people seeing the film but that she hopes for more education about the realities and misconceptions of DID. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Nedelman |first1=Michael |title=What Shyamalan's 'Split' gets wrong about dissociative identity disorder |url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/health/shyamalan-split-movie-dissociative-identity-disorder/index.html |website=CNN |publisher=CNN |accessdate=30 March 2020 |ref=42}}</ref> In a statement about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID. The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in [[jail]] over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period. Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based [[psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]], said he had not seen the movie \u2014 and doesn\u2019t plan to. \u201cWhat concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a [[Mental disorder|disorder]] that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering \u2014 the [[abuse]] of innocent children,\u201d Itzkowitz told [[Healthline]].

{"title_page": "Science/Engineering Specialized Learning Center", "text_new": "The '''Science/Engineering Specialized Learning Center''', or S&E(SnE), is a [[state school|public]] [[high school]] [[magnet school|magnet]] program housed within [[Manalapan High School]], located in [[Englishtown, New Jersey|Englishtown]], in [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]], [[New Jersey]], United States. The program, started in 1985, is designed for students with an interest in focusing on mathematical and scientific subjects.\n\nThe program has had 10 to 40 students in each class, which has recently been changed to a max of 30 per class, and the curriculum consists largely of courses related to engineering, science, and high level mathematics. The program is heavy on [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses, which can provide college credit with appropriate scores(3,4, or 5). A member of the [[Freehold Regional High School District]], the learning center serves an enrollment of no more than 100 students at any time in the school.\n\nApplicants, drawn from the communities in the Freehold Regional High School District, take an entrance exam in the eighth grade that tests their abilities in mathematics and English. In addition, there is also a personal statement portion of the application which allows students to write an essay on why they wish to go to the school as well as telling of their extracurricular activities or awards. Parents have been known to move into the district just so their children may have a chance to be accepted into S&E.\n\nThe program has an impressive entourage of knowledgeable and helpful teachers{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. Most students score very highly on [[standardized test]]s (the AP, the [[SAT]], the [[ACT Exam]], the [[PSAT/NMSQT]], the [[High School Proficiency Assessment]] - HSPA). In 2006, the average SAT score was 2,185: 713 Verbal, 770 Math, and 702 Writing, and more recent SAT scores have been similar.<ref>[http://www.frhsd.com/mambo/frhsd_uploads/programs/lc-science.pdf FRHSD S&E Learning Center Brochure],'' Accessed June 24, 2011.</ref> If this center was ranked as a separate high school, they would rank #2 out of more than 27,000 U.S. high schools based on SAT scores alone.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2011/americas-best-high-schools.html America's Best High Schools] [[Newsweek]],'' Accessed June 24, 2011.</ref> They also perform well in competitions such as the [[American Mathematics Contest]] or the [[Science League]].\n\n== Required courses ==\n''Freshman Year''\n*Algebra II/Geometry (H) - A combined course in which two classes usually offered separately are taught at an accelerated pace over the span of one year. Typically, Geometry is taught the first semester then Algebra II the second semester.

The program, started in 1985, is designed for students with an interest in focusing on mathematical and scientific subjects.\n\nThe program has had 10 to 40 students in each class, which has recently been changed to a max of 30 per class, and the curriculum consists largely of courses related to engineering, science, and high level mathematics. The program is heavy on [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses, which can provide college credit with appropriate scores(3,4, or 5). A member of the [[Freehold Regional High School District]], the learning center serves an enrollment of no more than 100 students at any time in the school.\n\nApplicants, drawn from the communities in the Freehold Regional High School District, take an entrance exam in the eighth grade that tests their abilities in mathematics and English. In addition, there is also a personal statement portion of the application which allows students to write an essay on why they wish to go to the school as well as telling of their extracurricular activities or awards. Parents have been known to move into the district just so their children may have a chance to be accepted into S&E.\n\nThe program has an impressive entourage of knowledgeable and helpful teachers{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. Most students score very highly on [[standardized test]]s (the AP, the [[SAT]], the [[ACT Exam]], the [[PSAT/NMSQT]], the [[High School Proficiency Assessment]] - HSPA). In 2006, the average SAT score was 2,185: 713 Verbal, 770 Math, and 702 Writing, and more recent SAT scores have been similar.<ref>[http://www.frhsd.com/mambo/frhsd_uploads/programs/lc-science.pdf FRHSD S&E Learning Center Brochure],'' Accessed June 24, 2011.</ref> If this center was ranked as a separate high school, they would rank #2 out of more than 27,000 U.S. high schools based on SAT scores alone.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2011/americas-best-high-schools.html America's Best High Schools] [[Newsweek]],'' Accessed June 24, 2011.</ref> They also perform well in competitions such as the [[American Mathematics Contest]] or the [[Science League]].\n\n== Required courses ==\n''Freshman Year''\n*Algebra II/Geometry (H) - A combined course in which two classes usually offered separately are taught at an accelerated pace over the span of one year.

In 2001, with the partial sale of Tranz Scenic (the long-distance passenger division of Tranz Rail), the company sought to separate its commercial passenger rail operations from its subsidised services (which remained in Wellington under Tranz Metro), operation of the train was transferred to Tranz Scenic.\n\n==Service==\nThe train operates Monday-Friday from Palmerston North to Wellington in the morning, returning in the evening.\n\n===Weekend services===\nOn Sunday 19 June 1994 a weekend service from Palmerston North to Wellington and return started.

It attracted minimal patronage and was withdrawn in 1994.\n\n=== Future ===\nConcerns were raised that once the [[Kapiti Line]] services were extended north from Paraparaumu to [[Waikanae Railway Station|Waikanae]], the Capital Connection would lose passengers.

The new cars are about three metres longer than the older cars and more spacious inside, with more headroom, full air-conditioning, 60 seats per car (28 in the servery car), and twin power sockets at the foot of each pair of seats. Seating arrangement is both alcove and airline-style, using their British Rail InterCity 72 seats. Since October 2016, fire suppressed [[New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)|DFB class]] locomotives have been assigned to the service.\n\nThey have been repainted from Tranz Scenic standard \"Cato blue\" into Capital Connection livery.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In 2001, with the partial sale of Tranz Scenic (the long-distance passenger division of Tranz Rail), the company sought to separate its commercial passenger rail operations from its subsidised services (which remained in Wellington under Tranz Metro), operation of the train was transferred to Tranz Scenic.\n\n==Service==\nThe train operates Monday-Friday from Palmerston North to Wellington in the morning, returning in the evening.\n\n===Weekend services===\nOn Sunday 19 June 1994 a weekend service from Palmerston North to Wellington and return started. The power/baggage van, catering car and 50-seat (alcove-style with tables) day car (ex Masterton) made up the consist. It attracted minimal patronage and was withdrawn in 1994.\n\n=== Future ===\nConcerns were raised that once the [[Kapiti Line]] services were extended north from Paraparaumu to [[Waikanae Railway Station|Waikanae]], the Capital Connection would lose passengers.

When the Northerner and Southerner cars were returned to their respective trains and patronage continued to increase a former Masterton commuter car was refurbished to the same standard, with the same 50 alcove-style seats as the Southerner car, but with sheepskin seat covers. Later, a former Endeavour car with luggage space at one end and a former Picton \u2013 Greymouth car, both from on the Masterton commuter run, were refurbished for the service. Later still, up to five more Masterton cars, a Northerner car, the second Northerner catering car and the sole InterCity spare buffet car saw service. Before these carriages were replaced, the service was regularly running with a van and eight cars.\n\n===British Rail carriages===\nOn Monday 15 November 1999 a new train entered service, made up of seven (later eight) [[New Zealand British Rail Mark 2 carriage|British Rail Mark 2]] cars and the second former Southerner modular 11&nbsp;kW power and baggage van, with 90&nbsp;kW generator and larger luggage space made up from the middle and expanded non-handbrake end compartments. The new cars are about three metres longer than the older cars and more spacious inside, with more headroom, full air-conditioning, 60 seats per car (28 in the servery car), and twin power sockets at the foot of each pair of seats. Seating arrangement is both alcove and airline-style, using their British Rail InterCity 72 seats. Since October 2016, fire suppressed [[New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)|DFB class]] locomotives have been assigned to the service.\n\nThey have been repainted from Tranz Scenic standard \"Cato blue\" into Capital Connection livery.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
