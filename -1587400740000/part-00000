The [[Regent]], [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Reting Rinpoche]], shortly afterwards had a [[vision (religion)|vision]] at the sacred lake of [[Lhamo La-tso]] which he interpreted as Amdo being the region to search. This vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The team, led by Kewtsang [[Rinpoche]], went first to meet the [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|Panchen Lama]], who had been stuck in [[Jyekundo]], in northern Kham.<ref name=bell397 /> The Panchen Lama had been investigating births of unusual children in the area ever since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama.<ref name=\"Laird 2006, p. 265\">Laird 2006, p. 265.</ref> He gave Kewtsang the names of three boys whom he had discovered and identified as candidates.

He held an old [[Buddhist prayer beads|mala]] that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and the boy Lhamo Dhondup, aged two, approached and asked for it. The monk said \"if you know who I am, you can have it.\" The child said \"Sera Lama, Sera Lama\" and spoke with him in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect the boy's mother could not understand. The next time the party returned to the house, they revealed their real purpose and asked permission to subject the boy to certain tests.

This began with the [[5th Dalai Lama]]'s rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705\u20131750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or [[Ganden Phodrang]]. Until 1912 however, when the [[13th Dalai Lama]] declared the complete independence of [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]], their rule was generally subject to [[priest and patron|patronage and protection]] of firstly Mongol kings (1642\u20131720) and then the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1720\u20131912).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Smith, Warren W.

The Dalai Lama's childhood was then spent between the [[Potala Palace]] and [[Norbulingka]], his summer residence, both of which are now [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage sites]].\n\nThe [[Kuomintang]] government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and a Kuomintang representative, General [[Wu Zhongxin]], presided over the ceremony. The British Representative [[Basil Gould|Sir Basil Gould]], who was also at the ceremony, disputes the Chinese claim to have presided over it. He criticised the Chinese account as follows: \n{{quote|The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation, that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks, and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude. Every one of these Chinese claims was false. Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator. He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf, as was done by the others, including the British Representative. But the Chinese have the ear of the world, and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue. Tibet has no newspapers, either in English or Tibetan, and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods.<ref>Bell 1946, p. 400.</ref>}}\n\nTibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, but two things are clear, first, the word \"\u4e3b\u6301 (preside or organize)\" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word was different than what we understand today. Second, [[Wu Zhongxin]] spent a lot of time and energy on the event, his effect of presiding over or organizing the event was very obvious.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997_preside\">{{cite book|author1=\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f|author2=\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e|title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u897f\u85cf\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u4f4d|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&pg=PA133|year=1997|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=133\u2013}}</ref> However, according to Goldstein: \n{{quote|everything the Tibetans did during the selection process was designed to prevent China from playing any role.<ref name=\"Powers\">{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=The Buddha Party: How the People's Republic of China Works to Define and Control Tibetan Buddhism}}</ref>}}\n\nChiang Kai Shek ordered Ma Bufang to put his Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942.<ref name=\"Lin\">{{cite journal |title = War or Stratagem?

This vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves.

The monk said \"if you know who I am, you can have it.\" The child said \"Sera Lama, Sera Lama\" and spoke with him in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect the boy's mother could not understand.

This began with the [[5th Dalai Lama]]'s rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705\u20131750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or [[Ganden Phodrang]]. Until 1912 however, when the [[13th Dalai Lama]] declared the complete independence of [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]], their rule was generally subject to [[priest and patron|patronage and protection]] of firstly Mongol kings (1642\u20131720) and then the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1720\u20131912).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Smith, Warren W.

The Dalai Lama's childhood was then spent between the [[Potala Palace]] and [[Norbulingka]], his summer residence, both of which are now [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage sites]].\n\nThe [[Kuomintang]] government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and a Kuomintang representative, General [[Wu Zhongxin]], presided over the ceremony. The British Representative [[Basil Gould|Sir Basil Gould]], who was also at the ceremony, disputes the Chinese claim to have presided over it. He criticised the Chinese account as follows: \n{{quote|The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation, that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks, and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude. Every one of these Chinese claims was false. Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator. He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf, as was done by the others, including the British Representative. But the Chinese have the ear of the world, and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue. Tibet has no newspapers, either in English or Tibetan, and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods.<ref>Bell 1946, p. 400.</ref>}}\n\nTibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, but two things are clear, first, the word \"\u4e3b\u6301 (preside or organize)\" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word was different than what we understand today. Second, [[Wu Zhongxin]] spent a lot of time and energy on the event, his effect of presiding over or organizing the event was very obvious.<ref name=\"\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e1997_preside\">{{cite book|author1=\u738b\u5bb6\u4f1f|author2=\u5c3c\u739b\u575a\u8d5e|title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u897f\u85cf\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u4f4d|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&pg=PA133|year=1997|publisher=\u4e94\u6d32\u4f20\u64ad\u51fa\u7248\u793e|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=133\u2013}}</ref> However, according to Goldstein: \n{{quote|everything the Tibetans did during the selection process was designed to prevent China from playing any role.<ref name=\"Powers\">{{cite book|last1=Powers|first1=John|title=The Buddha Party: How the People's Republic of China Works to Define and Control Tibetan Buddhism}}</ref>}}\n\nChiang Kai Shek ordered Ma Bufang to put his Muslim soldiers on alert for an invasion of Tibet in 1942.<ref name=\"Lin\">{{cite journal |title = War or Stratagem?

In the Americas and western Europe, [[abolitionism]] was a movement which sought to end the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and set slaves free. In the 17th century, enlightenment thinkers condemned slavery on [[humanistic]] grounds and English [[Quakers]] and some [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical]] denominations condemned slavery as un-Christian. At that time, most slaves were Africans, but thousands of Native Americans were also enslaved. In the 18th century, as many as six million Africans were transported to the Americas as slaves, at least a third of them on British ships to [[North America]]. The colony of Georgia originally prohibited slavery.\n\nBetween 1780 and 1804 all Northern states, beginning with [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery]] from Pennsylvania in 1780, passed legislation abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual [[emancipation]]. Massachusetts ratified [[Massachusetts Constitution|a constitution]] that declared all men equal; [[freedom suits]] challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state. In Virginia, similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to Africans or African Americans. All the states banned the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] by 1790. South Carolina did so in 1787 but in 1803 reversed itself.<ref>[https://www.ccpl.org/charleston-time-machine/end-trans-atlantic-slave-trade Nic Butler, \"The End of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade\" (Charleston County Public Library, 2018)]</ref> During the ensuing decades, the abolitionist movement grew in Northern states, and Congress regulated the expansion of slavery as new states were admitted to the Union. The United States federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 and made slavery [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] in 1865 as a result of the [[American Civil War]].\n\nHistorian [[James M. McPherson]] defines an abolitionist \"as one who before the Civil War had agitated for the immediate, unconditional and total abolition of slavery in the United States\". He does not include antislavery activists such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], U.S. President during the Civil War, or the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which called for the gradual ending of slavery.<ref>{{cite book |author = James M.

The [[Chester Friends Meetinghouse|Quaker Quarterly Meeting]] of [[Chester, Pennsylvania]], made its first protest in 1711.

The first state to begin a gradual abolition of slavery was Pennsylvania, in 1780. All importation of slaves was prohibited, but none freed at first; only the slaves of masters who failed to register them with the state, along with the \"future children\" of enslaved mothers.

By 1804, all the northern states passed laws to abolish it. Some slaves continued in servitude for two more decades, but most were freed. In addition, individual slaveholders, particularly in the upper South, freed slaves, sometimes in their wills. Many noted they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population increased from less than 1 percent to nearly 10 percent from 1790 to 1810 in the upper South as a result of these actions.\n\n===South after 1804===\nThe institution remained solid in the South, and that region's customs and social beliefs evolved into a strident defense of slavery in response to the rise of a stronger anti-slavery stance in the North. In 1835 alone, abolitionists mailed over a million pieces of anti-slavery literature to the South.\n\nIn 1820, Thomas Jefferson privately supported the [[Missouri Compromise]], believing it would help to end slavery,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]] p. 189.</ref> but his [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|views on slavery]] were complicated, and possibly contradictory.{{sfn|Cogliano|2006|p=219}} His will freed only a small fraction of [[Monticello]] plantation.<ref>Lucia Stanton (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1m1tRlh7xQC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false {{\"'}}Those Who Labor For My Happiness': Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves\"], in Peter S.

It took effect in 1808, the earliest allowed under the Constitution. Afterward, in 1820, the [[Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy]] was passed, This law made importing slaves into the United States a death penalty offense. The [[Confederate States of America]] continued this prohibition with the sentence of death and prohibited the import of slaves.\n\n===Abolitionism's sudden emergence===\nIn 1830 most Americans were, at least in principle, opposed to slavery. The problem was how to end it, and what would become of the slaves once they were free. In the 1830s there was a progressive shift in thinking in the North, from gradual emancipation and resettlement of freed blacks in Africa (see [[American Colonization Society]]), to immediatism: freeing all the slaves immediately and sorting out the problems later. This change was in many cases sudden, a consequence of the individual's coming in direct contact with the horrors of American slavery, or hearing of them from a creditable source. As it was put by [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], who witnessed the capture and return to slavery of [[Anthony Burns]], \"we went to bed one night old-fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]s and waked up stark mad Abolitionists.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|page=5\n|title=Stark Mad Abolitionists: Lawrence, Kansas, and the Battle Over Slavery in the Civil War Era\n|first=Robert K.\n|last=Sutton\n|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]\n|year=2017\n|isbn=1510716491}}</ref>\n\n===Garrison and immediate emancipation===\n[[File:William garrison.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[William Lloyd Garrison]] (1805\u20131879), publisher of the abolitionist newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' and one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]].]]\nThe American beginning of abolitionism as a political movement is usually dated from 1 January 1831, when [[William Lloyd Garrison]] published the first issue of his new weekly newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' (1831), which published without interruption until slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865 (when it closed). It was followed shortly by his book ''Thoughts on African Colonization'' (1832), in which he attacked severely the policy of sending blacks to (not \"back to\") Africa, and specifically the American Colonization Society. The Colonization Society, which he had previously supported, is \"a creature without heart, without brains, eyeless, unnatural, hypocritical, relentless and unjust.\"<ref name=Wile/>{{rp|15}} \"Colonization\", according to Garrison, was not a plan to eliminate slavery, but to protect it.

Sending free blacks to Africa, getting rid of them, removed a danger: the existence of free blacks in the United States, who slaveowners believed, not without reason, encouraged slaves to escape to a free state, or Canada. Garrison also pointed out that a majority of the colonists died of disease, and the number of free blacks actually resettled in the future Liberia was minute in comparison to the number of slaves in the country. As put by the same supporter:{{quote|As a remedy for slavery, it must be placed amongst the grossest of all delusions. In fifteen years it has transported less than three thousand persons to the African coast; while the ''increase'' on their numbers, in the same period, is about seven hundred thousand!\"<ref name=Wile/>{{rp|11}}}}\n\n====Immediate abolition====\nAbolitionists included those who joined the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] or its auxiliary groups in the 1830s and 1840s, as the movement fragmented.<ref>''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' by Jamaes Brewer Stewart, p. 78</ref> The fragmented anti-slavery movement included groups such as the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]]; the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]]; the [[American Missionary Association]]; and the [[Church Anti-Slavery Society]]. Historians traditionally distinguish between moderate antislavery reformers or gradualists, who concentrated on stopping the spread of slavery, and radical abolitionists or immediatists, whose demands for unconditional emancipation often merged with a concern for Black civil rights. However, James Stewart advocates a more nuanced understanding of the relationship of abolition and antislavery prior to the Civil War:\n\n<blockquote>While instructive, the distinction [between antislavery and abolition] can also be misleading, especially in assessing abolitionism's political impact. For one thing, slaveholders never bothered with such fine points. Many immediate abolitionists showed no less concern than did other white Northerners about the fate of the nation's \"precious legacies of freedom\". Immediatism became most difficult to distinguish from broader anti-Southern opinions once ordinary citizens began articulating these intertwining beliefs.<ref>{{cite book |author = James Brewer Stewart |title = Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3gR57ahFQBsC&pg=PA78 |year = 1997 |publisher = Macmillan |page = 78 |isbn = 9780809015962 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Lovejoyat1837AltonIllinoisRiot.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wood engraving of proslavery riot in [[Alton, Illinois]], on 7 November 1837, which resulted in the murder of abolitionist [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] (1802\u20131837).]]\nAnti-slavery advocates were outraged by the murder on 7 November 1837 of [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]], a white man and editor of an abolitionist newspaper, by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois. Nearly all Northern politicians, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], rejected the \"immediate emancipation\" called for by the abolitionists, seeing it as \"extreme\". Indeed, many Northern leaders, including Lincoln, [[Stephen Douglas]] (the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee in 1860), [[John C. Fremont]] (the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee in 1856), and [[Ulysses S. Grant]] married into slave-owning Southern families without any moral qualms.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAntislavery as a principle was far more than just the wish to limit the extent of slavery. Northerners recognized that slavery existed in the South and that the Constitution did not allow the federal government to intervene there. Most Northerners favored a policy of gradual and [[compensated emancipation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} After 1840, abolitionists rejected this because it let sin continue to exist; they demanded that slavery end immediately and everywhere. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was the only abolitionist to have actually planned a violent insurrection, though [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]] promoted the idea. The abolitionist movement was strengthened by the activities of free African Americans, especially in the [[Black church]], who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the [[New Testament]].\n\nAfrican-American activists and their writings were rarely heard outside the Black community. However, they were tremendously influential on some sympathetic white people, most prominently the first white activist to reach prominence, [[William Lloyd Garrison]], who was its most effective propagandist. Garrison's efforts to recruit eloquent spokesmen led to the discovery of ex-slave [[Frederick Douglass]], who eventually became a prominent activist in his own right. Eventually, Douglass would publish his own widely distributed abolitionist newspaper, ''[[North Star (newspaper)|North Star]]''.\n\n[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Lysander Spooner]] (1808\u20131887), an [[individualist anarchist]] who wrote ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' (1845).]]\nIn the early 1850s, the American abolitionist movement split into two camps over the issue of the [[United States Constitution]]. This issue arose in the late 1840s after the publication of ''The Unconstitutionality of Slavery'' by [[Lysander Spooner]]. The Garrisonians, led by Garrison and [[Wendell Phillips]], publicly burned copies of the Constitution, called it a pact with slavery, and demanded its abolition and replacement. Another camp, led by [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Gerrit Smith]], and eventually Douglass, considered the Constitution to be an anti-slavery document. Using an argument based upon [[Natural Law]] and a form of [[social contract]] theory, they said that slavery existed outside the Constitution's scope of legitimate authority and therefore should be abolished.\n\nAnother split in the abolitionist movement was along class lines. The artisan republicanism of [[Robert Dale Owen]] and [[Frances Wright]] stood in stark contrast to the politics of prominent elite abolitionists such as industrialist [[Arthur Tappan]] and his evangelist brother [[Lewis Tappan|Lewis]]. While the former pair opposed slavery on a basis of solidarity of \"wage slaves\" with \"chattel slaves\", the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whiggish]] Tappans strongly rejected this view, opposing the characterization of Northern workers as \"slaves\" in any sense.

(2001)Passages to Freedom: The Underground Railroad in History and Memory. Smithsonian Books</ref> This was made illegal by the federal [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]]. Nevertheless, participants like [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Henry Highland Garnet]], [[Alexander Crummell]], [[Amos No\u00eb Freeman]], and others continued with their work. Abolitionists were particularly active in [[Ohio]], where some worked directly in the Underground Railroad. Since the state shared a border with slave states, it was a popular place for slaves escaping across the [[Ohio River]] and up its tributaries, where they sought shelter among supporters who would help them move north to freedom. Two significant events in the struggle to destroy slavery were the [[Oberlin-Wellington Rescue]] and [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid on [[Harpers Ferry]]. In the South, members of the abolitionist movement or other people opposing [[slavery]] were often targets of lynch mob violence before the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1857/09/18/archives/lynching-an-abolitionist-in-mississippi.html |title = Lynching an Abolitionist in Mississippi. |last = D.p.m |date = 18 September 1857 |via = NYTimes.com }}</ref>\n\nNumerous known abolitionists lived, worked, and worshipped in downtown Brooklyn, from [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who auctioned slaves into freedom from the pulpit of Plymouth Church, to [[Nathan Egelston]], a leader of the African and Foreign Antislavery Society, who also preached at Bridge Street AME and lived on Duffield Street. His fellow Duffield Street residents Thomas and Harriet Truesdell were leading members of the Abolitionist movement. Mr. Truesdell was a founding member of the Providence Anti-slavery Society before moving to Brooklyn in 1851. Harriet Truesdell was also very active in the movement, organizing an antislavery convention in [[Pennsylvania Hall (hiladelphia)]]. Another prominent Brooklyn-based abolitionist was Rev. [[Joshua Leavitt]], trained as a lawyer at Yale, who stopped practicing law in order to attend Yale Divinity School, and subsequently edited the abolitionist newspaper ''The Emancipator'' and campaigned against slavery, as well as advocating other social reforms. In 1841, Leavitt published ''The Financial Power of Slavery'', which argued that the South was draining the national economy due to its reliance on slavery.\n\n===Abolitionism at institutes of learning===\n====Western Reserve College====\nBoth Garrison's newspaper ''The Liberator'' and his book ''Thoughts on African Colonization'' (1832) arrived shortly after publication at [[Western Reserve College and Preparatory School|Western Reserve College]], in [[Hudson, Ohio]], which was briefly the center of abolitionist discourse in the United States. ([[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] grew up in Hudson.) The readers, including college president [[Charles Backus Storrs]], found Garrison's arguments and evidence convincing. Abolition versus colonization rapidly became the primary issue on the campus, to the point that Storrs complained in writing that nothing else was being discussed.<ref name=Axe>{{cite book\n|title=Abolition's axe : Beriah Green, Oneida Institute, and the Black freedom struggle\n|last=Sernett\n|first=Milton C.\n|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]\n|year=1986\n|isbn=9780815623700\n|url=https://archive.org/details/abolitionsaxeber00sern/}}</ref>{{rp|26}}\n\nThe college's chaplain and theology professor [[Beriah Green]] said that \"his ''Thoughts'' and his paper (''The Liberator'') are worthy of the eye and the heart of every American.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|first=Beriah\n|last=Green\n|title=Four sermons preached in the chapel of the Western Reserve College : on Lord's Days, November 18th and 25th, and December 2nd and 9th, 1832\n|location=Cleveland\n|year=1833|url=https://archive.org/details/foursermonspreac1833gree}}</ref>{{rp|49}} Green delivered in the college chapel in November and December 1832 four sermons supporting immediate abolition of slavery.

Storrs contracted tuberculosis, took a [[leave of absence]], and died within six months.<ref name=Axe/>{{rp|28}} This left the school with only one of its four professors.\n\n====Oneida Institute for Science and Industry====\nGreen was soon hired as the new president of the [[Oneida Institute]]. Under the previous president, [[George Washington Gale]], there had been a mass walkout of students; among the issues was Gale's lack of support for abolition.\n\nHe accepted the position on conditions that 1) he be allowed to preach \"immediatism\", immediate emancipation, and 2) that African-American students be admitted on the same terms as white students. These were accepted, and we know the names of [[Oneida Institute#African-American students|16 Blacks who studied there]]. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students, of whom [[Oneida Institute#Native American students|we know the names of two]], were openly accepted as well.\n\nUnder Green, Oneida became \"a hotbed of anti-slavery activity.\"<ref name=Axe/>{{rp|44}} It was \"abolitionist to the core, more so than any other American college.\"<ref name=Axe/>{{rp|46}} For Presbyterian minister and Bible professor Green, slavery was not just an evil but a sin, and abolitionism was what Christ's principles mandated.

These include William Forten (son of [[James Forten]]), [[Alexander Crummell]], Rev. [[Henry Highland Garnet]] and Rev.

Based on Weld's recommendation, the Tappans approved the choice, and started giving Lane much of the financial support they had previously given Oneida. Weld, though on paper enrolled as a student at Lane, was ''de facto'' its head, choosing, through his recommendations to the Tappans, the president ([[Lyman Beecher]], after [[Charles Grandison Finney]], who became later the second president of Oberlin, turned it down), and telling the trustees whom to hire.<ref name=Fletcher/>{{rp|54}}\n\nStudents, many of whom considered him the real leader of Lane,<ref name=Lesick>{{cite book\n|title=The Lane rebels : evangelicalism and antislavery in antebellum America\n|last=Lesick\n|first=Lawrence Thomas\n|year=1980\n|location=Metuchen, New Jersey\n|url=https://archive.org/details/lanerebelsevange00lesi/page/156\n|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]\n|isbn=9780810813724}}</ref>{{rp|77}} responded to Weld's announcement of the new school.\n\n{{quote|[Y]oung men gathered in Cincinnati \"as from the hives of the north\".

They then proceeded to hold [[Lane Debates on Slavery|a well-publicized series of debates]] on abolition versus African colonialism, lasting 18 evenings, and decided that abolitionism was a much better solution to slavery.\n\nThese debates alarmed Lane trustees and president, who feared violence, since Cincinnati was strongly anti-abolitionist (see [[Cincinnati riots of 1829]]). They immediately prohibited any future such \"off-the-topic\" discussions. The students, again led by Weld, felt that abolitionism was so important \u2013 it was their responsibility as Christians to promote it \u2013 that they resigned ''en masse'', joined by [[Asa Mahan]], a trustee who supported the students. With support by the Tappans, they briefly tried to establish a new seminary, but as this did not prove a practical solution they accepted a proposal that they move to the new [[Oberlin Collegiate Institute]].\n\n====Oberlin Collegiate Institute====\nThe following year Weld encouraged a group of students at Lane Theological Seminary to form an anti-slavery society. After the president, [[Lyman Beecher]], tried to suppress the group, the students moved to [[Oberlin College]].\n\nDue to its students' anti-slavery position, Oberlin soon became one of the most liberal colleges and accepted African-American students. Along with Garrison, Northcutt and Collins were proponents of immediate abolition. [[Abby Kelley Foster]] became an \"ultra abolitionist\" and a follower of William Lloyd Garrison. She led [[Susan B.

Other members of the Society, including [[Charles Turner Torrey]], Amos Phelps, [[Henry Stanton]], and Alanson St. Clair, in addition to disagreeing with Garrison on the women's issue, urged taking a much more activist approach to abolitionism and consequently challenged Garrison's leadership at the Society's annual meeting in January 1839.

In 1854, Garrison wrote:\n<blockquote>I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, \"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Hence, I am an abolitionist. Hence, I cannot but regard oppression in every form \u2013 and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing \u2013 with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle.

Through the compromise, California was admitted as a free state after its state convention unanimously opposed slavery there, Texas was financially compensated for the loss of its territories, the [[slave trade]] (not slavery) was abolished in the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] was passed as a concession to the South.

The antislavery gains made in previous compromises were reversed. A firestorm of outrage brought together former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], [[Know-Nothings]], and former [[Free Soil]] Democrats to form a new party in 1854\u201356, the Republican Party. It included a program of rapid modernization involving the government promotion of industry, railroads, banks, free homesteads, and colleges, all to the annoyance of the South. The new party denounced the [[Slave Power]] \u2013 that is the political power of the slave owners who supposedly controlled the national government for their own benefit and to the disadvantage of the ordinary white man.<ref>Lewis Gould's ''Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans'' (2003) chapter 1</ref>\n\nThe Republican Party wanted to achieve the gradual extinction of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. Southern leaders said the Republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and challenged their autonomy. With the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential victory]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. The [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded.\n\n[[File:1856-Republican-party-Fremont-isms-caricature.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|This Democratic editorial cartoon links Republican candidate John Fr\u00e9mont (far right) to other radical movements including [[temperance movement|temperance]], [[feminism]], [[Fourierism]], [[free love]], Catholicism, and abolition.]]\n\nWestern explorer [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] ran as the first Republican nominee for president in 1856. The new party crusaded on the slogan: \"Free soil, free silver, free men, Fr\u00e9mont and victory!\" Although he lost, the party showed a strong base. It dominated in Yankee areas of New England, New York and the northern Midwest, and had a strong presence in the rest of the North. It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856\u201360 as a divisive force that threatened civil war.<ref>Eric Foner. ''Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party Before the Civil War'' (1970)</ref>\n\nWithout using the term \"[[containment]]\", the new Party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery, once it gained control of the national government. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy:\n<blockquote>The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a \"cordon of freedom\" around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.<ref>{{cite book |author = James Oakes |title = Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861\u20131865 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&pg=PR12 |year = 2012 |publisher = W.

Not a single slave revolted. Lt. Colonel [[Robert E. Lee]] of the U.S. Army was dispatched to put down the raid, and Brown was quickly captured. Brown was tried for treason against Virginia and hanged. At his trial, Brown exuded a remarkable zeal and single-mindedness that played directly to Southerners' worst fears. Under Virginia law there was a month between the sentencing and the hanging, and in those weeks Brown spoke gladly with reporters and anyone else who wanted to see him, and wrote many letters. Few individuals did more to cause secession than John Brown, because Southerners believed he was right about an impending slave revolt.

The first federal act taken against slavery during the war occurred on 16 April 1862, when Lincoln signed the [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act]], which abolished slavery in Washington D. C. Meanwhile, the Union suddenly found themselves dealing with a steady stream of escaped slaves from the South rushing to Union lines.  In response, Congress passed the [[Confiscation Acts]], which essentially declared escaped slaves from the South to be confiscated war property, and thus did not have to returned to their masters in the Confederacy.  Although the initial act did not mention emancipation, the second Confiscation act, passed on 17 July 1862, stated that escaped or liberated slaves belonging to anyone who participated in or supported the rebellion \"shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.\" Pro-Union forces gained control of the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]] and began the process of emancipation in Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia.  All three states would abolish slavery before the end of the war. Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on 1 January 1863. The passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (ratified in December 1865) abolished slavery in the United States, officially freeing more than 50,000 people still enslaved in Kentucky and Delaware.<ref>{{cite book |first = Eric |last = Foner |title = The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |year = 2010 |location = New York |publisher = W.

Border states, except Delaware and Kentucky, began their own emancipation programs. Thousands of slaves escaped to freedom behind Union Army lines, and in 1863 many men started serving as the [[United States Colored Troops]]. In June 1864, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]] was repealed. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] took effect in December 1865 and ended slavery throughout the United States, except as a punishment for crime.

For some that included the immediate abolition of slavery as they considered it sinful to hold slaves as well as to tolerate slavery.  Opposition to slavery, for example, was one of the [[works of piety]] of the [[Methodist Church]]es, which were established by [[John Wesley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gutenson |first1=Charles E. |title=The Right Church |date=2012 |publisher=Abingdon Press |isbn=9781426749117 |pages=58 |language=English}}</ref> \"Abolitionist\" had several meanings at the time. The followers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], including [[Wendell Phillips]] and [[Frederick Douglass]], demanded the \"immediate abolition of slavery\", hence the name, also called \"immediatism\". A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, such as [[Theodore Dwight Weld|Theodore Weld]] and [[Arthur Tappan]], wanted immediate action, but were willing to support a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage.\n\n\"Antislavery men\", such as [[John Quincy Adams]], did not call slavery a sin. They called it an evil feature of society as a whole. They did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but were not part of any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841, John Quincy Adams represented the ''[[United States v. The Amistad|Amistad]]'' African slaves in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and argued that they should be set free.<ref>[http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm \"Amistad\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106090007/http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm |date=6 November 2007 }}, Smithsonian Institution</ref> In the last years before the war, \"antislavery\" could refer to the Northern majority, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], who opposed expansion of slavery or its influence, as by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians.\n\nHistorian James Stewart (1976) explains the abolitionists' deep beliefs: \"All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution.\"<ref>James Brewer Stewart, ''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' (1976)</ref>\n\n[[File:69th New York at church.jpg|thumb|Officers and men of the [[Irish-Catholic]] [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th New York Volunteer Regiment]] attend Catholic services in 1861.]]\n\n[[Irish American|Irish Catholics]] in America seldom challenged the role of slavery in society as it was protected at that time by the U.S. Constitution.

Despite a firm stand for the spiritual equality of black people, and the resounding condemnation of slavery by Pope Gregory XVI in his bull ''[[In supremo apostolatus]]'' issued in 1839, the American church continued in deeds, if not in public discourse, to avoid confrontation with slave-holding interests. In 1861, the Archbishop of New York wrote to Secretary of War Cameron: \"That the Church is opposed to slavery&nbsp;... Her doctrine on that subject is, that it is a crime to reduce men naturally free to a condition of servitude and bondage, as slaves.\"  No American bishop supported extra-political abolition or interference with [[states' rights]] before the Civil War.\n\nThe secular Germans of the [[Forty-Eighters|Forty-Eighter]] immigration were largely anti-slavery. Prominent Forty-Eighters included [[Carl Schurz]] and [[Friedrich Hecker]]. German [[Lutherans]] seldom took a position on slavery, but German [[Methodists]] were anti-slavery.\n\n===Black abolitionist rhetoric===\nHistorians and scholars have largely overlooked the work of black abolitionists, instead, they have focused much of their scholarly attention on a few black abolitionists, such as [[Frederick Douglass]].<ref>Levesque, George.

Although it is impossible to generalize an entire rhetorical movement, black abolitionists can largely be characterized by the obstacles that they faced and the ways in which these obstacles informed their rhetoric.

Though well known for her [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] advocacy, Mott also played an important role in the abolitionist movement. During four decades, she delivered sermons about abolitionism, women's rights, and a host of other issues. Mott acknowledged her [[Quakers|Quaker]] beliefs' determinative role in affecting her abolitionist sentiment.

Anthony]], [[Harriet Tubman]], and [[Sojourner Truth]] all played important roles in abolitionism. But even beyond these well-known women, abolitionism maintained impressive support from white middle-class and some black women. It was these women who performed many of the logistical, day-to-day tasks that made the movement successful. They raised money, wrote and distributed propaganda pieces, drafted and signed petitions, and lobbied the legislatures. Though abolitionism sowed the seeds of the women's rights movement, most women became involved in abolitionism because of a gendered religious worldview, and the idea that they had feminine, moral responsibilities.<ref>{{cite book |last = Jeffrey |first = Julie Roy |title = The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism |year = 1998 |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |location = Chapel Hill, NC |page = 2 }}</ref> For example, in the winter of 1831\u20131832, women sent three petitions to the Virginia legislature, advocating emancipation of the state's slave population.

Similar backing increased leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nEven as women played crucial roles in abolitionism, the movement simultaneously helped stimulate women's-rights efforts. A full 10 years before the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the [[Grimk\u00e9 sisters]] were travelling and lecturing about their experiences with slavery. As Gerda Lerner says, the Grimk\u00e9s understood their actions' great impact. \"In working for the liberation of the slave,\" Lerner writes, \"Sarah and Angelina Grimk\u00e9 found the key to their own liberation. And the consciousness of the significance of their actions was clearly before them.

The Grimk\u00e9 sisters' public speaking played a critical part in legitimizing women's place in the public sphere.

During the 1820s and 1830s the [[American Colonization Society]] (A.C.S.) was the primary vehicle for proposals to \"return\" black Americans to freedom in Africa, regardless of whether they were native-born in the United States. It had broad support nationwide among white people, Northerners as well as prominent Southern leaders such [[Henry Clay]] and [[James Monroe]], who believed it a better solution than simply freeing slaves. Clay said that due to\n<blockquote>unconquerable prejudice resulting from their color, they [the blacks] never could amalgamate with the free whites of this country. It was desirable, therefore, as it respected them, and the residue of the population of the country, to drain them off.<ref name=ATH>Maggie Montesinos Sale, ''The slumbering volcano: American slave ship revolts and the production of rebellious masculinity'', Duke University Press, 1997, p. 264. {{ISBN|0-8223-1992-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMost African Americans opposed colonization, and simply wanted to be given the rights of free citizens in the United States.

Over the next four decades, it assisted thousands of former slaves and free black people to move there from the United States. The disease environment they encountered was extreme, and most migrants died fairly quickly. Enough survived to [[History of Liberia|declare independence]] in 1847. American support for colonization waned gradually through the 1840s and 1850s, largely because of the efforts of abolitionists to promote emancipation of slaves and the granting of United States citizenship to them.

In the 17th century, enlightenment thinkers condemned slavery on [[humanistic]] grounds and English [[Quakers]] and some [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical]] denominations condemned slavery as un-Christian. At that time, most slaves were Africans, but thousands of Native Americans were also enslaved. In the 18th century, as many as six million Africans were transported to the Americas as slaves, at least a third of them on British ships to [[North America]]. The colony of Georgia originally prohibited slavery.\n\nBetween 1780 and 1804 all Northern states, beginning with [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery]] from Pennsylvania in 1780, passed legislation abolishing slavery, sometimes by gradual [[emancipation]]. Massachusetts ratified [[Massachusetts Constitution|a constitution]] that declared all men equal; [[freedom suits]] challenging slavery based on this principle brought an end to slavery in the state. In Virginia, similar declarations of rights were interpreted by the courts as not applicable to Africans or African Americans. All the states banned the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]] by 1790. South Carolina did so in 1787 but in 1803 reversed itself.<ref>[https://www.ccpl.org/charleston-time-machine/end-trans-atlantic-slave-trade Nic Butler, \"The End of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade\" (Charleston County Public Library, 2018)]</ref> During the ensuing decades, the abolitionist movement grew in Northern states, and Congress regulated the expansion of slavery as new states were admitted to the Union. The United States federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808 and made slavery [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] in 1865 as a result of the American Civil War.\n\nHistorian [[James M. McPherson]] defines an abolitionist \"as one who before the Civil War had agitated for the immediate, unconditional and total abolition of slavery in the United States\". He does not include antislavery activists such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], U.S. President during the Civil War, or the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which called for the gradual ending of slavery.<ref>{{cite book |author = James M.

The first state to begin a gradual abolition of slavery was Pennsylvania, in 1780. All importation of slaves was prohibited, but none freed at first; only the slaves of masters who failed to register them with the state, along with the \"future children\" of enslaved mothers.

By 1804, all the northern states passed laws to abolish it. Some slaves continued in servitude for two more decades, but most were freed. In addition, individual slaveholders, particularly in the upper South, freed slaves, sometimes in their wills. Many noted they had been moved by the revolutionary ideals of the equality of men. The number of free blacks as a proportion of the black population increased from less than 1 percent to nearly 10 percent from 1790 to 1810 in the upper South as a result of these actions.\n\n===South after 1804===\nThe institution remained solid in the South, and that region's customs and social beliefs evolved into a strident defense of slavery in response to the rise of a stronger anti-slavery stance in the North. In 1835 alone, abolitionists mailed over a million pieces of anti-slavery literature to the South.\n\nIn 1820, Thomas Jefferson privately supported the [[Missouri Compromise]], believing it would help to end slavery,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]] p. 189.</ref> but his [[Thomas Jefferson and slavery|views on slavery]] were complicated, and possibly contradictory.{{sfn|Cogliano|2006|p=219}} His will freed only a small fraction of [[Monticello]] plantation.<ref>Lucia Stanton (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K1m1tRlh7xQC&pg=PA147#v=onepage&q&f=false {{\"'}}Those Who Labor For My Happiness': Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves\"], in Peter S.

It took effect in 1808, the earliest allowed under the Constitution. Afterward, in 1820, the [[Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy]] was passed, This law made importing slaves into the United States a death penalty offense. The [[Confederate States of America]] continued this prohibition with the sentence of death and prohibited the import of slaves.\n\n===Abolitionism's sudden emergence===\nIn 1830 most Americans were, at least in principle, opposed to slavery. The problem was how to end it, and what would become of the slaves once they were free. In the 1830s there was a progressive shift in thinking in the North, from gradual emancipation and resettlement of freed blacks in Africa (see [[American Colonization Society]]), to immediatism: freeing all the slaves immediately and sorting out the problems later. This change was in many cases sudden, a consequence of the individual's coming in direct contact with the horrors of American slavery, or hearing of them from a creditable source. As it was put by [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], who witnessed the capture and return to slavery of [[Anthony Burns]], \"we went to bed one night old-fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]s and waked up stark mad Abolitionists.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|page=5\n|title=Stark Mad Abolitionists: Lawrence, Kansas, and the Battle Over Slavery in the Civil War Era\n|first=Robert K.\n|last=Sutton\n|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]]\n|year=2017\n|isbn=1510716491}}</ref>\n\n===Garrison and immediate emancipation===\n[[File:William garrison.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[William Lloyd Garrison]] (1805\u20131879), publisher of the abolitionist newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' and one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]].]]\nThe American beginning of abolitionism as a political movement is usually dated from 1 January 1831, when [[William Lloyd Garrison]] published the first issue of his new weekly newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' (1831), which published without interruption until slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865 (when it closed). It was followed shortly by his book ''Thoughts on African Colonization'' (1832), in which he attacked severely the policy of sending blacks to (not \"back to\") Africa, and specifically the American Colonization Society. The Colonization Society, which he had previously supported, is \"a creature without heart, without brains, eyeless, unnatural, hypocritical, relentless and unjust.\"<ref name=Wile/>{{rp|15}} \"Colonization\", according to Garrison, was not a plan to eliminate slavery, but to protect it.

Sending free blacks to Africa, getting rid of them, removed a danger: the existence of free blacks in the United States, who slaveowners believed, not without reason, encouraged slaves to escape to a free state, or Canada. Garrison also pointed out that a majority of the colonists died of disease, and the number of free blacks actually resettled in the future Liberia was minute in comparison to the number of slaves in the country. As put by the same supporter:{{quote|As a remedy for slavery, it must be placed amongst the grossest of all delusions. In fifteen years it has transported less than three thousand persons to the African coast; while the ''increase'' on their numbers, in the same period, is about seven hundred thousand!\"<ref name=Wile/>{{rp|11}}}}\n\n====Immediate abolition====\nAbolitionists included those who joined the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] or its auxiliary groups in the 1830s and 1840s, as the movement fragmented.<ref>''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' by Jamaes Brewer Stewart, p. 78</ref> The fragmented anti-slavery movement included groups such as the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]]; the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]]; the [[American Missionary Association]]; and the [[Church Anti-Slavery Society]]. Historians traditionally distinguish between moderate antislavery reformers or gradualists, who concentrated on stopping the spread of slavery, and radical abolitionists or immediatists, whose demands for unconditional emancipation often merged with a concern for Black civil rights. However, James Stewart advocates a more nuanced understanding of the relationship of abolition and antislavery prior to the Civil War:\n\n<blockquote>While instructive, the distinction [between antislavery and abolition] can also be misleading, especially in assessing abolitionism's political impact. For one thing, slaveholders never bothered with such fine points. Many immediate abolitionists showed no less concern than did other white Northerners about the fate of the nation's \"precious legacies of freedom\". Immediatism became most difficult to distinguish from broader anti-Southern opinions once ordinary citizens began articulating these intertwining beliefs.<ref>{{cite book |author = James Brewer Stewart |title = Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3gR57ahFQBsC&pg=PA78 |year = 1997 |publisher = Macmillan |page = 78 |isbn = 9780809015962 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Lovejoyat1837AltonIllinoisRiot.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wood engraving of proslavery riot in [[Alton, Illinois]], on 7 November 1837, which resulted in the murder of abolitionist [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] (1802\u20131837).]]\nAnti-slavery advocates were outraged by the murder on 7 November 1837 of [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]], a white man and editor of an abolitionist newspaper, by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois. Nearly all Northern politicians, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], rejected the \"immediate emancipation\" called for by the abolitionists, seeing it as \"extreme\". Indeed, many Northern leaders, including Lincoln, [[Stephen Douglas]] (the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee in 1860), [[John C. Fremont]] (the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee in 1856), and [[Ulysses S. Grant]] married into slave-owning Southern families without any moral qualms.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAntislavery as a principle was far more than just the wish to limit the extent of slavery. Northerners recognized that slavery existed in the South and that the Constitution did not allow the federal government to intervene there. Most Northerners favored a policy of gradual and [[compensated emancipation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} After 1840, abolitionists rejected this because it let sin continue to exist; they demanded that slavery end immediately and everywhere. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was the only abolitionist to have actually planned a violent insurrection, though [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]] promoted the idea. The abolitionist movement was strengthened by the activities of free African Americans, especially in the [[Black church]], who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the [[New Testament]].\n\nAfrican-American activists and their writings were rarely heard outside the Black community. However, they were tremendously influential on some sympathetic white people, most prominently the first white activist to reach prominence, [[William Lloyd Garrison]], who was its most effective propagandist. Garrison's efforts to recruit eloquent spokesmen led to the discovery of ex-slave [[Frederick Douglass]], who eventually became a prominent activist in his own right. Eventually, Douglass would publish his own widely distributed abolitionist newspaper, ''[[North Star (newspaper)|North Star]]''.\n\n[[File:LysanderSpooner.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Lysander Spooner]] (1808\u20131887), an [[individualist anarchist]] who wrote ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' (1845).]]\nIn the early 1850s, the American abolitionist movement split into two camps over the issue of the [[United States Constitution]]. This issue arose in the late 1840s after the publication of ''The Unconstitutionality of Slavery'' by [[Lysander Spooner]]. The Garrisonians, led by Garrison and [[Wendell Phillips]], publicly burned copies of the Constitution, called it a pact with slavery, and demanded its abolition and replacement. Another camp, led by [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Gerrit Smith]], and eventually Douglass, considered the Constitution to be an anti-slavery document. Using an argument based upon [[Natural Law]] and a form of [[social contract]] theory, they said that slavery existed outside the Constitution's scope of legitimate authority and therefore should be abolished.\n\nAnother split in the abolitionist movement was along class lines. The artisan republicanism of [[Robert Dale Owen]] and [[Frances Wright]] stood in stark contrast to the politics of prominent elite abolitionists such as industrialist [[Arthur Tappan]] and his evangelist brother [[Lewis Tappan|Lewis]]. While the former pair opposed slavery on a basis of solidarity of \"wage slaves\" with \"chattel slaves\", the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whiggish]] Tappans strongly rejected this view, opposing the characterization of Northern workers as \"slaves\" in any sense.

(2001)Passages to Freedom: The Underground Railroad in History and Memory. Smithsonian Books</ref> This was made illegal by the federal [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]]. Nevertheless, participants like [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Henry Highland Garnet]], [[Alexander Crummell]], [[Amos No\u00eb Freeman]], and others continued with their work. Abolitionists were particularly active in [[Ohio]], where some worked directly in the Underground Railroad. Since the state shared a border with slave states, it was a popular place for slaves escaping across the [[Ohio River]] and up its tributaries, where they sought shelter among supporters who would help them move north to freedom. Two significant events in the struggle to destroy slavery were the [[Oberlin-Wellington Rescue]] and [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid on [[Harpers Ferry]]. In the South, members of the abolitionist movement or other people opposing [[slavery]] were often targets of lynch mob violence before the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1857/09/18/archives/lynching-an-abolitionist-in-mississippi.html |title = Lynching an Abolitionist in Mississippi. |last = D.p.m |date = 18 September 1857 |via = NYTimes.com }}</ref>\n\nNumerous known abolitionists lived, worked, and worshipped in downtown Brooklyn, from [[Henry Ward Beecher]], who auctioned slaves into freedom from the pulpit of Plymouth Church, to [[Nathan Egelston]], a leader of the African and Foreign Antislavery Society, who also preached at Bridge Street AME and lived on Duffield Street. His fellow Duffield Street residents Thomas and Harriet Truesdell were leading members of the Abolitionist movement. Mr. Truesdell was a founding member of the Providence Anti-slavery Society before moving to Brooklyn in 1851. Harriet Truesdell was also very active in the movement, organizing an antislavery convention in [[Pennsylvania Hall (hiladelphia)]]. Another prominent Brooklyn-based abolitionist was Rev. [[Joshua Leavitt]], trained as a lawyer at Yale, who stopped practicing law in order to attend Yale Divinity School, and subsequently edited the abolitionist newspaper ''The Emancipator'' and campaigned against slavery, as well as advocating other social reforms. In 1841, Leavitt published ''The Financial Power of Slavery'', which argued that the South was draining the national economy due to its reliance on slavery.\n\n===Abolitionism at institutes of learning===\n====Western Reserve College====\nBoth Garrison's newspaper ''The Liberator'' and his book ''Thoughts on African Colonization'' (1832) arrived shortly after publication at [[Western Reserve College and Preparatory School|Western Reserve College]], in [[Hudson, Ohio]], which was briefly the center of abolitionist discourse in the United States. ([[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] grew up in Hudson.) The readers, including college president [[Charles Backus Storrs]], found Garrison's arguments and evidence convincing. Abolition versus colonization rapidly became the primary issue on the campus, to the point that Storrs complained in writing that nothing else was being discussed.<ref name=Axe>{{cite book\n|title=Abolition's axe : Beriah Green, Oneida Institute, and the Black freedom struggle\n|last=Sernett\n|first=Milton C.\n|publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]]\n|year=1986\n|isbn=9780815623700\n|url=https://archive.org/details/abolitionsaxeber00sern/}}</ref>{{rp|26}}\n\nThe college's chaplain and theology professor [[Beriah Green]] said that \"his ''Thoughts'' and his paper (''The Liberator'') are worthy of the eye and the heart of every American.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|first=Beriah\n|last=Green\n|title=Four sermons preached in the chapel of the Western Reserve College : on Lord's Days, November 18th and 25th, and December 2nd and 9th, 1832\n|location=Cleveland\n|year=1833|url=https://archive.org/details/foursermonspreac1833gree}}</ref>{{rp|49}} Green delivered in the college chapel in November and December 1832 four sermons supporting immediate abolition of slavery.

Storrs contracted tuberculosis, took a [[leave of absence]], and died within six months.<ref name=Axe/>{{rp|28}} This left the school with only one of its four professors.\n\n====Oneida Institute for Science and Industry====\nGreen was soon hired as the new president of the [[Oneida Institute]]. Under the previous president, [[George Washington Gale]], there had been a mass walkout of students; among the issues was Gale's lack of support for abolition.\n\nHe accepted the position on conditions that 1) he be allowed to preach \"immediatism\", immediate emancipation, and 2) that African-American students be admitted on the same terms as white students. These were accepted, and we know the names of [[Oneida Institute#African-American students|16 Blacks who studied there]]. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] students, of whom [[Oneida Institute#Native American students|we know the names of two]], were openly accepted as well.\n\nUnder Green, Oneida became \"a hotbed of anti-slavery activity.\"<ref name=Axe/>{{rp|44}} It was \"abolitionist to the core, more so than any other American college.\"<ref name=Axe/>{{rp|46}} For Presbyterian minister and Bible professor Green, slavery was not just an evil but a sin, and abolitionism was what Christ's principles mandated.

These include William Forten (son of [[James Forten]]), [[Alexander Crummell]], Rev. [[Henry Highland Garnet]] and Rev.

He had been hired by the philanthropist brothers, and abolitionists, [[Arthur Tappan|Arthur]] and [[Lewis Tappan]] to find a location for a national [[manual labor school]], since Oneida, a manual labor school, was a disappointment, according to Weld and his student followers. (The manual labor school movement had students work about 3 hours a day on farms or in small factories or plants, such as Oneida's printing shop, and was intended to provide needy students with funds for their education \u2013 a form of [[Federal Work-Study Program|work-study]] \u2013 while at the same time providing them the newly-recognized health and spiritual (psychological) benefits of exercise.)\n\nAt the same time that Weld was scouting a location for a new school, the barely-functioning Lane Theological Seminary was looking for students. Based on Weld's recommendation, the Tappans approved the choice, and started giving Lane much of the financial support they had previously given Oneida. Weld, though on paper enrolled as a student at Lane, was ''de facto'' its head, choosing, through his recommendations to the Tappans, the president ([[Lyman Beecher]], after [[Charles Grandison Finney]], who became later the second president of Oberlin, turned it down), and telling the trustees whom to hire.<ref name=Fletcher/>{{rp|54}}\n\nStudents, many of whom considered him the real leader of Lane,<ref name=Lesick>{{cite book\n|title=The Lane rebels : evangelicalism and antislavery in antebellum America\n|last=Lesick\n|first=Lawrence Thomas\n|year=1980\n|location=Metuchen, New Jersey\n|url=https://archive.org/details/lanerebelsevange00lesi/page/156\n|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]\n|isbn=9780810813724}}</ref>{{rp|77}} responded to Weld's announcement of the new school.\n\n{{quote|[Y]oung men gathered in Cincinnati \"as from the hives of the north\".

They then proceeded to hold [[Lane Debates on Slavery|a well-publicized series of debates]] on abolition versus African colonialism, lasting 18 evenings, and decided that abolitionism was a much better solution to slavery.\n\nThese debates alarmed Lane trustees and president, who feared violence, since Cincinnati was strongly anti-abolitionist (see [[Cincinnati riots of 1829]]). They immediately prohibited any future such \"off-the-topic\" discussions. The students, again led by Weld, felt that abolitionism was so important \u2013 it was their responsibility as Christians to promote it \u2013 that they resigned ''en masse'', joined by [[Asa Mahan]], a trustee who supported the students. With support by the Tappans, they briefly tried to establish a new seminary, but as this did not prove a practical solution they accepted a proposal that they move to the new [[Oberlin Collegiate Institute]].\n\n====Oberlin Collegiate Institute====\nThe following year Weld encouraged a group of students at Lane Theological Seminary to form an anti-slavery society. After the president, [[Lyman Beecher]], tried to suppress the group, the students moved to [[Oberlin College]].\n\nDue to its students' anti-slavery position, Oberlin soon became one of the most liberal colleges and accepted African-American students. Along with Garrison, Northcutt and Collins were proponents of immediate abolition. [[Abby Kelley Foster]] became an \"ultra abolitionist\" and a follower of William Lloyd Garrison. She led [[Susan B. Anthony]] as well as Elizabeth Cady Stanton into the anti-slavery cause.\n[[File:Frederick Douglass as a younger man.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Frederick Douglass]] (1818\u20131895), a former slave whose memoirs, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'' (1845) and ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855), became bestsellers, which aided the cause of abolition.]]\nAfter 1840, \"abolition\" usually referred to positions similar to Garrison's. It was largely an ideological movement led by about 3,000 people, including free blacks and [[free people of color]], many of whom, such as [[Frederick Douglass]] in New England, and [[Robert Purvis]] and [[James Forten]] in Philadelphia, played prominent leadership roles. Douglass became legally free during a two-year stay in England, as British supporters raised funds to purchase his freedom from his American owner Thomas Auld, and also helped fund his abolitionist newspapers in the United States.<ref>Marianne Ruuth (1996).

They were split on the issue of women's activism and their political role, and this contributed to a major rift in the Society. In 1839, brothers [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Lewis Tappan]] left the Society and formed the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which did not admit women. Other members of the Society, including [[Charles Turner Torrey]], Amos Phelps, [[Henry Stanton]], and Alanson St. Clair, in addition to disagreeing with Garrison on the women's issue, urged taking a much more activist approach to abolitionism and consequently challenged Garrison's leadership at the Society's annual meeting in January 1839. When the challenge was beaten back,<ref>{{cite book |last = Chapman |first = Maria Weston |title = Right and Wrong in Massachusetts |url = https://archive.org/details/rightwronginmass00chap |year = 1839 |publisher = Dow and Jackson |location = Boston }}</ref> they left and founded the New Organization, which adopted a more activist approach to freeing slaves.

Jewett & Co.), 1847]]\n\nAbolitionists such as [[William Lloyd Garrison]] repeatedly condemned slavery for contradicting the principles of freedom and equality on which the country was founded. In 1854, Garrison wrote:\n<blockquote>I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, \"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Hence, I am an abolitionist. Hence, I cannot but regard oppression in every form \u2013 and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing \u2013 with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle. They who desire me to be dumb on the subject of slavery, unless I will open my mouth in its defense, ask me to give the lie to my professions, to degrade my manhood, and to stain my soul. I will not be a liar, a poltroon, or a hypocrite, to accommodate any party, to gratify any sect, to escape any odium or peril, to save any interest, to preserve any institution, or to promote any object. Convince me that one man may rightfully make another man his slave, and I will no longer subscribe to the Declaration of Independence. Convince me that liberty is not the inalienable birthright of every human being, of whatever complexion or clime, and I will give that instrument to the consuming fire.

Through the compromise, California was admitted as a free state after its state convention unanimously opposed slavery there, Texas was financially compensated for the loss of its territories, the [[slave trade]] (not slavery) was abolished in the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]] was passed as a concession to the South.

The antislavery gains made in previous compromises were reversed. A firestorm of outrage brought together former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], [[Know-Nothings]], and former [[Free Soil]] Democrats to form a new party in 1854\u201356, the Republican Party. It included a program of rapid modernization involving the government promotion of industry, railroads, banks, free homesteads, and colleges, all to the annoyance of the South. The new party denounced the [[Slave Power]] \u2013 that is the political power of the slave owners who supposedly controlled the national government for their own benefit and to the disadvantage of the ordinary white man.<ref>Lewis Gould's ''Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans'' (2003) chapter 1</ref>\n\nThe Republican Party wanted to achieve the gradual extinction of slavery by market forces, because its members believed that free labor was superior to slave labor. Southern leaders said the Republican policy of blocking the expansion of slavery into the West made them second-class citizens, and challenged their autonomy. With the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential victory]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]], seven Deep South states whose economy was based on cotton and slavery decided to secede and form a new nation. The [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861 with the firing on Fort Sumter in South Carolina. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress the rebellion, four more slave states seceded.\n\n[[File:1856-Republican-party-Fremont-isms-caricature.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|This Democratic editorial cartoon links Republican candidate John Fr\u00e9mont (far right) to other radical movements including [[temperance movement|temperance]], [[feminism]], [[Fourierism]], [[free love]], Catholicism, and abolition.]]\n\nWestern explorer [[John C.

The new party crusaded on the slogan: \"Free soil, free silver, free men, Fr\u00e9mont and victory!\" Although he lost, the party showed a strong base. It dominated in Yankee areas of New England, New York and the northern Midwest, and had a strong presence in the rest of the North.

Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy:\n<blockquote>The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a \"cordon of freedom\" around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.<ref>{{cite book |author = James Oakes |title = Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861\u20131865 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&pg=PR12 |year = 2012 |publisher = W.

Not a single slave revolted. Lt. Colonel [[Robert E. Lee]] of the U.S. Army was dispatched to put down the raid, and Brown was quickly captured. Brown was tried for treason against Virginia and hanged. At his trial, Brown exuded a remarkable zeal and single-mindedness that played directly to Southerners' worst fears.

The first federal act taken against slavery during the war occurred on 16 April 1862, when Lincoln signed the [[District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act]], which abolished slavery in Washington D. C. Meanwhile, the Union suddenly found themselves dealing with a steady stream of escaped slaves from the South rushing to Union lines.  In response, Congress passed the [[Confiscation Acts]], which essentially declared escaped slaves from the South to be confiscated war property, and thus did not have to returned to their masters in the Confederacy.  Although the initial act did not mention emancipation, the second Confiscation act, passed on 17 July 1862, stated that escaped or liberated slaves belonging to anyone who participated in or supported the rebellion \"shall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever free of their servitude, and not again held as slaves.\" Pro-Union forces gained control of the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]] and began the process of emancipation in Maryland, Missouri, and West Virginia.  All three states would abolish slavery before the end of the war. Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on 1 January 1863. The passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (ratified in December 1865) abolished slavery in the United States, officially freeing more than 50,000 people still enslaved in Kentucky and Delaware.<ref>{{cite book |first = Eric |last = Foner |title = The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery |year = 2010 |location = New York |publisher = W.

Border states, except Delaware and Kentucky, began their own emancipation programs. Thousands of slaves escaped to freedom behind Union Army lines, and in 1863 many men started serving as the [[United States Colored Troops]]. In June 1864, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]] was repealed. The [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] took effect in December 1865 and ended slavery throughout the United States, except as a punishment for crime. Until it was ratified, slaves still existed in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border states]], the [[slave states]] that did not secede: Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.\n\nThe Amendment also abolished slavery among the Indian tribes.\n\n==Variations by area==\n===Abolition in the North===\n[[File:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[John Jay]] (1745\u20131829), a founder of the [[New York Manumission Society]] in 1785]]\nThe abolitionist movement began about the time of the United States' independence.

[[Manumission]]s increased for nearly two decades. Many individual acts by slaveholders freed thousands of slaves. Slaveholders freed slaves in such numbers that the percentage of free black people in the [[Upper South]] increased from 1 to 10 percent, with most of that increase in [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]] and [[Delaware]]. By 1810 three-quarters of blacks in Delaware were free. The most notable of men offering freedom was [[Robert Carter III]] of Virginia, who freed more than 450 people by \"Deed of Gift\", filed in 1791. This number was more slaves than any single American had freed before or after.<ref>Andrew Levy, ''The First Emancipator: Slavery, Religion and the Quiet Revolution of Robert Carter'', New York: Random House, 2005, p. xi</ref> Often slaveholders came to their decisions by their own struggles in the Revolution; their wills and deeds frequently cited language about the equality of men supporting the decision to set slaves free.

Opposition to slavery, for example, was one of the [[works of piety]] of the [[Methodist Church]]es, which were established by [[John Wesley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gutenson |first1=Charles E. |title=The Right Church |date=2012 |publisher=Abingdon Press |isbn=9781426749117 |pages=58 |language=English}}</ref> \"Abolitionist\" had several meanings at the time. The followers of [[William Lloyd Garrison]], including [[Wendell Phillips]] and [[Frederick Douglass]], demanded the \"immediate abolition of slavery\", hence the name, also called \"immediatism\". A more pragmatic group of abolitionists, such as [[Theodore Dwight Weld|Theodore Weld]] and [[Arthur Tappan]], wanted immediate action, but were willing to support a program of gradual emancipation, with a long intermediate stage.\n\n\"Antislavery men\", such as [[John Quincy Adams]], did not call slavery a sin. They called it an evil feature of society as a whole. They did what they could to limit slavery and end it where possible, but were not part of any abolitionist group. For example, in 1841, John Quincy Adams represented the ''[[United States v. The Amistad|Amistad]]'' African slaves in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and argued that they should be set free.<ref>[http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm \"Amistad\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106090007/http://www.npg.si.edu/col/amistad/index.htm |date=6 November 2007 }}, Smithsonian Institution</ref> In the last years before the war, \"antislavery\" could refer to the Northern majority, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], who opposed expansion of slavery or its influence, as by the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] or the Fugitive Slave Act. Many Southerners called all these abolitionists, without distinguishing them from the Garrisonians.\n\nHistorian James Stewart (1976) explains the abolitionists' deep beliefs: \"All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution.\"<ref>James Brewer Stewart, ''Holy Warriors: The Abolitionists and American Slavery'' (1976)</ref>\n\n[[File:69th New York at church.jpg|thumb|Officers and men of the [[Irish-Catholic]] [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th New York Volunteer Regiment]] attend Catholic services in 1861.]]\n\n[[Irish American|Irish Catholics]] in America seldom challenged the role of slavery in society as it was protected at that time by the U.S. Constitution.

[[Daniel O'Connell]], the Catholic leader of the Irish in Ireland, supported abolition in the United States.

Despite a firm stand for the spiritual equality of black people, and the resounding condemnation of slavery by Pope Gregory XVI in his bull ''[[In supremo apostolatus]]'' issued in 1839, the American church continued in deeds, if not in public discourse, to avoid confrontation with slave-holding interests. In 1861, the Archbishop of New York wrote to Secretary of War Cameron: \"That the Church is opposed to slavery&nbsp;... Her doctrine on that subject is, that it is a crime to reduce men naturally free to a condition of servitude and bondage, as slaves.\"  No American bishop supported extra-political abolition or interference with [[states' rights]] before the Civil War.\n\nThe secular Germans of the [[Forty-Eighters|Forty-Eighter]] immigration were largely anti-slavery.

Radical abolitionism became known as \"Abby Kelleyism\".{{Sfn|Sterling|1991|pp=1\u20133, 41\u201359, 230}}{{Sfn|Morin|1994|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nOther luminaries such as [[Lydia Maria Child]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Harriet Tubman]], and [[Sojourner Truth]] all played important roles in abolitionism. But even beyond these well-known women, abolitionism maintained impressive support from white middle-class and some black women. It was these women who performed many of the logistical, day-to-day tasks that made the movement successful. They raised money, wrote and distributed propaganda pieces, drafted and signed petitions, and lobbied the legislatures. Though abolitionism sowed the seeds of the women's rights movement, most women became involved in abolitionism because of a gendered religious worldview, and the idea that they had feminine, moral responsibilities.<ref>{{cite book |last = Jeffrey |first = Julie Roy |title = The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism |year = 1998 |publisher = University of North Carolina Press |location = Chapel Hill, NC |page = 2 }}</ref> For example, in the winter of 1831\u20131832, women sent three petitions to the Virginia legislature, advocating emancipation of the state's slave population. The only precedent for such action was [[Catharine Beecher|Catharine Beecher's]] organization of a petition protesting the [[Cherokee removal]].<ref>{{cite journal |last = Breen |first = Patrick H. |title = The Female Antislavery Petition Campaign of 1831\u201332 |journal = The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography |year = 2002 |volume = 110 |issue = 3 |page = 377 }}</ref> The Virginia petitions, while the first of their kind, were by no means the last. Similar backing increased leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nEven as women played crucial roles in abolitionism, the movement simultaneously helped stimulate women's-rights efforts. A full 10 years before the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the [[Grimk\u00e9 sisters]] were travelling and lecturing about their experiences with slavery. As Gerda Lerner says, the Grimk\u00e9s understood their actions' great impact. \"In working for the liberation of the slave,\" Lerner writes, \"Sarah and Angelina Grimk\u00e9 found the key to their own liberation. And the consciousness of the significance of their actions was clearly before them.

The Grimk\u00e9 sisters' public speaking played a critical part in legitimizing women's place in the public sphere. Some Christian women created cent societies to benefit abolition movements, where many women in a church would each pledge to donate one cent a week to help abolitionist causes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/divided-by-faith-9780195147070?cc=us&lang=en&|title=Divided by Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America|date=2001-09-06|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195147070|location=Oxford, New York}}</ref>\n\nThe July 1848 [[Seneca Falls Convention]] grew out of a partnership between [[Lucretia Mott]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] that blossomed while the two worked, at first, on abolitionist issues.
