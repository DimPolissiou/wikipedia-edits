''Commissioner'' was a major commercial success. It is a [[cult film]] among [[Kerala|Keralite]] audiences.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] dubbed version ''Police Commissioner'' was a major commercial success.\n\nThe sequel ''[[Bharath Chandran I.P.S.]]'' was released in 2005, directed by Ranji Panicker. In 2012, a crossover film  ''[[The King & the Commissioner]]'', with the characters from ''[[The King (1995 film)|The King]]'' (1995), ''Commissioner'' (1994) and ''Bharath Chandran I.P.S.'' (2005) was released. But it was mainly panned by critics and audiences alike.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe movie opens with [[Kozhikode]] city police commissioner Bharathchandran (Suresh Gopi ), an honest but brash cop, busting a gold smuggling racket in. Bharath clearly has an issue with authority and breaths fire each time he encounters a political arm bender, such as Kunju Moideen Sahib ([[K. P. A. C. Sunny]]), whose gang was involved in the bust. But it his mentor and guardian angel [[Inspector General of Police|I.G.]]  Balachandran ([[M.G. Soman]]), who has been evidently shielding him from the wrath of the political brass.\n\nThe story takes a break from Bharathchandran to introduce the main antagonist Mohan Thomas (Ratheesh), a Delhi based business tycoon, with strong political clout and a clear sociopathic agenda. It is revealed that Mohan Thomas had entrusted Sahib with the gold, which was confiscated by Bharathchandran and is in fact the kingpin heading an unholy nexus of politicians, criminals and various officials including two high ranking cops, Rajan Felix, I.G. Vigilance  (Rajan P. Dev) and Menon, A.I.G.  (N. F. Varghese), who are involved in criminal activities like instigating communal riots and large scale distribution of counterfeit currency.\n\nBharathchandran and Mohan Thomas are set on a collision course when Mohan and Co. brutally murder Justice Mahendran (Karamana Janardanan Nair), chairman of the Poovanthura commission, possessing evidence that could potentially incriminate Rajan Felix and Menon, for their direct involvement in communal riots at Poovanthura. Bharathchandran is not only assigned to investigate the homicide but also made police commissioner of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city. Assisted by ASP Prasad Menon (K. B. Ganesh Kumar) and ASP Mohammed Iqbal (Vijayaraghavan), two dynamic but brash officers, Bharathchandran tries to solve the mystery,  but soon to hit a dead-end. Until Bharathchandran's fianc\u00e9e Indu (Shobana), who is also a lawyer, tips him off about the news clip on an assault on a drunk police constable Gopinathan (Maniyanpilla Raju, who also was coincidentally the security for Justice Mahendran. In an attempt to take Sahib in, while he was in college results in a massive riot as well as a standoff with Rajan Felix, who tries to save Sahib by trying to take him into his custody claiming previous charges. \n \nThe only clue that is left with Bharathchandran and crew are based on Vattapara Pithamparan's ([[Augustine (actor)|Augustine]]), a trade union leader, tipoff, that Sahib had actually attacked Gopinath because of Gopinath's comment on counterfeit currency. With this vital clue Bharathchandran unearths more dirt on Mohan Thomas & Co. Further Bharathchandran arrests Srilatha Varma (Chithra), Mohan's legal advisor and mistress, but is brutally murdered in a hotel elevator by Wilfred Vincent Baston ([[Bheeman Raghu]]), a Goan hitman, who had also murdered Justice Mahendran. Bharathchandran is successful in nabbing Antony Ignatius Pimento, Wilfred's right-hand man and zeroes in on Wilfred. Then he stages a coup by arresting both Rajan Felix and Menon, who are brutally tortured to reveal details on their alliance with Mohan Thomas and also sheds light on their agenda. Iqbal is killed brutally in an attempt to arrest Wilfred Vincent Baston. This enrages Bharathchandran, who later brutally kills Wilfred and then Mohan Thomas at an outhouse by torching the whole house, thus taking law into his own hands\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Suresh Gopi]] as City Police Commissioner Bharathchandran I.P.S\n*[[Ratheesh]] as Mohan Thomas\n*[[Shobana]] as Advocate Indu\n*[[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]] as ASP Mohammad Iqbal I.P.S.\n*[[K.

''Commissioner'' was a major commercial success. It is a [[cult film]] among [[Kerala|Keralite]] audiences.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] dubbed version ''Police Commissioner'' was a major commercial success.\n\nThe sequel ''[[Bharath Chandran I.P.S.]]'' was released in 2005, directed by Ranji Panicker. In 2012, a crossover film  ''[[The King & the Commissioner]]'', with the characters from ''[[The King (1995 film)|The King]]'' (1995), ''Commissioner'' (1994) and ''[[Bharath Chandran I.P.S.]]'' (2005) was released. But it was mainly panned by critics and audiences alike.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe movie opens with [[Kozhikode]] city police commissioner Bharathchandran ([[Suresh Gopi ]]), an honest but brash cop, busting a gold smuggling racket in. Bharath clearly has an issue with authority and breaths fire each time he encounters a political arm bender, such as Kunju Moideen Sahib ([[K. P. A. C. Sunny]]), whose gang was involved in the bust. But it his mentor and guardian angel [[Inspector General of Police|I.G.]]  Balachandran ([[M.G. Soman]]), who has been evidently shielding him from the wrath of the political brass.\n\nThe story takes a break from Bharathchandran to introduce the main antagonist Mohan Thomas ([[Ratheesh]]), a Delhi based business tycoon, with strong political clout and a clear sociopathic agenda. It is revealed that Mohan Thomas had entrusted Sahib with the gold, which was confiscated by Bharathchandran and is in fact the kingpin heading an unholy nexus of politicians, criminals and various officials including two high ranking cops, Rajan Felix, I.G. Vigilance  ([[Rajan P. Dev]]) and Menon, A.I.G.  ([[N. F. Varghese]]), who are involved in criminal activities like instigating communal riots and large scale distribution of counterfeit currency.\n\nBharathchandran and Mohan Thomas are set on a collision course when Mohan and Co. brutally murder Justice Mahendran ([[Karamana Janardanan Nair]]), chairman of the Poovanthura commission, possessing evidence that could potentially incriminate Rajan Felix and Menon, for their direct involvement in communal riots at Poovanthura. Bharathchandran is not only assigned to investigate the homicide but also made police commissioner of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] city. Assisted by ASP Prasad Menon ([[K. B. Ganesh Kumar]]) and ASP Mohammed Iqbal ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]), two dynamic but brash officers, Bharathchandran tries to solve the mystery,  but soon to hit a dead-end. Until Bharathchandran's fianc\u00e9e Indu ([[Shobana]]), who is also a lawyer, tips him off about the news clip on an assault on a drunk police constable Gopinathan ([[Maniyanpilla Raju]], who also was coincidentally the security for Justice Mahendran. In an attempt to take Sahib in, while he was in college results in a massive riot as well as a standoff with Rajan Felix, who tries to save Sahib by trying to take him into his custody claiming previous charges. \n \nThe only clue that is left with Bharathchandran and crew are based on Vattapara Pithamparan's ([[Augustine (actor)|Augustine]]), a trade union leader, tipoff, that Sahib had actually attacked Gopinath because of Gopinath's comment on counterfeit currency. With this vital clue Bharathchandran unearths more dirt on Mohan Thomas & Co. Further Bharathchandran arrests Srilatha Varma (Chithra), Mohan's legal advisor and mistress, but is brutally murdered in a hotel elevator by Wilfred Vincent Baston ([[Bheeman Raghu]]), a Goan hitman, who had also murdered Justice Mahendran. Bharathchandran is successful in nabbing Antony Ignatius Pimento, Wilfred's right-hand man and zeroes in on Wilfred. Then he stages a coup by arresting both Rajan Felix and Menon, who are brutally tortured to reveal details on their alliance with Mohan Thomas and also sheds light on their agenda. Iqbal is killed brutally in an attempt to arrest Wilfred Vincent Baston. This enrages Bharathchandran, who later brutally kills Wilfred and then Mohan Thomas at an outhouse by torching the whole house, thus taking law into his own hands\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Suresh Gopi]] as City Police Commissioner Bharathchandran I.P.S\n*[[Ratheesh]] as Mohan Thomas\n*[[Shobana]] as Advocate Indu\n*[[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]] as ASP Mohammad Iqbal I.P.S.\n*[[K.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |work=Pixar Post |access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

Ian tries to silence them with the staff but the spell is too weak. When Ian and the goat girl are finally in a trance, the mermaids place them in one of the houses. The house they are in starts to sink into the ground.\n\nThe goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers want the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley.

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It was speculated the gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/ |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |first= Scott |last= Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements.

Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |author=Pixar Post |publisher=|access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act.
