With the merger of Triple X into [[WTEM]] to form ''ESPN 980'', Riggins' afternoon show was replaced by WTEM's afternoon drive show, ''The Sports Reporters''.  Riggins stayed with ESPN 980 as a commentator at large.\n\nOn January 3, 2008, Riggins co-hosted the [[2008 Orange Bowl|74th Orange Bowl]] pre-game show. That same night, the [[2008 Kansas Jayhawks football team|Kansas Jayhawks]] defeated the [[Virginia Tech Hokies]] 24\u201321. It came 39 years after Riggins and the Jayhawks last played in the game in 1969. He offered congratulations to his Alma Mater in his closing comments, saying \"The KU ship's been out at sea since '48. It finally came to port tonight!\"\n\nIn September 2008 it was announced that Riggins would co-host the program \"Sirius Blitz\" with Adam Schein on Satellite Radio Stations Sirius 124 and XM 105. Following his involvement with \"Sirius Blitz\" Riggins began hosting his own show, The John Riggins Show, which simulcasts on television and radio on MASN-TV and WTOP-HD3, which airs each weekday afternoon. Riggins has been critical on his radio shows of the current management of the Washington Redskins under owner Dan Snyder.\n\nPreviously, he had been a panelist on ''Redskins Report'' until that show was canceled in December 2008 due to budget cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/29/AR2008122901353.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Leonard Shapiro: Loss of Michael Is a Truly Deep Cut | date=December 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Riggins returned to ESPN 980 Redskins radio in a variety of roles. Weekly appearances consisted of a one-hour appearance on Tuesdays with Bram Weinstein, a Thursday appearance on moving drive with Kevin Sheehan & Chris Cooley and a Friday appearance on Inside The Locker Room with Doc Walker, Brian Mitchell and Scott Jackson.

The player is put in charge of an American [[SSN (U.S. Navy)|SSN]] submarine in the [[Norwegian Sea]] Theater with the overall role of a [[Attack submarine|hunter killer]] performing various missions in the context of the global conflict described in the book representing a campaign. Its original [[Commodore 64]] version was co-designed and co-programmed by the famous game designer [[Sid Meier]].\n\n==Plot==\nAs with {{USS|Chicago|SSN-721|6}} in the book, the game concentrates on the [[Norwegian Sea]] theater, placing the player as captain of a single [[United States Navy]] [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] tasked to disrupt [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in the area between the [[Kola Peninsula]] and the Greenland-Iceland-UK barrier. Missions may include interdiction of [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]] fleets, stopping amphibious landing forces, eliminating Soviet [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolf pack]] submarines and many others. The background story remains true to the book's plot but the final mission is always to prevent the Soviets from launching nuclear missiles by locating and eliminating their [[ballistic missile submarine]]s.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe player may choose from four different timelines. Starting in the early 1980s limits the player to [[Thresher/Permit-class submarine|''Permit'']], {{sclass-|Sturgeon|submarine|5}} or early {{sclass-|Los Angeles|submarine|5}}-class submarines, but the Soviets have weak [[sonar]], whereas starting in the late 1980s allows the player to use the improved ''Los Angeles'' class and even the newer {{sclass-|Seawolf|submarine|5}} subs. Weapons improve accordingly, with [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk missiles]] and improved [[Mark 48 torpedo]]es included in later timelines but the Soviets begin deploying [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[aircraft carrier]]s and much better [[anti-submarine warfare]] ships.\n\nThe goal of the game is always consistent: Inflicting as much damage as possible on the Soviets in the Norwegian Sea, thus allowing safe passage to supply [[convoy]]s coming from America and preventing amphibious forces from conquering Norway and Iceland. In order to make contact with enemy forces, the player must navigate the sub in a map of the North Sea, depending on his sub's sensors as well as allied aircraft, satellites and [[SOSUS]] arrays to detect the Soviet forces.\n\nSuccess or failure of the missions impacts the progress of the war depicted by shifts in the front line on a simple map of Europe. If the player fails in a mission then Soviet forces capture more territory, but if he succeeds then [[NATO]] is able to resist the Soviet attacks. In the course of the campaign the player can gain rank and possibly earn medals as well. In the end of the war, a final score is calculated and the player is awarded a post-war rank if NATO wins the war; this rank can vary from [[commander]] to [[admiral]] depending on how successful they have been in their missions. A poor performance in the game, particularly in the final mission, means that the Soviets win the war and the player ends up with the rank of [[Comrade#Russian usage|Tovarishch]] (comrade), becoming a political prisoner in a communist-ruled America.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Compute!]]'' called ''Red Storm Rising'' a \"must\" for fans of Tom Clancy or military simulations.<ref name=\"sheffield198902\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1989-02-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_105_1989_Feb#page/n75/mode/2up | title=Red Storm Rising | work=Compute! | date=February 1989 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Sheffield, Richard | pages=66}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in 1988 and 1992 gave the game four and a half stars out of five, commending it for balancing realism and gameplay while noting deviations from realism, such as the durability of the player's submarine.

Magazines also cannot be accepted, as only a select few have access to episode information before their official release date. Also, do not change the Japanese names to their English translations '''UNTIL''' they have finished airing in an English speaking nation in the English dub. Being just \"close\" to airing in English is not enough; they must actually air beforehand in whatever timezone is the country of the original English airing - in the U.S. in most cases, episodes generally air in the Saturday morning time slot starting 9:00 Am - 9:30 AM EST/EDT or on Saturday evening 6:00 pm - 6:30pm EST/EDT, although there can be unique time slots. To comply with WP:CRYSTAL, you must cite a source for future air dates - only remove the citation once the episode has actually aired in the United States, and the fact that there is \"usually\" a weekly airing schedule when Pok\u00e9mon airs on Disney XD is also unreliable as other programs can be aired on the network in place of Pok\u00e9mon's time slot, delaying new English episodes by a week. Also, do not re-add or remove hidden titles before the announcement date; do not used Wikia such as fake release date are not followed scheduled.

The six visiting children are split into three teams: Team Blue escorted by Satoshi and Pikachu; Team Red by Go, Rabbifuto and Koharu; and Team Yellow by Professor Sakuragi and Koharu's Wanpachi, to explore a section of the city and learn about the Pokemon they meet. Naturally, the kids are in for different but interesting experiences: Satoshi and Pikachu show their kids Pokemon-battling (getting involved in a Pokemon World Championship ranking match along the way), and Go goes on a Pokemon-catching spree with his duo.

While Pikachu is being treated at the Kuchiba City Pokemon Center, a Pokemon egg there from the Sinnoh Region that hasn't been willing to hatch yet reacts to Satoshi, and Joy-san entrusts the egg to him. That night at the Sakuragi Institute, the egg hatches to reveal a Riolu, who runs away and starts attacking wild Pokemon indiscriminately, including an Iwark that may be too strong for Riolu unless Satoshi and Pikachu can get there in time.\n| LineColor       = #df73ff\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = List of Pocket Monsters (2019) episodes\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1109\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1102\n| Title           = Goodbye, Rabbifuto!\n| TranslitTitle   = Sayonara, Rabbifuto! \n| NativeTitle     = \u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089\u3001\u30e9\u30d3\u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\uff01\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| RTitle          = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|04|19}}\n| AltDate         =\n| ShortSummary    = The rift between Rabbifuto and Go seems to be getting worse and worse.
