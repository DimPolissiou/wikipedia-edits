During his career, he played as a [[small forward]] and [[shooting guard]]. During his college career at the [[University of Cincinnati]], Patterson earned third-team All-American honors and helped lead the Bearcats to [[Conference USA]] titles in both of his seasons there. Drafted by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in [[1998 NBA draft|1998]], Patterson began his career with the Greek team [[AEK Athens BC]] before joining the Lakers in his rookie season. Later, he played for the NBA teams [[Seattle SuperSonics]], [[Portland Trail Blazers]], [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]], and [[Los Angeles Clippers]] before ending his career with the Lebanese team [[Champville SC]].\n\n==Early life==\nPatterson had a troubled family life, both parents and one of his sisters battled [[drug addiction]], and his father spent time in [[prison]]. As a youth, he lived mostly with his mother, Charlene Patterson, who died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] when he was at the [[University of Cincinnati]].\n\nAfter hearing of her death while on a road trip at UAB, he rejected an offer to fly home and spend time with his family, instead staying with his team for the game and scoring 32 points. \"My mother would have wanted me to play,\" Patterson later explained.\n\nPatterson started off his college basketball career in the small town of [[Independence, Kansas]] at the [[Independence Community College]]. He later transferred to the University of Cincinnati.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Professional career==\nPatterson was a second-round selection of the [[1998 NBA Draft]] (31st pick overall), chosen by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Due to the [[1998-99 NBA season|lock-out season of 1998]], he started the season in the [[A1 Ethniki|Greek league]] playing with [[AEK Athens BC]] where he averaged 12.6 points and 3.6 rebounds in 19 games. He later played for the Lakers, the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], the [[Denver Nuggets]], the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], and the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], averaging a career 10.7 points and 4.2 rebounds per game. He nicknamed himself the \"Kobe Stopper\" after claiming he could play strong defense against NBA superstar [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\nPatterson left the Lakers for Seattle on August 10, 1999 as a free agent. He quickly became known as a solid defensive player and a good shooter, finishing fourth in the league in field goal percentage. He finished his second season in Seattle after starting 74 of 81 games, and third on the team in scoring with 13.6 points per game. After that season, he signed with the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nIn his second year in Portland, trouble began to brew for Patterson. He was punched in the face by teammate [[Zach Randolph]] during a practice. Randolph intervened in an argument between Patterson and rookie teammate [[Qyntel Woods]]. The move cost Randolph $100,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-04-04/sports/0304040467_1_randolph-artest-outburst |title=Incident with Zach Randolph |publisher=Articles.orlandosentinel.com |date=April 4, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref>\nOften outspoken and erratic, Patterson was temporarily suspended from the Trail Blazers in the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]] for speaking harshly to coach [[Nate McMillan]] and refusing to return to a game, upset about his lack of playing time.

There are four powered axles in each power car and two powered axles in the outer bogie of the front passenger coach (a layout used on the original [[SNCF TGV Sud-Est]] (PSE) sets) giving 12 powered axles. Each set draws up to 16MW with {{Convert|12|MW|lk=on|abbr=on}} of traction power, but the lowest [[power-to-weight ratio]] in the TGV family.\n\nThe class uses five different standards of [[overhead lines|overhead]]: domestic catenary in each of Belgium, France and the United Kingdom; fixed-height catenary on [[Lignes \u00e0 Grande Vitesse|LGV]] lines and HS1; and taller catenary in the [[Channel Tunnel]], designed to accommodate double-deck car-carrying trains and roll-on roll-off heavy goods vehicle trains. The driver must manually lower and then raise the pantograph during the transition between catenary systems.\n\n=== Signalling systems ===\nThe Class 373s are fitted with a wide range of signalling systems, these include:\n*[[Automatic Warning System|AWS]] (Automatic Warning System), the British signalling system, only used when services call at Ashford International<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers|last=A.

With the TVM signalling used on the high-speed lines, the target speed for the end of the current block is displayed with a flashing indication on the in-cab display for the next block if it is at a different speed. Auxiliary signalling information, including the location of neutral sections in the overhead supply and pantograph adjustment zones, is displayed in cab and by the lineside. The operation of circuit breakers over neutral sections is handled automatically on TVM-signalled lines only, and pantograph adjustments must always be manually performed by the driver.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhvSn8k1Mg&t=763s|title=Eurostar Driver's eye view|date=2004|type=Documentary|time=12:56 min}}</ref>\n\n=== Bogies and couplings ===\nThe Class 373 was designed to comply with the Channel Tunnel safety regulations, and consists of two independent half-sets, each with its own power car. Most of the trailer cars are supported on [[Jacobs bogie]]s shared between adjacent coaches, supporting both of them, with the cars next to the power cars and the two middle coaches (carriages 9 and 10 in a full-length set) not articulated.  Non-shared bogies are coupled with [[Scharfenberg coupler]]s, providing three points for separation in the event of an emergency in the [[Channel Tunnel]]. The electrical supply cables between a power car and the first carriage are designed to break apart during an emergency separation. In the event of a serious fire in the Tunnel the passengers would be transferred into the undamaged half of the train, which would then be uncoupled from the damaged half and driven out of the tunnel.<ref name=\"highspeedwho\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.christianwolmar.co.uk/2007/11/rail-579-who-is-going-to-use-the-new-high-speed-line/ |issue=579 |title=Who is going to use the new high speed line? |date=23 November 2007 |first=Christian|last=Wolmar|authorlink=Christian Wolmar|magazine=Rail Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2009}}</ref> If the undamaged part is the rear half of the train, this would be driven by the {{lang|fr|Chef du Train}} who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear driving cab in the tunnel for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/3531375/Eurostar-services-could-be-disrupted-by-strike-in-run-up-to-Christmas.html |title= Eurostar services could be disrupted by strike in run up to Christmas | date=27 November 2008|first=David|last=Millward|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=11 May 2009 | location=London}}</ref>  Due to limitations on driving hours, the driver and Chef du Train exchange roles for the return journey.\n\nThe [[articulated car|articulated]] design is advantageous during a derailment as the carriages will tend to stay aligned.  On non-articulated trains [[Railway coupling|couplings]] may break and the carriages may [[Jackknifing|jackknife]]. A disadvantage of articulation is that it is difficult to remove and separate the individual carriages for maintenance. Although the power cars can be uncoupled, specialised depot equipment is needed to split carriages by lifting the entire train at once. Once uncoupled, one of the carriage ends is left without a bogie at the point of separation, so a bogie frame is required to support it.\n\n=== Braking systems ===\nThe class 373s use three [[railway brake|braking systems]]:\n*The 12 traction motors can provide [[dynamic braking]]\n*All non-powered axles have four [[disc brake]]s.\n*All powered axles have cast iron brake shoes pressed against the wheel rim.\nA train travelling at {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0}} can slow down to stop in 65 seconds, during which time it travels about {{convert|2.7|km|abbr=in}}\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nTo combat the hypnotic effect of driving through the tunnel at speed for 20 minutes, the power cars have a very small windscreen when compared to other high-speed trains and TGVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/eurostar.htm|title=Features of the Eurostar: The Windscreen|last=Keating|first=Oliver|work=High Speed Rail (HSR)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413114416/http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/eurostar.htm|archive-date=13 April 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=29 September 2010|quote=it was found that going down a tunnel at a fast rate for several minutes induced a hypnotic effect on the driver}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newhamstory.com/node/850|title=Eurostar Depot|work=The Newham Story|publisher=Newham Council|first=Robert|last=Rogers|quote=if a normal size window and side windows were used, it causes Hypnotic effect on the driver when travelling through the Tunnel.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714172633/http://www.newhamstory.com/node/850|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gres.org.uk/page16.html|title=Class 373 Eurostar high speed electric multiple units|publisher=The Gravesend Railway Enthusiasts Society|first=Bob|last=Poole|accessdate=27 September 2010|quote=the small size of the drivers window is deliberate, to avoid hypnotic effects while in tunnel.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817123919/http://gres.org.uk/page16.html|archivedate=17 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Significant events ==\n\n=== Accidents and incidents ===\n{{Further|TGV accidents}}\nOn 5 June 2000, 373101/102 on a Paris to London service derailed on LGV Nord near Arras, France at 180mph (290 km/h). 14 people were treated for light injuries or shock, with no serious injures or fatalities.

To reduce the [[unsprung mass]], TGV trains have the motors attached to the train rather than the [[bogie]]s. In order for the train to be able to go around curves a sliding \"tripod\" assembly is used, which became dislodged.\n\nThere have been several minor incidents.

Part of the [[TGV]] family, it was built with a smaller cross-section to fit the smaller [[loading gauge]] in Britain, was originally capable of operating on the UK [[third rail]] network, and has extensive [[fireproofing]] in case of fire in the tunnel. It is both the second longest\u2014{{convert|387|m}}\u2014and second fastest train in regular UK passenger service, operating at speeds of up to {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0}}.

Five of the SNCF-owned sets are quadri-voltage, able to operate from 1,500&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC (French ''lignes classiques'') in the south of France, used on London\u2013Avignon and ski services.\n[[File:Herne Hill Eurostar geograph-3671884-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|A Class 373 passes {{stnlnk|Herne Hill}}; from 1994 until 2007, Eurostar ran its services to and from London Waterloo/Waterloo International, using the [[Southern Region of British Railways|third rail network in Southern England]]]]\nThe trains are powered by asynchronous [[traction motor]]s.  There are four powered axles in each power car and two powered axles in the outer bogie of the front passenger coach (a layout used on the original [[SNCF TGV Sud-Est]] (PSE) sets) giving 12 powered axles. Each set draws up to 16MW with {{Convert|12|MW|lk=on|abbr=on}} of traction power, but the lowest [[power-to-weight ratio]] in the TGV family.\n\nThe class uses five different standards of [[overhead lines|overhead]]: domestic catenary in each of Belgium, France and the United Kingdom; fixed-height catenary on [[Lignes \u00e0 Grande Vitesse|LGV]] lines and HS1; and taller catenary in the [[Channel Tunnel]], designed to accommodate double-deck car-carrying trains and roll-on roll-off heavy goods vehicle trains. The driver must manually lower and then raise the pantograph during the transition between catenary systems.\n\n=== Signalling systems ===\nThe Class 373s are fitted with a wide range of signalling systems, these include:\n*[[Automatic Warning System|AWS]] (Automatic Warning System), the British signalling system, only used when services call at Ashford International<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers|last=A.

With the TVM signalling used on the high-speed lines, the target speed for the end of the current block is displayed with a flashing indication on the in-cab display for the next block if it is at a different speed. Auxiliary signalling information, including the location of neutral sections in the overhead supply and pantograph adjustment zones, is displayed in cab and by the lineside. The operation of circuit breakers over neutral sections is handled automatically on TVM-signalled lines only, and pantograph adjustments must always be manually performed by the driver.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzhvSn8k1Mg&t=763s|title=Eurostar Driver's eye view|date=2004|type=Documentary|time=12:56 min}}</ref>\n\n=== Bogies and couplings ===\nThe Class 373 was designed to comply with the Channel Tunnel safety regulations, and consists of two independent half-sets, each with its own power car. Most of the trailer cars are supported on [[Jacobs bogie]]s shared between adjacent coaches, supporting both of them, with the cars next to the power cars and the two middle coaches (carriages 9 and 10 in a full-length set) not articulated.  Non-shared bogies are coupled with [[Scharfenberg coupler]]s, providing three points for separation in the event of an emergency in the [[Channel Tunnel]]. The electrical supply cables between a power car and the first carriage are designed to break apart during an emergency separation. In the event of a serious fire in the Tunnel the passengers would be transferred into the undamaged half of the train, which would then be uncoupled from the damaged half and driven out of the tunnel.<ref name=\"highspeedwho\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.christianwolmar.co.uk/2007/11/rail-579-who-is-going-to-use-the-new-high-speed-line/ |issue=579 |title=Who is going to use the new high speed line? |date=23 November 2007 |first=Christian|last=Wolmar|authorlink=Christian Wolmar|magazine=Rail Magazine |accessdate=11 May 2009}}</ref> If the undamaged part is the rear half of the train, this would be driven by the {{lang|fr|Chef du Train}} who is a fully authorised driver and occupies the rear driving cab in the tunnel for this purpose.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/3531375/Eurostar-services-could-be-disrupted-by-strike-in-run-up-to-Christmas.html |title= Eurostar services could be disrupted by strike in run up to Christmas | date=27 November 2008|first=David|last=Millward|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=11 May 2009 | location=London}}</ref>  Due to limitations on driving hours, the driver and Chef du Train exchange roles for the return journey.\n\nThe [[articulated car|articulated]] design is advantageous during a derailment as the carriages will tend to stay aligned.  On non-articulated trains [[Railway coupling|couplings]] may break and the carriages may [[Jackknifing|jackknife]]. A disadvantage of articulation is that it is difficult to remove and separate the individual carriages for maintenance. Although the power cars can be uncoupled, specialised depot equipment is needed to split carriages by lifting the entire train at once. Once uncoupled, one of the carriage ends is left without a bogie at the point of separation, so a bogie frame is required to support it.\n\n=== Braking systems ===\nThe class 373s use three [[railway brake|braking systems]]:\n*The 12 traction motors can provide [[dynamic braking]]\n*All non-powered axles have four [[disc brake]]s.\n*All powered axles have cast iron brake shoes pressed against the wheel rim.\nA train travelling at {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0}} can slow down to stop in 65 seconds, during which time it travels about {{convert|2.7|km|abbr=in}}\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nTo combat the hypnotic effect of driving through the tunnel at speed for 20 minutes, the power cars have a very small windscreen when compared to other high-speed trains and TGVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/eurostar.htm|title=Features of the Eurostar: The Windscreen|last=Keating|first=Oliver|work=High Speed Rail (HSR)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413114416/http://www.o-keating.com/hsr/eurostar.htm|archive-date=13 April 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=29 September 2010|quote=it was found that going down a tunnel at a fast rate for several minutes induced a hypnotic effect on the driver}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newhamstory.com/node/850|title=Eurostar Depot|work=The Newham Story|publisher=Newham Council|first=Robert|last=Rogers|quote=if a normal size window and side windows were used, it causes Hypnotic effect on the driver when travelling through the Tunnel.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714172633/http://www.newhamstory.com/node/850|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gres.org.uk/page16.html|title=Class 373 Eurostar high speed electric multiple units|publisher=The Gravesend Railway Enthusiasts Society|first=Bob|last=Poole|accessdate=27 September 2010|quote=the small size of the drivers window is deliberate, to avoid hypnotic effects while in tunnel.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817123919/http://gres.org.uk/page16.html|archivedate=17 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Significant events ==\n\n=== Accidents and incidents ===\n{{Further|TGV accidents}}\nOn 5 June 2000, 373101/102 on a Paris to London service derailed on LGV Nord near Arras, France at 180mph (290 km/h). 14 people were treated for light injuries or shock, with no serious injures or fatalities.

To reduce the [[unsprung mass]], TGV trains have the motors attached to the train rather than the [[bogie]]s. In order for the train to be able to go around curves a sliding \"tripod\" assembly is used, which became dislodged.\n\nThere have been several minor incidents. In October 1994, there were teething problems relating to the start of operations.
