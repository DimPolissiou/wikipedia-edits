Agricultural output is a component of the GDP of a nation.\n\n;[[Secondary sector of the economy|Industrial (or secondary) sector]]: ''[[Industry]]'' is the segment of economy concerned with production of goods (including [[fuel|fuels]] and [[fertilizer|fertilisers]]). Industrial output is a component of the GDP of a nation.\n\n;[[Tertiary sector of the economy|Service (or tertiary) sector]]: A ''[[service (economics)|service]]'' is the non-material equivalent of a [[goods|good]]. Service provision is defined as an economic activity that does not result in [[ownership]], and this is what differentiates it from providing physical goods. It is claimed {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} to be a process that creates benefits by facilitating either a change in [[customer|customers]], a change in their physical [[ownership|possessions]], or a change in their intangible [[asset|assets]]. [[Service (economics)|Service]] output is a component of the GDP of a nation.

Agricultural output is a component of the GDP of a nation.\n\n;[[Secondary sector of the economy|Industrial (or secondary) sector]]: ''[[Industry]]'' is the segment of economy concerned with production of goods (including [[fuel]]s and [[fertiliser]]s).

Another vulnerability allowing the client unprompted access to camera and microphone was again discovered in 2020 ([https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11470 CVE-2020-11470]).\n\nIn July 2019, security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh disclosed<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5 |title=Zoom Zero Day: 4+ Million Webcams & maybe an RCE?

In addition, attempts to uninstall the Zoom client on macOS would prompt the software to re-install automatically in the background, using a hidden web server that was set up on the machine during the first installation and remained active even after attempting to remove the client. After receiving public criticism, Zoom updated their software to remove the vulnerability and the hidden webserver, allowing complete uninstallation.<ref name=\"Anderson 2019\">{{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Tim | title=Anyone for unintended Chat Roulette?

The number of [[Domain name|domains]] containing the name \"Zoom\" showed a sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of these were used to make fake Zoom websites and links for the purposes of stealing personal information. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252480806/Coronavirus-Warning-over-surge-in-Zoom-security-incidents|title=Coronavirus: Warning over surge in Zoom security incidents|last=Scroxton|first=Alex|date=30 March 2020|website=ComputerWeekly.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n===Windows credentials risk===\nOn 23 March 2020, it was discovered that because Zoom auto-converts links sent to conference participants, this becomes a vector for hackers to \"access shared network resources, such as Outlook servers and storage devices\"; i.e., hard disks, printers, shared folders, etc.<ref>{{cite news |last1=DAN GOODIN |title=Attackers can use Zoom to steal users\u2019 Windows credentials with no warning |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/04/unpatched-zoom-bug-lets-attackers-steal-windows-credentials-with-no-warning/ |accessdate=2 April 2020 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=1 April 2020 |language=en |quote=The vulnerability was first described last week by a researcher who uses the Twitter handle @_g0dmode.

One of the reasons was that Zoom turned the Universal Naming Convention of the Windows network into a clickable link. If the user accidentally clicks on the relevant link, the user name and password may be leaked.\n\nSecurity experts warn that the vulnerability is serious because the required technology is scarce, and the consequences of a username and password being compromised by a hacker are unimaginable. Matthew Hickey, another expert who confirmed the vulnerabilities, claimed that hackers could use the same vulnerability to randomly cause users' computers to execute viruses and applications. Although a prompt may pop up before execution, some users may not know that pressing the confirmation randomly may make the computer poisoned or controlled by a hacker.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Finance links\n| name      = Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n| symbol    = ZM\n| reuters   = ZM.O\n| bloomberg = ZM:US\n| sec_cik   = ZM\n| yahoo     = ZM\n| google    = ZM\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Software companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:2011 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Jose, California]]\n[[Category:Web conferencing]]\n[[Category:Videotelephony]]\n[[Category:2019 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "<noinclude>{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=Zoom Video|2=Talk:Zoom Video Communications#Requested move 27 March 2020 }}\n</noinclude>{{short description|American video communications company}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name               = Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n| logo               = Zoom Communications Logo.svg\n| type               = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as          = {{nowrap|{{NASDAQ|ZM}} (Class A)}}\n| foundation         = 2011\n| location_city      = {{Nowrap|[[San Jose, California]]}}\n| key_people         = [[Eric Yuan]], founder and CEO\n| services           = Zoom Meetings<br>Zoom Premium Audio<br>Zoom Business IM<br>Zoom Video Webinar<br>Zoom Rooms<br>Zoom H.323/SIP Connector<br>Zoom Developer Platform\n| num_employees      = 1,958\n| num_employees_year = 2019\n| website            = {{Official URL}}\n}}\n[[File:DenverZoomAdvertizement.jpg|thumb|Zoom advertisement at [[Denver International Airport]]]]\n\n'''Zoom Video Communications''' is an American remote conferencing services company headquartered in [[San Jose, California]].

This would allow the attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users, or hijack shared screens. Another vulnerability allowing the client unprompted access to camera and microphone was again discovered in 2020 ([https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11470 CVE-2020-11470]).\n\nIn July 2019, security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh disclosed<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5 |title=Zoom Zero Day: 4+ Million Webcams & maybe an RCE?

In addition, attempts to uninstall the Zoom client on macOS would prompt the software to re-install automatically in the background, using a hidden web server that was set up on the machine during the first installation and remained active even after attempting to remove the client. After receiving public criticism, Zoom updated their software to remove the vulnerability and the hidden webserver, allowing complete uninstallation.<ref name=\"Anderson 2019\">{{cite web | last=Anderson | first=Tim | title=Anyone for unintended Chat Roulette?

One of the reasons was that Zoom turned the Universal Naming Convention of the Windows network into a clickable link. If the user accidentally clicks on the relevant link, the user name and password may be leaked.\n\nSecurity experts warn that the vulnerability is serious because the required technology is scarce, and the consequences of a username and password being compromised by a hacker are unimaginable. Matthew Hickey, another expert who confirmed the vulnerabilities, claimed that hackers could use the same vulnerability to randomly cause users' computers to execute viruses and applications. Although a prompt may pop up before execution, some users may not know that pressing the confirmation randomly may make the computer poisoned or controlled by a hacker.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{Finance links\n| name      = Zoom Video Communications, Inc.\n| symbol    = ZM\n| reuters   = ZM.O\n| bloomberg = ZM:US\n| sec_cik   = ZM\n| yahoo     = ZM\n| google    = ZM\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Software companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2011]]\n[[Category:2011 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Jose, California]]\n[[Category:Web conferencing]]\n[[Category:Videotelephony]]\n[[Category:2019 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "XavierItzm", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e=Windows password risk:typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications"}
