Examples of such magneto&shy;fluids include [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], [[liquid metal]]s, [[Brine|salt water]], and [[electrolyte]]s. The word \"magneto&shy;hydro&shy;dynamics\" is derived from ''magneto-'' meaning [[magnetic field]], ''hydro-'' meaning [[water]], and ''dynamics'' meaning movement. The field of MHD was initiated by [[Hannes Alfv\u00e9n]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alfv\u00e9n | first1 = H | year = 1942 | title = Existence of electromagnetic-hydrodynamic waves | bibcode=1942Natur.150..405A | journal = Nature | volume = 150 | issue = 3805| pages = 405\u2013406 | doi=10.1038/150405d0}}</ref> for which he received the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics in 1970.\n\nThe fundamental concept behind MHD is that magnetic fields can [[Electromagnetic induction|induce]] currents in a moving conductive fluid, which in turn polarizes the fluid and reciprocally changes the magnetic field itself.

However, by a similar process the voltage induced by the tide in the English Channel was measured in 1851.<ref>McKetta J McKetta, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=U8Bd7TOcma4C&pg=PA127 Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 66]\" (1999) {{Dead link|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Ideal and resistive MHD ==\n[[File:T3e troy.jpg|right|frame|MHD Simulation of the Solar Wind]]\nThe simplest form of MHD, Ideal MHD, assumes that the fluid has so little [[resistivity]] that it can be treated as a [[perfect conductor]].  This is the limit of infinite [[magnetic Reynolds number]]. In ideal MHD, [[Lenz's law]] dictates that the fluid is in a sense ''tied'' to the magnetic field lines. To explain, in ideal MHD a small rope-like volume of fluid surrounding a field line will continue to lie along a magnetic field line,\neven as it is twisted and distorted by fluid flows in the system. This is sometimes referred to as the magnetic field lines being \"frozen\" in the fluid.<ref>Eric Priest and Terry Forbes, \"Magnetic Reconnection: MHD Theory and Applications\", Cambridge University Press, First Edition, 2000, pp 25.</ref>\nThe connection between magnetic field lines and fluid in ideal MHD fixes the [[topology]] of the magnetic field in the fluid\u2014for example, if a set of magnetic field lines are tied into a knot, then they will remain so as long as the fluid/plasma has negligible resistivity.  This difficulty in reconnecting magnetic field lines makes it possible to store energy by moving the fluid or the source of the magnetic field.  The energy can then become available if the conditions for ideal MHD break down, allowing [[magnetic reconnection]] that releases the stored energy from the magnetic field.\n\n=== Ideal MHD equations ===\n[[File:Magnetohydrodynamic Flow Simulation.jpg|thumb|Magnetohydrodynamic flow simulation showing magnetic flux density]]\nThe ideal MHD equations consist of the [[continuity equation]], the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], [[Ampere's Law]] neglecting displacement current, and a [[Conservation of energy|temperature evolution equation]].  As with any fluid description to a kinetic system, a closure approximation must be applied to highest moment of the particle distribution equation.  This is often accomplished with approximations to the heat flux through a condition of [[Adiabatic process|adiabaticity]] or [[Isothermal process|isothermality]].\n\nThe main quantities which characterize the electrically conducting fluid are the bulk plasma [[velocity field]] '''v''', the [[current density]] '''J''', the [[mass density]] ''\u03c1'', and the plasma [[pressure]] ''p''. The flowing electric charge in the plasma is the source of a [[magnetic field]] '''B''' and [[electric field]] '''E'''. All quantities generally vary with time ''t''. [[Vector operator]] notation will be used, in particular \u2207 is [[gradient]], \u2207\u22c5 is [[divergence]], and \u2207\u00d7 is [[curl (mathematics)|curl]].\n\nThe mass [[continuity equation]] is\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\rho\\mathbf{v}\\right)=0.</math>\nThe [[Cauchy momentum equation]] is\n:<math> \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla \\right)\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\nabla p.</math>\nThe [[Lorentz force]] term '''J'''\u00d7'''B''' can be expanded using Ampere's law and the [[vector calculus identity]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathbf{B})=(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}+\\mathbf{B}\\times(\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B})</math>\n\nto give\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} =  \\frac{\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right),</math>\nwhere the first term on the right hand side is the [[magnetic tension force]] and the second term is the [[magnetic pressure]] force.\nThe ideal Ohm's law for a plasma is given by\n:<math>\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} = 0. </math>\nFaraday's law is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}. </math>\nThe low-frequency Ampere's law neglects displacement current and is given by\n:<math>\\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} = \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}.</math>\nThe magnetic divergence constraint is\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B} = 0.</math>\nThe energy equation is given by\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left(\\frac{p}{\\rho^\\gamma}\\right) = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma=5/3</math> is the ratio of [[specific heat]]s for an [[adiabatic]] [[equation of state]]. This energy equation is, of course, only applicable in the absence of shocks or heat conduction as it assumes that the entropy of a fluid element does not change.\n\n=== Applicability of ideal MHD to plasmas ===\n\nIdeal MHD is only strictly applicable when:\n\n# The plasma is strongly collisional, so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are therefore close to [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]].\n# The resistivity due to these collisions is small. In particular, the typical magnetic diffusion times over any scale length present in the system must be longer than any time scale of interest.\n# Interest in length scales much longer than the ion [[Plasma parameters#Lengths|skin depth]] and [[Larmor radius]] perpendicular to the field, long enough along the field to ignore [[Landau damping]], and time scales much longer than the ion gyration time (system is smooth and slowly evolving).\n\n=== Importance of resistivity ===\n\nIn an imperfectly conducting fluid the magnetic field can generally move through the fluid following a [[Diffusion equation|diffusion law]] with the resistivity of the plasma serving as a [[diffusion constant]]. This means that solutions to the ideal MHD equations are only applicable for a limited time for a region of a given size before diffusion becomes too important to ignore.  One can estimate the diffusion time across a [[solar active region]] (from collisional resistivity) to be  hundreds to thousands of years, much longer than the actual lifetime of a sunspot\u2014so it would seem reasonable to ignore the resistivity. By contrast, a meter-sized volume of seawater has a magnetic diffusion time measured in milliseconds.\n\nEven in physical systems \u2013 which are large and conductive enough that simple estimates of the [[Lundquist number]] suggest that the resistivity can be ignored \u2013 resistivity may still be important: many [[Instability|instabilities]] exist that can increase the effective resistivity of the plasma by factors of more than a billion. The enhanced resistivity is usually the result of the formation of small scale structure like current sheets or fine scale magnetic [[Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence|turbulence]], introducing small spatial scales into the system over which ideal MHD is broken and magnetic diffusion can occur quickly. When this happens, magnetic reconnection may occur in the plasma to release stored magnetic energy as waves, bulk mechanical acceleration of material, [[particle acceleration]], and heat.\n\nMagnetic reconnection in highly conductive systems is important because it concentrates energy in time and space, so that gentle forces applied to a plasma for long periods of time can cause violent explosions and bursts of radiation.\n\nWhen the fluid cannot be considered as completely conductive, but the other conditions for ideal MHD are satisfied, it is possible to use an extended model called resistive MHD. This includes an extra term in Ohm's Law which models the collisional resistivity. Generally MHD computer simulations are at least somewhat resistive because their computational grid introduces a [[numerical resistivity]].\n\n=== Importance of kinetic effects ===\n\nAnother limitation of MHD (and fluid theories in general) is that they depend on the assumption that the plasma is strongly collisional (this is the first criterion listed above), so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]. This is usually not the case in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas. When this is not the case, or the interest is in smaller spatial scales, it may be necessary to use a kinetic model which properly accounts for the non-Maxwellian shape of the distribution function.  However, because MHD is relatively simple and captures many of the important properties of plasma dynamics it is often qualitatively accurate and is therefore often the first model tried.\n\nEffects which are essentially kinetic and not captured by fluid models include [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]], [[Landau damping]], a wide range of instabilities, chemical separation in space plasmas and electron runaway. In the case of ultra-high intensity laser interactions, the incredibly short timescales of energy deposition mean that hydrodynamic codes fail to capture the essential physics.\n\n== Structures in MHD systems ==\n{{further|Magnetosphere particle motion}}\n[[File:Currents.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Schematic view of the different current systems which shape the Earth's magnetosphere]]\n\nIn many MHD systems most of the electric current is compressed into thin nearly-two-dimensional ribbons termed [[current sheet]]s.  These can divide the fluid into magnetic domains, inside of which the currents are relatively weak. Current sheets in\nthe solar corona are thought to be between a few meters and a few kilometers in thickness, which is quite thin compared to the magnetic domains (which are thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilometers across). Another example is in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], where current sheets separate topologically distinct domains, isolating most of the Earth's [[ionosphere]] from the [[solar wind]].\n\n== Waves ==\n{{see also|Waves in plasmas}}\nThe wave modes derived using MHD plasma theory are called '''magnetohydrodynamic waves''' or '''MHD waves'''. In general there are three MHD wave modes:\n* Pure (or oblique) Alfv\u00e9n wave\n* Slow MHD wave\n* Fast MHD wave\n{{multiple image\n | width=250\n | direction=vertical\n | align=right\n | header=Phase velocity plotted with respect to <math>\\theta</math>\n | image1=MHD wave mode 1.svg\n | alt1=<math>v_A>v_s</math>\n | caption1=<math>v_A>v_s</math>\n | image2=MHD wave mode 2.svg\n | alt2=<math>v_A<v_s</math>\n | caption2=<math>v_A<v_s</math>\n}}\nAll these waves have constant phase velocities for all frequencies, and hence there is no dispersion.

The plus branch corresponds to the fast-MHD wave mode and the minus branch corresponds to the slow-MHD wave mode.\n\nThe MHD oscillations will be damped if the fluid is not perfectly conducting but has a finite conductivity, or if viscous effects are present.\n\nMHD waves and oscillations are a popular tool for the remote diagnostics of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, e.g. the [[solar corona|corona]] of the Sun ([[Coronal seismology]]).\n\n== Extensions ==\n; Resistive\n: Resistive MHD describes magnetized fluids with finite electron diffusivity (<math>\\eta \\neq 0</math>).  This diffusivity leads to a breaking in the magnetic topology; magnetic field lines can 'reconnect' when they collide.  Usually this term is small and reconnections can be handled by thinking of them as not dissimilar to [[Shocks and discontinuities (magnetohydrodynamics)|shocks]]; this process has been shown to be important in the Earth-Solar magnetic interactions.\n; Extended\n: Extended MHD describes a class of phenomena in plasmas that are higher order than resistive MHD, but which can adequately be treated with a single fluid description.  These include the effects of Hall physics, electron pressure gradients, finite Larmor Radii in the particle gyromotion, and electron inertia.\n; Two-fluid\n: Two-fluid MHD describes plasmas that include a non-negligible Hall [[electric field]].  As a result, the electron and ion momenta must be treated separately.  This description is more closely tied to Maxwell's equations as an evolution equation for the electric field exists.\n; Hall\n: In 1960, M. J. Lighthill criticized the applicability of ideal or resistive MHD theory for plasmas.<ref>M. J. Lighthill, \"Studies on MHD waves and other anisotropic wave motion,\" ''Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.'', London, vol. 252A, pp. 397\u2013430, 1960.</ref> It concerned the neglect of the \"Hall current term\", a frequent simplification  made in magnetic fusion theory.  Hall-magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) takes into account this electric field description of magnetohydrodynamics.  The most important difference is that in the absence of field line breaking, the magnetic field is tied to the electrons and not to the bulk fluid.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Witalis | first1 = E.A. | year = 1986 | title = Hall Magnetohydrodynamics and Its Applications to Laboratory and Cosmic Plasma | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | volume = PS-14 | issue = 6| pages = 842\u2013848 | bibcode=1986ITPS...14..842W|doi = 10.1109/TPS.1986.4316632 }}</ref>\n; Electron MHD\n: Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) describes small scales plasmas when electron motion is much faster than the ion one.

This is the limit of infinite [[magnetic Reynolds number]]. In ideal MHD, [[Lenz's law]] dictates that the fluid is in a sense ''tied'' to the magnetic field lines. To explain, in ideal MHD a small rope-like volume of fluid surrounding a field line will continue to lie along a magnetic field line,\neven as it is twisted and distorted by fluid flows in the system. This is sometimes referred to as the magnetic field lines being \"frozen\" in the fluid.<ref>Eric Priest and Terry Forbes, \"Magnetic Reconnection: MHD Theory and Applications\", Cambridge University Press, First Edition, 2000, pp 25.</ref>\nThe connection between magnetic field lines and fluid in ideal MHD fixes the [[topology]] of the magnetic field in the fluid\u2014for example, if a set of magnetic field lines are tied into a knot, then they will remain so as long as the fluid/plasma has negligible resistivity.  This difficulty in reconnecting magnetic field lines makes it possible to store energy by moving the fluid or the source of the magnetic field.  The energy can then become available if the conditions for ideal MHD break down, allowing [[magnetic reconnection]] that releases the stored energy from the magnetic field.\n\n=== Ideal MHD equations ===\n[[File:Magnetohydrodynamic Flow Simulation.jpg|thumb|Magnetohydrodynamic flow simulation showing magnetic flux density]]\nThe ideal MHD equations consist of the [[continuity equation]], the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], [[Ampere's Law]] neglecting displacement current, and a [[Conservation of energy|temperature evolution equation]].  As with any fluid description to a kinetic system, a closure approximation must be applied to highest moment of the particle distribution equation.  This is often accomplished with approximations to the heat flux through a condition of [[Adiabatic process|adiabaticity]] or [[Isothermal process|isothermality]].\n\nThe main quantities which characterize the electrically conducting fluid are the bulk plasma [[velocity field]] '''v''', the [[current density]] '''J''', the [[mass density]] ''\u03c1'', and the plasma [[pressure]] ''p''. The flowing electric charge in the plasma is the source of a [[magnetic field]] '''B''' and [[electric field]] '''E'''. All quantities generally vary with time ''t''. [[Vector operator]] notation will be used, in particular \u2207 is [[gradient]], \u2207\u22c5 is [[divergence]], and \u2207\u00d7 is [[curl (mathematics)|curl]].\n\nThe mass [[continuity equation]] is\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\rho\\mathbf{v}\\right)=0.</math>\nThe [[Cauchy momentum equation]] is\n:<math> \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\nabla \\right)\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} - \\nabla p.</math>\nThe [[Lorentz force]] term '''J'''\u00d7'''B''' can be expanded using Ampere's law and the [[vector calculus identity]]\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot \\mathbf{B})=(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla)\\mathbf{B}+\\mathbf{B}\\times(\\nabla\\times \\mathbf{B})</math>\n\nto give\n:<math>\\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B} =  \\frac{\\left(\\mathbf{B}\\cdot\\nabla\\right)\\mathbf{B}}{\\mu_0} - \\nabla\\left(\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\\right),</math>\nwhere the first term on the right hand side is the [[magnetic tension force]] and the second term is the [[magnetic pressure]] force.\nThe ideal Ohm's law for a plasma is given by\n:<math>\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} = 0. </math>\nFaraday's law is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}. </math>\nThe low-frequency Ampere's law neglects displacement current and is given by\n:<math>\\mu_0 \\mathbf{J} = \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}.</math>\nThe magnetic divergence constraint is\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{B} = 0.</math>\nThe energy equation is given by\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left(\\frac{p}{\\rho^\\gamma}\\right) = 0,</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma=5/3</math> is the ratio of [[specific heat]]s for an [[adiabatic]] [[equation of state]]. This energy equation is, of course, only applicable in the absence of shocks or heat conduction as it assumes that the entropy of a fluid element does not change.\n\n=== Applicability of ideal MHD to plasmas ===\n\nIdeal MHD is only strictly applicable when:\n\n# The plasma is strongly collisional, so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are therefore close to [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]].\n# The resistivity due to these collisions is small. In particular, the typical magnetic diffusion times over any scale length present in the system must be longer than any time scale of interest.\n# Interest in length scales much longer than the ion [[Plasma parameters#Lengths|skin depth]] and [[Larmor radius]] perpendicular to the field, long enough along the field to ignore [[Landau damping]], and time scales much longer than the ion gyration time (system is smooth and slowly evolving).\n\n=== Importance of resistivity ===\n\nIn an imperfectly conducting fluid the magnetic field can generally move through the fluid following a [[Diffusion equation|diffusion law]] with the resistivity of the plasma serving as a [[diffusion constant]]. This means that solutions to the ideal MHD equations are only applicable for a limited time for a region of a given size before diffusion becomes too important to ignore.  One can estimate the diffusion time across a [[solar active region]] (from collisional resistivity) to be  hundreds to thousands of years, much longer than the actual lifetime of a sunspot\u2014so it would seem reasonable to ignore the resistivity. By contrast, a meter-sized volume of seawater has a magnetic diffusion time measured in milliseconds.\n\nEven in physical systems \u2013 which are large and conductive enough that simple estimates of the [[Lundquist number]] suggest that the resistivity can be ignored \u2013 resistivity may still be important: many [[Instability|instabilities]] exist that can increase the effective resistivity of the plasma by factors of more than a billion. The enhanced resistivity is usually the result of the formation of small scale structure like current sheets or fine scale magnetic [[Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence|turbulence]], introducing small spatial scales into the system over which ideal MHD is broken and magnetic diffusion can occur quickly. When this happens, magnetic reconnection may occur in the plasma to release stored magnetic energy as waves, bulk mechanical acceleration of material, [[particle acceleration]], and heat.\n\nMagnetic reconnection in highly conductive systems is important because it concentrates energy in time and space, so that gentle forces applied to a plasma for long periods of time can cause violent explosions and bursts of radiation.\n\nWhen the fluid cannot be considered as completely conductive, but the other conditions for ideal MHD are satisfied, it is possible to use an extended model called resistive MHD. This includes an extra term in Ohm's Law which models the collisional resistivity. Generally MHD computer simulations are at least somewhat resistive because their computational grid introduces a [[numerical resistivity]].\n\n=== Importance of kinetic effects ===\n\nAnother limitation of MHD (and fluid theories in general) is that they depend on the assumption that the plasma is strongly collisional (this is the first criterion listed above), so that the time scale of collisions is shorter than the other characteristic times in the system, and the particle distributions are [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]]. This is usually not the case in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas. When this is not the case, or the interest is in smaller spatial scales, it may be necessary to use a kinetic model which properly accounts for the non-Maxwellian shape of the distribution function.  However, because MHD is relatively simple and captures many of the important properties of plasma dynamics it is often qualitatively accurate and is therefore often the first model tried.\n\nEffects which are essentially kinetic and not captured by fluid models include [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]], [[Landau damping]], a wide range of instabilities, chemical separation in space plasmas and electron runaway. In the case of ultra-high intensity laser interactions, the incredibly short timescales of energy deposition mean that hydrodynamic codes fail to capture the essential physics.\n\n== Structures in MHD systems ==\n{{further|Magnetosphere particle motion}}\n[[File:Currents.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Schematic view of the different current systems which shape the Earth's magnetosphere]]\n\nIn many MHD systems most of the electric current is compressed into thin nearly-two-dimensional ribbons termed [[current sheet]]s.  These can divide the fluid into magnetic domains, inside of which the currents are relatively weak. Current sheets in\nthe solar corona are thought to be between a few meters and a few kilometers in thickness, which is quite thin compared to the magnetic domains (which are thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilometers across). Another example is in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]], where current sheets separate topologically distinct domains, isolating most of the Earth's [[ionosphere]] from the [[solar wind]].\n\n== Waves ==\n{{see also|Waves in plasmas}}\nThe wave modes derived using MHD plasma theory are called '''magnetohydrodynamic waves''' or '''MHD waves'''. In general there are three MHD wave modes:\n* Pure (or oblique) Alfv\u00e9n wave\n* Slow MHD wave\n* Fast MHD wave\n{{multiple image\n | width=250\n | direction=vertical\n | align=right\n | header=Phase velocity plotted with respect to <math>\\theta</math>\n | image1=MHD wave mode 1.svg\n | alt1=<math>v_A>v_s</math>\n | caption1=<math>v_A>v_s</math>\n | image2=MHD wave mode 2.svg\n | alt2=<math>v_A<v_s</math>\n | caption2=<math>v_A<v_s</math>\n}}\nAll these waves have constant phase velocities for all frequencies, and hence there is no dispersion.

This diffusivity leads to a breaking in the magnetic topology; magnetic field lines can 'reconnect' when they collide.  Usually this term is small and reconnections can be handled by thinking of them as not dissimilar to [[Shocks and discontinuities (magnetohydrodynamics)|shocks]]; this process has been shown to be important in the Earth-Solar magnetic interactions.\n; Extended\n: Extended MHD describes a class of phenomena in plasmas that are higher order than resistive MHD, but which can adequately be treated with a single fluid description.  These include the effects of Hall physics, electron pressure gradients, finite Larmor Radii in the particle gyromotion, and electron inertia.\n; Two-fluid\n: Two-fluid MHD describes plasmas that include a non-negligible Hall [[electric field]].  As a result, the electron and ion momenta must be treated separately.  This description is more closely tied to Maxwell's equations as an evolution equation for the electric field exists.\n; Hall\n: In 1960, M. J. Lighthill criticized the applicability of ideal or resistive MHD theory for plasmas.<ref>M. J. Lighthill, \"Studies on MHD waves and other anisotropic wave motion,\" ''Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.'', London, vol. 252A, pp. 397\u2013430, 1960.</ref> It concerned the neglect of the \"Hall current term\", a frequent simplification  made in magnetic fusion theory.  Hall-magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) takes into account this electric field description of magnetohydrodynamics.  The most important difference is that in the absence of field line breaking, the magnetic field is tied to the electrons and not to the bulk fluid.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Witalis | first1 = E.A. | year = 1986 | title = Hall Magnetohydrodynamics and Its Applications to Laboratory and Cosmic Plasma | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | volume = PS-14 | issue = 6| pages = 842\u2013848 | bibcode=1986ITPS...14..842W|doi = 10.1109/TPS.1986.4316632 }}</ref>\n; Electron MHD\n: Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) describes small scales plasmas when electron motion is much faster than the ion one.

In a [[closed system]] such as the cloud of gas and dust from which the Sun was formed, mass and angular momentum are both [[Conservation law|conserved]]. That conservation would imply that as the mass concentrated in the center of the cloud to form the Sun, it would spin faster, much like a skater pulling their arms in. The high speed of rotation predicted by early theories would have flung the proto-Sun apart before it could have formed. However, magnetohydrodynamic effects transfer the Sun's angular momentum into the outer solar system, slowing its rotation.\n\nBreakdown of ideal MHD (in the form of magnetic reconnection) is known to be the likely cause of [[solar flare]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} The magnetic field in a solar [[active region]] over a sunspot can store energy that is released suddenly as a burst of motion, [[X-ray]]s, and [[radiation]] when the main current sheet collapses, reconnecting the field.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Sensors===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Principle of MHD Sensor.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Principle of MHD sensor for angular velocity measurement]] -->\nMagnetohydrodynamic sensors are used for precision measurements of [[Angular velocity|angular velocities]] in [[inertial navigation system]]s such as in [[aerospace engineering]].

It uses [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] in order to explain their origin and [[chronology of the Universe|evolution]]. Objects of interest include [[planets]], [[natural satellite|moons]], [[star]]s, [[nebulae]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[comet]]s. Relevant phenomena include [[supernova]] explosions, [[gamma ray burst]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[blazar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. [[Cosmology]] is a branch of astronomy. It studies the [[Universe]] as a whole.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Uns\u00f6ld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System \u2013 Introduction|date=2001|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nAstronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. The early civilizations in [[recorded history]] made methodical observations of the [[night sky]]. These include the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonians]], [[Greek astronomy|Greeks]], [[Indian astronomy|Indians]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptians]], [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and many ancient [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as [[astrometry]], [[celestial navigation]], [[observational astronomy]], and the making of [[calendar]]s. Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as [[astrophysics]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Uns\u00f6ld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System|date=2001|pages=6\u20139}}</ref>\n\nProfessional astronomy is split into [[observational astronomy|observational]] and [[theoretical astronomy|theoretical]] branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. These two fields complement each other. Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.\n\nAmateurs play an [[citizen science|active role]] in astronomy. It is one of the few sciences in which this is the case. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of [[transient astronomical event|transient events]]. [[amateur astronomy|Amateur astronomers]] have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:SLNSW 479519 16 Observatory SH 198.jpg|thumb|19th-century, Australia (1873)]]\n[[File:Quito Observatory.JPG|thumb|19th-century [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]] is located 12 minutes south of the [[Equator]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]].<ref>http://oaq.epn.edu.ec/  Official Web Site of one of the oldest Observatories in South America, the  [[Quito Astronomical Observatory]]</ref>]]\n''Astronomy'' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1#Ancient Greek|\u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1]] from [[wikt:\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd#Ancient Greek|\u1f04\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd]] ''astron'', \"star\" and -\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 ''[[wikt:-nomy|-nomia]]'' from [[wikt:\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''nomos'', \"law\" or \"culture\") means \"law of the stars\" (or \"culture of the stars\" depending on the translation).

In addition to their ceremonial uses, these [[Observatory|observatories]] could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year.<ref name=\"history\">Forbes, 1909</ref>\n\nBefore tools such as the telescope were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in [[Babylonian astronomy|Mesopotamia]], [[Greek astronomy|Greece]], [[Astrology in medieval Islam|Persia]], [[Indian astronomy|India]], [[Chinese astronomy|China]], [[Egyptian astronomy|Egypt]], and [[Maya civilization|Central America]], astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop. Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the [[geocentric model]] of the Universe, or the [[Ptolemaic system]], named after [[Ptolemy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=DeWitt|first=Richard|title=Worldviews: An Introduction to the History and Philosophy of Science|date=2010|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-1-4051-9563-8|page=113|chapter=The Ptolemaic System}}</ref>\n[[File:Suryaprajnapati Sutra.jpg|thumb|The Suryaprajnaptis\u016btra, a 6th-century BC astronomy text of [[Jains]] at The Schoyen Collection, London.

The stars move along [[randomness|random]] orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies.\n\nA spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the [[Milky Way]] and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], are spiral galaxies.\n\nIrregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical. About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction.\n\nAn active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas. It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material.\n\nA [[radio galaxy]] is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas.

Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep-sky object]]s such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky.

Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects. This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics.

Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as [[astrometry]]. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically.

The term, therefore, could simply mean \"the abode of the Kang,\" or \"territory occupied by the Kang.\" ...  As ''kang'' \u5eb7 means 'well-being', 'peaceful,' 'happy;' 'settle', 'stability,' Kangju can be translated as the 'Peaceful Land,' or 'Abode of the Peaceful (People).' ... Even if the name Kangju was originally an attempt to transcribe the sounds of a foreign name, it would still have carried the sense of a peaceful place to Chinese speakers, and the name 'Kang' would have had overtones of a peaceful people.<ref name=\"Hill-183\"/></blockquote>\n\nLater Chinese sources, during the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, refer to Kangju as the State of '''Kang''' ({{Zh|s=\u5eb7\u56fd|t=\u5eb7\u570b}}) By that time it was part of the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khaganate]].<ref>''Tangshu'' chapter 221b, p. 1, translated (into French) by \u00c9douard Chavannes in ''Documents sur les tou-kiue [turcs] occidentaux'', pp. 132-147.

Pulleyblank also suggested that the [[Jie people|Ji\u00e9]] (\u7faf) tribe Qi\u0101ngq\u00fa (\u7f8c\u6e20) might be Kangju people who had been incorporated into the Xiongnu tribal confederation. Pulleyblank further connected Kangju to K\u00e0nji\u00e9 \u77b0\u7faf (*''Kamkar''?) and the name ''Kankar'' given to the lower [[Syr Darya|Yaxartes]] by Persian geographer [[ibn Khordadbeh]].<ref name=\"Pulleyblank (1963)\">{{cite journal|last=Pulleyblank|first=Edwin George|authorlink=Edwin G.

Nevertheless, all those connections remain hypothetical.{{sfn|Golden|1992|pages = 264-265}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|Sogdia}}\nAccording to 2nd century BC [[China|Chinese]] sources, Kangju lay north of the [[Dayuan]] and west of the [[Wusun]], bordering the [[Yuezhi]] in the south. Their territory covered the region of the [[Ferghana Valley]] and the area between the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Syr Darya]] rivers, with the core territory along the middle Syr Darya.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Since historians of [[Alexander the Great]] do not mention the existence of any political power in the area except the [[Khwarezm]]ians, the Kangju must have appeared a little later.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> It is likely that the state of the Kangju emerged during the great upheaval in [[Central Asia]] following the withdrawal of the [[Yuezhi]] from [[Gansu]] and then the [[Ili Valley]] after their defeat by the [[Xiongnu]] and Wusun respectively.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Chinese sources state that the Kangju were tributiaries of the Yuezhi in the south and the Xiongnu in the east.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/>\n[[File:Coin of Vanvan of Chach.png|thumb|250px|Kangju coin: obverse: ruler Vanvan of Chach; reverse: Kangju tamga]]\nKangju was mentioned by the Chinese traveller and diplomat [[Zhang Qian]] who visited the area c. 128 BCE, whose travels are documented in Chapter 123 of the ''[[Shiji]]'' (whose author, [[Sima Qian]], died c. 90 BC):\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Kangju is situated some 2,000 li [832 kilometers] northwest of Dayuan. Its people are nomads and resemble the Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archers. The country is small, and borders Dayuan ([[Ferghana]]). It acknowledges sovereignty to the Yuezhi people in the South and the Xiongnu in the East.<ref name=\"Watson234\">{{harvnb|Watson|1993|p=234}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nQian also visited a land known to the Chinese as [[Yancai]] \u5944\u8521 (literally \"vast steppe\"), which lay north-west of the Kangju. The people of Yancai and were said to resemble the Kangju in their customs:\n\n<blockquote>\nYancai lies some 2,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' (832 km) northwest of Kangju (centered on [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]] at Beitian). The people are nomads and their customs are generally similar to those of the people of Kangju. The country has over 100,000 archer warriors, and borders a great shoreless lake, perhaps what is now known as the Northern Sea ([[Aral Sea]], distance between [[Tashkent]] to [[Aralsk]] is about 866 km\n</blockquote>\n\nBy the time of the ''[[Hanshu]]'' (which covers the period from 206 BCE to 23 CE), Kangju had expanded considerably to a nation of some 600,000 individuals, with 120,000 men able to bear arms. Kangju was clearly now a major power in its own right. By this time it had gained control of Dayuan and [[Sogdiana]] in which it controlled \u201cfive lesser kings\u201d (\u5c0f\u738b\u4e94).<ref>[[Hulsew\u00e9]] (1979) pp. 126, 130\u2013132</ref>\n\nIn 101 BCE, the Kangju allied themselves with the Dayuan, helping them preserve their independence against the [[Han dynasty|Han]].<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/>\n\nThe account on  the '[[Western Regions]]' in the [[Han Dynasty]] Chinese chronicle, the ''[[Book of Later Han|Hou Hanshu]]'', 88 (covering the period 25\u2013220 and completed in the 5th century), based on a report to the Chinese emperor c. 125 CE, mentions that, at that time, Liyi \u6817\u5f0b (= Suyi \u7c9f\u5f0b) = Sogdiana, and both the \"old\" Yancai (which had changed its name to ''Alanliao'' and seems here to have expanded its territory to the [[Caspian Sea]]), and ''Yan'', a country to Yancai's north, as well as the strategic city of \"Northern Wuyi\" \u5317\u70cf\u4f0a ([[Alexandria Eschate]], or modern [[Khujand]]), were all dependent on Kangju.<ref>Hill (2009), pp. 377-383.</ref><ref name=\"FH129\">{{harvnb|Fran\u00e7ois|Hulsew\u00e9|1979|p=129}}</ref>\n\nY.

The westward expansion of the Kangju obliged many of the Sarmatians to migrate further west, and it may therefore be concluded that the Kangju played a major in the [[Migration Period|great migrations of the time]], which played a major role in world history.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Through this expansion the Kangju gained control over key parts of the [[Silk Route]].<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> The Kangju state came to unite a number of regions which had [[sedentary]], [[agricultural]] and [[nomadic]] populations.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Although their territory was small, the fertility of the land and their sophisticated civilization enabled the Kangju to maintain a large population, becoming a major military power.<ref name=\"Benjamin_Marshak\"/>\n\nThe Kangju were in frequent struggles with the Wusun, during which they in the mid 1st century BCE allied themselves with the northern Xiongnu.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> The Kangju ruler gave his daughter in marriage to the northern Xiongnu ruler Chih-Chih (Zhizhi?) while Chih-Chih married the daughter of the Kangju ruler.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy468\">{{harvnb|Zadneprovskiy|1994|p=468}}</ref> The Xiongnu and Kangju were initially successful, besieging the Wusun in 42 BCE.

The Kangju ruler was subsequently forced to send his son as a [[hostage]] to the Han court.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Nevertheless, the Kangju continued to send embassies to the Han court and pursued an independent policy, which they were able to maintain until the 3rd century AD. Evidence of Kangju independence can be seen in the [[coin]]age issued in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, during which they issued their own [[currency]] which was similar to that of Khwarezm.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/>\n\nThe biography of the Chinese General [[Ban Chao]] in the ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' says in 94 CE that the Yuezhi were arranging a marriage of their king with a Kangju princess. The Chinese then sent \"considerable presents of silks\" to the Yuezhi successfully gaining their help in pressuring the Kangju to stop supporting the king of [[Kashgar]] against them.<ref>\"Trois g\u00e9n\u00e9raux chinois de la dynastie des Han orientaux,\" by \u00c9douard Chavannes, p. 230.

Kangju burials of the early period have been excavatated at Berk-kara and Tamd\u00ee, in which the dead were placed in pit-graves, often covered with logs, under [[kurgan]] mounds.

The burials show that the traditional culture of the Kangju resembled characteristics of the [[Saka]].<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> From the beginning of the Christian era \"catacomb graves\" (in shaft and chamber tombs) became widespread.

Grigoriev in 1934\u201337.\n\nSettlements of the Kaunchi culture were typically located in proximity to water and usually have monumental oval buildings in the center, at times with a defensive wall. The largest settlement was a 150 hectare city known apparently as Kang ([[Sanskrit]] ''Kanka''), south of modern [[Tashkent]] and founded in the 1st century CE. Kang had a square layout, encircled by a wall with inner passages.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Masson V.M., ''Pre-Islamic Central Asia''</ref>\n\nThe settlements were surrounded by [[kurgan]] burials of a catacomb type with long [[Glossary of architecture#D|dromoses]], crypts, and burial vaults, with horse bone trappings and rites typical of nomads.<ref>Masson V.M., ''Pre-Islamic Central Asia'', http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/archeology-v</ref>\n\nThe people predominantly practiced cattle husbandry and nonirrigated agriculture (grain cultures of millet, barley, wheat, and rice, cotton, melons, and fruits).\n\nMaterials typical of the culture are typical hand-formed pottery: ''khums'' (large bowls for water and produce), pots, pitchers, and cups adorned with ram's head on the handles. In the 1st century CE ceramics made on a [[potter's wheel]] became more common. A [[Sheep|ram]]'s head motif at first common was replaced by a [[bull]]'s head during the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. At that period weapons started appearing in the kurgans.\n \nKaunchi-type sites apparently spread from the [[Otrar]] region along Syr Darya to the south of Tashkent. The Kaunchi culture significantly impacted the archeological cultures in the vast territories of the [[Middle Asia]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Inscriptions===\nSome important inscriptions were discovered recently {{when|date=June 2016}} that provide information about Kangju and its contacts with China.\n\n* A dozen wooden slips with Chinese writing were found at the Xuanquan site in [[Dunhuang]], China. They are dated to the late Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE-24 CE).\n* A set of Sogdian inscriptions from Kultobe in Kazakhstan; they were analyzed and deciphered by [[Nicholas Sims-Williams]]. They complement the existing Chinese historical records about  Kangju.

Their territory covered the region of the [[Ferghana Valley]] and the area between the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Syr Darya]] rivers, with the core territory along the middle Syr Darya.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Since historians of [[Alexander the Great]] do not mention the existence of any political power in the area except the [[Khwarezm]]ians, the Kangju must have appeared a little later.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> It is likely that the state of the Kangju emerged during the great upheaval in [[Central Asia]] following the withdrawal of the [[Yuezhi]] from [[Gansu]] and then the [[Ili Valley]] after their defeat by the [[Xiongnu]] and Wusun respectively.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Chinese sources state that the Kangju were tributiaries of the Yuezhi in the south and the Xiongnu in the east.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/>\n[[File:Coin of Vanvan of Chach.png|thumb|250px|Kangju coin: obverse: ruler Vanvan of Chach; reverse: Kangju tamga]]\nKangju was mentioned by the Chinese traveller and diplomat [[Zhang Qian]] who visited the area c. 128 BCE, whose travels are documented in Chapter 123 of the ''[[Shiji]]'' (whose author, [[Sima Qian]], died c. 90 BC):\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Kangju is situated some 2,000 li [832 kilometers] northwest of Dayuan. Its people are nomads and resemble the Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archers. The country is small, and borders Dayuan ([[Ferghana]]).

The people of Yancai and were said to resemble the Kangju in their customs:\n\n<blockquote>\nYancai lies some 2,000 ''[[Li (Chinese unit)|li]]'' (832 km) northwest of Kangju (centered on [[Hazrat-e Turkestan|Turkestan]] at Beitian). The people are nomads and their customs are generally similar to those of the people of Kangju. The country has over 100,000 archer warriors, and borders a great shoreless lake, perhaps what is now known as the Northern Sea ([[Aral Sea]], distance between [[Tashkent]] to [[Aralsk]] is about 866 km\n</blockquote>\n\nBy the time of the ''[[Hanshu]]'' (which covers the period from 206 BCE to 23 CE), Kangju had expanded considerably to a nation of some 600,000 individuals, with 120,000 men able to bear arms. Kangju was clearly now a major power in its own right.

This is seen from the burials of the Kaunchi and Dzhun cultures of the 1st to the 4th centuries AD, which are generally accepted as having belonged to the Kangju.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> The Kangju regarded the [[Sheep|ram]] as a noble animal.<ref name=\"Mukhamedjanov277\">{{harvnb|Mukhamedjanov|1994|p=277}}</ref>\n\nReferences from written sources and archaeological finds show that the Kangju reached a considerable level of agricultural sophistication. Much of the population consisted of a sedentary farming population.<ref name=\"Zadneprovskiy\"/> Wide canals from the Kangju period have been discovered, with the land area under [[irrigation]] of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya being four times greater than today.<ref name=\"Mukhamedjanov270\">{{harvnb|Mukhamedjanov|1994|p=270}}</ref> The irrigation systems of Central Asia reached their highest levels of development under the Kangju-[[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] and was in fact superior to those fully developed in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"Mukhamedjanov270\"/>\n\n==Archaeology==\n\n===Kaunchi culture===\nKangju appears to be a civilisation known to [[Soviet]] archaeologists as the \"Kaunchi Culture\", dating from the 2nd century BCE to the early 8th century CE, and centred on the middle course of the Syr Darya and its tributaries: the [[Angren River|Angren]], [[Chirchiq River|Chirchik]], and [[Keles River|Keles]]. The culture was named after an ancient townsite now known as Kaunchi-Tepe, which was first studied by G. V. Grigoriev in 1934\u201337.\n\nSettlements of the Kaunchi culture were typically located in proximity to water and usually have monumental oval buildings in the center, at times with a defensive wall. The largest settlement was a 150 hectare city known apparently as Kang ([[Sanskrit]] ''Kanka''), south of modern [[Tashkent]] and founded in the 1st century CE. Kang had a square layout, encircled by a wall with inner passages.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Masson V.M., ''Pre-Islamic Central Asia''</ref>\n\nThe settlements were surrounded by [[kurgan]] burials of a catacomb type with long [[Glossary of architecture#D|dromoses]], crypts, and burial vaults, with horse bone trappings and rites typical of nomads.<ref>Masson V.M., ''Pre-Islamic Central Asia'', http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/archeology-v</ref>\n\nThe people predominantly practiced cattle husbandry and nonirrigated agriculture (grain cultures of millet, barley, wheat, and rice, cotton, melons, and fruits).\n\nMaterials typical of the culture are typical hand-formed pottery: ''khums'' (large bowls for water and produce), pots, pitchers, and cups adorned with ram's head on the handles. In the 1st century CE ceramics made on a [[potter's wheel]] became more common. A [[Sheep|ram]]'s head motif at first common was replaced by a [[bull]]'s head during the late 3rd and early 4th centuries. At that period weapons started appearing in the kurgans.\n \nKaunchi-type sites apparently spread from the [[Otrar]] region along Syr Darya to the south of Tashkent. The Kaunchi culture significantly impacted the archeological cultures in the vast territories of the [[Middle Asia]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Inscriptions===\nSome important inscriptions were discovered recently {{when|date=June 2016}} that provide information about Kangju and its contacts with China.\n\n* A dozen wooden slips with Chinese writing were found at the Xuanquan site in [[Dunhuang]], China. They are dated to the late Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE-24 CE).\n* A set of Sogdian inscriptions from Kultobe in Kazakhstan; they were analyzed and deciphered by [[Nicholas Sims-Williams]]. They complement the existing Chinese historical records about  Kangju. Sims-Williams also assigned a likely date to these inscriptions.<ref>[http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/page/pastevents.html New Evidence from Dunhuang, China and Central Asia for the Kangju] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095903/http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/page/pastevents.html |date=2014-04-07 }} nyu.edu</ref>\n* Several fragmentary Sogdian inscriptions discovered by A. N. Podushkin in his excavations at Kultobe.
