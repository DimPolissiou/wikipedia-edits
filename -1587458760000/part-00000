It is intended as a shoulder-braced weapon for law enforcement use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well.  The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P-Series pistol as a [[sidearm (weapon)|sidearm]], and keep a Police Carbine available (for example, in the [[police car|patrol vehicle]]) as a more offensive weapon if needed.  Since the Police Carbine has a {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} [[gun barrel|barrel]], it provides more [[muzzle energy]] with the same ammunition used by pistols which often only have {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} barrels (see [[internal ballistics]]), thus better [[stopping power]], accuracy and effective range than pistols.\n\nIn 2007, Ruger discontinued production of the original Police Carbine, citing low demand.  More than ten years later on December 29th, 2017, Ruger announced the reintroduction of a new upgraded 9 mm [[takedown gun|takedown model]] called the '''Ruger PC Carbine''' (\"Ruger pistol-caliber carbine\"), which has a {{convert|16.12|in|mm|adj=on}} [[threading (manufacturing)|threaded]] barrel and accepts not only the [[Ruger SR9]] pistol magazine, but also magazines from [[Glock]], [[Ruger American Pistol]] and the new Ruger Security-9 pistols via interchangeable magazine well adaptor inserts.  In early 2019, Ruger introduced a variant PC Carbine model with [[free-floating barrel|free-floating]] [[M-LOK]] [[handguard]], and also reintroduced the .40 S&W caliber.\n\n==Design==\nThe Carbine has some unique design features.  The action is a simple [[Blowback (arms)|blowback]] design, which requires a fairly massive bolt to handle the pressure of 9mm and .40 S&W.  To prevent the gun from being too unbalanced by the large bolt, the bolt consists of two parts; the main body of the bolt is fairly light and located in the receiver, while the other part is just a weight located under the forend of the carbine.  These two parts are held together by strong, rigid steel bars.  The combined mass serves to hold the breech safely closed during firing, while keeping the center of gravity forward, so the gun handles well.\n\nAnother unique feature is the bolt lock.  Since blowback guns of these calibers require heavy bolts, the inertia of dropping the gun can cause the bolt to come partially open, rendering the gun unfirable until the bolt is manually closed all the way.  To prevent this, the Carbine uses a bolt lock that locks the bolt securely closed so that a fall will not dislodge it.  A slight pressure on the trigger or on the bolt handle, however, will disengage the bolt lock so that the bolt can move for firing or clearing the action.\n\nIn addition to caliber, the Carbine also comes with a choice in [[iron sights]].  The standard model uses notch-and-post sights, while the GR models are equipped with [[ghost ring]] rear sights.  The ghost ring sights cost more, but they are generally considered better for defensive purposes, as they allow faster sight alignment under poor lighting conditions plus a longer sight radius for greater accuracy.  The Carbine also has Ruger-style scope bases built into the receiver, allowing optical sights to be easily and securely mounted.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://ruger-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_manuals/rugerCarbine.pdf User Manual]\n\n{{Ruger}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Police weapons]]\n[[Category:Semi-automatic rifles of the United States]]\n[[Category:Ruger rifles|Police Carbine]]\n[[Category:Carbines]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|PC9|the PC-9 aircraft|Pilatus PC-9}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{Infobox weapon\n|name=Ruger Pistol Carbine\n| image= Ruger PC4.jpg\n| image_size = 300\n|caption=Ruger PC4\n|origin=United States\n|type=[[Carbine]]\n|is_ranged=yes\n|service=\n|used_by=\n|wars=\n|designer= Ruger\n|design_date=1996<ref name=Rug/>\n|manufacturer=[[Sturm, Ruger & Co.]]\n|unit_cost=\n|production_date=1996-2006<ref name=Rug>{{cite web|title=Ruger Product History|url=http://www.ruger.com/service/productHistory.html#|publisher=Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc.|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>\n|number=\n|variants=PC9, PC4\n|spec_label=\n|weight={{convert|7|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=GDB>{{cite book|last=Peterson|first=Phillip|title=Gun Digest Buyer's Guide to Assault Weapons|year=2011|publisher=Gun Digest Books|isbn=9781440226724|pages=236}}</ref>\n|length={{convert|34|in|mm|abbr=on}}<ref name=GDB/>\n|part_length={{convert|16.24|in|mm|abbr=on}}<ref name=GDB/>\n|width=\n|height=\n|cartridge=[[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm]], [[.40 S&W]]<ref name=GDB/>\n|caliber=\n|action=[[Blowback (arms)|Blowback]]\n|velocity=\n|range=\n|max_range=\n|feed=10 or 15 round [[Ruger P-Series|P series]] box [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]<ref name=GDB/>\n|sights= Ghost ring rear, Blade front\n}}\n\n{{Infobox weapon\n|name=Ruger PC Carbine\n| image= \n| image_size = \n|caption=\n|origin=United States\n|type=[[Carbine]]\n|is_ranged=yes\n|service=\n|used_by=\n|wars=\n|designer= Ruger\n|design_date=2017<ref name=Rug/>\n|manufacturer=[[Sturm, Ruger & Co.]]\n|unit_cost= $650<ref>https://www.ruger.com/products/pcCarbine/models.html</ref>\n|production_date=2017-Present\n|number=\n|variants=\n|spec_label=\n|weight={{convert|7|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}|length={{convert|34.37|in|mm|abbr=on}}<ref>https://www.ruger.com/products/pcCarbine/models.html</ref>\n|part_length={{convert|16.2|in|mm|abbr=on}}<ref>https://www.ruger.com/products/pcCarbine/models.html</ref>\n|width=\n|height=\n|cartridge=[[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719mm]]\n|caliber=\n|action=[[Blowback (arms)|Blowback]]\n|velocity=\n|range=\n|max_range=\n|feed=10, 17, 33 round [[ Glock]] or [[Ruger SR9]] box [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]]<ref>https://www.ruger.com/products/pcCarbine/models.html</ref> <br>(Magwell is interchangeable.)\n|sights= Protected Blade / Adjustable Ghost Ring\n}}\nThe '''Ruger Police Carbine''' is a [[blowback (firearms)|blowback]] [[centerfire]] [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] [[pistol-caliber carbine#Pistol-caliber carbine|pistol-caliber carbine]] manufactured by [[Sturm, Ruger & Co.]], designed as a companion to the [[Ruger P-Series]] [[semi-automatic pistol]]s, using the same [[9 mm Parabellum]] and [[.40 S&W]] caliber [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]s and [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s of the P-Series pistols.\n\nBoth the PC9 (the 9 mm version) and the PC4 (.40 S&W version) are modelled after Ruger\u2019s highly successful [[Ruger 10/22]] [[rimfire]] carbine.

There was also a number of lodges catering to visitors, including Spirit Lake Lodge and Mt. St. Helens Lodge; the latter was inhabited by [[Harry Randall Truman|Harry R.

The blast and the debris avalanche associated with this eruption temporarily displaced much of the lake from its bed and forced lake waters as a wave as much as {{Convert|850|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} above lake level on the mountain slopes along the north shoreline of the lake. The debris avalanche deposited about {{convert|430000000|m3|acre-ft}} of pyrolized trees, other plant material, volcanic ash, and volcanic debris of various origins into Spirit Lake. The deposition of this volcanic material decreased the lake volume by approximately {{convert|56000000|m3|acre-ft}}. Lahar and pyroclastic flow deposits from the eruption blocked its natural pre-eruption outlet to the [[North Fork Toutle River]] valley at its outlet, raising the surface elevation of the lake by between {{Convert|197|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|206|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The surface area of the lake was increased from 1,300 acres to about 2,200 acres and its maximum depth decreased from {{Convert|190|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|110|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The eruption tore thousands of trees from the surrounding hillsides and swept them into Spirit Lake. These thousands of shattered trees formed a floating log raft on the lake surface that covered about 40% of the lake's surface after the eruption.<ref name=\"MeyerOthers1983a\"/><ref name=\"Lee1993a\">Lee DB (1993) [https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp2438 ''Effects of the Eruptions of Mount St. Helens on Physical, Chemical, and Biological Characteristics of Surface Water, Ground Water, and Precipitation in the Western United States.''] Water-Supply Paper no. 2438.

A month after the eruption, the bacteria-carrying water was devoid of [[oxygen]]. Scientists predicted that the lake would not recover quickly, but the reemergence of phytoplankton starting in 1983 began to restore oxygen levels.

Some [[artillery]] ammunition uses the same cartridge concept as found in [[small arms]]. In other cases, the [[shell (projectile)|artillery shell]] is separate from the propellant charge.\n\nA cartridge without a projectile is called a [[blank (cartridge)|blank]].  One that is completely [[inert munitions|inert]] (contains no active primer and no propellant) is called a [[dummy round|dummy]].  One that failed to ignite and shoot off the projectile is called a [[dud]], and one that ignited but failed to sufficiently push the projectile out of the barrel is called a [[squib load|squib]].\n\n[[File:Cartridge Sample 2.jpg|right|thumb|500px|A variety of rifle cartridges: ('''1''')[[.17 HM2]] ('''2''')[[.17 HMR]] ('''3''')[[.22LR]] ('''4''')[[.22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire|.22 Win Mag R/F.22 WMR]] ('''5''')[[.17/23 SMc]] ('''6''')[[5mm/35 SMc]] ('''7''')[[.22 Hornet]] ('''8''')[[.223 Remington]] ('''9''')[[.223 WSSM]] ('''10''')[[.243 Win]] ('''11''')[[P.O.

In modern, automatic weapons, it also provides the energy to move the parts of the gun which make it fire repeatedly. Many weapons were designed to make use of a readily available cartridge, or a new one with new qualities.\n\nThe cartridge case [[Obturation|seals]] a [[Chamber (firearms)|firing chamber]] in all directions excepting the [[Gun barrel|bore]]. A [[firing pin]] strikes the primer and ignites it. The primer compound ''[[deflagration|deflagrates]]'', it does not ''[[detonation|detonate]]'' (that is, it rapidly burns, but does not explode). A jet of burning gas from the primer ignites the propellant.\n\nGases from the burning powder pressurize and expand the case to seal it against the chamber wall. These propellant gases push on the bullet base. In response to this pressure, the bullet will move in the path of least resistance which is down the bore of the [[Barrel (firearms)|barrel]]. After the bullet leaves the barrel, the chamber pressure drops to atmospheric pressure. The case, which had been elastically expanded by chamber pressure, contracts slightly. This eases removal of the case from the chamber.\n\n===Manufacture===\n\n[[File:0.30-30 Winchester case, stages in the drawing process, book; Cartridge Manufacture (1916), autor; Douglas T. Hamilton.png|thumb|upright=1.6|0.30-30 Winchester case, stages in the drawing process, book; from Hamilton<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |url=http://archive.org/details/cartridgemanufac00hamirich |title=Cartridge manufacture; a treatise covering the manufacture of rifle cartridge cases, bullets, powders, primers and cartridge clips, and the designing and making of the tools used in connection with the production of cartridge cases and bullets |last=Hamilton |first=Douglas Thomas |date=1916 |location=New York |publisher=The Industrial Press |access-date=8 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606192744/https://archive.org/details/cartridgemanufac00hamirich |archive-date=6 June 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\n\nTo manufacture cases for cartridges, a sheet of brass is punched into disks. These disks go through a series of [[deep drawing|drawing dies]]. The disks are [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] and washed before moving to the next series of dies. The brass needs to be annealed to remove the work-hardening in the material and make the brass malleable again ready for the next series of dies.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nManufacturing bullet jackets is similar to making brass cases: there is a series of drawing steps with annealing and washing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Materials===\nThe projectile (see [[#Bullet design types|below]]) can be made of virtually anything. [[Lead]] is a material of choice because of high density, and ductility.\n\nThe propellant was long [[gunpowder]], still in use, but superseded by better compositions, generically called [[smokeless powder]].\n\nEarly [[Primer (firearm)|primer]] was simply fine gunpowder poured into a pan or tube where it could be ignited by some external source of ignition such as a fuse or a spark. Modern primers are shock sensitive chemicals enclosed in a small (a few mm) capsule, ignited by percussion. In some instance ignition is electricity-primed, and there may even be no primer at all in such design (the propellant being directly ignited).\n\nThe case is commonly made of [[brass]] because it is resistant to corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A brass case head can be work-hardened to withstand the high pressures of cartridges, and allow for manipulation via extraction and ejection without tearing the metal. The neck and body portion of a brass case is easily annealed to make the case [[ductile]] enough to allow reforming so that it can be reloaded many times.\n\n[[Steel]] is used in some [[plinking]] ammunition, as well as in some military ammunition (mainly from the [[former Soviet Union]] and [[China]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}). Steel is less expensive than brass, but it is not feasible to reload and reuse steel cases. Military forces typically consider small arms cartridge cases to be disposable, one-time-use devices. However, case weight (mass) affects how much ammunition a soldier can carry, so the lighter steel cases do have a military advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Conversely, steel is more susceptible to contamination and damage so all such cases are varnished or otherwise sealed against the elements.\n\nOne downside caused by the increased strength of steel in the neck of these cases (compared to the annealed neck of a brass case) is that propellant gas can blow back past the neck and into the chamber. Constituents of these gases condense on the (relatively cold) chamber wall. This solid propellant residue can make extraction of fired cases difficult. This is less of a problem for small arms of the former [[Warsaw Pact]] nations, which were designed with much larger chamber tolerances than [[NATO]] weapons.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[Aluminum]] cased cartridges are available commercially. These are generally not reloaded as aluminum fatigues easily during firing and resizing. Some calibers also have non-standard primer sizes to discourage reloaders from attempting to reuse these cases.\n\n[[Polymer-cased ammunition|Plastic cases]] are commonly used in [[shotgun]] shells and some manufacturers offer polymer centerfire cartridges.\n\nHistorically paper had been used in the earliest cartridges.\n\n===Specifications===\nCritical cartridge specifications include neck size, bullet weight and [[caliber]], maximum pressure, [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]], overall length, case body diameter and taper, shoulder design, [[Rim (firearms)|rim type]], etc. Generally, every characteristic of a specific cartridge type is tightly controlled and few types are interchangeable in any way. Exceptions do exist but generally, these are only where a shorter cylindrical rimmed cartridge can be used in a longer chamber, (e.g., .22 Short in .22 Long Rifle chamber, and .38 Special in a .357 Magnum chamber). [[Centerfire ammunition|Centerfire]] primer type (Boxer or Berdan, see below) is interchangeable, although not in the same case. Deviation in any of these specifications can result in firearm damage and, in some instances, injury or death. Similarly, use of the wrong type of cartridge in any given gun can damage the gun, or cause bodily injury.\n\nCartridge specifications are determined by several standards organizations, including [[SAAMI]] in the United States, and [[C.I.P.]] in many European states. NATO also performs [[NATO EPVAT testing|its own tests]] for military cartridges for its member nations; due to differences in testing methods, NATO cartridges ([[headstamp]]ed with the NATO cross) may present an unsafe combination when loaded into a weapon chambered for a cartridge certified by one of the other testing bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saami.org/specifications_and_information/publications/download/SAAMI_ITEM_211-Unsafe_Arms_and_Ammunition_Combinations.pdf |title=Unsafe Firearm-Ammunition Combinations |publisher=SAAMI |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116092917/http://saami.org/specifications_and_information/publications/download/SAAMI_ITEM_211-Unsafe_Arms_and_Ammunition_Combinations.pdf |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nBullet diameter is measured either as a fraction of an inch (usually in 1/100 or in 1/1000) or in millimeters.

This was struck by the flint and fired the gun. In the course of loading a pinch of powder from the cartridge would be placed into the pan as priming, before the rest of the cartridge was rammed down the barrel, providing charge and wadding.<ref>{{cite book|title=Edgehill: The Battle Reinterpreted|last1=Scott|first1=Christopher L.|last2=Turton|first2=Alan|last3=Gruber von Arni|first3=Eric|pages=9\u201312|year=2004|isbn=978-1844152544|publisher=Pen and Sword}}</ref>\n\nThe next important advance in the method of ignition was the introduction of the copper [[percussion cap]]. This was only generally applied to the British military musket (the [[Brown Bess]]) in 1842, a quarter of a century after the invention of percussion powder and after an elaborate government test at Woolwich in 1834. The invention that made the percussion cap possible was patented by the Rev. A. J. Forsyth in 1807 and consisted of priming with a fulminating powder made of [[potassium chlorate]], sulfur, and charcoal, which ignited by concussion. This invention was gradually developed, and used, first in a steel cap, and then in a copper cap, by various gunmakers and private individuals before coming into general military use nearly thirty years later.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe alteration of the military flint-lock to the percussion [[musket]] was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan with a perforated nipple and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint with a smaller hammer that had a hollow to fit on the nipple when released by the trigger. The shooter placed a percussion cap (now made of three parts of [[potassium chlorate]], two of [[mercury fulminate|fulminate of mercury]] and powdered glass) on the nipple. The detonating cap thus invented and adopted brought about the invention of the modern cartridge case, and rendered possible the general adoption of the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] principle for all varieties of [[rifle]]s, [[shotgun]]s and [[pistol]]s. This greatly streamlined the reloading procedure and paved the way for semi- and full-automatic firearms.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nHowever, this big leap forward came at a price. It introduced an extra component into each round \u2013 the cartridge case \u2013 which had to be removed before the gun could be reloaded. While a flintlock, for example, is immediately ready to reload once it has been fired, adopting brass cartridge cases brought in the problems of extraction and ejection. The mechanism of a modern gun not only must load and fire the piece but also must remove the spent case, which might require just as many added moving parts. Many [[Firearm malfunction|malfunctions]] involve this process, either through failure to extract a case properly from the chamber or by allowing the extracted case to jam the action. Nineteenth-century inventors were reluctant to accept this added complication and experimented with a variety of [[caseless]] or self-consuming cartridges before finally accepting that the advantages of brass cases far outweighed this one drawback.<ref>Winant, Lewis (1959).

This invention has completely revolutionized the art of gun making, has been successfully applied to all descriptions of firearms, and has produced a new and important industry: that of cartridge manufacture. Its essential feature is preventing gas escaping the breech when the gun is fired, by means of an expansive cartridge case containing its own means of ignition. Previous to this invention shotguns and sporting rifles were loaded by means of [[powder flask]]s and shot bags or flasks, bullets, wads and copper caps, all carried separately. One of the earliest efficient modern cartridge cases was the [[pinfire cartridge]], developed by French gunsmith [[Casimir Lefaucheux]] in 1836.<ref name=\"Pistols\">Kinard, Jeff (2004) ''Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact'', ABC-CLIO, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA109&dq=Houllier+cartridge#PPA109,M1 p. 109] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528211811/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA109&dq=Houllier+cartridge#PPA109,M1 |date=28 May 2016 }}</ref> It consisted of a thin weak shell made of brass and paper that expanded from the force of the explosion. This fit perfectly in the barrel, and thus formed an efficient gas check. A small percussion cap was placed in the middle of the base of the cartridge and was ignited by means of a brass pin projecting from the side and struck by the hammer. This pin also afforded the means of extracting the cartridge case. This cartridge was introduced in England by Lang, of Cockspur Street, London, about 1845.\n\nIn the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) a breech-loading rifle, the Sharps, was introduced and produced in large numbers. It could be loaded with either a ball or a [[paper cartridge]]. After that war many were converted to the use of metal cartridges. The development by [[Smith & Wesson]] (among many others) of revolver handguns that used metal cartridges helped establish cartridge firearms as the standard in the US by the late 1860s and early 1870s, although many continue to use percussion revolvers well after that.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cabelas.com/category/Pistols-Revolvers/104503680.uts |title=Cabela's still sells black powder pistols; remain in use for hunting |access-date=22 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111737/http://www.cabelas.com/category/Pistols-Revolvers/104503680.uts |archive-date=22 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Modern metallic cartridges===\n[[File:Snider-Martini-Enfield Cartridges.JPG|thumb|(From Left to Right): A [[.577 Snider]] cartridge (1867), a [[.577/450 Martini-Henry]] cartridge (1871), a later drawn brass .577/450 [[Martini-Henry]] cartridge, and a [[.303 British]] Mk VII SAA Ball cartridge.]]\n[[File:Fusil Gras M80 1874 metallic cartridge.jpg|thumb|French Army [[Fusil Gras mle 1874]] metallic cartridge.]]\n[[File:Lebel 8mm round.jpg|thumb|The [[8 mm Lebel]] ammunition, developed in 1886, the first [[smokeless powder|smokeless gunpowder]] cartridge to be made and adopted by any country.]]\n\nMost early all-metal cartridges were of the [[pinfire]] and [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] types.\n\nThe first centerfire metallic cartridge was invented by [[Jean Samuel Pauly]] in the first decades of the 19th century.

A year before, in 1856, the [[LeMat revolver]] was the first American (French-designed) breech-loading firearm, but it used pinfire cartridges, not rimfire. Formerly, an employee of the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company]], [[Rollin White]], had been the first in America to conceive the idea of having the revolver cylinder bored through to accept metallic cartridges ([[circa]] 1852), with the first in the world to use bored-through cylinders probably having been Lefaucheux in 1845, who invented a pepperbox-revolver loaded from the rear using bored-through cylinders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DjWpnQEACAAJ&dq=Early+Percussion+Firearms|title=Early Percussion Firearms|publisher=Spring Books |date=2015-10-25}}</ref> Another possible claimant for the bored-through cylinder is a Frenchman by the name of Perrin, who allegedly produced in 1839 a revolver with a bored-through cylinder to order.

White left Colt, went to Smith & Wesson to rent a licence for his patent, and this is how the S&W Model 1 saw light of day in 1857. The patent didn't definitely expire until 1870, allowing Smith & Wesson competitors to design and commercialise their own revolving breech-loaders using metallic cartridges. Famous models of that time are the Colts [[Colt Model 1871-72 Open Top|Open Top]] (1871-1872) and [[Colt Single Action Army|Single Action Army \"Peacemaker\"]] (1873). But in rifles, the [[lever-action]] mechanism patents were not obstructed by Rollin White's [[patent infringement]] because White only held a patent concerning drilled cylinders and revolving mechanisms. Thus, larger caliber rimfire cartridges were soon introduced after 1857, when the Smith & Wesson .22 Short ammunition was introduced for the first time. Some of these rifle cartridges were used in the American Civil War, including the [[.44 Henry]] and [[56-56 Spencer]] (both in 1860). However, the large rimfire cartridges were soon replaced by [[centerfire]] cartridges, which could safely handle higher pressures.<ref>[[Cartridges of the World]], various editions and articles.</ref><ref name=\"Williamson\">{{citation|first=Harold F. |last=Williamson |title=Winchester: The Gun that Won the West |date=1952 |publisher=A. S.

These limitations, which still apply, came from the construction of the rimfire cartridge and from the action of the priming mixture.  Rimfire cartridges must be made of thin metal or the firing pin cannot indent the head and explode the primer.  This thin-walled cartridge case limits the pressure developed by the powder charge and consequently the weight of the bullet.  If too much powder is used, there is a danger that the cartridge case will burst at the folded rim when it is fired, and that the primer flash, passing laterally across the rear of the powder charge, will not ignite a large load sufficiently to consume all of the powder before the bullet leaves the cartridge case. These limitations were overcome with the development of the centerfire cartridge....}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867 the British war office adopted the [[Eley Brothers|Eley]]-[[Edward Mounier Boxer|Boxer]] metallic centerfire cartridge case in the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] rifles, which were converted to [[Snider-Enfield|Snider-Enfield breech-loaders]] on the Snider principle. This consisted of a block opening on a hinge, thus forming a false breech against which the cartridge rested. The priming cap was in the base of the cartridge and was discharged by a [[Firing pin#Firing pin vs. striker|striker]] passing through the breech block. Other European powers adopted breech-loading military rifles from 1866 to 1868, with paper instead of metallic cartridge cases. The original Eley-Boxer cartridge case was made of thin-coiled brass\u2014occasionally these cartridges could break apart and jam the breech with the unwound remains of the case upon firing. Later the solid-drawn, centerfire cartridge case, made of one entire solid piece of tough hard metal, an alloy of copper, with a solid head of thicker metal, has been generally substituted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nCenterfire cartridges with solid-drawn metallic cases containing their own means of ignition are almost universally used in all modern varieties of military and sporting rifles and pistols.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAround 1870, machined tolerances had improved to the point that the cartridge case was no longer necessary to seal a firing chamber. Precision-faced bolts would seal as well, and could be economically manufactured.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, normal wear and tear proved this system to be generally infeasible.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name of any given cartridge does not necessarily reflect any cartridge or gun dimension. The name is merely the standardized and accepted moniker. SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute) and the European counterpart (CIP) and members of those organizations specify correct cartridge names. Cartridge names, when correctly presented, never include a naked leading decimal point.\n\nIt is a common misnomer to refer to a cartridge as a certain \"caliber\", (e.g., \"30-06 caliber\"). The correct full name for this cartridge is [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-'06 Springfield]].  The \"-'06\" means it was introduced in 1906. In sporting arms, the only consistent definition of \"caliber\" is bore diameter. Dozens of unique .30-caliber cartridge types exist.\n\nThere is considerable variation in cartridge nomenclature. Names sometimes reflect various characteristics of the cartridge. For example, the .308 Winchester uses a bullet of 308/1000-inch diameter and was standardized by Winchester. Conversely, cartridge names often reflect nothing related to the cartridge in any obvious way. For example, the .218 Bee uses a bullet of 224/1000-inch diameter, fired through a .22-in bore, etc. The 218 and Bee portions of this cartridge name reflect nothing other than the desires of those who standardized that cartridge. Many similar examples exist, for example: .219 Zipper, .221 Fireball, .222 Remington, .256 Winchester, .280 Remington, .307 Winchester, .356 Winchester.\n\nWhere two numbers are used in a cartridge name, the second number may reflect a variety of things. Frequently the first number reflects bore diameter (inches or millimeters). The second number reflects case length (in inches or mm). For example, the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] refers to a bore diameter of 7.62&nbsp;mm and has an overall case length of 51&nbsp;mm, with a total lengt h of 71.1 mm. The commercial version is the [[.308 Winchester]].)\n\nIn older [[black powder]] cartridges, the second number typically refers to powder charge, in [[Grain (unit)|grains]]. For example, the [[.50-90 Sharps]] has a .50-inch bore and used a nominal charge of {{convert|90.0|gr|g}} of black powder.\n\nMany such cartridges were designated by a three-number system (e.g., 45-120-3\u00bc Sharps: 45-caliber bore, 120 grains of (black) powder, 3\u00bc-inch long case). Other times, a similar three-number system indicated bore (caliber), charge (grains), and bullet weight (grains). The 45-70-500 Government is an example.\n\nOften, the name reflects the company or individual who standardized it, such as the [[.30 Newton]], or some characteristic important to that person.\n\nThe [[.38 Special]] actually has a nominal bullet diameter of {{convert|0.3570|in}} (jacketed) or {{convert|0.3580|in}} (lead) while the case has a nominal diameter of {{convert|0.3800|in}},. Hence the name. This is historically logical. The hole drilled through the chambers of .36-caliber cap-and-ball revolvers when converting those to work with cartridges was {{convert|0.3800|in}}, and the cartridge made to work in those revolvers was logically named the [[.38 Short Colt|.38 Colt]]. The original cartridges used a heeled bullet like a .22 rimfire where the bullet was the same diameter as the case. Early Colt Army .38s have a bore diameter that will allow a .357\" diameter bullet to slide through the barrel. The cylinder is bored straight through with no step. Later versions used an inside the case lubricated bullet of .357\" diameter instead of the original .38\" with a reduction in bore diameter. The difference in .38 Special bullet diameter and case diameter reflects the thickness of the case mouth (approximately 11/1000-inch per side). The [[.357 Magnum]] evolved from the .38 Special. The .357 was named to reflect bullet diameter (in thousandths inch), not case diameter. \"Magnum\" was used to indicate its longer case and higher operating pressure.\n\n==Classification==\nCartridges are classified by some major characteristics. One classification is the location of the primer. Early cartridges began with the pinfire, then the rimfire, and finally the centerfire.\n\nAnother classification describes how cartridges are located in the chamber ([[headspace (firearms)|headspace]]). Rimmed cartridges are located with the rim near the cartridge head; the rim is also used to extract the cartridge from the chamber. Examples are the [[.22 long rifle]] and [[.303 British]]. In a rimless cartridge, the cartridge head diameter is about the same as or smaller than the body diameter. The head will have a groove so the cartridge can be extracted from the chamber. Locating the cartridge in the chamber is accomplished by other means. Some rimless cartridges are necked down, and they are positioned by the cartridge's shoulder. An example is the [[.30-06 Springfield]]. Pistol cartridges may be located by the end of the brass case. An example is the [[.45 ACP]]. A [[belted magnum|belted cartridge]] has a larger diameter band of thick metal near the head of the cartridge. An example is the [[.300 Weatherby Magnum]]. An extreme version of the rimless cartridge is the rebated case; guns employing [[Blowback (firearms)#Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback|advanced primer ignition]] need such a case because the case moves during firing (i.e., it is not located at a fixed position). An example is the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20mm&times;110RB]].\n\n===Centerfire===\n{{Main|Centerfire ammunition}}\n[[File:Centerfire & rimfire ignition.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Centerfire and rimfire]]\nA centerfire cartridge has a centrally located primer held within a recess in the case head. Most centerfire brass cases used worldwide for sporting ammunition use [[Boxer primer]]s. It is easy to remove and replace Boxer primers using standard reloading tools, facilitating reuse.\n\nSome European- and Asian-manufactured military and sporting ammunition uses [[Berdan primer]]s. Removing the spent primer from (decapping) these cases requires use of a special tool because the primer anvil (on which the primer compound is crushed) is an integral part of the case and the case therefore does not have a central hole through which a decapping tool can push the primer out from the inside, as is done with Boxer primers. In Berdan cases, the flash holes are located to the sides of the anvil. With the right tool and components, reloading Berdan-primed cases is perfectly feasible. However, Berdan primers are not readily available in the U.S.\n\n===Rimfire===\n{{Main|Rimfire ammunition}}\nRimfire priming was a popular solution before centerfire priming was perfected. In a rimfire case, centrifugal force pushes a liquid priming compound into the internal recess of the folded rim as the manufacturer spins the case at a high rate and heats the spinning case to dry the priming compound mixture in place within the hollow cavity formed within the rim fold at the perimeter of the case interior.\n\nIn the mid- to late-1800s, many rimfire cartridge designs existed. Today only a few, mostly for use in small-caliber guns, remain in general and widespread use. These include the .17 Mach II, .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire (HMR), 5mm Remington Magnum (Rem Mag), .22 (BB, CB, Short, Long, Long Rifle), and .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR).\n\nCompared to modern centerfire cases used in the strongest types of modern guns, existing rimfire cartridge designs use loads that generate relatively low pressure because of limitations of feasible gun design \u2013 the rim has little or no lateral support from the gun. Such support would require very close tolerances in design of the chamber, bolt, and firing pin. Because that is not cost-effective, it is necessary to keep rimfire load pressure low enough so that the stress generated by chamber pressure that would push the case rim outward cannot expand the rim significantly. Also, the wall of the folded rim must be thin and ductile enough to easily deform, as necessary to allow the blow from the firing pin to crush and thereby ignite the primer compound, and it must do so without rupturing, If it is too thick, it will be too resistant to deformation. If it is too hard, it will crack rather than deform. These two limitations \u2013 that the rim is self-supporting laterally and that the rim is thin and ductile enough to easily crush in response to the firing pin impact \u2013 limit rimfire pressures.<ref name=\"Williamson\"/>\n\nModern centerfire cartridges are often loaded to about {{convert|65000|psi|abbr=on}} maximum chamber pressure. Conversely, no commercialized rimfire has ever been loaded above about {{convert|40000|psi|abbr=on}} maximum chamber pressure. However, with careful gun design and production, no fundamental reason exists that higher pressures could not be used. Despite the relative pressure disadvantage, modern rimfire magnums in .17-caliber/4.5mm, .20-caliber/5mm, and .22-caliber/5.6mm can generate muzzle energies comparable to smaller centerfire cartridges.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nToday, [[.22 LR]] (Long Rifle) accounts for the vast majority of all rimfire ammunition used. Standard .22 LR rounds use an essentially pure lead bullet plated with a typical 95% copper, 5% zinc combination. These are offered in [[supersonic]] and subsonic types, as well as target, plinking, and hunting versions. These cartridges are usually coated with a hard wax for fouling control.\n\nThe .22 LR and related rimfire .22 cartridges use a heeled bullet, where external diameter of the case is the same as diameter of the forward portion of the bullet and where the rearward portion of the bullet, which extends into the case, is necessarily smaller in diameter than the main body of the bullet.\n\n==Semi-automatic vs. revolver cartridges==\n\nMost [[revolver]] cartridges have a rim at the base of the case that is larger than the case body is and which seats against or into the cylinder block to provide [[Headspace (firearms)|headspace]] control (to keep the cartridge from moving too far forward in the cylinder chamber) and to provide for easy extraction.\n\nNearly every [[semi-automatic pistol]] cartridge is \"rimless\", or more precisely has a rim of the same diameter as the case body. An extractor engages this rim by entering a cannelure near the base of the case. A few designs, known as \"semi-rimmed\" have a rim that is slightly larger than case body diameter but these function as a rimless design. All such cartridges headspace on the case mouth (although some, such as [[.38 Super]], at one time seated on the rim, this was changed for accuracy reasons), which prevents the round from entering too far into the chamber. Some cartridges have a rim that is significantly smaller than case body diameter. These are known as rebated-rim designs and almost always allow a handgun to fire multiple caliber cartridges with only a barrel and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] change.\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:380 ACP - FMJ - SB - 2.jpg|Rimless [[.380 ACP]] semi-automatic cartridge\nFile:38 Special - FMJ - SB - 2.jpg|Rimmed [[.38 special]] revolver cartridge\n</gallery>\n\n==Bullet design types==\n[[File:7.7 mm Japanese navy.jpg|right|thumb|A cutaway showing a Japanese Navy 7.7 mm rimmed rounds as fired by the Type 92 and Type 97 machine guns\u2014copies of Vickers and Lewis designs.

Slugs are stabilized in flight by [[rifling]] in the barrel, which causes the slug to spin, or are stabilized as a dart is by the weight center of balance being forward of the aerodynamic center of balance, sometimes with assistance from fins. Solid or hollow-point slugs are available but, due to the relatively low velocity, hollow-point slugs often demonstrate relatively low expansion.\n* [[Flexible baton round|Baton round]]: a generally non-lethal projectile fired from a riot gun.\n* [[Armor-piercing shell#Small arms|Armor Piercing]] (AP): A hard bullet made from steel or tungsten alloys in a pointed shape typically covered by a thin layer of lead and or a copper or brass jacket. The lead and jacket are intended to prevent barrel wear from the hard core materials. AP bullets are sometimes less effective on unarmored targets than FMJ bullets are. This has to do with the reduced tendency of AP projectiles to yaw (turn sideways after impact).\n* Flat Nose Lead (FNL): Similar to the above, with a flattened nose. Common in [[Cowboy Action Shooting]] and plinking ammunition loads.\n* [[Full metal jacket bullet|Full Metal Jacket]] (FMJ): Made with a lead core surrounded by a full covering of brass, copper, or mild steel. These usually offer very little deformation or terminal performance expansion, but will occasionally yaw (turn sideways). Despite the name, a FMJ bullet typically has an exposed lead base, which is not visible in an intact cartridge.\n* [[Glaser Safety Slug]]: The Glaser Safety Slug dates back to the early 1970s. The inventor, Colonel Jack Cannon, named it for his friend Armin Glaser. Over the years, these projectiles have evolved from crude, hand-produced examples to mass-production; however, the basic concept has remained the same: copper jackets filled with bird shot and covered by a crimped polymer endcap. Upon impact with flesh, the projectile is supposed to fragment, with the birdshot spreading like a miniature shotgun pattern. The standard \"Blue\" Glaser uses a rather fine birdshot that only gives 5 to 6&nbsp;inches ({{nowrap|130\u2013150 mm}}) of penetration in flesh. The \"Silver\" Glaser adds another 1 to 2&nbsp;inches ({{nowrap|30\u201350 mm}}) of penetration with the use of slightly larger birdshot. Due to reduced penetration in flesh, some have theorized that the Glaser would be ideal where over-penetration of a projectile could be hazardous to bystanders. For instance, the Glaser might be entirely contained within an arm. However, for the same reasons, terminal performance of Glaser bullets can vary dramatically, producing impressive successes and equally spectacular failures depending on the angle at which the target is struck. Glancing hits on hard surfaces will result in fragmentation, reducing the risk of ricochets. However, the Glaser can penetrate barriers such as drywall, plywood, and thin sheet metal if struck nearly head on.\n* Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP): Soon after the invention of the JSP, Woolwich Arsenal in Great Britain experimented with this design even further by forming a hole or cavity in the nose of the bullet while keeping most of the exterior profile intact. These bullets could theoretically deform even faster and expand to a larger diameter than the JSP. In personal defense use, concerns have arisen over whether clothing, especially heavy materials like denim, can clog the cavity of JHP bullets and cause expansion failures.\n* Jacketed Soft Point (JSP): In the late 19th century, the Indian Army at [[Dum-Dum Arsenal]], near Kolkata, developed a variation of the FMJ design where the jacket did not cover the nose of the bullet. The soft lead nose was found to expand in flesh while the remaining jacket still prevented lead fouling in the barrel. The JSP roughly splits the difference between FMJ and JHP. It gives more penetration than JHP but has better terminal ballistic characteristics than the FMJ.\n* Round Nose Lead (RNL): An unjacketed lead bullet. Although largely supplanted by jacketed ammunition, this is still common for older revolver cartridges. Some hunters prefer roundnose ammunition for hunting in brush because they erroneously believe that such a bullet deflects less than sharp-nosed [[spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullets]], regardless of the fact that this belief has been repeatedly proven not to be true. Refer to American Rifleman magazine.\n* Total Metal Jacket (TMJ): Featured in some Speer cartridges, the TMJ bullet has a lead core completely and seamlessly enclosed in brass, copper or other jacket metal, including the base. According to Speer literature, this prevents hot propellant gases from vaporizing lead from the base of the bullet, reducing lead emissions. [[Sellier & Bellot]] produce a similar version that they call TFMJ, with a separate end cap of jacket material.\n* Wadcutter (WC): Similar to the FNL, but completely cylindrical, in some instances with a slight concavity in the nose. This bullet derives its name from its popularity for target shooting, because the form factor cuts neat holes in paper targets, making scoring easier and more accurate and because it typically cuts a larger hole than a round nose bullet, a hit centered at the same spot can touch the next smaller ring and therefore score higher.\n* Semi Wad Cutter (SWC) identical to the WC with a smaller diameter flap pointed conical or radiused nose added.

Because of the small size of this cartridge, the smallest self-defense handguns chambered in 22 rimfire (though less effective than most centerfire handguns cartridges) can be concealed in situations where a handgun chambered for a centerfire cartridge could not. The 22 LR is the most commonly fired sporting arms cartridge, primarily because, when compared to any centerfire ammunition, 22 LR ammunition is much less expensive and because recoil generated by the light 22 bullet at modest velocity is very mild.\n* [[.22-250 Remington]]: A very popular cartridge for medium to long range small game and varmint hunting, pest control and target shooting. The 22-250 is one of the most popular cartridges for fox hunting and other pest control in Western Europe due to its flat trajectory and very good accuracy on rabbit to fox sized pests.\n* [[.300 Winchester Magnum]]: One of the most popular big game hunting cartridges of all time. Also, as a long-range sniping round, it is favored by [[United States Navy SEALs|US Navy SEALs]] and the German [[Bundeswehr]]. While not in the same class as the [[338 Lapua]], it has roughly the same power as [[7 mm Remington Magnum]], and easily exceeds the performance of [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]].\n* [[30-06 Springfield]] (7.62\u00d763mm): The standard US Army rifle cartridge for the first half of the 20th century.

Two years prior to the NATO adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO T65 in 1954, Winchester (a subsidiary of the Olin Corporation) branded the cartridge and introduced it to the commercial hunting market as the 308 Winchester. The Winchester Model 70 and Model 88 rifles were subsequently chambered for this cartridge. Since then, the 308 Winchester has become the most popular short-action big-game hunting cartridge worldwide. It is also commonly used for civilian and military target events, military sniping and police sharpshooting.\n* [[.357 Magnum]]: Using a lengthened version of the [[.38 Special]] case loaded to about twice the maximum chamber pressure as the 38 Spc., the 357 Magnum was rapidly accepted by hunters and law enforcement. At the time of its introduction, 357 Magnum bullets were claimed to easily pierce the body panels of automobiles and crack engine blocks (to eventually disable the vehicle).<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 =Barr\n | first1 =Al\n | last2 =Teesdale\n | first2 =Jerald\n | last3 =Keith\n | first3 =Elmer\n | last4 =Hardaway\n | first4 =Ben F.\n | title =Reloading Information\n | publisher =[[National Rifle Association]]\n | volume =2\n | year =1951\n | location =Washington, DC\n | pages =77\u201383\n }}</ref>\n* [[.375 Holland & Holland Magnum]]: designed for hunting African big game in the early 20th century and legislated as the minimum caliber for African hunters during the mid-20th century<ref name=AH375HNH>{{cite web|last=Gunyana |title=Classic African Cartridges Part X \u2013 The .375 H&H Magnum |url=http://www.huntnetwork.net/modules/wfsection/html/Ahclassic%20African%20Cartridge%20Pt10.pdf |work=African Hunter Magazine |publisher=African Hunter |accessdate=23 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225044443/https://www.huntnetwork.net/modules/wfsection/html/Ahclassic%20African%20Cartridge%20Pt10.pdf |archivedate=25 February 2012}}</ref>\n* [[.40 S&W]]: A shorter-cased version of the [[10mm Auto]].\n* [[.44 Magnum]]: A high-powered pistol cartridge designed primarily for hunting.\n* [[.45 ACP]]: The standard US pistol round for about one century.

It is used in heavy machine guns and high-powered sniper rifles. Such rifles can be used, amongst other things, for destroying military [[mat\u00e9riel]] such as sensitive parts of grounded aircraft and armored transports. Civilian shooters use these for long-distance target shooting.\n* [[5.45\u00d739mm]] Soviet: The Soviet response to the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge.\n* [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]]: Adopted by the US military in the 1960s, it later became the NATO standard rifle cartridge in the early 80s, displacing the [[7.62\u00d751mm]]. Remington later adopted this military round as the [[.223 Remington]], a very popular cartridge for varminting and small game hunting.\n* [[7\u00d764mm]]: One of the most popular long range varmint and medium- to big-game hunting cartridges in Europe, especially in the countries such as [[France]] and (formerly) [[Belgium]] where the possession of firearms chambered for a (former) military cartridge is forbidden or is more heavily restricted. This cartridge is offered by European rifle makers in both bolt-action rifles and a rimmed version, the 7\u00d765mmR is chambered in double and combination rifles. Another reason for its popularity is its flat trajectory, very good penetration and high versatility, depending on what bullet and load are used. Combined with a large choice of different 7&nbsp;mm bullets available the 7\u00d764mm is used on everything from [[fox]] and [[geese]] to [[red deer]], Scandinavian [[moose]] and European [[brown bear]] equivalent to the North American black bear. The 7x64mm essentially duplicates performance of the 270 Winchester and 280 Remington.\n* [[7 mm Remington Magnum]]: A long-range hunting cartridge.\n* [[7.62\u00d739mm]]: The standard Soviet/ComBloc rifle cartridge from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s, this is easily one of the most widely distributed cartridges in the world due to the distribution of the ubiquitous [[Mikhail Kalashnikov|Kalashnikov]] [[AK-47]] series.\n* [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]]: This was the standard NATO rifle round until its replacement by the 5.56\u00d745mm. It is currently the standard NATO sniper rifle and medium machinegun chambering. In the 1950s it was the standard NATO cartridge for rifles, but recoil and weight proved problematic for the new [[battle rifle]] designs such as the [[FN FAL]]. Standardized commercially as the 308 Winchester.\n* [[7.62\u00d754mmR]]: The standard Russian rifle round from the 1890s to the mid-1940s. The \"R\" stands for rimmed. The 7.62\u00d754mmR rifle cartridge is a Russian design dating back to 1891. Originally designed for the Mosin-Nagant rifle, it was used during the late Tsarist era and throughout the Soviet period, in machine guns and rifles such as the SVT-40. The Winchester Model 1895 was also chambered for this cartridge per a contract with the Russian government. It is still in use by the Russian military in the Dragunov and other sniper rifles and some machine guns. The round is colloquially known as the \"7.62 Russian\". This name sometimes causes people to confusion this round with the \"7.62 Soviet\" round, which refers to the 7.62&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;39 cartridge used in the SKS and AK-47 rifles.\n* [[32 ACP|7.65\u00d717mm Browning SR]] (32 ACP): A very small pistol round. However, this was the predominant Police Service Cartridge in Europe until the mid-1970s. The \"SR\" stands for semi-rimmed, meaning the case rim is slightly larger than case body diameter.\n* [[7.92 x 57mm Mauser|8\u00d757mm IS]]: The standard German service rifle cartridge from 1888 to 1945, the 8\u00d757mmIS (aka 8&nbsp;mm Mauser) has seen wide distribution around the globe through commercial, surplus, and military sales, and is still a popular and commonly used hunting round in most of Europe, partly because of the abundance of affordable hunting rifles in this chambering as well as a broad availability of different hunting, target, and military surplus ammunition available.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 =Hatcher\n | first1 =Julian\n | last2 =Barr\n | first2 =Al\n | last3 =Neuman\n | first3 =Charles L.\n | title =Reloading Information\n | publisher =[[National Rifle Association]]\n | volume =1\n | year =1951\n | location =Washington, DC\n | pages =79\u201384\n }}</ref>\n* [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]: Invented for the German military at the turn of the 20th century, the wide distribution of the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge made it the logical choice for the NATO standard pistol and [[Submachine gun]] round.\n* [[9.3\u00d762mm]]: Very common big game hunting round in Scandinavia along with the [[6.5\u00d755mm]], where it is used as a very versatile hunting round on anything from small and medium game with lightweight cast lead bullets to the largest European big game with heavy soft point hunting bullets. The 9.3\u00d762mm is also very popular in the rest of Europe for Big game, especially driven Big game hunts due to its effective stopping power on running game. And, it is the single cartridge smaller than the 375 H&H Magnum that has routinely been allowed for legal hunting of dangerous African species.\n* [[12.7\u00d7108mm]]: The 12.7\u00d7108mm cartridge is a heavy machine gun and anti-materiel rifle cartridge used by the Soviet Union, the former Warsaw Pact, modern Russia, and other countries. It is the approximate Russian equivalent of the NATO .50 BMG (12.7\u00d799mm NATO) cartridge. The differences between the two are the bullet shape, the types of powder used, and that the case of the 12.7\u00d7108mm is 9&nbsp;mm longer and marginally more powerful.\n* [[14.5\u00d7114mm]]: The 14.5\u00d7114&nbsp;mm is a heavy machine gun and anti-materiel rifle cartridge used by the Soviet Union, the former Warsaw Pact, modern Russia, and other countries. Its most common use is in the [[KPV heavy machine gun]] found on several Russian Military vehicles.\n\n==Snake shot==\n[[File:.22LR ratshot.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|CCI .22LR snake shot loaded with #12 shot]] \n{{Main|Snake shot}}\n\n'''Snake shot''' (AKA: '''bird shot,''' '''rat shot''' and '''dust shot''')<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/guidetotaxidermy00reed#page/22/mode/2up/|title=Guide to taxidermy|pages=22\u201323|author=Reed, C.K. & C.A.

Snake shot is generally used for shooting at snakes, rodents, birds, and other [[Pest (organism)|pests]] at very close range.\n\nThe most common snake shot cartridge is [[.22 Long Rifle]] loaded with #12 shot. From a standard rifle these can produce effective patterns only to a distance of about {{convert|3|m|ft|-1}} - but in a smoothbore shotgun this can extend as far as {{convert|15|m|ft|-1}}.\n\n==Caseless ammunition==\n{{Main|Caseless ammunition}}\n[[File:4.73x33 Caseless-crop.jpg|thumb|left|An example of caseless ammunition. This disassembled round, the 4.73\u00d733mm, is used in the [[Heckler & Koch G11]] rifle.]]\n\nMany governments and companies continue to develop caseless ammunition {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} (where the entire case assembly is either consumed when the round fires or whatever remains is ejected with the bullet). So far, none of these have been successful enough to reach the civilian market and gain commercial success. Even within the military market, use is limited. Around 1848, [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company|Sharps]] introduced a rifle and paper cartridge (containing everything but the primer) system. When new these guns had significant gas leaks at the chamber end, and with use these leaks progressively worsened. This problem plagues caseless cartridge and gun systems to this day.\n\nThe Daisy Heddon VL Single Shot Rifle, which used a caseless round in .22 caliber, was produced by the air gun company, beginning in 1968. Apparently Daisy never considered the gun an actual firearm. In 1969, the ATF ruled it was in fact a firearm, which Daisy was not licensed to produce. Production of the guns and the ammo was discontinued in 1969. They are still available on the secondary market, mainly as collector items, as most owners report that accuracy is not very good.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://everything2.com/title/Daisy+V%252FL |title=Daisy V/L |access-date=3 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005223625/http://everything2.com/title/Daisy+V%252FL |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, [[Heckler & Koch]], a prominent [[Germany|German]] firearms manufacturer, began advertising the [[G11 assault rifle]], which shot a 4.73\u00d733 square caseless round. The round was mechanically fired, with an integral primer.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1993 [[Voere]] of [[Austria]] began selling a gun and caseless ammunition. Their system used a primer, [[electronic firing|electronically fired]] at 17.5 \u00b1 2 [[volt]]s. The upper and lower limits prevent fire from either stray currents or [[static electricity]]. The direct electrical firing eliminates the mechanical delays associated with a striker, reducing [[lock time]] and allowing for easier adjustment of the rifle trigger.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn both instances, the \"case\" was molded directly from solid [[nitrocellulose]], which is itself relatively strong and inert. The bullet and primer were glued into the propellant block.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Trounds==\n[[File:Dardick 1500 with trounds (29432934078).jpg|thumb|Dardick 1500 with trounds]]\n{{Main|Dardick tround}}\n\nThe \"Tround\" (\"Triangular Round\") was a unique type of cartridge designed in 1958 by David Dardick, for use in specially designed Dardick 1100 and Dardick 1500 open-chamber firearms. As their name suggests, Trounds were triangular in cross-section, and were made of plastic or aluminum, with the cartridge completely encasing the powder and projectile. The Tround design was also produced as a cartridge adaptor, to allow conventional [[.38 Special]] and [[22 Long Rifle]] cartridges to be used with the Dardick firearms.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Blank ammunition==\n{{Main|Blank (cartridge)}}\n[[File:Platzpatronen762 9.jpg|thumb|Blank cartridges:{{unordered list\n | [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (left)\n | [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (right).}}]]\nA blank is a charged cartridge that does not contain a projectile or alternatively uses a non-metallic (for instance, wooden) projectile that pulverizes when hitting a blank firing adapter. To contain the propellant, the opening where the projectile would normally be located is crimped shut and or it is sealed with some material that disperses rapidly upon leaving the barrel.\n\nThis sealing material can still potentially cause harm at extremely close range. Actor [[Jon-Erik Hexum#Death|Jon-Erik Hexum]] died when he shot himself in the head with a blank, and actor [[Brandon Lee]] was famously killed during filming of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' when a blank fired behind a bullet that was stuck in the bore drove that bullet through his abdomen and into his spine. The gun had not been properly deactivated and a primed case with a bullet instead of a dummy had been used previously. Someone pulled the trigger and the primer drove the bullet silently into the bore.\n\nBlanks are used in training, but do not always cause a gun to behave the same as live ammunition does; recoil is always far weaker, and some automatic guns only cycle correctly when the gun is fitted with a [[blank-firing adaptor]] to confine gas pressure within the barrel to operate the gas system.\n\nBlanks can also be used to launch a [[rifle grenade]], although later systems used a \"bullet trap\" design that captures a bullet from a conventional round, speeding deployment. This also negates the risk of mistakenly firing a live bullet into the rifle grenade, causing it to instantly explode instead of propelling it forward.\n\nBlanks are also used as dedicated launchers for propelling a [[grappling hook]], rope line or flare, or for a training lure for training [[gun dog]]s.\n\nThe power loads used in a variety of [[nail gun]]s are essentially rimfire blanks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Dummy rounds==\n[[File:Naboj23 mm.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[23\u00d7152mm]] cartridge, drill round]]\n{{Main|Dummy round}}\nDrill rounds are inert versions of cartridges used for education and practice during military training. Other than the lack of propellant and primer, these are the same size as normal cartridges and will fit into the mechanism of a gun in the same way as a live cartridge does. Because dry-firing (releasing the firing pin with an empty chamber) a gun can sometimes lead to firing pin (striker) damage, dummy rounds termed [[snap cap]]s are designed to protect centerfire guns from possible damage during \"dry-fire\" trigger control practices.\n\nTo distinguish drill rounds and snap-caps from live rounds these are marked distinctively. Several forms of markings are used; e.g. setting colored flutes in the case, drilling holes through the case, coloring the bullet or cartridge, or a combination of these. In the case of centerfire drill rounds the primer will often be absent, its mounting hole in the base is left open. Because these are mechanically identical to live rounds, which are intended to be loaded once, fired and then discarded, drill rounds have a tendency to become significantly worn and damaged with repeated passage through [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s and firing mechanisms, and must be frequently inspected to ensure that these are not so degraded as to be unusable\u2014for example the cases can become torn or misshapen and snag on moving parts, or the bullet can become separated and stay in the breech when the case is ejected.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Mek-Porek===\n[[File:Mek-Porek 9x19mm Parabellum from behind.jpg|thumb|upright|9 \u00d7 19 mm Mek-Porek]]\nThe bright-colored Mek-Porek is an inert cartridge base designed to prevent a live round from being unintentionally chambered, to reduce the chances of an accidental discharge from mechanical or operator failure. An L-shaped flag is visible from the outside, so that the shooter and other people concerned are instantly aware about the situation of the weapon. The Mek-Porek is usually tethered to its weapon by a short string, and can be quickly ejected to make way for a live round if the situation suddenly warrants. This safety device is standard-issue in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].<ref>Shoval, Lilach. [http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=15149 \"IDF to issue new safety device to prevent accidental weapon discharge\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104203837/http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=15149 |date=4 January 2016 }}, ''[[Israel Hayom]]'', Tel-Aviv, 31 January 2014. Retrieved on 4 January 2016.</ref>\n\n===Snap cap===\n[[File:Snap caps.jpg|left|thumb|An assortment of snap caps of varying calibers]]\nA [[snap cap]] is a device which is shaped like a standard cartridge but contains no primer, propellant or projectile.  It is used to ensure that [[dry firing]] firearms of certain designs does not cause damage.  A small number of rimfire and centerfire firearms of older design should not be test-fired with the chamber empty, as this can lead to weakening or breakage of the firing pin and increased wear to other components in those firearms. In the instance of a rimfire weapon of primitive design, dry firing can also cause deformation of the chamber edge.  For this reason some shooters use a snap cap in an attempt to cushion the weapon's firing pin as it moves forward.  Some snap caps contain a spring-dampened fake primer, or one made of plastic, or none at all; the springs or plastic absorb force from the firing pin, allowing the user to safely test the function of the [[firearm action]] without damaging its components.\n\nSnap caps and action-proving dummy cartridges also work as a training tool to replace live rounds for loading and unloading drills, as well as training for misfires or other malfunctions, as they function identically to a live \"dud\" round that has not ignited.  Usually one snap-cap is usable for 300 to 400 clicks.  After that, due to the hole at the false primer, the firing pin does not reach it.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ammunition]]\n* [[Ammunition box]]\n* [[Antique guns]]\n* [[Handloading]]\n* [[List of handgun cartridges]]\n* [[List of Magnum pistol cartridges]]\n* [[List of rifle cartridges]]\n* [[Nitrocellulose]]\n* [[Percussion cap]]\n* [[Shotgun shell]]\n* [[Snake shot]]\n* [[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Pistol and rifle cartridges}}\n* [http://www.cartridgecollectors.org/glossary.htm Cartridge Collectors]\n* [http://www.rawles.to/Euro_Box_FAQ.html European Ammunition Box Translations]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cartridge (Firearms)}}\n[[Category:Ammunition]]\n[[Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|modern metallic small-arms cartridges|older, paper, small-arms cartridges|Paper cartridge|cartridges used with larger arms|Artillery#Ammunition|other uses|Cartridge (disambiguation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Image:Bulletfixed1.PNG|thumb|A modern cartridge consists of the following:<br>''1.''

Many weapons were designed to make use of a readily available cartridge, or a new one with new qualities.\n\nThe cartridge case [[Obturation|seals]] a [[Chamber (firearms)|firing chamber]] in all directions excepting the [[Gun barrel|bore]]. A [[firing pin]] strikes the primer and ignites it. The primer compound ''[[deflagration|deflagrates]]'', it does not ''[[detonation|detonate]]'' (that is, it rapidly burns, but does not explode). A jet of burning gas from the primer ignites the propellant.\n\nGases from the burning powder pressurize and expand the case to seal it against the chamber wall. These propellant gases push on the bullet base. In response to this pressure, the bullet will move in the path of least resistance which is down the bore of the [[Barrel (firearms)|barrel]]. After the bullet leaves the barrel, the chamber pressure drops to atmospheric pressure. The case, which had been elastically expanded by chamber pressure, contracts slightly. This eases removal of the case from the chamber.\n\n===Manufacture===\n\n[[File:0.30-30 Winchester case, stages in the drawing process, book; Cartridge Manufacture (1916), autor; Douglas T.

These disks go through a series of [[deep drawing|drawing dies]]. The disks are [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] and washed before moving to the next series of dies. The brass needs to be annealed to remove the work-hardening in the material and make the brass malleable again ready for the next series of dies.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nManufacturing bullet jackets is similar to making brass cases: there is a series of drawing steps with annealing and washing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Materials===\nThe projectile (see [[#Bullet design types|below]]) can be made of virtually anything. [[Lead]] is a material of choice because of high density, and ductility.\n\nThe propellant was long [[gunpowder]], still in use, but superseded by better compositions, generically called [[smokeless powder]].\n\nEarly [[Primer (firearm)|primer]] was simply fine gunpowder poured into a pan or tube where it could be ignited by some external source of ignition such as a fuse or a spark. Modern primers are shock sensitive chemicals enclosed in a small (a few mm) capsule, ignited by percussion. In some instance ignition is electricity-primed, and there may even be no primer at all in such design (the propellant being directly ignited).\n\nThe case is commonly made of [[brass]] because it is resistant to corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A brass case head can be work-hardened to withstand the high pressures of cartridges, and allow for manipulation via extraction and ejection without tearing the metal. The neck and body portion of a brass case is easily annealed to make the case [[ductile]] enough to allow reforming so that it can be reloaded many times.\n\n[[Steel]] is used in some [[plinking]] ammunition, as well as in some military ammunition (mainly from the [[former Soviet Union]] and [[China]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}). Steel is less expensive than brass, but it is not feasible to reload and reuse steel cases. Military forces typically consider small arms cartridge cases to be disposable, one-time-use devices. However, case weight (mass) affects how much ammunition a soldier can carry, so the lighter steel cases do have a military advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Conversely, steel is more susceptible to contamination and damage so all such cases are varnished or otherwise sealed against the elements.\n\nOne downside caused by the increased strength of steel in the neck of these cases (compared to the annealed neck of a brass case) is that propellant gas can blow back past the neck and into the chamber. Constituents of these gases condense on the (relatively cold) chamber wall. This solid propellant residue can make extraction of fired cases difficult. This is less of a problem for small arms of the former [[Warsaw Pact]] nations, which were designed with much larger chamber tolerances than [[NATO]] weapons.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[Aluminum]] cased cartridges are available commercially. These are generally not reloaded as aluminum fatigues easily during firing and resizing. Some calibers also have non-standard primer sizes to discourage reloaders from attempting to reuse these cases.\n\n[[Polymer-cased ammunition|Plastic cases]] are commonly used in [[shotgun]] shells and some manufacturers offer polymer centerfire cartridges.\n\nHistorically paper had been used in the earliest cartridges.\n\n===Specifications===\nCritical cartridge specifications include neck size, bullet weight and [[caliber]], maximum pressure, [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]], overall length, case body diameter and taper, shoulder design, [[Rim (firearms)|rim type]], etc. Generally, every characteristic of a specific cartridge type is tightly controlled and few types are interchangeable in any way. Exceptions do exist but generally, these are only where a shorter cylindrical rimmed cartridge can be used in a longer chamber, (e.g., .22 Short in .22 Long Rifle chamber, and .38 Special in a .357 Magnum chamber). [[Centerfire ammunition|Centerfire]] primer type (Boxer or Berdan, see below) is interchangeable, although not in the same case. Deviation in any of these specifications can result in firearm damage and, in some instances, injury or death. Similarly, use of the wrong type of cartridge in any given gun can damage the gun, or cause bodily injury.\n\nCartridge specifications are determined by several standards organizations, including [[SAAMI]] in the United States, and [[C.I.P.]] in many European states. NATO also performs [[NATO EPVAT testing|its own tests]] for military cartridges for its member nations; due to differences in testing methods, NATO cartridges ([[headstamp]]ed with the NATO cross) may present an unsafe combination when loaded into a weapon chambered for a cartridge certified by one of the other testing bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saami.org/specifications_and_information/publications/download/SAAMI_ITEM_211-Unsafe_Arms_and_Ammunition_Combinations.pdf |title=Unsafe Firearm-Ammunition Combinations |publisher=SAAMI |date=6 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116092917/http://saami.org/specifications_and_information/publications/download/SAAMI_ITEM_211-Unsafe_Arms_and_Ammunition_Combinations.pdf |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nBullet diameter is measured either as a fraction of an inch (usually in 1/100 or in 1/1000) or in millimeters.

This was struck by the flint and fired the gun. In the course of loading a pinch of powder from the cartridge would be placed into the pan as priming, before the rest of the cartridge was rammed down the barrel, providing charge and wadding.<ref>{{cite book|title=Edgehill: The Battle Reinterpreted|last1=Scott|first1=Christopher L.|last2=Turton|first2=Alan|last3=Gruber von Arni|first3=Eric|pages=9\u201312|year=2004|isbn=978-1844152544|publisher=Pen and Sword}}</ref>\n\nThe next important advance in the method of ignition was the introduction of the copper [[percussion cap]]. This was only generally applied to the British military musket (the [[Brown Bess]]) in 1842, a quarter of a century after the invention of percussion powder and after an elaborate government test at Woolwich in 1834. The invention that made the percussion cap possible was patented by the Rev. A. J. Forsyth in 1807 and consisted of priming with a fulminating powder made of [[potassium chlorate]], sulfur, and charcoal, which ignited by concussion. This invention was gradually developed, and used, first in a steel cap, and then in a copper cap, by various gunmakers and private individuals before coming into general military use nearly thirty years later.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe alteration of the military flint-lock to the percussion [[musket]] was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan with a perforated nipple and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint with a smaller hammer that had a hollow to fit on the nipple when released by the trigger. The shooter placed a percussion cap (now made of three parts of [[potassium chlorate]], two of [[mercury fulminate|fulminate of mercury]] and powdered glass) on the nipple. The detonating cap thus invented and adopted brought about the invention of the modern cartridge case, and rendered possible the general adoption of the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] principle for all varieties of [[rifle]]s, [[shotgun]]s and [[pistol]]s. This greatly streamlined the reloading procedure and paved the way for semi- and full-automatic firearms.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nHowever, this big leap forward came at a price. It introduced an extra component into each round \u2013 the cartridge case \u2013 which had to be removed before the gun could be reloaded. While a flintlock, for example, is immediately ready to reload once it has been fired, adopting brass cartridge cases brought in the problems of extraction and ejection. The mechanism of a modern gun not only must load and fire the piece but also must remove the spent case, which might require just as many added moving parts. Many [[Firearm malfunction|malfunctions]] involve this process, either through failure to extract a case properly from the chamber or by allowing the extracted case to jam the action. Nineteenth-century inventors were reluctant to accept this added complication and experimented with a variety of [[caseless]] or self-consuming cartridges before finally accepting that the advantages of brass cases far outweighed this one drawback.<ref>Winant, Lewis (1959).

This invention has completely revolutionized the art of gun making, has been successfully applied to all descriptions of firearms, and has produced a new and important industry: that of cartridge manufacture. Its essential feature is preventing gas escaping the breech when the gun is fired, by means of an expansive cartridge case containing its own means of ignition. Previous to this invention shotguns and sporting rifles were loaded by means of [[powder flask]]s and shot bags or flasks, bullets, wads and copper caps, all carried separately. One of the earliest efficient modern cartridge cases was the [[pinfire cartridge]], developed by French gunsmith [[Casimir Lefaucheux]] in 1836.<ref name=\"Pistols\">Kinard, Jeff (2004) ''Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact'', ABC-CLIO, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA109&dq=Houllier+cartridge#PPA109,M1 p. 109] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528211811/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVnuHX_6bG0C&pg=PA109&dq=Houllier+cartridge#PPA109,M1 |date=28 May 2016 }}</ref> It consisted of a thin weak shell made of brass and paper that expanded from the force of the explosion. This fit perfectly in the barrel, and thus formed an efficient gas check. A small percussion cap was placed in the middle of the base of the cartridge and was ignited by means of a brass pin projecting from the side and struck by the hammer. This pin also afforded the means of extracting the cartridge case. This cartridge was introduced in England by Lang, of Cockspur Street, London, about 1845.\n\nIn the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) a breech-loading rifle, the Sharps, was introduced and produced in large numbers. It could be loaded with either a ball or a [[paper cartridge]]. After that war many were converted to the use of metal cartridges. The development by [[Smith & Wesson]] (among many others) of revolver handguns that used metal cartridges helped establish cartridge firearms as the standard in the US by the late 1860s and early 1870s, although many continue to use percussion revolvers well after that.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cabelas.com/category/Pistols-Revolvers/104503680.uts |title=Cabela's still sells black powder pistols; remain in use for hunting |access-date=22 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111737/http://www.cabelas.com/category/Pistols-Revolvers/104503680.uts |archive-date=22 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Modern metallic cartridges===\n[[File:Snider-Martini-Enfield Cartridges.JPG|thumb|(From Left to Right): A [[.577 Snider]] cartridge (1867), a [[.577/450 Martini-Henry]] cartridge (1871), a later drawn brass .577/450 [[Martini-Henry]] cartridge, and a [[.303 British]] Mk VII SAA Ball cartridge.]]\n[[File:Fusil Gras M80 1874 metallic cartridge.jpg|thumb|French Army [[Fusil Gras mle 1874]] metallic cartridge.]]\n[[File:Lebel 8mm round.jpg|thumb|The [[8 mm Lebel]] ammunition, developed in 1886, the first [[smokeless powder|smokeless gunpowder]] cartridge to be made and adopted by any country.]]\n\nMost early all-metal cartridges were of the [[pinfire]] and [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] types.\n\nThe first centerfire metallic cartridge was invented by [[Jean Samuel Pauly]] in the first decades of the 19th century.

A year before, in 1856, the [[LeMat revolver]] was the first American (French-designed) breech-loading firearm, but it used pinfire cartridges, not rimfire. Formerly, an employee of the [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company]], [[Rollin White]], had been the first in America to conceive the idea of having the revolver cylinder bored through to accept metallic cartridges ([[circa]] 1852), with the first in the world to use bored-through cylinders probably having been Lefaucheux in 1845, who invented a pepperbox-revolver loaded from the rear using bored-through cylinders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DjWpnQEACAAJ&dq=Early+Percussion+Firearms|title=Early Percussion Firearms|publisher=Spring Books |date=2015-10-25}}</ref> Another possible claimant for the bored-through cylinder is a Frenchman by the name of Perrin, who allegedly produced in 1839 a revolver with a bored-through cylinder to order.

White left Colt, went to Smith & Wesson to rent a licence for his patent, and this is how the S&W Model 1 saw light of day in 1857. The patent didn't definitely expire until 1870, allowing Smith & Wesson competitors to design and commercialise their own revolving breech-loaders using metallic cartridges. Famous models of that time are the Colts [[Colt Model 1871-72 Open Top|Open Top]] (1871-1872) and [[Colt Single Action Army|Single Action Army \"Peacemaker\"]] (1873). But in rifles, the [[lever-action]] mechanism patents were not obstructed by Rollin White's [[patent infringement]] because White only held a patent concerning drilled cylinders and revolving mechanisms. Thus, larger caliber rimfire cartridges were soon introduced after 1857, when the Smith & Wesson .22 Short ammunition was introduced for the first time. Some of these rifle cartridges were used in the American Civil War, including the [[.44 Henry]] and [[56-56 Spencer]] (both in 1860). However, the large rimfire cartridges were soon replaced by [[centerfire]] cartridges, which could safely handle higher pressures.<ref>[[Cartridges of the World]], various editions and articles.</ref><ref name=\"Williamson\">{{citation|first=Harold F. |last=Williamson |title=Winchester: The Gun that Won the West |date=1952 |publisher=A.

Barnes |isbn=978-0498083150 <!--1961 is second printing not second edition --> |page=66 |quote=The rimfire cartridge, which was used so successfully in the Henry and the Model 66, was limited to relatively weak loads of powder and comparatively lightweight bullets.  These limitations, which still apply, came from the construction of the rimfire cartridge and from the action of the priming mixture.  Rimfire cartridges must be made of thin metal or the firing pin cannot indent the head and explode the primer.  This thin-walled cartridge case limits the pressure developed by the powder charge and consequently the weight of the bullet.  If too much powder is used, there is a danger that the cartridge case will burst at the folded rim when it is fired, and that the primer flash, passing laterally across the rear of the powder charge, will not ignite a large load sufficiently to consume all of the powder before the bullet leaves the cartridge case. These limitations were overcome with the development of the centerfire cartridge....}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867 the British war office adopted the [[Eley Brothers|Eley]]-[[Edward Mounier Boxer|Boxer]] metallic centerfire cartridge case in the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]] rifles, which were converted to [[Snider-Enfield|Snider-Enfield breech-loaders]] on the Snider principle. This consisted of a block opening on a hinge, thus forming a false breech against which the cartridge rested. The priming cap was in the base of the cartridge and was discharged by a [[Firing pin#Firing pin vs. striker|striker]] passing through the breech block. Other European powers adopted breech-loading military rifles from 1866 to 1868, with paper instead of metallic cartridge cases. The original Eley-Boxer cartridge case was made of thin-coiled brass\u2014occasionally these cartridges could break apart and jam the breech with the unwound remains of the case upon firing. Later the solid-drawn, centerfire cartridge case, made of one entire solid piece of tough hard metal, an alloy of copper, with a solid head of thicker metal, has been generally substituted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nCenterfire cartridges with solid-drawn metallic cases containing their own means of ignition are almost universally used in all modern varieties of military and sporting rifles and pistols.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAround 1870, machined tolerances had improved to the point that the cartridge case was no longer necessary to seal a firing chamber. Precision-faced bolts would seal as well, and could be economically manufactured.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, normal wear and tear proved this system to be generally infeasible.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name of any given cartridge does not necessarily reflect any cartridge or gun dimension. The name is merely the standardized and accepted moniker. SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute) and the European counterpart (CIP) and members of those organizations specify correct cartridge names. Cartridge names, when correctly presented, never include a naked leading decimal point.\n\nIt is a common misnomer to refer to a cartridge as a certain \"caliber\", (e.g., \"30-06 caliber\"). The correct full name for this cartridge is [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-'06 Springfield]].  The \"-'06\" means it was introduced in 1906. In sporting arms, the only consistent definition of \"caliber\" is bore diameter. Dozens of unique .30-caliber cartridge types exist.\n\nThere is considerable variation in cartridge nomenclature. Names sometimes reflect various characteristics of the cartridge. For example, the .308 Winchester uses a bullet of 308/1000-inch diameter and was standardized by Winchester. Conversely, cartridge names often reflect nothing related to the cartridge in any obvious way. For example, the .218 Bee uses a bullet of 224/1000-inch diameter, fired through a .22-in bore, etc. The 218 and Bee portions of this cartridge name reflect nothing other than the desires of those who standardized that cartridge. Many similar examples exist, for example: .219 Zipper, .221 Fireball, .222 Remington, .256 Winchester, .280 Remington, .307 Winchester, .356 Winchester.\n\nWhere two numbers are used in a cartridge name, the second number may reflect a variety of things. Frequently the first number reflects bore diameter (inches or millimeters). The second number reflects case length (in inches or mm). For example, the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] refers to a bore diameter of 7.62&nbsp;mm and has an overall case length of 51&nbsp;mm, with a total lengt h of 71.1 mm. The commercial version is the [[.308 Winchester]].)\n\nIn older [[black powder]] cartridges, the second number typically refers to powder charge, in [[Grain (unit)|grains]]. For example, the [[.50-90 Sharps]] has a .50-inch bore and used a nominal charge of {{convert|90.0|gr|g}} of black powder.\n\nMany such cartridges were designated by a three-number system (e.g., 45-120-3\u00bc Sharps: 45-caliber bore, 120 grains of (black) powder, 3\u00bc-inch long case). Other times, a similar three-number system indicated bore (caliber), charge (grains), and bullet weight (grains). The 45-70-500 Government is an example.\n\nOften, the name reflects the company or individual who standardized it, such as the [[.30 Newton]], or some characteristic important to that person.\n\nThe [[.38 Special]] actually has a nominal bullet diameter of {{convert|0.3570|in}} (jacketed) or {{convert|0.3580|in}} (lead) while the case has a nominal diameter of {{convert|0.3800|in}},. Hence the name. This is historically logical. The hole drilled through the chambers of .36-caliber cap-and-ball revolvers when converting those to work with cartridges was {{convert|0.3800|in}}, and the cartridge made to work in those revolvers was logically named the [[.38 Short Colt|.38 Colt]]. The original cartridges used a heeled bullet like a .22 rimfire where the bullet was the same diameter as the case. Early Colt Army .38s have a bore diameter that will allow a .357\" diameter bullet to slide through the barrel. The cylinder is bored straight through with no step. Later versions used an inside the case lubricated bullet of .357\" diameter instead of the original .38\" with a reduction in bore diameter. The difference in .38 Special bullet diameter and case diameter reflects the thickness of the case mouth (approximately 11/1000-inch per side). The [[.357 Magnum]] evolved from the .38 Special. The .357 was named to reflect bullet diameter (in thousandths inch), not case diameter. \"Magnum\" was used to indicate its longer case and higher operating pressure.\n\n==Classification==\nCartridges are classified by some major characteristics. One classification is the location of the primer. Early cartridges began with the pinfire, then the rimfire, and finally the centerfire.\n\nAnother classification describes how cartridges are located in the chamber ([[headspace (firearms)|headspace]]). Rimmed cartridges are located with the rim near the cartridge head; the rim is also used to extract the cartridge from the chamber. Examples are the [[.22 long rifle]] and [[.303 British]]. In a rimless cartridge, the cartridge head diameter is about the same as or smaller than the body diameter. The head will have a groove so the cartridge can be extracted from the chamber. Locating the cartridge in the chamber is accomplished by other means. Some rimless cartridges are necked down, and they are positioned by the cartridge's shoulder. An example is the [[.30-06 Springfield]]. Pistol cartridges may be located by the end of the brass case. An example is the [[.45 ACP]]. A [[belted magnum|belted cartridge]] has a larger diameter band of thick metal near the head of the cartridge. An example is the [[.300 Weatherby Magnum]]. An extreme version of the rimless cartridge is the rebated case; guns employing [[Blowback (firearms)#Advanced primer ignition (API) blowback|advanced primer ignition]] need such a case because the case moves during firing (i.e., it is not located at a fixed position). An example is the [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20mm&times;110RB]].\n\n===Centerfire===\n{{Main|Centerfire ammunition}}\n[[File:Centerfire & rimfire ignition.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|Centerfire and rimfire]]\nA centerfire cartridge has a centrally located primer held within a recess in the case head. Most centerfire brass cases used worldwide for sporting ammunition use [[Boxer primer]]s. It is easy to remove and replace Boxer primers using standard reloading tools, facilitating reuse.\n\nSome European- and Asian-manufactured military and sporting ammunition uses [[Berdan primer]]s. Removing the spent primer from (decapping) these cases requires use of a special tool because the primer anvil (on which the primer compound is crushed) is an integral part of the case and the case therefore does not have a central hole through which a decapping tool can push the primer out from the inside, as is done with Boxer primers. In Berdan cases, the flash holes are located to the sides of the anvil. With the right tool and components, reloading Berdan-primed cases is perfectly feasible. However, Berdan primers are not readily available in the U.S.\n\n===Rimfire===\n{{Main|Rimfire ammunition}}\nRimfire priming was a popular solution before centerfire priming was perfected. In a rimfire case, centrifugal force pushes a liquid priming compound into the internal recess of the folded rim as the manufacturer spins the case at a high rate and heats the spinning case to dry the priming compound mixture in place within the hollow cavity formed within the rim fold at the perimeter of the case interior.\n\nIn the mid- to late-1800s, many rimfire cartridge designs existed. Today only a few, mostly for use in small-caliber guns, remain in general and widespread use. These include the .17 Mach II, .17 Hornady Magnum Rimfire (HMR), 5mm Remington Magnum (Rem Mag), .22 (BB, CB, Short, Long, Long Rifle), and .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (WMR).\n\nCompared to modern centerfire cases used in the strongest types of modern guns, existing rimfire cartridge designs use loads that generate relatively low pressure because of limitations of feasible gun design \u2013 the rim has little or no lateral support from the gun. Such support would require very close tolerances in design of the chamber, bolt, and firing pin. Because that is not cost-effective, it is necessary to keep rimfire load pressure low enough so that the stress generated by chamber pressure that would push the case rim outward cannot expand the rim significantly. Also, the wall of the folded rim must be thin and ductile enough to easily deform, as necessary to allow the blow from the firing pin to crush and thereby ignite the primer compound, and it must do so without rupturing, If it is too thick, it will be too resistant to deformation. If it is too hard, it will crack rather than deform. These two limitations \u2013 that the rim is self-supporting laterally and that the rim is thin and ductile enough to easily crush in response to the firing pin impact \u2013 limit rimfire pressures.<ref name=\"Williamson\"/>\n\nModern centerfire cartridges are often loaded to about {{convert|65000|psi|abbr=on}} maximum chamber pressure. Conversely, no commercialized rimfire has ever been loaded above about {{convert|40000|psi|abbr=on}} maximum chamber pressure. However, with careful gun design and production, no fundamental reason exists that higher pressures could not be used. Despite the relative pressure disadvantage, modern rimfire magnums in .17-caliber/4.5mm, .20-caliber/5mm, and .22-caliber/5.6mm can generate muzzle energies comparable to smaller centerfire cartridges.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nToday, [[.22 LR]] (Long Rifle) accounts for the vast majority of all rimfire ammunition used. Standard .22 LR rounds use an essentially pure lead bullet plated with a typical 95% copper, 5% zinc combination. These are offered in [[supersonic]] and subsonic types, as well as target, plinking, and hunting versions. These cartridges are usually coated with a hard wax for fouling control.\n\nThe .22 LR and related rimfire .22 cartridges use a heeled bullet, where external diameter of the case is the same as diameter of the forward portion of the bullet and where the rearward portion of the bullet, which extends into the case, is necessarily smaller in diameter than the main body of the bullet.\n\n==Semi-automatic vs. revolver cartridges==\n\nMost [[revolver]] cartridges have a rim at the base of the case that is larger than the case body is and which seats against or into the cylinder block to provide [[Headspace (firearms)|headspace]] control (to keep the cartridge from moving too far forward in the cylinder chamber) and to provide for easy extraction.\n\nNearly every [[semi-automatic pistol]] cartridge is \"rimless\", or more precisely has a rim of the same diameter as the case body. An extractor engages this rim by entering a cannelure near the base of the case. A few designs, known as \"semi-rimmed\" have a rim that is slightly larger than case body diameter but these function as a rimless design. All such cartridges headspace on the case mouth (although some, such as [[.38 Super]], at one time seated on the rim, this was changed for accuracy reasons), which prevents the round from entering too far into the chamber. Some cartridges have a rim that is significantly smaller than case body diameter. These are known as rebated-rim designs and almost always allow a handgun to fire multiple caliber cartridges with only a barrel and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] change.\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:380 ACP - FMJ - SB - 2.jpg|Rimless [[.380 ACP]] semi-automatic cartridge\nFile:38 Special - FMJ - SB - 2.jpg|Rimmed [[.38 special]] revolver cartridge\n</gallery>\n\n==Bullet design types==\n[[File:7.7 mm Japanese navy.jpg|right|thumb|A cutaway showing a Japanese Navy 7.7 mm rimmed rounds as fired by the Type 92 and Type 97 machine guns\u2014copies of Vickers and Lewis designs.

Slugs are stabilized in flight by [[rifling]] in the barrel, which causes the slug to spin, or are stabilized as a dart is by the weight center of balance being forward of the aerodynamic center of balance, sometimes with assistance from fins. Solid or hollow-point slugs are available but, due to the relatively low velocity, hollow-point slugs often demonstrate relatively low expansion.\n* [[Flexible baton round|Baton round]]: a generally non-lethal projectile fired from a riot gun.\n* [[Armor-piercing shell#Small arms|Armor Piercing]] (AP): A hard bullet made from steel or tungsten alloys in a pointed shape typically covered by a thin layer of lead and or a copper or brass jacket. The lead and jacket are intended to prevent barrel wear from the hard core materials. AP bullets are sometimes less effective on unarmored targets than FMJ bullets are. This has to do with the reduced tendency of AP projectiles to yaw (turn sideways after impact).\n* Flat Nose Lead (FNL): Similar to the above, with a flattened nose. Common in [[Cowboy Action Shooting]] and plinking ammunition loads.\n* [[Full metal jacket bullet|Full Metal Jacket]] (FMJ): Made with a lead core surrounded by a full covering of brass, copper, or mild steel. These usually offer very little deformation or terminal performance expansion, but will occasionally yaw (turn sideways). Despite the name, a FMJ bullet typically has an exposed lead base, which is not visible in an intact cartridge.\n* [[Glaser Safety Slug]]: The Glaser Safety Slug dates back to the early 1970s. The inventor, Colonel Jack Cannon, named it for his friend Armin Glaser. Over the years, these projectiles have evolved from crude, hand-produced examples to mass-production; however, the basic concept has remained the same: copper jackets filled with bird shot and covered by a crimped polymer endcap. Upon impact with flesh, the projectile is supposed to fragment, with the birdshot spreading like a miniature shotgun pattern. The standard \"Blue\" Glaser uses a rather fine birdshot that only gives 5 to 6&nbsp;inches ({{nowrap|130\u2013150 mm}}) of penetration in flesh. The \"Silver\" Glaser adds another 1 to 2&nbsp;inches ({{nowrap|30\u201350 mm}}) of penetration with the use of slightly larger birdshot. Due to reduced penetration in flesh, some have theorized that the Glaser would be ideal where over-penetration of a projectile could be hazardous to bystanders. For instance, the Glaser might be entirely contained within an arm. However, for the same reasons, terminal performance of Glaser bullets can vary dramatically, producing impressive successes and equally spectacular failures depending on the angle at which the target is struck. Glancing hits on hard surfaces will result in fragmentation, reducing the risk of ricochets. However, the Glaser can penetrate barriers such as drywall, plywood, and thin sheet metal if struck nearly head on.\n* Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP): Soon after the invention of the JSP, Woolwich Arsenal in Great Britain experimented with this design even further by forming a hole or cavity in the nose of the bullet while keeping most of the exterior profile intact. These bullets could theoretically deform even faster and expand to a larger diameter than the JSP. In personal defense use, concerns have arisen over whether clothing, especially heavy materials like denim, can clog the cavity of JHP bullets and cause expansion failures.\n* Jacketed Soft Point (JSP): In the late 19th century, the Indian Army at [[Dum-Dum Arsenal]], near Kolkata, developed a variation of the FMJ design where the jacket did not cover the nose of the bullet. The soft lead nose was found to expand in flesh while the remaining jacket still prevented lead fouling in the barrel. The JSP roughly splits the difference between FMJ and JHP. It gives more penetration than JHP but has better terminal ballistic characteristics than the FMJ.\n* Round Nose Lead (RNL): An unjacketed lead bullet. Although largely supplanted by jacketed ammunition, this is still common for older revolver cartridges. Some hunters prefer roundnose ammunition for hunting in brush because they erroneously believe that such a bullet deflects less than sharp-nosed [[spitzer (bullet)|spitzer bullets]], regardless of the fact that this belief has been repeatedly proven not to be true. Refer to American Rifleman magazine.\n* Total Metal Jacket (TMJ): Featured in some Speer cartridges, the TMJ bullet has a lead core completely and seamlessly enclosed in brass, copper or other jacket metal, including the base. According to Speer literature, this prevents hot propellant gases from vaporizing lead from the base of the bullet, reducing lead emissions. [[Sellier & Bellot]] produce a similar version that they call TFMJ, with a separate end cap of jacket material.\n* Wadcutter (WC): Similar to the FNL, but completely cylindrical, in some instances with a slight concavity in the nose. This bullet derives its name from its popularity for target shooting, because the form factor cuts neat holes in paper targets, making scoring easier and more accurate and because it typically cuts a larger hole than a round nose bullet, a hit centered at the same spot can touch the next smaller ring and therefore score higher.\n* Semi Wad Cutter (SWC) identical to the WC with a smaller diameter flap pointed conical or radiused nose added. Has the same advantages for target shooters but is easier to load into the gun and works more reliably in semi-automatic guns. This design is also superior for some hunting applications.\n* Truncated Cone, Round Nose Flat Point, etc. Descriptive of typical modern commercial cast bullet designs.\n\nThe [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1899]] bans the use of expanding projectiles against the military forces of other nations. Some countries accept this as a blanket ban against the use of expanding projectiles against anyone, while others<ref group=\"note\">The US did not sign the complete [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention of 1899]] in any case, but still follows its guidelines in military conflicts.</ref> use JSP and HP against non-military forces such as terrorists and criminals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2013/02/20/why-do-cops-use-hollow-point-bullets |title=San Francisco cops use hollow point bullets |access-date=18 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219023753/http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2013/02/20/why-do-cops-use-hollow-point-bullets |archive-date=19 December 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Common cartridges==\n[[File:Handguncalibercomparison.jpg|right|thumb|A variety of common pistol cartridges.

This cartridge is offered by European rifle makers in both bolt-action rifles and a rimmed version, the 7\u00d765mmR is chambered in double and combination rifles.

The Winchester Model 1895 was also chambered for this cartridge per a contract with the Russian government. It is still in use by the Russian military in the Dragunov and other sniper rifles and some machine guns. The round is colloquially known as the \"7.62 Russian\". This name sometimes causes people to confusion this round with the \"7.62 Soviet\" round, which refers to the 7.62&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;39 cartridge used in the SKS and AK-47 rifles.\n* [[32 ACP|7.65\u00d717mm Browning SR]] (32 ACP): A very small pistol round. However, this was the predominant Police Service Cartridge in Europe until the mid-1970s. The \"SR\" stands for semi-rimmed, meaning the case rim is slightly larger than case body diameter.\n* [[7.92 x 57mm Mauser|8\u00d757mm IS]]: The standard German service rifle cartridge from 1888 to 1945, the 8\u00d757mmIS (aka 8&nbsp;mm Mauser) has seen wide distribution around the globe through commercial, surplus, and military sales, and is still a popular and commonly used hunting round in most of Europe, partly because of the abundance of affordable hunting rifles in this chambering as well as a broad availability of different hunting, target, and military surplus ammunition available.<ref>{{cite book\n | last1 =Hatcher\n | first1 =Julian\n | last2 =Barr\n | first2 =Al\n | last3 =Neuman\n | first3 =Charles L.\n | title =Reloading Information\n | publisher =[[National Rifle Association]]\n | volume =1\n | year =1951\n | location =Washington, DC\n | pages =79\u201384\n }}</ref>\n* [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]]: Invented for the German military at the turn of the 20th century, the wide distribution of the 9\u00d719mm Parabellum cartridge made it the logical choice for the NATO standard pistol and [[Submachine gun]] round.\n* [[9.3\u00d762mm]]: Very common big game hunting round in Scandinavia along with the [[6.5\u00d755mm]], where it is used as a very versatile hunting round on anything from small and medium game with lightweight cast lead bullets to the largest European big game with heavy soft point hunting bullets. The 9.3\u00d762mm is also very popular in the rest of Europe for Big game, especially driven Big game hunts due to its effective stopping power on running game. And, it is the single cartridge smaller than the 375 H&H Magnum that has routinely been allowed for legal hunting of dangerous African species.\n* [[12.7\u00d7108mm]]: The 12.7\u00d7108mm cartridge is a heavy machine gun and anti-materiel rifle cartridge used by the Soviet Union, the former Warsaw Pact, modern Russia, and other countries. It is the approximate Russian equivalent of the NATO .50 BMG (12.7\u00d799mm NATO) cartridge. The differences between the two are the bullet shape, the types of powder used, and that the case of the 12.7\u00d7108mm is 9&nbsp;mm longer and marginally more powerful.\n* [[14.5\u00d7114mm]]: The 14.5\u00d7114&nbsp;mm is a heavy machine gun and anti-materiel rifle cartridge used by the Soviet Union, the former Warsaw Pact, modern Russia, and other countries.

Snake shot is generally used for shooting at snakes, rodents, birds, and other [[Pest (organism)|pests]] at very close range.\n\nThe most common snake shot cartridge is [[.22 Long Rifle]] loaded with #12 shot. From a standard rifle these can produce effective patterns only to a distance of about {{convert|3|m|ft|-1}} - but in a smoothbore shotgun this can extend as far as {{convert|15|m|ft|-1}}.\n\n==Caseless ammunition==\n{{Main|Caseless ammunition}}\n[[File:4.73x33 Caseless-crop.jpg|thumb|left|An example of caseless ammunition. This disassembled round, the 4.73\u00d733mm, is used in the [[Heckler & Koch G11]] rifle.]]\n\nMany governments and companies continue to develop caseless ammunition {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} (where the entire case assembly is either consumed when the round fires or whatever remains is ejected with the bullet). So far, none of these have been successful enough to reach the civilian market and gain commercial success. Even within the military market, use is limited. Around 1848, [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company|Sharps]] introduced a rifle and paper cartridge (containing everything but the primer) system. When new these guns had significant gas leaks at the chamber end, and with use these leaks progressively worsened. This problem plagues caseless cartridge and gun systems to this day.\n\nThe Daisy Heddon VL Single Shot Rifle, which used a caseless round in .22 caliber, was produced by the air gun company, beginning in 1968. Apparently Daisy never considered the gun an actual firearm. In 1969, the ATF ruled it was in fact a firearm, which Daisy was not licensed to produce. Production of the guns and the ammo was discontinued in 1969. They are still available on the secondary market, mainly as collector items, as most owners report that accuracy is not very good.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://everything2.com/title/Daisy+V%252FL |title=Daisy V/L |access-date=3 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005223625/http://everything2.com/title/Daisy+V%252FL |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, [[Heckler & Koch]], a prominent [[Germany|German]] firearms manufacturer, began advertising the [[G11 assault rifle]], which shot a 4.73\u00d733 square caseless round. The round was mechanically fired, with an integral primer.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1993 [[Voere]] of [[Austria]] began selling a gun and caseless ammunition. Their system used a primer, [[electronic firing|electronically fired]] at 17.5 \u00b1 2 [[volt]]s. The upper and lower limits prevent fire from either stray currents or [[static electricity]]. The direct electrical firing eliminates the mechanical delays associated with a striker, reducing [[lock time]] and allowing for easier adjustment of the rifle trigger.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn both instances, the \"case\" was molded directly from solid [[nitrocellulose]], which is itself relatively strong and inert. The bullet and primer were glued into the propellant block.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Trounds==\n[[File:Dardick 1500 with trounds (29432934078).jpg|thumb|Dardick 1500 with trounds]]\n{{Main|Dardick tround}}\n\nThe \"Tround\" (\"Triangular Round\") was a unique type of cartridge designed in 1958 by David Dardick, for use in specially designed Dardick 1100 and Dardick 1500 open-chamber firearms. As their name suggests, Trounds were triangular in cross-section, and were made of plastic or aluminum, with the cartridge completely encasing the powder and projectile. The Tround design was also produced as a cartridge adaptor, to allow conventional [[.38 Special]] and [[22 Long Rifle]] cartridges to be used with the Dardick firearms.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Blank ammunition==\n{{Main|Blank (cartridge)}}\n[[File:Platzpatronen762 9.jpg|thumb|Blank cartridges:{{unordered list\n | [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] (left)\n | [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (right).}}]]\nA blank is a charged cartridge that does not contain a projectile or alternatively uses a non-metallic (for instance, wooden) projectile that pulverizes when hitting a blank firing adapter. To contain the propellant, the opening where the projectile would normally be located is crimped shut and or it is sealed with some material that disperses rapidly upon leaving the barrel.\n\nThis sealing material can still potentially cause harm at extremely close range. Actor [[Jon-Erik Hexum#Death|Jon-Erik Hexum]] died when he shot himself in the head with a blank, and actor [[Brandon Lee]] was famously killed during filming of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' when a blank fired behind a bullet that was stuck in the bore drove that bullet through his abdomen and into his spine. The gun had not been properly deactivated and a primed case with a bullet instead of a dummy had been used previously. Someone pulled the trigger and the primer drove the bullet silently into the bore.\n\nBlanks are used in training, but do not always cause a gun to behave the same as live ammunition does; recoil is always far weaker, and some automatic guns only cycle correctly when the gun is fitted with a [[blank-firing adaptor]] to confine gas pressure within the barrel to operate the gas system.\n\nBlanks can also be used to launch a [[rifle grenade]], although later systems used a \"bullet trap\" design that captures a bullet from a conventional round, speeding deployment. This also negates the risk of mistakenly firing a live bullet into the rifle grenade, causing it to instantly explode instead of propelling it forward.\n\nBlanks are also used as dedicated launchers for propelling a [[grappling hook]], rope line or flare, or for a training lure for training [[gun dog]]s.\n\nThe power loads used in a variety of [[nail gun]]s are essentially rimfire blanks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n==Dummy rounds==\n[[File:Naboj23 mm.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[23\u00d7152mm]] cartridge, drill round]]\n{{Main|Dummy round}}\nDrill rounds are inert versions of cartridges used for education and practice during military training. Other than the lack of propellant and primer, these are the same size as normal cartridges and will fit into the mechanism of a gun in the same way as a live cartridge does. Because dry-firing (releasing the firing pin with an empty chamber) a gun can sometimes lead to firing pin (striker) damage, dummy rounds termed [[snap cap]]s are designed to protect centerfire guns from possible damage during \"dry-fire\" trigger control practices.\n\nTo distinguish drill rounds and snap-caps from live rounds these are marked distinctively. Several forms of markings are used; e.g. setting colored flutes in the case, drilling holes through the case, coloring the bullet or cartridge, or a combination of these. In the case of centerfire drill rounds the primer will often be absent, its mounting hole in the base is left open. Because these are mechanically identical to live rounds, which are intended to be loaded once, fired and then discarded, drill rounds have a tendency to become significantly worn and damaged with repeated passage through [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s and firing mechanisms, and must be frequently inspected to ensure that these are not so degraded as to be unusable\u2014for example the cases can become torn or misshapen and snag on moving parts, or the bullet can become separated and stay in the breech when the case is ejected.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Mek-Porek===\n[[File:Mek-Porek 9x19mm Parabellum from behind.jpg|thumb|upright|9 \u00d7 19 mm Mek-Porek]]\nThe bright-colored Mek-Porek is an inert cartridge base designed to prevent a live round from being unintentionally chambered, to reduce the chances of an accidental discharge from mechanical or operator failure. An L-shaped flag is visible from the outside, so that the shooter and other people concerned are instantly aware about the situation of the weapon. The Mek-Porek is usually tethered to its weapon by a short string, and can be quickly ejected to make way for a live round if the situation suddenly warrants. This safety device is standard-issue in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].<ref>Shoval, Lilach. [http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=15149 \"IDF to issue new safety device to prevent accidental weapon discharge\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104203837/http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=15149 |date=4 January 2016 }}, ''[[Israel Hayom]]'', Tel-Aviv, 31 January 2014. Retrieved on 4 January 2016.</ref>\n\n===Snap cap===\n[[File:Snap caps.jpg|left|thumb|An assortment of snap caps of varying calibers]]\nA [[snap cap]] is a device which is shaped like a standard cartridge but contains no primer, propellant or projectile.  It is used to ensure that [[dry firing]] firearms of certain designs does not cause damage.  A small number of rimfire and centerfire firearms of older design should not be test-fired with the chamber empty, as this can lead to weakening or breakage of the firing pin and increased wear to other components in those firearms. In the instance of a rimfire weapon of primitive design, dry firing can also cause deformation of the chamber edge.  For this reason some shooters use a snap cap in an attempt to cushion the weapon's firing pin as it moves forward.  Some snap caps contain a spring-dampened fake primer, or one made of plastic, or none at all; the springs or plastic absorb force from the firing pin, allowing the user to safely test the function of the [[firearm action]] without damaging its components.\n\nSnap caps and action-proving dummy cartridges also work as a training tool to replace live rounds for loading and unloading drills, as well as training for misfires or other malfunctions, as they function identically to a live \"dud\" round that has not ignited.  Usually one snap-cap is usable for 300 to 400 clicks.  After that, due to the hole at the false primer, the firing pin does not reach it.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ammunition]]\n* [[Ammunition box]]\n* [[Antique guns]]\n* [[Handloading]]\n* [[List of handgun cartridges]]\n* [[List of Magnum pistol cartridges]]\n* [[List of rifle cartridges]]\n* [[Nitrocellulose]]\n* [[Percussion cap]]\n* [[Shotgun shell]]\n* [[Snake shot]]\n* [[Table of handgun and rifle cartridges]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Pistol and rifle cartridges}}\n* [http://www.cartridgecollectors.org/glossary.htm Cartridge Collectors]\n* [http://www.rawles.to/Euro_Box_FAQ.html European Ammunition Box Translations]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cartridge (Firearms)}}\n[[Category:Ammunition]]\n[[Category:Pistol and rifle cartridges| ]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toRimfire(link changed toRimfire ammunition) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)"}

[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\nMost Haredi and Hasidic institutions likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

The trail was known as the [[Great Wagon Road]] by colonial travelers; it went to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and later was renamed Monocacy Road. Early surviving historical records indicate that Monocacy was the oldest settlement in Western Maryland.

The series begins with a visible nuclear detonation of unknown origin in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. Despite initial belief that it was an accident, Dale Turner, one of the characters, receives a phone call from his mother in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The call is then cut out by the sound of a nuclear blast. Upon showing this to others, it is revealed that the bombings were deliberate. Problems are compounded by loss of power and modern communications, effectively isolating Jericho. Later, power is restored to Jericho by what is alluded to as the efforts of the U.S. government but an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from an unknown source disables all electronics.\n\nWhile the first few episodes are about restoring life after the attacks, about halfway through the season some of the citizens meet with citizens of a nearby town, New Bern. At first, relations are established, resulting in a trade of windmills (for power), built in New Bern's factory, for supplies for food from Jericho's farms and salt from its mine (neither of which New Bern could supply on its own). Relations sour as New Bern scapegoats Jericho for its problems and the New Bern [[sheriff]] eventually declares war, leading to the season's climax.\n\nSeveral themes regularly addressed in the show include the gathering of information, community identity, public order, limited resources, the value of family, hardships of fatherhood and internal and external threats. The show also features several mysteries involving the backgrounds of major characters, the perpetrators of the attack and the extent of damage to the United States and its government.\n\nThe pivotal character in this story is [[Jake Green (Jericho)|Jake Green]], the 32-year-old son of Mayor [[Johnston Green]]. Jake had fled the town of Jericho five years earlier, when he became mixed up with the wrong people and was involved in questionable activity. He briefly returns home to claim his inheritance, before being stranded by the catastrophe. After a somewhat awkward return home and a tense reunion with his father, Jake steps up to become a leader in Jericho, fighting to protect the town and its citizens. As the people of Jericho struggle to survive in a changed world, most remain unaware that one of the newest residents, [[Robert Hawkins (Jericho character)|Robert Hawkins]], knows a lot more about the attacks than he is letting on. It is later revealed that he is in possession of an unexploded nuclear bomb that was supposed to be used in the attack but how he obtained it and what side he is on remain anything but clear.\n\nGrey Anderson encounters a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) camp outside of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], where he learns that the attack on [[New York City]] was foiled by alert [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] who shot the bomber before he could detonate the nuclear bomb that he had in the back of a van. Mayor Green reports that the NYPD captured the van in New York with a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb on board but [[Washington, D.C.]] has been bombed. On the way back from the FEMA camp, Anderson's car is stolen by 12 looters and he is forced to walk home to Jericho. Anderson also reports that Lawrence, Kansas has been attacked. Robert Hawkins receives a morse code message on a ham radio stating that Denver, Atlanta, [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Diego]] and several more cities not shown on screen have been attacked. A black box flight data recorder that Jake recovers from a crashed airliner indicates that [[air traffic control]] is non-existent, a mushroom cloud is rising {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere and that flashes have also been seen towards [[Texas]].\n\nA radiation-burn victim walks into Jericho from Denver, leading a rescue party to Bear Lake but the 20 radiation-burn victims there are dead. Before the unnamed radiation-burn victim dies, while he is interrogated by Hawkins, it is revealed that he is an accomplice of Hawkins and that there is a traitor in the attack. In the season one finale, armed residents of New Bern attack Jericho with crude [[Mortar_(weapon)|mortars]] made at the factories in New Bern. The mortar bombardment injure people in Jericho. Jake and Johnston Green along with Robert Hawkins lead a counter-attack on New Bern's forces outside of town, killing many of the attackers; Johnston Green is mortally wounded. Army units arrive to separate the combatants just as the season ends.\n\n===Second season===\n[[File:Allied States of America flag (Jericho).svg|thumb|Flag of the Allied States of America]]\nThe military forces of the new Allied States of America (ASA), which now govern most of what was formerly the [[Western United States]], except the independent Republic of [[Texas]], have restored order to Jericho and its hinterland, putting an abrupt end to the conflict between Jericho and its rival town, New Bern. As a sense of normality returns to Jericho, the plot shifts away from day-to-day survival to life and political intrigue under the ASA government.\n\nThe garrison commander of the ASA Army's newly established post in Jericho, Major Edward Beck, asks Jake to accept appointment as the Sheriff of Jericho and the county. Jake reluctantly accepts the appointment with reservations about the ASA government's intentions.\n\nKnown only to Hawkins and a select few, the September attacks were neither a foreign nor domestic terrorist act but a conspiracy of unknown perpetrators within the highest level of the former U.S. government, including the president and the secretary of defense of the new ASA government in Cheyenne. Hawkins must calculate his every move to avoid capture, piece together the trail of evidence and bring the truth to light, before the conspiracy's mastermind buries it forever.\n\nJericho's residents deal with the reality of the new ASA government based in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Welcomed as saviors, the government's military and mercenary agents transform life in Jericho into a repressive [[police state]], led by a [[Private military company|private security]] contracting firm, Ravenwood, owned by Jennings & Rall, which has major ties to and sponsors the leaders of the ASA government. When a Ravenwood contractor kills Bonnie, a deaf farm girl from the outskirts of Jericho, to conceal his embezzlement, the town is put on the edge of revolt as Jake and the deputies protect Mimi, the only witness to Bonnie's murder and the embezzlement.\n\nJake can no longer tolerate the methods of Ravenwood and the ASA government in Jericho and leads an underground movement to remove them from power in the town. He is arrested by Major Beck and interrogated. Jake refuses to break and escapes with the help of his mother and other town residents. The citizens of the town rebel against the local ASA soldiers. All of this causes Major Beck, a decorated former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, to question his duty to a government that would treat its citizens the way the new ASA government is doing. He orders his men to stand down and return to their garrison.\n\nHawkins tries to transport the bomb to his contacts in the reborn [[Republic of Texas]]. The ASA military is tipped off and after a brief chase, seizes the weapon. Hawkins narrowly escapes and the ASA military then transports the weapon to Cheyenne for safekeeping.\n\nHawkins makes contact with Jake and the two travel to Cheyenne, where they retake the bomb from J&R contractors. Hawkins is wounded in a brief gun battle. The two make it to the Republic of Texas embassy in Cheyenne with the only undetonated bomb (in ASA territory) from the September attacks. The ASA's military is right behind them. The Republic of Texas is considered the [[swing state]] in the struggle for power between the [[Eastern United States]], which is led by the legitimate surviving United States government, now governed from [[Columbus, Ohio]] and the Allied States. Texas has not decided which government to back. The Texan ambassador in Cheyenne shelters Jake and Hawkins at his embassy. He informs his military forces at the embassy to tell the ASA forces outside the fence that any incursion into the embassy by ASA troops will be considered an act of war against the Republic of Texas. The ambassador manages to quickly smuggle Jake, Hawkins and the bomb to the Cheyenne airport. At the airport he secures a small diplomatic jet plane to carry Jake, Hawkins and the device to Texas. While they are ''en route'', two ASA [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters intercept Jake and Hawkins and order them to turn around or be shot down. When Jake refuses to be escorted back to Cheyenne, the two jets drop back to open fire. Suddenly, two Republic of Texas [[United States Air National Guard|Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters appear and shoot down the ASA planes. Jake and Hawkins make it to Texas with the evidence and Hawkins ominously intones that a [[second American Civil War]] was always coming and the two of them have made history by giving the United States a fighting chance in the war to come.\n\n===Third season===\n{{main|Jericho Season 3: Civil War}}\n{{Missing information |section |the plot |date=April 2020}}\nSeason 3 is not a television show, but a six-part comic book series \"from the minds\" of the original ''Jericho'' production team and written by the ''Jericho'' writing team.\n\nIn April 2013, ''Jericho'' creator Stephen Chbosky revealed during a chat with Nerdacy that talks about a live-action season 3 remain ongoing. In his statement, Chbosky noted, \"you know [[William Morris Endeavor]] Agency, who represents me, executive producer Jon Turteltaub and many other people, and they've been talking to [[Netflix]] and you never know. I can't say what it will be in season 3, but I'm excited for the new developments.\"<ref name=\"JerichoSeason3\">{{cite web|last1=Roco|title=ERICHO Netflix Season 3 Update \u2014 Could Series Mount A Nuts Return?|url=http://seriable.com/jericho-netflix-season-3-update-could-series-mount-a-nuts-return/|website=Seriable|publisher=Seriable.com|accessdate=15 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520110343/http://seriable.com/jericho-netflix-season-3-update-could-series-mount-a-nuts-return/|archivedate=20 May 2015|date=15 February 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2017, Skeet Ulrich gave a reason why the show didn't move to Netflix: \"We were close [to a third season] about four or five years ago.

Are you in?\" I said, \"Absolutely, with one proviso: That first script back has to time-jump five years, and the world has devolved way lower than we could ever have imagined.\" And they were on board with it.

It is approximately 47 miles east of the Kansas/Colorado border (which would put it near the location of the real [[Colby, Kansas]]). However, a map (episode 3: Jericho is Ness City, Kansas on the map) in the series seems to show Jericho near the junctions of [[Interstate 70|I-70]] and [[U.S. Route 83|US 83]].  That would place it near the real [[Oakley, Kansas|Oakley]]. Jericho is 90 miles west of the also fictional Rogue River, Kansas, and around 330 miles from the real [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]. New Bern, Kansas is a neighboring fictional town which starts a war with Jericho in the wake of the national destruction. Jericho is served by one state highway and the (fictional) Cedar Run Road.\n\nThe city's population is mentioned to be almost 5,000 as mentioned in season 1 Ep. 2 \"Fallout\" (1,000 in 1957). But after the great war between New Bern and Jericho, the population was reduced to 3,000. The city has one grocery store, owned by Gracie Leigh ([[Beth Grant]]).\n\nJericho is run by two mayors throughout the series. Johnston Green ([[Gerald McRaney]]) was the mayor at the show opening and for most of season one, but loses the election in the show. Gray Anderson ([[Michael Gaston]]), the other electoral candidate, wins the election in the show.\n\n==Production==\n===Early development===\nThe series originated as a feature film idea of co-creators [[Jonathan E. Steinberg|Jonathan Steinberg]] and Josh Schaer: a [[post-apocalyptic]] plot set amidst the trappings of \"a little character drama\" movie, in the vein of ''[[The Day After]]'', ''[[Threads (film)|Threads]]'', and ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. However, they soon realized that a two- or two-and-a-half-hour-long film would still not carry the necessary length they felt such a concept required to properly explore the setting and the characters. Thus, Schaer and Steinberg decided to re-conceive the entire project as a television series, producing a treatment out of the original feature screenplay. Director Jon Turteltaub and producer [[Carol Barbee]] then entered the picture, the pair having pitched the project to them. Turteltaub soon commissioned writer Stephen Chbosky to pen the pilot teleplay based upon Schaer and Steinberg's series treatment.\n\nOne of Chbosky's major contributions to the structure of the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, \"[We] could use some girls, a little kissing, and some laughs.\" Another significant developmental influence were the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the sense of \"[being] a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it.\" Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the \"best of people,\" and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the \"worst of people,\" and sought to include both in the fabric of ''Jericho'', with Katrina providing \"lots of inspiration\" for the show's overall premise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html|title=Paley Fest - Jericho |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070307/http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 December 2007 |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n[[File:Brad Beyer on Set.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Brad Beyer]], who plays [[Stanley Richmond]], on the set of ''Jericho'']]\n''Jericho'' is set in northwestern Kansas, but the series was filmed in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\">{{cite web|url= https://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=16239|title=A Visit to the Town of Jericho|publisher=Coming Soon Media|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php|title=Insiders' Commentary: Pilot Episode#2|publisher=CBS|accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608165720/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> The pilot and all episodes involving New Bern, Kansas, were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fillmoregazette.com/node/701|publisher=The Fillmore Gazette|date=March 8, 2007|title=Jericho in Fillmore this week}}</ref> Filming also occurred in [[Pasadena, California]], including in front of the city hall.

The television program gave the web address for the online companion. ''Beyond Jericho'' was to feature the \"other survivors\" of the nuclear attacks. According to Barbee, the story was intended to be unique to the site, but as the season of ''Jericho'' progressed, the online story would dovetail into the episodes themselves. However, the site and \"webisode\" are now unavailable, having been removed from the CBS website before the second episode of the TV show was broadcast.\n\nCBS since decided to scrap the current webisode storyline, and instead released a new series of \"prequel\" webisodes named ''Countdown'' that take place before the first explosion. Each of these new webisodes appeared concurrently with the broadcast of new episodes during season 1, and showed Robert Hawkins gathering information before the attack.\n\n===''Beyond Jericho''===\n{{Main|Beyond Jericho}}\nThe first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently actually the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble, as the vignette ends.\n\n===''Countdown''===\nStarting on October 26, ''Beyond Jericho'' was replaced by ''Countdown'', which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs before he moved to Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|title= Jericho on CBS - Countdown|access-date= 2006-10-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061102023830/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|archive-date= 2006-11-02|url-status= dead}}</ref> The webisodes do not feature any of the regular characters, and consist primarily of Hawkins, draped in shadows, watching mini-[[Documentary film|documentaries]].\n\nThe mini-documentaries feature expert interviews about the effects of a nuclear attack. They are only minimally connected to each episode's plot. For instance, CBS' 8-episode plot summary reads: \"A shadowy military unit bursts into the chamber Hawkins has just vacated. On his computer, they find a video.\" The video was a short documentary about FEMA's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and their use of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. The \"shadowy military unit\" then patiently waits until the documentary ends to resume its search for Hawkins.\n\n''Countdown'''s sponsor, [[AT&T]], is heavily promoted in the series using [[product placement]]. Nearly all dialog takes place as [[SMS]] messages on an AT&T cellular phone, and a full-screen AT&T logo appears in every episode when Hawkins views the expert interviews. This web-based programming is not accessible from outside of the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''JenningsandRall.com''===\nCreated for the Tom Tooman game, JenningsandRall.com is the purported website of Jennings & Rall, the corporate giant which plays an increasingly prominent role in the second season of the series.

The show was produced by [[CBS Paramount Network Television]] and Junction Entertainment, with executive producers [[Jon Turteltaub]], [[Stephen Chbosky]], and [[Carol Barbee]]. It was shown in more than 30 countries.\n\n''Jericho'' ran on [[CBS]] from September 20, 2006, to March 25, 2008. It was cancelled after its first full season, because of poor ratings.

The series begins with a visible nuclear detonation of unknown origin in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. Despite initial belief that it was an accident, Dale Turner, one of the characters, receives a phone call from his mother in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The call is then cut out by the sound of a nuclear blast. Upon showing this to others, it is revealed that the bombings were deliberate. Problems are compounded by loss of power and modern communications, effectively isolating Jericho. Later, power is restored to Jericho by what is alluded to as the efforts of the U.S. government but an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from an unknown source disables all electronics.\n\nWhile the first few episodes are about restoring life after the attacks, about halfway through the season some of the citizens meet with citizens of a nearby town, New Bern. At first, relations are established, resulting in a trade of windmills (for power), built in New Bern's factory, for supplies for food from Jericho's farms and salt from its mine (neither of which New Bern could supply on its own). Relations sour as New Bern scapegoats Jericho for its problems and the New Bern [[sheriff]] eventually declares war, leading to the season's climax.\n\nSeveral themes regularly addressed in the show include the gathering of information, community identity, public order, limited resources, the value of family, hardships of fatherhood and internal and external threats. The show also features several mysteries involving the backgrounds of major characters, the perpetrators of the attack and the extent of damage to the United States and its government.\n\nThe pivotal character in this story is [[Jake Green (Jericho)|Jake Green]], the 32-year-old son of Mayor [[Johnston Green]]. Jake had fled the town of Jericho five years earlier, when he became mixed up with the wrong people and was involved in questionable activity. He briefly returns home to claim his inheritance, before being stranded by the catastrophe. After a somewhat awkward return home and a tense reunion with his father, Jake steps up to become a leader in Jericho, fighting to protect the town and its citizens. As the people of Jericho struggle to survive in a changed world, most remain unaware that one of the newest residents, [[Robert Hawkins (Jericho character)|Robert Hawkins]], knows a lot more about the attacks than he is letting on. It is later revealed that he is in possession of an unexploded nuclear bomb that was supposed to be used in the attack but how he obtained it and what side he is on remain anything but clear.\n\nGrey Anderson encounters a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) camp outside of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], where he learns that the attack on [[New York City]] was foiled by alert [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] who shot the bomber before he could detonate the nuclear bomb that he had in the back of a van. Mayor Green reports that the NYPD captured the van in New York with a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb on board but [[Washington, D.C.]] has been bombed. On the way back from the FEMA camp, Anderson's car is stolen by 12 looters and he is forced to walk home to Jericho. Anderson also reports that Lawrence, Kansas has been attacked. Robert Hawkins receives a morse code message on a ham radio stating that Denver, Atlanta, [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Diego]] and several more cities not shown on screen have been attacked. A black box flight data recorder that Jake recovers from a crashed airliner indicates that [[air traffic control]] is non-existent, a mushroom cloud is rising {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere and that flashes have also been seen towards [[Texas]].\n\nA radiation-burn victim walks into Jericho from Denver, leading a rescue party to Bear Lake but the 20 radiation-burn victims there are dead. Before the unnamed radiation-burn victim dies, while he is interrogated by Hawkins, it is revealed that he is an accomplice of Hawkins and that there is a traitor in the attack. In the season one finale, armed residents of New Bern attack Jericho with crude [[Mortar_(weapon)|mortars]] made at the factories in New Bern. The mortar bombardment injure people in Jericho. Jake and Johnston Green along with Robert Hawkins lead a counter-attack on New Bern's forces outside of town, killing many of the attackers; Johnston Green is mortally wounded. Army units arrive to separate the combatants just as the season ends.\n\n===Second season===\n[[File:Allied States of America flag (Jericho).svg|thumb|Flag of the Allied States of America]]\nThe military forces of the new Allied States of America (ASA), which now govern most of what was formerly the [[Western United States]], except the independent Republic of [[Texas]], have restored order to Jericho and its hinterland, putting an abrupt end to the conflict between Jericho and its rival town, New Bern. As a sense of normality returns to Jericho, the plot shifts away from day-to-day survival to life and political intrigue under the ASA government.\n\nThe garrison commander of the ASA Army's newly established post in Jericho, Major Edward Beck, asks Jake to accept appointment as the Sheriff of Jericho and the county. Jake reluctantly accepts the appointment with reservations about the ASA government's intentions.\n\nKnown only to Hawkins and a select few, the September attacks were neither a foreign nor domestic terrorist act but a conspiracy of unknown perpetrators within the highest level of the former U.S. government, including the president and the secretary of defense of the new ASA government in Cheyenne. Hawkins must calculate his every move to avoid capture, piece together the trail of evidence and bring the truth to light, before the conspiracy's mastermind buries it forever.\n\nJericho's residents deal with the reality of the new ASA government based in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Welcomed as saviors, the government's military and mercenary agents transform life in Jericho into a repressive [[police state]], led by a [[Private military company|private security]] contracting firm, Ravenwood, owned by Jennings & Rall, which has major ties to and sponsors the leaders of the ASA government. When a Ravenwood contractor kills Bonnie, a deaf farm girl from the outskirts of Jericho, to conceal his embezzlement, the town is put on the edge of revolt as Jake and the deputies protect Mimi, the only witness to Bonnie's murder and the embezzlement.\n\nJake can no longer tolerate the methods of Ravenwood and the ASA government in Jericho and leads an underground movement to remove them from power in the town. He is arrested by Major Beck and interrogated. Jake refuses to break and escapes with the help of his mother and other town residents. The citizens of the town rebel against the local ASA soldiers. All of this causes Major Beck, a decorated former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, to question his duty to a government that would treat its citizens the way the new ASA government is doing. He orders his men to stand down and return to their garrison.\n\nHawkins tries to transport the bomb to his contacts in the reborn [[Republic of Texas]]. The ASA military is tipped off and after a brief chase, seizes the weapon. Hawkins narrowly escapes and the ASA military then transports the weapon to Cheyenne for safekeeping.\n\nHawkins makes contact with Jake and the two travel to Cheyenne, where they retake the bomb from J&R contractors. Hawkins is wounded in a brief gun battle. The two make it to the Republic of Texas embassy in Cheyenne with the only undetonated bomb (in ASA territory) from the September attacks. The ASA's military is right behind them. The Republic of Texas is considered the [[swing state]] in the struggle for power between the [[Eastern United States]], which is led by the legitimate surviving United States government, now governed from [[Columbus, Ohio]] and the Allied States. Texas has not decided which government to back. The Texan ambassador in Cheyenne shelters Jake and Hawkins at his embassy. He informs his military forces at the embassy to tell the ASA forces outside the fence that any incursion into the embassy by ASA troops will be considered an act of war against the Republic of Texas. The ambassador manages to quickly smuggle Jake, Hawkins and the bomb to the Cheyenne airport. At the airport he secures a small diplomatic jet plane to carry Jake, Hawkins and the device to Texas. While they are ''en route'', two ASA [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters intercept Jake and Hawkins and order them to turn around or be shot down. When Jake refuses to be escorted back to Cheyenne, the two jets drop back to open fire. Suddenly, two Republic of Texas [[United States Air National Guard|Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters appear and shoot down the ASA planes. Jake and Hawkins make it to Texas with the evidence and Hawkins ominously intones that a [[second American Civil War]] was always coming and the two of them have made history by giving the United States a fighting chance in the war to come.\n\n===Third season===\n{{main|Jericho Season 3: Civil War}}\n{{Missing information |section |the plot |date=April 2020}}\nSeason 3 is not a television show, but a six-part comic book series \"from the minds\" of the original ''Jericho'' production team and written by the ''Jericho'' writing team.\n\nIn April 2013, ''Jericho'' creator Stephen Chbosky revealed during a chat with Nerdacy that talks about a live-action season 3 remain ongoing. In his statement, Chbosky noted, \"you know [[William Morris Endeavor]] Agency, who represents me, executive producer Jon Turteltaub and many other people, and they've been talking to [[Netflix]] and you never know.

It is approximately 47 miles east of the Kansas/Colorado border (which would put it near the location of the real [[Colby, Kansas]]). However, a map (episode 3: Jericho is Ness City, Kansas on the map) in the series seems to show Jericho near the junctions of [[Interstate 70|I-70]] and [[U.S. Route 83|US 83]].  That would place it near the real [[Oakley, Kansas|Oakley]]. Jericho is 90 miles west of the also fictional Rogue River, Kansas, and around 330 miles from the real [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]. New Bern, Kansas is a neighboring fictional town which starts a war with Jericho in the wake of the national destruction. Jericho is served by one state highway and the (fictional) Cedar Run Road.\n\nThe city's population is mentioned to be almost 5,000 as mentioned in season 1 Ep. 2 \"Fallout\" (1,000 in 1957). But after the great war between New Bern and Jericho, the population was reduced to 3,000. The city has one grocery store, owned by Gracie Leigh ([[Beth Grant]]).\n\nJericho is run by two mayors throughout the series. Johnston Green ([[Gerald McRaney]]) was the mayor at the show opening and for most of season one, but loses the election in the show. Gray Anderson ([[Michael Gaston]]), the other electoral candidate, wins the election in the show.\n\n==Production==\n===Early development===\nThe series originated as a feature film idea of co-creators [[Jonathan E. Steinberg|Jonathan Steinberg]] and Josh Schaer: a [[post-apocalyptic]] plot set amidst the trappings of \"a little character drama\" movie, in the vein of ''[[The Day After]]'', ''[[Threads (film)|Threads]]'', and ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. However, they soon realized that a two- or two-and-a-half-hour-long film would still not carry the necessary length they felt such a concept required to properly explore the setting and the characters. Thus, Schaer and Steinberg decided to re-conceive the entire project as a television series, producing a treatment out of the original feature screenplay. Director Jon Turteltaub and producer [[Carol Barbee]] then entered the picture, the pair having pitched the project to them. Turteltaub soon commissioned writer Stephen Chbosky to pen the pilot teleplay based upon Schaer and Steinberg's series treatment.\n\nOne of Chbosky's major contributions to the structure of the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, \"[We] could use some girls, a little kissing, and some laughs.\" Another significant developmental influence were the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the sense of \"[being] a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it.\" Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the \"best of people,\" and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the \"worst of people,\" and sought to include both in the fabric of ''Jericho'', with Katrina providing \"lots of inspiration\" for the show's overall premise.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html|title=Paley Fest - Jericho|accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n[[File:Brad Beyer on Set.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Brad Beyer]], who plays [[Stanley Richmond]], on the set of ''Jericho'']]\n''Jericho'' is set in northwestern Kansas, but the series was filmed in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\">{{cite web|url= https://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=16239|title=A Visit to the Town of Jericho|publisher=Coming Soon Media|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php|title=Insiders' Commentary: Pilot Episode#2|publisher=CBS|accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608165720/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> The pilot and all episodes involving New Bern, Kansas, were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fillmoregazette.com/node/701|publisher=The Fillmore Gazette|date=March 8, 2007|title=Jericho in Fillmore this week}}</ref> Filming also occurred in [[Pasadena, California]], including in front of the city hall.

The messages vary from generic references to cryptic clues, and are always related to the current episode in some way. The messages were broadcast at 15 [[words per minute]] at a [[frequency]] of 1000&nbsp;Hz. In addition to these messages, there is Morse code over the DVD menus. These messages say \"Jericho Fans Made TV History.\" (Season 1) and \"Thank You Fans For Making TV History\" (Season 2).

The television program gave the web address for the online companion. ''Beyond Jericho'' was to feature the \"other survivors\" of the nuclear attacks. According to Barbee, the story was intended to be unique to the site, but as the season of ''Jericho'' progressed, the online story would dovetail into the episodes themselves. However, the site and \"webisode\" are now unavailable, having been removed from the CBS website before the second episode of the TV show was broadcast.\n\nCBS since decided to scrap the current webisode storyline, and instead released a new series of \"prequel\" webisodes named ''Countdown'' that take place before the first explosion. Each of these new webisodes appeared concurrently with the broadcast of new episodes during season 1, and showed Robert Hawkins gathering information before the attack.\n\n===''Beyond Jericho''===\n{{Main|Beyond Jericho}}\nThe first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently actually the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble, as the vignette ends.\n\n===''Countdown''===\nStarting on October 26, ''Beyond Jericho'' was replaced by ''Countdown'', which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs before he moved to Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|title= Jericho on CBS - Countdown|access-date= 2006-10-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061102023830/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|archive-date= 2006-11-02|url-status= dead}}</ref> The webisodes do not feature any of the regular characters, and consist primarily of Hawkins, draped in shadows, watching mini-[[Documentary film|documentaries]].\n\nThe mini-documentaries feature expert interviews about the effects of a nuclear attack. They are only minimally connected to each episode's plot. For instance, CBS' 8-episode plot summary reads: \"A shadowy military unit bursts into the chamber Hawkins has just vacated. On his computer, they find a video.\" The video was a short documentary about FEMA's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and their use of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. The \"shadowy military unit\" then patiently waits until the documentary ends to resume its search for Hawkins.\n\n''Countdown'''s sponsor, [[AT&T]], is heavily promoted in the series using [[product placement]]. Nearly all dialog takes place as [[SMS]] messages on an AT&T cellular phone, and a full-screen AT&T logo appears in every episode when Hawkins views the expert interviews. This web-based programming is not accessible from outside of the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''JenningsandRall.com''===\nCreated for the Tom Tooman game, JenningsandRall.com is the purported website of Jennings & Rall, the corporate giant which plays an increasingly prominent role in the second season of the series. The site contains a wealth of information about the company's post-holocaust global operations, with significant hints regarding events in the show.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, the domain name jenningsandrall.com expired.\n\n===''Tom Tooman''===\n''Tom Tooman'' is an [[alternate reality game]] that CBS ran in conjunction with ''Jericho'', beginning in August 2007.
