Class I-III (creeking)\n\n== Europe ==\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nWhitewater rivers in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] are typically low volume and technical. In [[England]] and [[Wales]] rivers are typically less than 20&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s, and some are run with less than 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s (usually these involve skidding the kayak down steep rockslides and small waterfalls). In [[Scotland]] there are also a few bigger volume (up to about 50&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s) rivers. Like many places in Europe, England, Scotland and Wales have been subject to centuries of rivers getting [[Damming|dammed,]] [[weir]]<nowiki/>ed, or diverted in ways that suit agriculture or land development and the natural flow has been altered heavily in many regions; there are many orphan dams or sites intended for grist mills that no longer have any function but obstruct the water,  Some areas of the island Great Britain occupies has enough gradient to create rapids and waterfalls, but unfortunately ages of damming  prevents the full volume of water and snowmelt from reaching the lower reaches: [[Clywedog Reservoir|Clywedog Dam]] holds back approximately 50,0000 megalitres of water alone on the [[River Severn]], and Parliament granted weirs and locks to be placed upon that river multiple times during the 19th century, some of which are still used.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nFAdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT111&lpg=PT111&dq=%22dams%22+on+river+severn#v=onepage&q=%22dams%22%20on%20river%20severn&f=false|title=River Severn: From Source to Sea|date=2016-03-15|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|isbn=9781445649054|last1=Dobrzynski|first1=Jan}}</ref>    Scotland is famous for its rocky north,  but many rivers have been dammed in Scotland over the course of the 20th century to create hydroelectric power, with the trend still continuing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/727503/power-scheme-for-monarch-country/|title=Work to begin on biggest dam in Scotland in years|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nAlmost all runs in England and Wales need recent rain to be at a paddleable level, and many can only be run immediately after heavy rain. In Scotland, some bigger rivers can be run for weeks after rain although as with the rest of the country, most need recent wet weather. The paddling season is year-round but the rivers are more often runnable in winter (the wettest months of the year being December and January). Exceptions to this include rivers which have artificially maintained flows from reservoirs. On these rivers, flow may increase in dry weather as more water is released. The [[Afon Tryweryn]] is one example in Wales.\n\nMost runs offer only a few kilometres of whitewater; often several rivers can be run on a wet day. Some rivers consist of only a single rapid. Only a few rivers (such as the [[River Findhorn|Findhorn]] and [[River Spean|Spean]] in the Scottish Highlands) have more than a days' worth of paddling, and most of this tends to be grade III or less.\n\nThe [[River Dart]] excepted, there is no natural whitewater in the (mainly flat) south and east of England. Here whitewater paddlers often go [[playboating]] at man made [[weir]]s. [[Hurley weir]] on the [[River Thames]] west of London is probably the most popular.{{fact|date=January 2019}} There are several [[artificial whitewater]] courses, where water is pumped or diverted through a concrete channel containing obstacles to create rapids. There is a 28&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s artificial whitewater course on the [[River Trent|Trent]] at [[Holme Pierrepont]] in [[Nottingham]] (at the [[Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre|National Watersports Centre]]), a 5&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s course on the [[River Tees|Tees]] in [[Teesside]], and smaller courses on the Nene at [[Northampton]], and at [[Cardington Artificial Slalom Course|Cardington]].\n\nIn [[England]] Commercial rafting is limited to artificial whitewater courses (where it often provides the majority of the courses' income). Bigger and more reliable rivers can be found in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], in particular the [[River Findhorn]], [[River Orchy]], [[River Spey]], [[River Tay]] and the [[Afon Tryweryn]].\n\nThere are several sites off the west coast of Britain where strong tidal currents channeled between islands create big volume sections of whitewater. These include the Bitches in Pembrokeshire in Wales, and the [[Falls of Lora]] on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nLegal access to whitewater is a big issue in England and Wales. The law is currently unclear, resulting in two schools of thought followed. \n* The first, followed by many anglers and the Anglers Association, states that rivers are almost all private and require access agreements to be set up with the [[riparian|riparian owners]]. This means that the public are only allowed access to a tiny proportion of the available whitewater, and often this is restricted to a few months or even a few days per year. This also limits commercial operations and the activities of clubs. Agreements rarely exist as there is no incentive for the owners of rivers to let anyone else use them.\n* Recently, legal research conducted by Rev Dr Douglas Caffyn,<ref>http://www.caffynonrivers.co.uk/</ref> claims to have identified a public right of access on all navigable rivers in England and Wales in [[Common Law]]. In law, a public right is a higher right than any private right, and so this outweighs the rights of the [[riparian owners]] in a court of law.\n\nIn Scotland, like most of the rest of the world, access to whitewater is legal and has never been illegal. It has been enshrined in law in the recent Scottish [[Land Reform]] act. The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000|Right to Roam]] act in England explicitly excluded rivers. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]] to raise awareness and bring about changes in the law to permit public access to all inland rivers in England and Wales.\n\n\n=== Alps ===\n\nWhitewater rivers in the [[Alps]] are mainly medium volume [[glacier]]-fed rivers with long continuous rapids and few big drops.{{fact|date=January 2019}} The season is short (two or three months in early summer when the snow and glaciers are melting) but the whitewater is reliable in this period. Tourists come from around Europe to kayak and raft\u2013the most common centres are [[Brian\u00e7on]] in the [[French Alps]], the area around [[Landeck]] in [[Austria]], and [[Bovec]] in [[Slovenia]].{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==== Austria ====\n* Enns River, Schladming, Class 3-4\n* Inn River Imst Gorge, Haiming, Class 3\n* Inn River Landeck Gorge, Landeck, Class 4-5\n* [[Saalach River]], [[Lofer]], Class 3-4\n* Salzach River, Zell am See, Class 3-4\n* Sanna River, Landeck, Class 4\n\n==== France ====\n* Dranse River, Morzine, Class 3-4\n* Doron de Bozel River, Bourg St Maurice, Class 4-5\n* Durance River, Embrun, Class 3\n* Guisane River, Briancon, Class 3-4\n* Isere River, Bourg St Maurice, Class 4\n* Ubaye River, Barcelonnette, Class 4-5\n\n==== Italy ====\n* Dora Baltea River, Villeneuve, Class 3-4\n* Noce River, Dimaro, Class 4-5\n* Sesia River, Varallo Sesia, Class 2-4\n\n==== Slovenia ====\n* [[Soca River]], [[Bovec]], Class 3-4\n\n=== France (Corsica) ===\n\nFor a brief three to six week period in March and April snowmelt runoff explodes down the steep gorges creating the ultimate destination for any rafter or kayaker.

One of the most spectacular rivers is Vindelaelven and particularly Trollforsarna III-VI, where one Euro cup competition was held in 2007.\n\nThe main information channel for Swedish white water is [[Forsguiden]],\n\n== North America ==\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nCanada has a varied terrain that supports many kinds of environments, with the majority of whitewater found in three areas: the mountainous Rockies in Alberta, the smaller Eastern forests of Quebec, Ontario, and some of the Maritimes, and the volcanic influenced geology of British Columbia. This creates the conditions necessary for whitewater: gradient, volume, and pressure. Like its neighbor to the south, [[First Nations]] had used the river systems as personal highways and built [[dugout canoes]] to run rapids; later [[French Canadian]] fur trappers used the same technique to collect beaver pelts and form small settlements.\n\nCanadian whitewater rivers are characterized by the dramatic difference between the high water spring run-off and the summer low water volume; the classification of rapids therefore changes from spring to summer. It also is highly subject to the change of seasons, where many places are frozen solid by October and, for example, runs that are ready in late May in the neighboring US Pacific Northwest are still too dangerous to attempt in British Columbia or too cold: the spring run-off of the glaciers has either not finished or the landscape is not fully thawed.    \n\nMost of the land in Canada is not privately owned and likewise neither are the rivers. Many places in which water thunders through the terrain are on land that is either protected or very remote, so knowledge of first aid and the local wildlife is paramount. As with the United States to the South, [[rattlesnakes]], [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[mountain lion]]s, [[wolves]], and two members of the [[lynx]] family are very much active at the height of rafting and kayaking season, and they do use the water as a source of food and sustenance.  On multi day excursions in The Northwest Territories, British Columbia or Alberta it is extremely important to know or learn to coexist with the grizzly bears that live there. Caution should be used whenever camping in bear country.\n\n==== Alberta ====\n\n* [[Bow River]] - Horseshoe Canyon, II - III\n* Carbondale Creek, Southern Alberta\n* Cascade Creek, Western Rockies, III - IV\n* Castle River, Southern Albert\n* [[Elbow River]], Western Rockies, III+ - IV\n* [[Highwood River]], and tributaries, Southern Alberta\n* Kakwa River, Northern Alberta\n* [[Kananaskis River]], Foothills, II - III\n* Mosquito Creek - Western Rockies, II - III\n* Mystia River, Western Rockies, II - III+\n* [[North Saskatchewan River]], Rockies to Plains, II - III\n* [[Oldman River]], Southern Alberta\n* Pipestone River, Western Rockies, III - IV\n* Red Earth Creek, Western Rockies, IV - V\n* [[St. Mary River (Montana-Alberta)]], II - III\n* [[Sheep River]], Western Rockies, III+ - V\n* [[Slave River]], NWT Border, I-VI\n* Smoky River, Northern Alberta\n* Upper Bow - Western Rockies, Willys Rapid Section, III - IV\n* Upper Red Deer River, Alberta foothills, II - III\n* [[Waterton River]], Southern Alberta\n\n==== British Columbia ====\n\n* [[Fraser River]], [[British Columbia]]\n* Alsek, British Columbia - Alaska\n* Ashnola River, Keremeos, IV - IV+ \n* Babine River\n* [[Capilano River]]\n* [[Chehalis River (British Columbia)|Chehalis River]]\n* [[Chilliwack River]]\n* [[Coquitlam River]]\n* [[Mamquam River]]\n* [[Cheakamus River]]\n* Dipper Creek, Squamish Valley, V+\n* [[Kicking Horse River]], III - IV\n* Yoho River, Columbia Valley, IV - V\n* Toby Creek, Columbia Valley, IV - V+\n* Skookumchuck Creek, Columbia Valley, IV\n* Upper Fraiser, Columbia Valley, III - IV\n* Palliser River, Kootney Valley, III\n* Albertson River, Kootney Valley, III - V\n* Kootney River, Kootney Valley\n* [[Thompson River]], Central, III - IV-\n* Stein River, Central, IV - V\n* [[Nahatlatch River]], Central, III - V\n* Clear Water River, Central, III - IV\n* Tatlow Creek, Coastal\n* Ryan Creek, Coastal\n* Soo River, Coastal, IV - V\n* Callahan Creek, Coastal, V\n* Kanu River, Coastal\n* [[Homathko River]], Coastal\n* [[Dean River]], Coastal\n* Stikine River, Coastal, V - VI\n* Englishman River, Island, III - IV\n* Similkameen River, Princeton, II - III\n\n==== Ontario ====\n* [[Niagara River]]  The Canadian side of the river has the largest of the three set of waterfalls that make up [[Niagara Falls]], all rated Class VI.

They are the property of the nation and its people and are overseen by individual state governments and a handful of federal government agencies in [[Washington, DC]] like the [[Department of the Interior]], [[National Park Service]], [[National Forest Service]], and [[Bureau of Land Management]]. Dams may be held on a contract basis with the federal or state government, for example the energy company [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&E]] has dams in the Sierra Nevada range near Sacramento in California and this affects water volume. (Other entities like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in the East have similar arrangements, and the water volume is lower than it should be naturally in the East in many sections of the Appalachians.)  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the operators of the dams themselves usually schedule releases in advance and this information is readily available to the public upon request.\n\nMany whitewater rivers and creeks exist in rather rural or wild conditions when compared to parts of Europe and thus are located in places where animals can bite back or harm visitors, including children and dogs. (Some require a substantial hike through forest, desert, or mountains to reach the put in and cannot be reached by car at all.) In no particular order or regard to specific geography, they would include [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bears]], [[moose]], [[wapiti|bull elk]],  [[porcupines]], [[cougar]]s, [[bobcats]], more than 15 species of [[rattlesnake]]s on both sides of the Mississippi, [[scorpion]]s, [[agkistrodon contortrix|copperheads]], [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|water mocassin]]s and [[coral snakes]]. [[Beavers]] are sometimes extant on rivers but prefer to build in the calmer sections where there are only minor riffles and their dams are easily portaged or surmounted.\n\n==== Rivers of the Eastern United States ====\n\nThere are several places in the East where the water roars, everything from big rivers like the [[Delaware River]] to creeks that dive over large waterfalls, many exceeding {{convert|30|ft|m}}. In fact, there used to be more of them but over time some of these have been dammed or altered; the upper portions of the Mississippi River near St. Paul Minnesota, for example, used to have very large rapids and several waterfalls.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fmr.org/dam-removal|title=Restoring rapids to the Mississippi river gorge|date=2018-04-09|work=Friends of the Mississippi River|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}</ref> The Mississippi, the divide between East and West itself,  used to be a much more wild and turbulent river<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Lower Rapids of the Mississippi|journal = The Journal of Geology|volume = 7|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201322|jstor = 30054830|last1 = Leverett|first1 = Frank|year = 1899|doi = 10.1086/608284}}</ref> with more violent spots in its drainage area past Cairo Illinois with the [[Des Moines Rapids]] and the Sauk Rapids  being either larger than today or undammed. \n\n===== Northeast =====\n\nThe following are some of the rivers in the Northeast that are popular.\n* [[Ashuelot River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class III-IV\n* [[Bearcamp River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class II-IV\n* [[Contoocook River]], [[New Hampshire]], Class III-IV\n* [[Dead River (Kennebec River)|Dead River]], [[Maine]], Class III-V\n* [[Deerfield River]], [[Vermont]] and [[Massachusetts]], Class II-V.

Good for beginners in upper part and a decent river for practice for the more advanced. This river was named for [[James VI and I]] and was one of the first to ever be navigated by British settlers; much farther downriver the water becomes quieter and brackish and leads straight to the spot where the fort of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] was built and the archaeological site still stands. Not far from Richmond, the [[Powhatan]] tribe built their capital, [[Werowocomoco]],  on an island in this river and chose it in part because of its considerable rapids.  \n*[[Linville Gorge]], Western [[North Carolina]] - This runs right through [[Pisgah National Forest]] and has Class V rapids; it is a creek run suitable for kayakers and small canoes but it is too small for rafts. Approximately 17 miles long and not recommended at all for novices as it is one of the most difficult runs in the east. Very steep gorge walls make escape in an accident impossible.

Western rafters also navigate many small, low volume rivers, some with much steeper descents than eastern rivers; however, since the mountains are newer in the west, the hazard from undercut rocks, a problem in the east, is replaced by more frequent log jams precipitated by logging activities near the rivers.\n\nThe big-water rivers usually do not require the precision paddling of smaller rivers, but have larger rapids and longer wilderness trips due to the greater length and water flow of the big rivers. The smaller rivers and creeks boated by most rafters offer many one- or two-day trips with difficulty levels from I to VI.\n\nIn the West, some paddlers start on the American in [[California]] and work their way up to the Rogue and Illinois in [[Oregon]], the Tuolumne (California), the Salmon in [[Idaho]], the Snake, and then the big-water rivers like the Green and Colorado through the Grand Canyon ([[Arizona]]), the Fraser in [[British Columbia]], and many [[Alaska]]n streams.\n\n===== California =====\n{{main|List of California rivers}}\n\nCalifornia has some of the most challenging whitewater runs in the United States as well as several rivers with sections that are safe for families with children who wish to go rafting. Several rivers in California are fed by the snowmelt of the Sierra Nevada mountain range as well as natural springs in high mountainous areas; some rivers flow directly through protected land and foreign visitors should be strongly warned that early spring runs can be very dangerous; the normal classification cranks up much higher turning some runs into death traps for even Olympic level whitewater enthusiasts.  A primary example would be Cherry Creek, a class V-V+ river in normal conditions:  this creek has had a number of fatalities to its name for unwary kayakers because the water cuts through high vertical walls of granite: there is no way out except down the river and certain sections cannot be portaged. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainbuzz.com/forums/f14/fatality-in-upper-cherry-7-2-2016-a-62077.html|title=Fatality in Upper Cherry 7/2/2016 - Mountain Buzz|website=www.mountainbuzz.com|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awetstate.com/CherryCreekU.html|title=Cherry Creek (Upper)|website=www.awetstate.com|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniondemocrat.com/localnews/3789596-151/pro-kayaker-dies-onperilous-stretch-of-upper-cherry|title=Pro kayaker dies on perilous stretch of Upper Cherry Creek|website=The Union Democrat|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> If the water volume gets too high, death is certain.  It is  for this reason most locals will not willingly even try to ride it before June.<!-- Cherry Creek is the most difficult run in the country and a simple Google shows it is ranked at least as one of the hardest rather consistently. It is actually true that people have died on it because they got overconfident, and there are crazies out there for whom the thrill is never enough. It is also true that it is a classic example of why you can't go up there before at least May 30th.  It is already a challenge for advanced kayakers and for people who overestimate their skill it may be a death sentence. Safety first!! I have seen photos of Cherry Bomb Gorge look more like a VII than a VI and people need to be warned not to fool around with this river or its relatives and respect the water's power!!   -->\n\n* [[American River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\">{{Cite book| edition = 3| publisher = Fieldston Co| isbn = 9780961365028| last1 = Cassady| first1 = Jim| last2 = Calhoun| first2 = Fryar| title = California Whitewater: A Guide to the Rivers| location = Berkeley, CA| date = 1995| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/californiawhitew00cass_0}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{Cite book| edition = 1| publisher = North Fork Press| isbn = 9780961365042| last1 = Cassady| first1 = Jim| last2 = Cross| first2 = Bill| last3 = Calhoun| first3 = Fryar| title = Western Whitewater from the Rockies to the Pacific: A River Guide for Raft, Kayak, and Canoe| location = Berkeley, CA| date = 1994}}</ref>\n* [[Carson River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Cosumnes River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Feather River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Kaweah River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Kern River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>-  Cuts through a very deep canyon.

[[Gore Canyon]] is the first difficult section and should not be attempted by novices, Class IV-V, depending on the time of year and rainfall and this part is the upper section in Colorado. The section through the Grand Canyon and [[Grand Canyon National Park]] would include the Hance Rapids and overall the class of the rapids here are I-V, with the overall section being a IV.

In [[England]] and [[Wales]] rivers are typically less than 20&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s, and some are run with less than 1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s (usually these involve skidding the kayak down steep rockslides and small waterfalls). In [[Scotland]] there are also a few bigger volume (up to about 50&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s) rivers. Like many places in Europe, England, Scotland and Wales have been subject to centuries of rivers getting [[Damming|dammed,]] [[weir]]<nowiki/>ed, or diverted in ways that suit agriculture or land development and the natural flow has been altered heavily in many regions; there are many orphan dams or sites intended for grist mills that no longer have any function but obstruct the water,  Some areas of the island Great Britain occupies has enough gradient to create rapids and waterfalls, but unfortunately ages of damming  prevents the full volume of water and snowmelt from reaching the lower reaches: [[Clywedog Reservoir|Clywedog Dam]] holds back approximately 50,0000 megalitres of water alone on the [[River Severn]], and Parliament granted weirs and locks to be placed upon that river multiple times during the 19th century, some of which are still used.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nFAdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT111&lpg=PT111&dq=%22dams%22+on+river+severn#v=onepage&q=%22dams%22%20on%20river%20severn&f=false|title=River Severn: From Source to Sea|date=2016-03-15|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|isbn=9781445649054|last1=Dobrzynski|first1=Jan}}</ref>    Scotland is famous for its rocky north,  but many rivers have been dammed in Scotland over the course of the 20th century to create hydroelectric power, with the trend still continuing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/727503/power-scheme-for-monarch-country/|title=Work to begin on biggest dam in Scotland in years|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nAlmost all runs in England and Wales need recent rain to be at a paddleable level, and many can only be run immediately after heavy rain. In Scotland some bigger rivers can be run for weeks after rain although as with the rest of the country, most need recent wet weather. The paddling season is year-round but the rivers are more often runnable in winter (the wettest months of the year being December and January). Exceptions to this include rivers which have artificially maintained flows from reservoirs. On these rivers flow may increase in dry weather as more water is released. The [[Afon Tryweryn]] is one example in Wales.\n\nMost runs offer only a few kilometres of whitewater; often several rivers can be run on a wet day. Some rivers consist of only a single rapid. Only a few rivers (such as the [[River Findhorn|Findhorn]] and [[River Spean|Spean]] in the Scottish Highlands) have more than a days' worth of paddling, and most of this tends to be grade III or less.\n\nThe [[River Dart]] excepted, there is no natural whitewater in the (mainly flat) south and east of England. Here whitewater paddlers often go [[playboating]] at man made [[weir]]s. [[Hurley weir]] on the [[River Thames]] west of London is probably the most popular.{{fact|date=January 2019}} There are several [[artificial whitewater]] courses, where water is pumped or diverted though a concrete channel containing obstacles to create rapids. There is a 28&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s artificial whitewater course on the [[River Trent|Trent]] at [[Holme Pierrepont]] in [[Nottingham]] (at the [[Holme Pierrepont National Watersports Centre|National Watersports Centre]]), a 5&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s course on the [[River Tees|Tees]] in [[Teesside]], and smaller courses on the Nene at [[Northampton]], and at [[Cardington Artificial Slalom Course|Cardington]].\n\nIn [[England]] Commercial rafting is limited to artificial whitewater courses (where it often provides the majority of the courses' income). Bigger and more reliable rivers can be found in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], in particular the [[River Findhorn]], [[River Orchy]], [[River Spey]], [[River Tay]] and the [[Afon Tryweryn]].\n\nThere are several sites off the west coast of Britain where strong tidal currents channeled between islands create big volume sections of whitewater. These include the Bitches in Pembrokeshire in Wales, and the [[Falls of Lora]] on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nLegal access to whitewater is a big issue in England and Wales. The law is currently unclear, resulting in two schools of thought followed. \n* The first, followed by many anglers and the Anglers Association, states that rivers are almost all private and requires access agreements to be set up with the [[riparian|riparian owners]]. This means that the public are only allowed access to a tiny proportion of the available whitewater, and often this is restricted to a few months or even a few days per year. This also limits commercial operations and the activities of clubs. Agreements rarely exist as there is no incentive for the owners of rivers to let anyone else use them.\n* Recently, legal research conducted by Rev Dr Douglas Caffyn,<ref>http://www.caffynonrivers.co.uk/</ref> claims to have identified a public right of access on all navigable rivers in England and Wales in [[Common Law]]. In law a public right is a higher right than any private right, and so this outweighs the rights of the [[riparian owners]] in a court of law.\n\nIn Scotland, like most of the rest of the world, access to whitewater is legal and has never been illegal. It has been enshrined in law in the recent Scottish [[Land Reform]] act. The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000|Right to Roam]] act in England explicitly excluded rivers. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]] to raise awareness and bring about changes in the law to permit public access to all inland rivers in England and Wales.\n\n\n=== Alps ===\n\nWhitewater rivers in the [[Alps]] are mainly medium volume [[glacier]]-fed rivers with long continuous rapids and few big drops.{{fact|date=January 2019}} The season is short (two or three months in early summer when the snow and glaciers are melting) but the whitewater is reliable in this period.

One of the most spectacular rivers is Vindelaelven and particularly Trollforsarna III-VI, where one Euro cup competition was held in 2007.\n\nThe main information channel for Swedish white water is [[Forsguiden]],\n\n== North America ==\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nCanada has a varied terrain that supports many kinds of environments, with the majority of whitewater found in three areas: the mountainous Rockies in Alberta, the smaller Eastern forests of Quebec, Ontario, and some of the Maritimes, and the volcanic influenced geology of British Columbia. This creates the conditions necessary for whitewater: gradient, volume, and pressure. Like its neighbor to the south, [[First Nations]] had used the river systems as personal highways and built [[dugout canoes]] to run rapids; later [[French Canadian]] fur trappers used the same technique to collect beaver pelts and form small settlements.\n\nCanadian whitewater rivers are characterized by the dramatic difference between the high water spring run-off and the summer low water volume; the classification of rapids therefore changes from spring to summer. It also is highly subject to the change of seasons, where many places are frozen solid by October and, for example, runs that are ready in late May in the neighboring US Pacific Northwest are still too dangerous to attempt in British Columbia or too cold: the spring run-off of the glaciers has either not finished or the landscape is not fully thawed.    \n\nMost of the land in Canada is not privately owned and likewise neither are the rivers. Many places in which water thunders through the terrain are on land that is either protected or very remote, so knowledge of first aid and the local wildlife is paramount. As with the United States to the South, [[rattlesnakes]], [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[mountain lion]]s, [[wolves]], and two members of the [[lynx]] family are very much active at the height of rafting and kayaking season, and they do use the water as a source of food and sustenance.  On multi day excursions in The Northwest Territories, British Columbia or Alberta it is extremely important to know or learn to coexist with the grizzly bears that live there. Caution should be used whenever camping in bear country.\n\n==== Alberta ====\n\n* [[Bow River]] - Horseshoe Canyon, II - III\n* Carbondale Creek, Southern Alberta\n* Cascade Creek, Western Rockies, III - IV\n* Castle River, Southern Albert\n* [[Elbow River]], Western Rockies, III+ - IV\n* [[Highwood River]], and tributaries, Southern Alberta\n* Kakwa River, Northern Alberta\n* [[Kananaskis River]], Foothills, II - III\n* Mosquito Creek - Western Rockies, II - III\n* Mystia River, Western Rockies, II - III+\n* [[North Saskatchewan River]], Rockies to Plains, II - III\n* [[Oldman River]], Southern Alberta\n* Pipestone River, Western Rockies, III - IV\n* Red Earth Creek, Western Rockies, IV - V\n* [[St. Mary River (Montana-Alberta)]], II - III\n* [[Sheep River]], Western Rockies, III+ - V\n* [[Slave River]], NWT Border, I-VI\n* Smoky River, Northern Alberta\n* Upper Bow - Western Rockies, Willys Rapid Section, III - IV\n* Upper Red Deer River, Alberta foothills, II - III\n* [[Waterton River]], Southern Alberta\n\n==== British Columbia ====\n\n* [[Fraser River]], [[British Columbia]]\n* Alsek, British Columbia - Alaska\n* Ashnola River, Keremeos, IV - IV+ \n* Babine River\n* [[Capilano River]]\n* [[Chehalis River (British Columbia)|Chehalis River]]\n* [[Chilliwack River]]\n* [[Coquitlam River]]\n* [[Mamquam River]]\n* [[Cheakamus River]]\n* Dipper Creek, Squamish Valley, V+\n* [[Kicking Horse River]], III - IV\n* Yoho River, Columbia Valley, IV - V\n* Toby Creek, Columbia Valley, IV - V+\n* Skookumchuck Creek, Columbia Valley, IV\n* Upper Fraiser, Columbia Valley, III - IV\n* Palliser River, Kootney Valley, III\n* Albertson River, Kootney Valley, III - V\n* Kootney River, Kootney Valley\n* [[Thompson River]], Central, III - IV-\n* Stein River, Central, IV - V\n* [[Nahatlatch River]], Central, III - V\n* Clear Water River, Central, III - IV\n* Tatlow Creek, Coastal\n* Ryan Creek, Coastal\n* Soo River, Coastal, IV - V\n* Callahan Creek, Coastal, V\n* Kanu River, Coastal\n* [[Homathko River]], Coastal\n* [[Dean River]], Coastal\n* Stikine River, Coastal, V - VI\n* Englishman River, Island, III - IV\n* Similkameen River, Princeton, II - III\n\n==== Ontario ====\n* [[Niagara River]]  The Canadian side of the river has the largest of the three set of waterfalls that make up [[Niagara Falls]], all rated Class VI.

They are the property of the nation and its people and are overseen by individual state governments and a handful of federal government agencies in [[Washington, DC]] like the [[Department of the Interior]], [[National Park Service]], [[National Forest Service]], and [[Bureau of Land Management]]. Dams may be held on a contract basis with the federal or state government, for example the energy company [[Pacific Gas and Electric Company|PG&E]] has dams in the Sierra Nevada range near Sacramento in California and this affects water volume. (Other entities like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in the East have similar arrangements, and the water volume is lower than it should be naturally in the East in many sections of the Appalachians.)  The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and the operators of the dams themselves usually schedule releases in advance and this information is readily available to the public upon request.\n\nMany whitewater rivers and creeks exist in rather rural or wild conditions when compared to parts of Europe and thus are located in places where animals can bite back or harm visitors, including children and dogs. (Some require a substantial hike through forest, desert, or mountains to reach the put in and cannot be reached by car at all.) In no particular order or regard to specific geography, they would include [[grizzly bear]]s, [[American black bear|black bears]], [[moose]], [[wapiti|bull elk]],  [[porcupines]], [[cougar]]s, [[bobcats]], more than 15 species of [[rattlesnake]]s on both sides of the Mississippi, [[scorpion]]s, [[agkistrodon contortrix|copperheads]], [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|water mocassin]]s and [[coral snakes]]. [[Beavers]] are sometimes extant on rivers but prefer to build in the calmer sections where there are only minor riffles and their dams are easily portaged or surmounted.\n\n==== Rivers of the Eastern United States ====\n\nThere are several places in the East where the water roars, everything from big rivers like the [[Delaware River]] to creeks that dive over large waterfalls, many exceeding {{convert|30|ft|m}}.

Good for beginners in upper part and a decent river for practice for the more advanced. This river was named for [[James VI and I]] and was one of the first to ever be navigated by British settlers; much farther downriver the water becomes quieter and brackish and leads straight to the spot where the fort of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] was built and the archaeological site still stands. Not far from Richmond, the [[Powhatan]] tribe built their capital, [[Werowocomoco]],  on an island in this river and chose it in part because of its considerable rapids.  \n*[[Linville Gorge]], Western [[North Carolina]] - This runs right through [[Pisgah National Forest]] and has Class V rapids; it is a creek run suitable for kayakers and small canoes but it is too small for rafts. Approximately 17 miles long and not recommended at all for novices as it is one of the most difficult runs in the east. Very steep gorge walls make escape in an accident impossible. Deaths have occurred for those who overestimate their skills. \n* [[Nantahala River]], [[Bryson City, North Carolina]] - a relatively gentle river, with the final rapid having the propensity to send paddlers in for a cold, exhilarating swim; suitable for beginners and families with younger children.\n* [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]], [[Thurmond, West Virginia]] - Class III-V natural flow river.

Gets its name from ''passiflora incarnata'', the [[maypop]], a very close relative of the commercial [[passionfruit]]  that is a common edible garden plant in the South and was introduced as a source of food to settlers by tribes like the Cherokee. This plant is still found in thickets near the river.\n* [[Pigeon River (Tennessee \u2013 North Carolina)]], [[Tennessee (U.S. state)|Tennessee]] - class III+ rapids, Dam released river with scheduled releases from Memorial Day to Labor Day.

Western rafters also navigate many small, low volume rivers, some with much steeper descents than eastern rivers; however, since the mountains are newer in the west, the hazard from undercut rocks, a problem in the east, is replaced by more frequent log jams precipitated by logging activities near the rivers.\n\nThe big-water rivers usually do not require the precision paddling of smaller rivers, but have larger rapids and longer wilderness trips due to the greater length and water flow of the big rivers. The smaller rivers and creeks boated by most rafters offer many one- or two-day trips with difficulty levels from I to VI.\n\nIn the West, some paddlers start on the American in [[California]] and work their way up to the Rogue and Illinois in [[Oregon]], the Tuolumne (California), the Salmon in [[Idaho]], the Snake, and then the big-water rivers like the Green and Colorado through the Grand Canyon ([[Arizona]]), the Fraser in [[British Columbia]], and many [[Alaska]]n streams.\n\n===== California =====\n{{main|List of California rivers}}\n\nCalifornia has some of the most challenging whitewater runs in the United States as well as several rivers with sections that are safe for families with children who wish to go rafting. Several rivers in California are fed by the snowmelt of the Sierra Nevada mountain range as well as natural springs in high mountainous areas; some rivers flow directly through protected land and foreign visitors should be strongly warned that early spring runs can be very dangerous; the normal classification cranks up much higher turning some runs into death traps for even Olympic level whitewater enthusiasts.  A primary example would be Cherry Creek, a class V-V+ river in normal conditions:  this creek has had a number of fatalities to its name for unwary kayakers because the water cuts through high vertical walls of granite: there is no way out except down the river and certain sections cannot be portaged. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainbuzz.com/forums/f14/fatality-in-upper-cherry-7-2-2016-a-62077.html|title=Fatality in Upper Cherry 7/2/2016 - Mountain Buzz|website=www.mountainbuzz.com|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awetstate.com/CherryCreekU.html|title=Cherry Creek (Upper)|website=www.awetstate.com|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uniondemocrat.com/localnews/3789596-151/pro-kayaker-dies-onperilous-stretch-of-upper-cherry|title=Pro kayaker dies on perilous stretch of Upper Cherry Creek|website=The Union Democrat|language=en|access-date=2019-07-27}}</ref> If the water volume gets too high, death is certain.  It is  for this reason most locals will not willingly even try to ride it before June.<!-- Cherry Creek is the most difficult run in the country and a simple Google shows it is ranked at least as one of the hardest rather consistently. It is actually true that people have died on it because they got overconfident, and there are crazies out there for whom the thrill is never enough. It is also true that it is a classic example of why you can't go up there before at least May 30th.  It is already a challenge for advanced kayakers and for people who overestimate their skill it may be a death sentence. Safety first!! I have seen photos of Cherry Bomb Gorge look more like a VII than a VI and people need to be warned not to fool around with this river or its relatives and respect the water's power!!   -->\n\n* [[American River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\">{{Cite book| edition = 3| publisher = Fieldston Co| isbn = 9780961365028| last1 = Cassady| first1 = Jim| last2 = Calhoun| first2 = Fryar| title = California Whitewater: A Guide to the Rivers| location = Berkeley, CA| date = 1995| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/californiawhitew00cass_0}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{Cite book| edition = 1| publisher = North Fork Press| isbn = 9780961365042| last1 = Cassady| first1 = Jim| last2 = Cross| first2 = Bill| last3 = Calhoun| first3 = Fryar| title = Western Whitewater from the Rockies to the Pacific: A River Guide for Raft, Kayak, and Canoe| location = Berkeley, CA| date = 1994}}</ref>\n* [[Carson River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Cosumnes River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Feather River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Kaweah River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Kern River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>\n* [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]]<ref name=\"CAWW\"/><ref name=\"WW\"/>-  Cuts through a very deep canyon.

[[Cataract Canyon]] is third,  with up to 1,400 m<sup>3</sup>/s volume running through the canyon as this section goes through [[Canyonlands National Park]].  Class III to V.

The Gunnison River drops about 34 feet per mile (10.4 m/1.6 km) in the canyon and thus has a steeper gradient than the portions of the Colorado that are normally rafted or kayaked.

L\u00edvia and Felipe are of distinct social classes: She is a humble, obliged young lady that lives in the city's convent while Felipe is a noble Earl, nephew-grandson of the powerful Countess Vit\u00f3ria. He is about to walk down the aisle with the beautiful Melissa.\nL\u00edvia and Felipe fall passionately in love at first sight. To live this passion seems impossible. Beyond the commitment of the Earl, L\u00edvia discovers that she is granddaughter of a Countess, a greatest enemy to her mother, who provoked her separation to Bernardo, the only son to the nobleman. Vit\u00f3ria does not accept the love that its heir felt for the artist mambembe, until it decides to live with the loved one and to open hand of all its wealth.\nDespaired with the attitude of her son, the Countess sends a letter to Em\u00edlia saying that she is willing to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Bernardo distrusts of the good intentions of her mother and goes to find Em\u00edlia by himself. A great tragedy occur's on the way, and Bernardo dies. The first phase ends with Felipe and L\u00edvia drowning making love oaths.\n\n=== Second phase: Belarrosa ===\n150 years later, all the people of Campobello, now Belarrosa, will have a second chance to redeem the errors of the past. Felipe Santar\u00e9m, humble owner of a Vin\u00edcola Campobello, and L\u00edvia Beraldini, a cultured, rich and educated young woman, will have a new possibility to live their love. L\u00edvia is daughter to Em\u00edlia, with whom they do not share a good relationship. She is also engaged to Pedro, a possessive and jealousy man. Felipe is already married to Melissa and they are parents to Alex. Melissa is a dedicated wife and left her dreams aside for Felipe despite the sorrow she caused her mother, Dorot\u00e9ia. She will disclose her true colours when she discovers the love between L\u00edvia and Felipe.\n\nThe new phase also shows the conflicts of Em\u00edlia with her mother, Vit\u00f3ria Ventura. While a child, Em\u00edlia lived in a small town in South of Italy with her mother and father, Alberto Navona. In her seventh birthday, she was abandoned by her mother and this left her traumatized. With regrets, Vit\u00f3ria comes back to ask for forgiveness, but her father (Alberto) fakes his death to avenge the fact that his wife ran away with another man. Now rich and powerful, Em\u00edlia is owner to the Beraldini House - a company that imports wines hosted in Rio de Janeiro. On the other hand, Vit\u00f3ria is through a financial crisis thus decides to put her house in Belarrosa and the Vin\u00edcola Ventura on sale in order to pay her debts. For vengeance, Em\u00edlia  buys all her mother's properties without Vit\u00f3ria's knowledge that the purchaser is her own daughter and that she plans to disinherit her from the patrimony.<ref>{{cite web|date=29 September 2016|author=Pradella, Michele Vaz|url=http://diariogaucho.clicrbs.com.br/rs/entretenimento/noticia/2015/09/vitoria-sera-mae-de-emilia-na-segunda-fase-de-alem-do-tempo-4858614.html|title=Vit\u00f3ria ser\u00e1 m\u00e3e de Em\u00edlia na segunda fase de Al\u00e9m do Tempo|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=Diario Gucho|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purepeople.com.br/noticia/veja-o-antes-e-depois-e-os-novos-personagens-da-segunda-fase-de-alem-do-tempo_a80101/1|title=Veja o antes e depois e os novos personagens da segunda fase de 'Al\u00e9m do Tempo|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=Pure People|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gshow.globo.com/tv/noticia/2015/10/resumo-da-segunda-fase-de-alem-do-tempo-saiba-o-que-muda-na-vida-dos-personagens.html|title=esumo da segunda fase de \u2018Al\u00e9m do Tempo\u2019; saiba o que muda na vida dos personagens!|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=GShow Globo|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guiadasemana.com.br/em-casa/noticia/entenda-a-2-fase-da-novela-alem-do-tempo|title=ENTENDA A 2\u00aa FASE DA NOVELA 'AL\u00c9M DO TEMPO|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=Guiada Semana|language=Portuguese}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== First phase ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Actor /Actress\n!Role<ref name=\"Personagens da segunda fase\">[http://especiais.gshow.globo.com/novelas/alem-do-tempo/relacoes-familiares/  Personagens da segunda fase]</ref> \n|-\n|[[Alinne Moraes]]\n|L\u00edvia Diffiori<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odia.ig.com.br/diversao/celebridades/2015-04-25/paolla-oliveira-perde-o-noivo-para-alinne-moraes-em-novela.html|title=Paolla Oliveira perde o noivo para Alinne Moraes em novela|author=Fl\u00e1via Muniz|date=25 April 2015|website=O Dia|accessdate =22 March 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Rafael Cardoso]]\n|Count Felipe Castellini<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odia.ig.com.br/diversao/televisao/2015-06-13/rafael-cardoso-sera-disputado-por-paolla-oliveira-e-alinne-moraes-na-tv.html|title=Rafael Cardoso ser\u00e1 disputado por Paolla Oliveira e Alinne Moraes na TV|author=Fl\u00e1via Muniz|date=13 June 2015|publisher=O Dia|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Paolla Oliveira]]\n|Melissa Borghini<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kogut.oglobo.globo.com/noticias-da-tv/noticia/2015/05/paolla-oliveira-fara-de-tudo-para-casar-com-rafael-cardoso-em-novela-das-18h-veja-foto.html|title=Paolla Oliveira far\u00e1 de tudo para casar com Rafael Cardoso em novela das 18h.

L\u00edvia and Felipe are of distinct social classes: She is a humble, obliged young lady that lives in the city's convent while Felipe is a noble Earl, nephew-grandson of the powerful Countess Vit\u00f3ria. He is about to walk down the aisle with the beautiful Melissa.\nL\u00edvia and Felipe fall passionately in love at first sight. To live this passion seems impossible. Beyond the commitment of the Earl, L\u00edvia discovers that she is granddaughter of a Countess, a greatest enemy to her mother, who provoked her separation to Bernardo, the only son to the nobleman. Vit\u00f3ria does not accept the love that its heir felt for the artist mambembe, until it decides to live with the loved one and to open hand of all its wealth.\nDespaired with the attitude of her son, the Countess sends a letter to Em\u00edlia saying that she is willing to accept her as a daughter-in-law. Bernardo distrusts of the good intentions of her mother and goes to find Em\u00edlia by himself. A great tragedy occur's on the way, and Bernardo dies. The first phase ends with Felipe and L\u00edvia drowning making love oaths.\n\n=== Second phase: Belarrosa ===\n150 years later, all the people of Campobello, now Belarrosa, will have a second chance to redeem the errors of the past. Felipe Santar\u00e9m, humble owner of a Vin\u00edcola Campobello, and L\u00edvia Beraldini, a cultured, rich and educated young woman, will have a new possibility to live their love. L\u00edvia is daughter to Em\u00edlia, with whom they do not share a good relationship. She is also engaged to Pedro, a possessive and jealousy man. Felipe is already married to Melissa and they are parents to Alex. Melissa is a dedicated wife and left her dreams aside for Felipe despite the sorrow she caused her mother, Dorot\u00e9ia. She will disclose her true colours when she discovers the love between L\u00edvia and Felipe.\n\nThe new phase also shows the conflicts of Em\u00edlia with her mother, Vit\u00f3ria Ventura. While a child, Em\u00edlia lived in a small town in South of Italy with her mother and father, Alberto Navona. In her seventh birthday, she was abandoned by her mother and this left her traumatized. With regrets, Vit\u00f3ria comes back to ask for forgiveness, but her father (Alberto) fakes his death to avenge the fact that his wife ran away with another man. Now rich and powerful, Em\u00edlia is owner to the Beraldini House - a company that imports wines hosted in Rio de Janeiro. On the other hand, Vit\u00f3ria is through a financial crisis thus decides to put her house in Belarrosa and the Vin\u00edcola Ventura on sale in order to pay her debts. For vengeance, Em\u00edlia  buys all her mother's properties without Vit\u00f3ria's knowledge that the purchaser is her own daughter and that she plans to disinherit her from the patrimony.<ref>{{cite web|date=29 September 2016|author=Pradella, Michele Vaz|url=http://diariogaucho.clicrbs.com.br/rs/entretenimento/noticia/2015/09/vitoria-sera-mae-de-emilia-na-segunda-fase-de-alem-do-tempo-4858614.html|title=Vit\u00f3ria ser\u00e1 m\u00e3e de Em\u00edlia na segunda fase de Al\u00e9m do Tempo|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=Diario Gucho|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purepeople.com.br/noticia/veja-o-antes-e-depois-e-os-novos-personagens-da-segunda-fase-de-alem-do-tempo_a80101/1|title=Veja o antes e depois e os novos personagens da segunda fase de 'Al\u00e9m do Tempo|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=Pure People|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gshow.globo.com/tv/noticia/2015/10/resumo-da-segunda-fase-de-alem-do-tempo-saiba-o-que-muda-na-vida-dos-personagens.html|title=esumo da segunda fase de \u2018Al\u00e9m do Tempo\u2019; saiba o que muda na vida dos personagens!|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=GShow Globo|language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guiadasemana.com.br/em-casa/noticia/entenda-a-2-fase-da-novela-alem-do-tempo|title=ENTENDA A 2\u00aa FASE DA NOVELA 'AL\u00c9M DO TEMPO|accessdate=2 April 2016|website=Guiada Semana|language=Portuguese}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== First phase ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Actor /Actress\n!Role<ref name=\"Personagens da segunda fase\">[http://especiais.gshow.globo.com/novelas/alem-do-tempo/relacoes-familiares/  Personagens da segunda fase]</ref> \n|-\n|[[Alinne Moraes]]\n|L\u00edvia Diffiori<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odia.ig.com.br/diversao/celebridades/2015-04-25/paolla-oliveira-perde-o-noivo-para-alinne-moraes-em-novela.html|title=Paolla Oliveira perde o noivo para Alinne Moraes em novela|author=Fl\u00e1via Muniz|date=25 April 2015|website=O Dia|accessdate =22 March 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Rafael Cardoso]]\n|Count Felipe Castellini<ref>{{cite web|url=http://odia.ig.com.br/diversao/televisao/2015-06-13/rafael-cardoso-sera-disputado-por-paolla-oliveira-e-alinne-moraes-na-tv.html|title=Rafael Cardoso ser\u00e1 disputado por Paolla Oliveira e Alinne Moraes na TV|author=Fl\u00e1via Muniz|date=13 June 2015|publisher=O Dia|accessdate=20 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Paolla Oliveira]]\n|Melissa Borghini<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kogut.oglobo.globo.com/noticias-da-tv/noticia/2015/05/paolla-oliveira-fara-de-tudo-para-casar-com-rafael-cardoso-em-novela-das-18h-veja-foto.html|title=Paolla Oliveira far\u00e1 de tudo para casar com Rafael Cardoso em novela das 18h.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

{"title_page": "Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales''' involved the shipping of coal\u2014mainly for local consumption but also for export or coal bunkering\u2014by sea to Sydney from the northern and southern coal fields of [[New South Wales]]. It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found \u2018fine burning coal\u2019 near a \u2018little creek\u2019 with [[Livistona australis|cabbage tree palms]] \u2018about 2 degrees\u2019 north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'.

William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but [[William Bligh]]\u2014later a governor of New South Wales\u2014saw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal\u2014seeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England\u2014took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1558725/1/Memorandoms-by-James-Martin.pdf|title=Memorandoms by James Martin - An astonishing escape from early New South Wales|last=Causer|first=Tim|publisher=UCL Press|year=2017|isbn=9781911576815|location=|pages=24, 25, 82, 83, 130, 131}}</ref>  It is likely that the location was near the entrance to [[Glenrock Lagoon#History|Glenrock Lagoon]], where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geomaps.com.au/scripts/glenrockstate.php|title=Glenrock State Recreation Area - Mining heritage and Dudley Beach fossilised forest|website=www.geomaps.com.au|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSurvivors of the wreck of the [[Sydney Cove (1796 ship)|''Sydney Cove'']] reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700&nbsp;km trek along the coast in May 1797.

Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed. The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons. Large letters on the side of the wagon identified the owner, and small letters its capacity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coals to Hexham : the continuing story|last=Kenn.|first=Pearce|date=1994|publisher=Railmac Publication|others=McNicol, Steve.|isbn=0949817961|edition=[Rev. ed.]|location=Elizabeth, S.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries. Originally these were horse-drawn but later used steam locomotives.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1890, there was a cokeworks, which converted unsaleable fines to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], some of which was loaded at the port for Sydney.\n\nBy 1927, there was only one coal staith in operation at Wollongong. The last coal was loaded there in 1933, by which time it had been eclipsed as a coal port by Port Kembla.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==== Port Kembla ====\n{{Main|Port Kembla (seaport)}}\n\nFrom 1883, coal was shipped from an ocean jetty on the beach just to the north of a rocky headland lying to the north of [[Red Point (Port Kembla)|Red Point]] and Boiler's Point. This new port was named Port Kembla, after the [[Mount Kembla|Mount Kembla mine]] from where the coal was transported by rail.\n\nA second jetty belonging to the Southern Coal Company was opened in 1887, which loaded coal sent by rail from the [[Corrimal, New South Wales#History|Corrimal Colliery]].\n\nIn its earlier years\u2014much like the other ocean jetty coal ports\u2014Port Kembla was exposed to rough seas during bad weather, Between 1901 and 1937, first an eastern breakwater and then a northern breakwater was constructed, resulting in a large protected and safe anchorage now known as the \u2018Outer Harbour\u2019.\n\nA new coal jetty was built to the north of the two existing coal jetties. The new coal jetty opened in 1915 and became 'No.1 Jetty', the Southern Coal Jetty became No.2 Jetty, and the Mt Kembla Jetty became Jetty No.3.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S.|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=6}}</ref>\n\nBy 1937, the No.1 Jetty was loading coal from all the southern mines that shipped coal by sea, except those mines still using Bellambi or Bulli.

It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791.

That proved true; an immense coal resource existed in New South Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d28rz98at9flks.cloudfront.net/9178/Rec1953_111.pdf|title=The Coal Resources of New South Wales (Draft)|last=Burton|first=G.M.|date=1953|publisher=Department of National Development, Bureau of Mineral Resources Geology and Geophysics.}}</ref>  Coal is still being mined within the [[Sydney Basin]] more than two centuries later. Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed.

Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

The lugs at the top were used to lift the removable hopper out of the frame by crane.|alt=|260x260px]]\n\nMany collieries on the northern coalfield of NSW were named after collieries in the United Kingdom. Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons. Large letters on the side of the wagon identified the owner, and small letters its capacity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coals to Hexham : the continuing story|last=Kenn.|first=Pearce|date=1994|publisher=Railmac Publication|others=McNicol, Steve.|isbn=0949817961|edition=[Rev. ed.]|location=Elizabeth, S.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

Ordered in the spring of 1767 from the [[Military port of Toulon|Toulon shipyard]], she was launched on 3 August 1768. She saw service in the [[American War of Independence]], and was destroyed in battle during it.\n\n==Design==\n\n''C\u00e9sar'' was a 74-gun ship built according to the standards defined by French shipbuilders in the 1740s. The design aimed to combine good manoeuvrability and armament cost effectively, so as to counter British warships.\n\nHer hull was constructed from [[oak]], while her masts and yards were [[pine]]. [[Elm]], [[Tilia|linden]], [[Populus|poplar]] and [[Juglans|walnut]] wood was used for the [[gun carriage]]s, sculptures and carvings. 80 tons of ropes and c. 2,500 m\u00b2 of sails were made of [[hemp]], with a set of replacement sails stored in the hold. She could operate for several weeks at sea, carrying three months supply of fresh water, supplemented by six months supply of wine. Tens of tons of biscuits, flour, fresh and dried vegetables, meat and salted fish, cheese, oil, vinegar, salt, were also carried, as was live cattle, which would be slaughtered as required.\n\n''C\u00e9sar'' carried twenty-eight 36-pounder guns on her lower deck, and thirty 18-pounder guns on her upper deck. In addition, sixteen 8-pounder guns were distributed on the [[forecastle|fore]] and [[aftcastle]]. In total ''C\u00e9sar''{{'}}s armament weighed around 215 tons.  6,000 [[cannonball]]s, weighing some 67 tons, were carried. There was also around 8 tons of [[bar shot|bar]], [[chain shot|chain]] and [[grape shot]]. 20 tons of [[gunpowder]] was embarked, stored in the form of cartridges or in bulk in the depths of the ship. On average, each gun had 50 to 60 cannonballs.\n\n==American War of Independence==\n\n===d'Estaing's squadron (1778-1779)===\nAt the time of the French entry to the American War of Independence, ''C\u00e9sar'' was under the command of Captain [[Joseph de Raimondis d'Allons]]. On 13 April 1778, ''C\u00e9sar'' sailed from Toulon bound for America, with the 12 ships of the [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|Comte d'Estaing's]] fleet. The fleet arrived at the mouth of the [[Delaware River]], north of [[Baltimore]], on 8 July and pursued several enemy ships. On 8 August, it forced the straits at New York and entered the mouth of the [[Connecticut River]], where the British forces were anchored. The British burnt seven of their ships and their stores. On 11 August 1778, the ''C\u00e9sar'' was separated from the squadron by a violent storm at the time when they were about to engage in a battle with the forces of [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]]. On 16 August 1778, ''C\u00e9sar'' battled [[USS Hancock (1776)|HMS ''Iris'']] and then went to shelter in [[Boston]], where she was joined by the other French ships.\n\nIn December 1778, after d'Estaing's squadron had transferred to the West Indies, the ''C\u00e9sar'' took part in the French defeat at the [[Battle of St. Lucia]]. On 6 July 1779 ''C\u00e9sar'' was part of the rear squadron in the hard-fought [[battle of Grenada]] against the forces of [[John Byron]]. After Estaing's failure to support the [[Siege of Savannah]] in October 1779, the ''C\u00e9sar'' returned to France with the other ships that had arrived on America in 1778 in order to be refitted and to recruit new crew.\n\n=== De Grasse's fleet (1781-1782)===\n\nIn 1781, the ''C\u00e9sar'' left for the West Indies under the command of [[Charles R\u00e9gis de Coriolis d'Espinouse]] in the fleet of the [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse]]. On 28 April she was present at the [[Battle of Fort Royal]], attempting to raise the blockade of [[Martinique]]. On 24 May ''C\u00e9sar'' was part of the squadron which covered the French [[Invasion of Tobago]]. On 5 September 1781 ''C\u00e9sar'' was present at the decisive [[battle of the Chesapeake]], which completed the encirclement of the British forces at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]].\n\nIn 1782, still with De Grasse's fleet, ''C\u00e9sar'' sailed to the West Indies and in January took part in the [[Battle of Saint Kitts]]. ''C\u00e9sar'' was then at the [[Battle of the Saintes]] on 12 April 1782, during which she was totally dismasted and then captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}.\n\nA prize crew of 58 men and one lieutenant were placed on the ship and the crew were locked below deck. Here around 9pm they accidentally started a fire whilst breaking into the officers liquor cabinet. The fire spread and at 10.30pm reached the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]], causing it to explode. The ''C\u00e9sar'' was destroyed, killing 400 French sailors and 50 British members of the [[prize crew]]. To make things worse, during the 90 minutes before the explosion when were jumping in the water, not realising that the ship was surrounded by sharks.

However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical [[lymphadenopathy]]), [[arthralgia|joint pains]], [[headache]], and [[conjunctivitis]].<ref name=\"pmid16022642\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Edlich RF, Winters KL, Long WB, Gubler KD |title=Rubella and congenital rubella (German measles)|journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants|volume=15|issue=3|pages=319\u201328|year=2005|pmid=16022642|doi= 10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.v15.i3.80}}</ref>\n\nThe swollen [[gland]]s or [[lymph nodes]] can persist for up to a week and the [[fever]] rarely rises above 38&nbsp;\u00b0C (100.4&nbsp;\u00b0F). The rash of German measles is typically pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer's sign occurs in 20% of cases, and is characterized by small, red [[papule]]s on the area of the [[soft palate]].<ref>Robert Kliegman, Waldo E. Nelson, Hal B. Jenson, Karen J.

However, the primary symptom of rubella virus infection is the appearance of a rash (exanthem) on the face which spreads to the trunk and limbs and usually fades after three days (that is why it is often referred to as three-day measles). The facial rash usually clears as it spreads to other parts of the body. Other symptoms include low grade fever, swollen glands (sub-occipital and posterior cervical [[lymphadenopathy]]), [[arthralgia|joint pains]], [[headache]], and [[conjunctivitis]].<ref name=\"pmid16022642\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Edlich RF, Winters KL, Long WB, Gubler KD |title=Rubella and congenital rubella (German measles)|journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants|volume=15|issue=3|pages=319\u201328|year=2005|pmid=16022642|doi= 10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.v15.i3.80}}</ref>\n\nThe swollen [[gland]]s or [[lymph nodes]] can persist for up to a week and the [[fever]] rarely rises above 38&nbsp;\u00b0C (100.4&nbsp;\u00b0F). The rash of German measles is typically pink or light red. The rash causes itching and often lasts for about three days. The rash disappears after a few days with no staining or peeling of the skin. When the rash clears up, the skin might shed in very small flakes where the rash covered it. Forchheimer's sign occurs in 20% of cases, and is characterized by small, red [[papule]]s on the area of the [[soft palate]].<ref>Robert Kliegman, Waldo E. Nelson, Hal B. Jenson, Karen J.

George and Culture Club drummer [[Jon Moss]] had taken part in the recording of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" and in the same month, the band were undertaking a tour of the UK, which culminated in six nights at [[Wembley Arena]]. On the final night at Wembley, 22 December 1984, an impromptu gathering of some of the other artists from Band Aid joined Culture Club on stage at the end of the concert for an encore of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\". George was so overcome by the occasion he told Geldof that they should consider organising a benefit concert. Speaking to the UK music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'' at the beginning of January 1985, Geldof revealed his enthusiasm for George's idea, saying, \"If George is organising it, you can tell him he can call me at any time and I'll do it. It's a logical progression from the record, but the point is you don't just talk about it, you go ahead and do it!\"<ref name=\"MM19850112\">{{cite magazine |title=Band Aid ... On Stage |periodical=[[Melody Maker]] |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |location=London, England |page=3 |date=12 January 1985}}</ref>\n\nIt was clear from the interview that Geldof had already had the idea to hold a dual venue concert and how the concerts should be structured:\n\n{{quote|The show should be as big as is humanly possible. There's no point just 5,000 fans turning up at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]; we need to have Wembley linked with [[Madison Square Garden]]s, and the whole show to be televised worldwide. It would be great for [[Duran Duran|Duran]] to play three or four numbers at Wembley, and then flick to Madison Square where [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] would be playing. While he's on, the Wembley stage could be made ready for the next British act like [[Thompson Twins|the Thompsons]] or whoever. In that way, lots of acts could be featured and the television rights, tickets and so on could raise a phenomenal amount of money. It's not an impossible idea, and certainly one worth exploiting.<ref name=\"MM19850112\" />}}\n\n== Organisation<!-- Not a typo: this article is written in British English spelling --> ==\nAmong those involved in organising Live Aid were [[Harvey Goldsmith]], who was responsible for the Wembley Stadium concert, and [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], who put together the American leg.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bob Geldof, Harvey Goldsmith \u2013 and the truth about Live Aid|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/neil-mccormick/8217877/Bob-Geldof-Harvey-Goldsmith-and-the-truth-about-Live-Aid.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe concert grew in scope, as more acts were added on both sides of the Atlantic. [[Tony Verna]], inventor of [[instant replay]], was able to secure [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] through his friendship with Philadelphia [[Wilson Goode|Mayor Goode]] and was able to procure, through his connections with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[prime time]] chief, John Hamlin, a three-hour prime time slot on the ABC Network and, in addition, was able to supplement the lengthy program through meetings that resulted in the addition of an ad-hoc network within the US, which covered 85 percent of TVs there. Verna designed the needed satellite schematic and became the Executive Director as well as the Co-Executive Producer along with [[Hal Uplinger]]. Uplinger came up with the idea to produce a four-hour video edit of Live Aid to distribute to those countries without the necessary satellite equipment to rebroadcast the live feed.\n\n== Collaborative effort ==\nThe concert began at 12:00 British Summer Time (BST) (7:00 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in the United Kingdom. It continued at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] (JFK) in the United States, starting at 13:51 BST (8:51 EDT). The UK's Wembley performances ended at 22:00 BST (17:00 EDT). The JFK performances and whole concert in the US ended at 04:05 BST 14 July (23:05 EDT). Thus, the concert continued for just over 16 hours, but since many artists' performances were conducted simultaneously in Wembley and JFK, the total concert's length was much longer.\n\n[[Mick Jagger]] and [[David Bowie]] intended to perform an intercontinental duet, with Bowie in London and Jagger in Philadelphia. Problems of synchronisation meant the only practical solution was to have one artist, likely Bowie at Wembley, mime along to prerecorded vocals broadcast as part of the live sound mix for Jagger's performance from Philadelphia. Veteran music engineer David Richards ([[Pink Floyd]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) was brought in to create footage and sound mixes Jagger and Bowie could perform to in their respective venues. The BBC would then have had to ensure those footage and sound mixes were in sync while also performing a live vision mix of the footage from both venues. The combined footage would then have had to be bounced back by satellite to the various broadcasters around the world. Due to the time lag (the signal would take several seconds to be broadcast twice across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]), Richards concluded there was no way for Jagger to hear or see Bowie's performance, meaning there could be no interaction between the artists, essentially defeating the whole point of the exercise. On top of this, both artists objected to the idea of miming at what was perceived as a historic event. Instead, Jagger and Bowie worked with Richards to create a video clip of the song they would have performed, a cover of \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\", which was shown on the screens of both stadiums and broadcast as part of many TV networks' coverage.\n\nEach of the two main parts of the concert ended with their particular continental all-star anti-hunger anthems, with [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" closing the UK concert, and [[USA for Africa]]'s \"[[We Are the World]]\" closing the US concert (and thus the entire event itself).<ref>[http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/liveaidtimesdetaileduk.html \"Detailed list of all the artist having performed at the Live Aid concert\"]. Live Aid. Retrieved 4 April 2013.</ref>\n\nConcert organizers have subsequently said they were particularly keen to ensure at least one surviving member of [[the Beatles]], ideally [[Paul McCartney]], took part in the concert as they felt that having an 'elder statesman' from British music would give it greater legitimacy in the eyes of the political leaders whose opinions the performers were trying to shape. McCartney agreed to perform and has said it was \"the management\" \u2013 his children \u2013 who persuaded him to take part. In the event, he was the last performer (aside from the Band Aid finale) to take to the stage and one of the few to be beset by technical difficulties; his microphone failed for the first two minutes of his piano performance of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", making it difficult for television viewers and impossible for those in the stadium to hear him. He later joked by saying he had thought about changing the lyrics to \"There will be some feedback, let it be\".\n\n[[Phil Collins]] performed at both Wembley Stadium and JFK, travelling by helicopter (piloted by UK TV personality [[Noel Edmonds]]) to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]], then by [[Concorde]] to [[New York City|New York]], and by another helicopter to Philadelphia. As well as his own set at both venues, he also played the drums for [[Eric Clapton]], and played with the reuniting surviving members of [[Led Zeppelin]] at JFK. On the Concorde flight, Collins encountered actress and singer [[Cher]], who was unaware of the concerts. Upon reaching the US, she attended the Philadelphia concert and can be seen performing as part of the concert's \"[[We Are the World]]\" finale.<ref name=Guardian2004/> In a 1985 interview, singer-songwriter [[Billy Joel]] stated that he had considered performing at the event, but ultimately chose not to because he had difficulties getting his band together and didn't want to perform by himself.<ref>{{Citation|title=Billy Joel 1985 Interview part 2 of 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pCIrypwQIs|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcasts ==\nBroadcaster [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] opened the Live Aid concert with the words:\n\n{{quote|It's twelve noon in London, seven AM in Philadelphia, and around the world it's time for Live Aid.}}\n\nThe concert was the most ambitious international satellite television venture that had ever been attempted at the time. In Europe, the TV feed was supplied by the [[BBC]], whose broadcast was presented by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]], [[Andy Kershaw]], [[Mark Ellen]], [[David Hepworth]], [[Andy Batten-Foster]], Steve Blacknell, [[Paul Gambaccini]], [[Janice Long]] and [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] and included numerous interviews and chats in between the various acts. The [[BBC Television|BBC's television]] sound feed was mono, as was all UK TV audio before [[NICAM]] was introduced, but the [[BBC Radio 1]] feed was stereo and was simulcast in sync with the TV pictures. Unfortunately, in the rush to set up the transatlantic feeds, the sound feed from Philadelphia was sent to London via transatlantic cable, while the video feed was via satellite, which meant a lack of synchronisation on British television receivers. Due to the constant activities in both London and Philadelphia, the BBC producers omitted the reunion of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] from their broadcast. The BBC, however, did supply a [[Backhaul (broadcasting)|'clean feed']] to various television channels in Europe.\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was largely responsible for the US broadcast (although ABC themselves only telecast the final three hours of the concert from Philadelphia, hosted by [[Dick Clark]], with the rest shown in syndication through [[Orbis Communications]], acting on behalf of ABC). An entirely separate and simultaneous US feed was provided for cable viewers by [[MTV]], whose broadcast was presented in stereo, and accessible as such for those with stereo televisions. At the time, before [[Multichannel television sound]] was enacted nationwide, very few televisions reproduced stereo signals and few television stations were able to broadcast in stereo. While the telecast was run commercial-free by the BBC, both the MTV and syndicated/ABC broadcasts included advertisements and interviews. As a result, many songs were omitted due to the commercial breaks, as these songs were played during these slots.\n\nThe biggest issue of the syndicated/ABC coverage is that the network had wanted to reserve some of the biggest acts that had played earlier in the day for certain points in the entire broadcast, particularly in the final three hours in prime time; thus, Orbis Communications had some sequences replaced by others, especially those portions of the concert that had acts from London and Philadelphia playing simultaneously. For example, while the London/Wembley finale was taking place at 22:00 (10:00 pm) London time, syndicated viewers saw segments that had been recorded earlier, so that ABC could show the UK finale during its prime-time portion. In 1995, VH1 and [[MuchMusic]] aired a re-edited ten-hour re-broadcast of the concert for its 10th anniversary.\n\nThe Live Aid concert in London was also the first time that the BBC [[outside broadcast]] sound equipment had been used for an event of such scale. In stark contrast to the mirrored sound systems commonly used by the rock band touring engineers, with two 40\u201348-channel mixing consoles at the [[front of house]] and another pair for monitors, the BBC sound engineers had to use multiple 12-channel desks. Some credit this as the point where the mainstream entertainment industry realised that the rock concert industry had overtaken them in technical expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/information/internet-publishing-broadcasting/850869-1.html |title=Lessons learned since Live Aid: the challenge of bringing high quality audio to live television audiences continues to change.

Funny old world, innit?\" to cheers from the Philadelphia crowd.\n\n== Fundraising ==\nThroughout the concerts, viewers were urged to donate money to the Live Aid cause. Three hundred phone lines were manned by the BBC, so that members of the public could make donations using their credit cards. The phone number and an address that viewers could send cheques to were repeated every twenty minutes.\n\nNearly seven hours into the concert in London, Bob Geldof enquired how much money had been raised so far; he was told about \u00a31.2 million. He is said to have been sorely disappointed by the amount and marched to the BBC commentary position. Pumped up further by a performance by Queen which he later called \"absolutely amazing\", Geldof gave an interview in which BBC presenter [[David Hepworth]] had attempted to provide a postal address to which potential donations could be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted \"Fuck the address, let's get the numbers\". Although the phrase \"give us your fucking money\" has passed into folklore, Geldof has stated that it was never uttered.<ref>Geldof, Bob. ''Live Aid'' DVD.</ref> ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine made great humorous capital out of this outburst, emphasising Geldof's Irish accent which meant the profanities were heard as \"fock\" or \"focking\". After the outburst, donations increased to \u00a3300 per second.<ref>Fred Kr\u00fcger (2015). \"Cultures and Disasters: Understanding Cultural Framings in Disaster Risk Reduction\". p. 190. Routledge</ref>\n\nLater in the evening, following David Bowie's set, a video shot by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] was shown to the audiences in London and Philadelphia, as well as on televisions around the world (though neither US feed showed the film), showing starving and diseased Ethiopian children set to \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\" by [[The Cars]]. (This would also be shown at the London Live 8 concert in 2005.) The rate of donations became faster in the immediate aftermath of the video. Geldof had previously refused to allow the video to be shown, due to time constraints, and had only relented when Bowie offered to drop the song \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" from his set as a trade-off.\n\nGeldof mentioned during the concert that the [[Republic of Ireland]] gave the most donations per capita, despite being in the midst of a serious economic recession at the time. The single largest donation came from [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], who was part of the ruling family of Dubai, who donated \u00a31m in a phone conversation with Geldof. The next day, news reports stated that between \u00a340 and \u00a350 million had been raised. It is now estimated that around \u00a3150 million in total has been raised for famine relief as a direct result of the concerts.\n\n== Criticisms and controversies ==\n[[Bob Dylan]]'s performance generated controversy after he said: \"I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it, say, to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks\".<ref name=\"CNN\"/> He is often misquoted, as on the [[Farm Aid]] website,<ref>{{cite web|title=28 Years of Amazing Concerts|url=http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2739785/apps/s/content.asp?ct=3851529|publisher=Farm Aid website|accessdate=31 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153719/http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2739785/apps/s/content.asp?ct=3851529|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> as saying: \"Wouldn't it be great if we did something for our own farmers right here in America?\". In his autobiography, ''Is That It?'' (published in 1986), Geldof was critical of the remark, saying \"He displayed a complete lack of understanding of the issues raised by Live Aid. ...

I recall that Tears For Fears, who made a musical and artistic decision to pull out of the concert, were subsequently accused by Geldof of killing children in Africa \u2013 what a shockingly irresponsible and stupid attitude to take. But I have nothing bad whatsoever to say about Bob Geldof; he sacrificed his health, his career, everything for something he believed in. But others around him got involved for their own reasons.

That was the reason why the concert was never recorded in its complete original form, and only secondary television broadcasts were recorded. Following Geldof's request, ABC even erased its own broadcast tapes. However, before the syndicated/ABC footage was erased, copies of it were donated to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and have now been presumed lost. The ABC feed of the USA for Africa/\"We Are The World\" finale does exist in its entirety, complete with the network end credits, and can be found as a supplemental feature on the ''We Are The World: The Story Behind The Song'' DVD.\n\nMeanwhile, MTV decided to keep recordings of its broadcast and eventually located more than 100 tapes of Live Aid in its archives, but many songs in these tapes were cut short by MTV's ad breaks and presenters (according to the BBC).<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3604680.stm |title=How Live Aid was saved for history |work=BBC News |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> The BBC also decided to erase fragments of the performance due to storage limitations, to pave the way for newer programmes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Many performances from the US were not shown on the BBC, and recordings of these performances are missing. There were four separate Audio Trucks in Philadelphia provided by David Hewitt of Remote Recording Services. ABC had taken the decision that no multi track tape recordings would be allowed, so no remixing of the Philadelphia show was possible.\n\n=== Official Live Aid DVD ===\nAn official four-disc DVD set of the Live Aid concerts was released on 8 November 2004. A [[film premiere|premiere]] to launch the new DVD was held on 7 November and shown in [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] surround sound featuring a short compilation of the four-disc set. The screening was held at the [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon Cinema]] in [[Kensington]], London and included guests such as [[Brian May]], [[Anita Dobson]], [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], Bob Geldof and partner Jean Marie, Annie Lennox, Midge Ure, [[Michael Buerk]], [[Gary Kemp]] and [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]].<ref>{{cite news|last= |first=|url=https://brianmay.com/queen/queennews/queennewsnov04a.html|title=Live Aid DVD Launch|work=Brianmay.com|date=8 November 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref> Other theatrical premiere\u2019s were held in [[Zurich]], [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Vienna]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]].<ref>[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20041112005099/en/Live-Aid-DVD-Premiere-European-Cinemas-DTS Live Aid DVD] \u2013 Premiere at European Cinemas in DTS Surround Sound; Exclusive Cinema Screenings of the Landmark 1985 Concert Recording Played in 5.1 DTS Digital Surround, 12 November 2004</ref> A 52-minute compilation was later released as a limited edition DVD in July 2005 titled ''20 Years Ago Today: Live Aid''.<ref>[http://www.dvdmg.com/20yearsagotodayliveaid.shtml 20 Years Ago Today] \u2013 July 2005</ref> The box set contains 10-hour partial footage of the 16-hour length concert. The DVD was produced by Geldof's company, Woodcharm Ltd., and distributed by [[Warner Music Vision]]. The DVD has since been [[out of print]] and no longer available in stores. The decision to finally release it was taken by Bob Geldof nearly 20 years after the original concerts, after he found a number of unlicensed copies of the concert on the Internet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3530269.stm |title=Geldof thwarts 'Live Aid pirate' |work=BBC News |date=3 March 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe most complete footage that exists is used from the [[BBC]] source, and this was the main source of the DVD. During production on the official DVD, [[MTV]] lent Woodcharm Ltd. their B-roll and alternate camera footage where MTV provided extra footage of the Philadelphia concert (where ABC had erased the tapes from the command of Bob Geldof). Songs that were not originally littered with ads were also used on the official DVD.\n\nWorking from the BBC and MTV footage, several degrees of dramatic license were taken, in order to release the concert on DVD. Many songs had their soundtracks altered for the DVD release, mainly in sequences where there were originally microphone problems. In one of those instances, Paul McCartney had re-recorded his failed vocals for \"Let It Be\" in a studio the day after the concert (14 July 1985) but it was never used until the release of the DVD. Also, in the US finale, the original USA for Africa studio track for \"We Are the World\" was overlaid in places where the microphone was absent (consequently, it includes the vocals of [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[James Ingram]], two artists who did not even take part in Live Aid).\n\nSome artists did not want their performances to be featured on the DVD. At their own request, [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Santana (band)|Santana]] were omitted. The former defended their decision not to be included on the grounds that their performance was 'sub-standard', but to lend their support, [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] pledged to donate proceeds from the DVD release of ''Page & Plant: No Quarter'' to the campaign, and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] pledged proceeds from his American tour with [[Mutual Admiration Society (collaboration)|Mutual Admiration Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm |title=Zeppelin defend Live Aid opt out |website=BBC News |date=4 August 2004 |accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nJudicious decisions were also made on which acts would be included and which ones would not, due to either technical difficulties in the original performances, the absence of original footage, or for music rights reasons. [[Rick Springfield]], [[the Four Tops]], [[the Hooters]], [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], [[Billy Ocean]] and [[Kool and the Gang]]<nowiki/> were among those acts that were left off the DVD. Several artists who did feature on the DVD also had songs that were performed omitted. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] performed three solo songs in the concert, but only two were included on the DVD (\"Love Makes the World Go Round\" was omitted). Phil Collins played \"Against All Odds\" and \"In the Air Tonight\" at both Wembley and JFK, but only the London performance of the former and the Philadelphia performance of the latter were included on the DVD. The JFK performance of \"Against All Odds\" was later included on Collins' ''Finally ... The First Farewell Tour'' DVD. [[Tom Petty]] performed four songs, and only two were included on DVD. Patti LaBelle played six songs but only two songs were included.\n\nIn 2007, [[Queen (band)|Queen]] released a special edition of ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]'' on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD formats containing their 1981 concert from [[Montreal Forum|The Forum]] in Montreal, Canada, and their complete Live Aid performance, along with Freddie Mercury and Brian May performing \"[[Is This the World We Created...?]]\" from the UK Live Aid finale, all re-mixed in DTS 5.1 sound by Justin Shirley-Smith \u2014 this marked the first Live Aid material officially released in a high-definition/Blu-ray format. Also included is their Live Aid rehearsal, and an interview with the band, from earlier in the week.\n\nOn its release, the then British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]], decided the [[VAT]] collected on sales of the Live Aid DVD would be given back to the charity, which would raise an extra \u00a35 for every DVD sold.\n\nOn 14 November 2004, the DVD entered the UK Official [[UK Music Charts|Music Video Chart]] at number one and stayed in the top position for twelve consecutive weeks.<ref name=\"Official Music Video Chart Top 50\">[https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/music-video-chart/20041114/13/ Official Music Video Chart Top 50] \u2013 14 November 2004 \u2013 20 November 2004</ref>\n\n====Charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable unsortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

These recordings circulated among collectors, and in recent years, have also appeared on the Internet in [[file sharing networks]].\n\nSince the official DVD release of Live Aid includes only partial footage of this event, unofficial distribution sources continue to be the only source of the most complete recordings of this event.

George and Culture Club drummer [[Jon Moss]] had taken part in the recording of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" and in the same month, the band were undertaking a tour of the UK, which culminated in six nights at [[Wembley Arena]]. On the final night at Wembley, 22 December 1984, an impromptu gathering of some of the other artists from Band Aid joined Culture Club on stage at the end of the concert for an encore of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\". George was so overcome by the occasion he told Geldof that they should consider organising a benefit concert. Speaking to the UK music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'' at the beginning of January 1985, Geldof revealed his enthusiasm for George's idea, saying, \"If George is organising it, you can tell him he can call me at any time and I'll do it. It's a logical progression from the record, but the point is you don't just talk about it, you go ahead and do it!\"<ref name=\"MM19850112\">{{cite magazine |title=Band Aid ... On Stage |periodical=[[Melody Maker]] |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |location=London, England |page=3 |date=12 January 1985}}</ref>\n\nIt was clear from the interview that Geldof had already had the idea to hold a dual venue concert and how the concerts should be structured:\n\n{{quote|The show should be as big as is humanly possible. There's no point just 5,000 fans turning up at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]; we need to have Wembley linked with [[Madison Square Garden]]s, and the whole show to be televised worldwide. It would be great for [[Duran Duran|Duran]] to play three or four numbers at Wembley, and then flick to Madison Square where [[Bruce Springsteen|Springsteen]] would be playing. While he's on, the Wembley stage could be made ready for the next British act like [[Thompson Twins|the Thompsons]] or whoever. In that way, lots of acts could be featured and the television rights, tickets and so on could raise a phenomenal amount of money. It's not an impossible idea, and certainly one worth exploiting.<ref name=\"MM19850112\" />}}\n\n== Organisation<!-- Not a typo: this article is written in British English spelling --> ==\nAmong those involved in organising Live Aid were [[Harvey Goldsmith]], who was responsible for the Wembley Stadium concert, and [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], who put together the American leg.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bob Geldof, Harvey Goldsmith \u2013 and the truth about Live Aid|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/journalists/neil-mccormick/8217877/Bob-Geldof-Harvey-Goldsmith-and-the-truth-about-Live-Aid.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe concert grew in scope, as more acts were added on both sides of the Atlantic. [[Tony Verna]], inventor of [[instant replay]], was able to secure [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] through his friendship with Philadelphia [[Wilson Goode|Mayor Goode]] and was able to procure, through his connections with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[prime time]] chief, John Hamlin, a three-hour prime time slot on the ABC Network and, in addition, was able to supplement the lengthy program through meetings that resulted in the addition of an ad-hoc network within the US, which covered 85 percent of TVs there. Verna designed the needed satellite schematic and became the Executive Director as well as the Co-Executive Producer along with [[Hal Uplinger]]. Uplinger came up with the idea to produce a four-hour video edit of Live Aid to distribute to those countries without the necessary satellite equipment to rebroadcast the live feed.\n\n== Collaborative effort ==\nThe concert began at 12:00 British Summer Time (BST) (7:00 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in the United Kingdom. It continued at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] (JFK) in the United States, starting at 13:51 BST (8:51 EDT). The UK's Wembley performances ended at 22:00 BST (17:00 EDT). The JFK performances and whole concert in the US ended at 04:05 BST 14 July (23:05 EDT). Thus, the concert continued for just over 16 hours, but since many artists' performances were conducted simultaneously in Wembley and JFK, the total concert's length was much longer.\n\n[[Mick Jagger]] and [[David Bowie]] intended to perform an intercontinental duet, with Bowie in London and Jagger in Philadelphia. Problems of synchronisation meant the only practical solution was to have one artist, likely Bowie at Wembley, mime along to prerecorded vocals broadcast as part of the live sound mix for Jagger's performance from Philadelphia. Veteran music engineer David Richards ([[Pink Floyd]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) was brought in to create footage and sound mixes Jagger and Bowie could perform to in their respective venues. The BBC would then have had to ensure those footage and sound mixes were in sync while also performing a live vision mix of the footage from both venues. The combined footage would then have had to be bounced back by satellite to the various broadcasters around the world. Due to the time lag (the signal would take several seconds to be broadcast twice across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]), Richards concluded there was no way for Jagger to hear or see Bowie's performance, meaning there could be no interaction between the artists, essentially defeating the whole point of the exercise. On top of this, both artists objected to the idea of miming at what was perceived as a historic event. Instead, Jagger and Bowie worked with Richards to create a video clip of the song they would have performed, a cover of \"[[Dancing in the Street]]\", which was shown on the screens of both stadiums and broadcast as part of many TV networks' coverage.\n\nEach of the two main parts of the concert ended with their particular continental all-star anti-hunger anthems, with [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" closing the UK concert, and [[USA for Africa]]'s \"[[We Are the World]]\" closing the US concert (and thus the entire event itself).<ref>[http://liveaid.free.fr/pages/liveaidtimesdetaileduk.html \"Detailed list of all the artist having performed at the Live Aid concert\"]. Live Aid. Retrieved 4 April 2013.</ref>\n\nConcert organizers have subsequently said they were particularly keen to ensure at least one surviving member of [[the Beatles]], ideally [[Paul McCartney]], took part in the concert as they felt that having an 'elder statesman' from British music would give it greater legitimacy in the eyes of the political leaders whose opinions the performers were trying to shape. McCartney agreed to perform and has said it was \"the management\" \u2013 his children \u2013 who persuaded him to take part. In the event, he was the last performer (aside from the Band Aid finale) to take to the stage and one of the few to be beset by technical difficulties; his microphone failed for the first two minutes of his piano performance of \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", making it difficult for television viewers and impossible for those in the stadium to hear him. He later joked by saying he had thought about changing the lyrics to \"There will be some feedback, let it be\".\n\n[[Phil Collins]] performed at both Wembley Stadium and JFK, travelling by helicopter (piloted by UK TV personality [[Noel Edmonds]]) to [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow Airport]], then by [[Concorde]] to [[New York City|New York]], and by another helicopter to Philadelphia. As well as his own set at both venues, he also played the drums for [[Eric Clapton]], and played with the reuniting surviving members of [[Led Zeppelin]] at JFK. On the Concorde flight, Collins encountered actress and singer [[Cher]], who was unaware of the concerts. Upon reaching the US, she attended the Philadelphia concert and can be seen performing as part of the concert's \"[[We Are the World]]\" finale.<ref name=Guardian2004/> In a 1985 interview, singer-songwriter [[Billy Joel]] stated that he had considered performing at the event, but ultimately chose not to because he had difficulties getting his band together and didn't want to perform by himself.<ref>{{Citation|title=Billy Joel 1985 Interview part 2 of 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pCIrypwQIs|language=en|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref>\n\n== Broadcasts ==\nBroadcaster [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] opened the Live Aid concert with the words:\n\n{{quote|It's twelve noon in London, seven AM in Philadelphia, and around the world it's time for Live Aid.}}\n\nThe concert was the most ambitious international satellite television venture that had ever been attempted at the time. In Europe, the TV feed was supplied by the [[BBC]], whose broadcast was presented by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]], [[Andy Kershaw]], [[Mark Ellen]], [[David Hepworth]], [[Andy Batten-Foster]], Steve Blacknell, [[Paul Gambaccini]], [[Janice Long]] and [[Mike Smith (broadcaster)|Mike Smith]] and included numerous interviews and chats in between the various acts. The [[BBC Television|BBC's television]] sound feed was mono, as was all UK TV audio before [[NICAM]] was introduced, but the [[BBC Radio 1]] feed was stereo and was simulcast in sync with the TV pictures. Unfortunately, in the rush to set up the transatlantic feeds, the sound feed from Philadelphia was sent to London via transatlantic cable, while the video feed was via satellite, which meant a lack of synchronisation on British television receivers. Due to the constant activities in both London and Philadelphia, the BBC producers omitted the reunion of [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] from their broadcast. The BBC, however, did supply a [[Backhaul (broadcasting)|'clean feed']] to various television channels in Europe.\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was largely responsible for the US broadcast (although ABC themselves only telecast the final three hours of the concert from Philadelphia, hosted by [[Dick Clark]], with the rest shown in syndication through [[Orbis Communications]], acting on behalf of ABC). An entirely separate and simultaneous US feed was provided for cable viewers by [[MTV]], whose broadcast was presented in stereo, and accessible as such for those with stereo televisions. At the time, before [[Multichannel television sound]] was enacted nationwide, very few televisions reproduced stereo signals and few television stations were able to broadcast in stereo. While the telecast was run commercial-free by the BBC, both the MTV and syndicated/ABC broadcasts included advertisements and interviews. As a result, many songs were omitted due to the commercial breaks, as these songs were played during these slots.\n\nThe biggest issue of the syndicated/ABC coverage is that the network had wanted to reserve some of the biggest acts that had played earlier in the day for certain points in the entire broadcast, particularly in the final three hours in prime time; thus, Orbis Communications had some sequences replaced by others, especially those portions of the concert that had acts from London and Philadelphia playing simultaneously. For example, while the London/Wembley finale was taking place at 22:00 (10:00 pm) London time, syndicated viewers saw segments that had been recorded earlier, so that ABC could show the UK finale during its prime-time portion. In 1995, VH1 and [[MuchMusic]] aired a re-edited ten-hour re-broadcast of the concert for its 10th anniversary.\n\nThe Live Aid concert in London was also the first time that the BBC [[outside broadcast]] sound equipment had been used for an event of such scale. In stark contrast to the mirrored sound systems commonly used by the rock band touring engineers, with two 40\u201348-channel mixing consoles at the [[front of house]] and another pair for monitors, the BBC sound engineers had to use multiple 12-channel desks. Some credit this as the point where the mainstream entertainment industry realised that the rock concert industry had overtaken them in technical expertise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/information/internet-publishing-broadcasting/850869-1.html |title=Lessons learned since Live Aid: the challenge of bringing high quality audio to live television audiences continues to change.

Funny old world, innit?\" to cheers from the Philadelphia crowd.\n\n== Fundraising ==\nThroughout the concerts, viewers were urged to donate money to the Live Aid cause. Three hundred phone lines were manned by the BBC, so that members of the public could make donations using their credit cards. The phone number and an address that viewers could send cheques to were repeated every twenty minutes.\n\nNearly seven hours into the concert in London, Bob Geldof enquired how much money had been raised so far; he was told about \u00a31.2 million. He is said to have been sorely disappointed by the amount and marched to the BBC commentary position. Pumped up further by a performance by Queen which he later called \"absolutely amazing\", Geldof gave an interview in which BBC presenter [[David Hepworth]] had attempted to provide a postal address to which potential donations could be sent; Geldof interrupted him in mid-flow and shouted \"Fuck the address, let's get the numbers\". Although the phrase \"give us your fucking money\" has passed into folklore, Geldof has stated that it was never uttered.<ref>Geldof, Bob. ''Live Aid'' DVD.</ref> ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine made great humorous capital out of this outburst, emphasising Geldof's Irish accent which meant the profanities were heard as \"fock\" or \"focking\". After the outburst, donations increased to \u00a3300 per second.<ref>Fred Kr\u00fcger (2015). \"Cultures and Disasters: Understanding Cultural Framings in Disaster Risk Reduction\". p. 190. Routledge</ref>\n\nLater in the evening, following David Bowie's set, a video shot by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] was shown to the audiences in London and Philadelphia, as well as on televisions around the world (though neither US feed showed the film), showing starving and diseased Ethiopian children set to \"[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]\" by [[The Cars]]. (This would also be shown at the London Live 8 concert in 2005.) The rate of donations became faster in the immediate aftermath of the video. Geldof had previously refused to allow the video to be shown, due to time constraints, and had only relented when Bowie offered to drop the song \"[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]\" from his set as a trade-off.\n\nGeldof mentioned during the concert that the [[Republic of Ireland]] gave the most donations per capita, despite being in the midst of a serious economic recession at the time. The single largest donation came from [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], who was part of the ruling family of Dubai, who donated \u00a31m in a phone conversation with Geldof. The next day, news reports stated that between \u00a340 and \u00a350 million had been raised. It is now estimated that around \u00a3150 million in total has been raised for famine relief as a direct result of the concerts.\n\n== Criticisms and controversies ==\n[[Bob Dylan]]'s performance generated controversy after he said: \"I hope that some of the money ... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe ... one or two million, maybe ... and use it, say, to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks\".<ref name=\"CNN\"/> He is often misquoted, as on the [[Farm Aid]] website,<ref>{{cite web|title=28 Years of Amazing Concerts|url=http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2739785/apps/s/content.asp?ct=3851529|publisher=Farm Aid website|accessdate=31 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153719/http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2739785/apps/s/content.asp?ct=3851529|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> as saying: \"Wouldn't it be great if we did something for our own farmers right here in America?\". In his autobiography, ''Is That It?'' (published in 1986), Geldof was critical of the remark, saying \"He displayed a complete lack of understanding of the issues raised by Live Aid. ... Live Aid was about people losing their lives. There is a radical difference between losing your livelihood and losing your life.

He felt pressured into it by Graham and local promoter Larry Magid. Magid, promoting the concert through [[Electric Factory Concerts]], argued that the band was popular in Philadelphia; their first major label album ''[[Nervous Night]]'' had been released almost three months earlier and had been a hit.

I don't think Phil ever forgave Bob.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.69facesofrock.com/thin_lizzy_interview.html|title=Thin Lizzy|first=Mark|last=Kadzielawa|publisher=69 Faces of Rock|accessdate=16 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203183350/http://69facesofrock.com/thin_lizzy_interview.html|archivedate=3 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lynott died less than five months after the concert, from complications associated with his drug and alcohol addictions.\n\n[[Neil Peart]], drummer of Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] said: \"[[Geddy Lee|Geddy]] was involved with the ''[[Tears Are Not Enough|Northern Lights]]'' charity record here in Canada, although Rush weren't invited to participate in the Live Aid event \u2013 mainly because if you look at the guest list, it was very much an 'in-crowd' situation. We were 'out' by then. We didn't refuse to take part because of any principles. Mind you, I wouldn't have been happy being part of this scenario. Those stars should have shut up and just given over their money if they were genuine. I recall that Tears For Fears, who made a musical and artistic decision to pull out of the concert, were subsequently accused by Geldof of killing children in Africa \u2013 what a shockingly irresponsible and stupid attitude to take. But I have nothing bad whatsoever to say about Bob Geldof; he sacrificed his health, his career, everything for something he believed in. But others around him got involved for their own reasons. Some of those involved in ''Northern Lights'' were actually quoted as saying that their managers told them to get down to the recording sessions because it would be a good career move!\"<ref name=\"Metal Hammer\">{{cite interview | first=Neil | last=Peart | interviewer=Malcolm Dome | title=All Fired Up | magazine=Metal Hammer | url=http://www.2112.net/xanadu/interviews/neil.htm | date=25 April 1988 | accessdate=13 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"I tried to pitch into Live Aid,\" recalled [[Roger Waters]], \"They asked me to put [[Pink Floyd]] back together for it and I said no, but I'd bring my new band to play. They didn't want that. But that's alright. I went along on my own.\"<ref>[[Steve Turner (writer)|Turner, Steve]]: \"Roger Waters: The Wall in Berlin\"; ''[[Radio Times]]'', 25 May 1990; reprinted in ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' #148, August 2010, p. 81</ref>\n\n== Live Aid recordings ==\nWhen organiser Bob Geldof was persuading artists to take part in the concert, he promised them that it would be a one-off event, never to be seen again. That was the reason why the concert was never recorded in its complete original form, and only secondary television broadcasts were recorded. Following Geldof's request, ABC even erased its own broadcast tapes. However, before the syndicated/ABC footage was erased, copies of it were donated to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and have now been presumed lost. The ABC feed of the USA for Africa/\"We Are The World\" finale does exist in its entirety, complete with the network end credits, and can be found as a supplemental feature on the ''We Are The World: The Story Behind The Song'' DVD.\n\nMeanwhile, MTV decided to keep recordings of its broadcast and eventually located more than 100 tapes of Live Aid in its archives, but many songs in these tapes were cut short by MTV's ad breaks and presenters (according to the BBC).<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3604680.stm |title=How Live Aid was saved for history |work=BBC News |date=27 August 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> The BBC also decided to erase fragments of the performance due to storage limitations, to pave the way for newer programmes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Many performances from the US were not shown on the BBC, and recordings of these performances are missing. There were four separate Audio Trucks in Philadelphia provided by David Hewitt of Remote Recording Services. ABC had taken the decision that no multi track tape recordings would be allowed, so no remixing of the Philadelphia show was possible.\n\n=== Official Live Aid DVD ===\nAn official four-disc DVD set of the Live Aid concerts was released on 8 November 2004. A [[film premiere|premiere]] to launch the new DVD was held on 7 November and shown in [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] surround sound featuring a short compilation of the four-disc set. The screening was held at the [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon Cinema]] in [[Kensington]], London and included guests such as [[Brian May]], [[Anita Dobson]], [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], Bob Geldof and partner Jean Marie, Annie Lennox, Midge Ure, [[Michael Buerk]], [[Gary Kemp]] and [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]].<ref>{{cite news|last= |first=|url=https://brianmay.com/queen/queennews/queennewsnov04a.html|title=Live Aid DVD Launch|work=Brianmay.com|date=8 November 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2019}}</ref> Other theatrical premiere\u2019s were held in [[Zurich]], [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Vienna]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Berlin]].<ref>[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20041112005099/en/Live-Aid-DVD-Premiere-European-Cinemas-DTS Live Aid DVD] \u2013 Premiere at European Cinemas in DTS Surround Sound; Exclusive Cinema Screenings of the Landmark 1985 Concert Recording Played in 5.1 DTS Digital Surround, 12 November 2004</ref> A 52-minute compilation was later released as a limited edition DVD in July 2005 titled ''20 Years Ago Today: Live Aid''.<ref>[http://www.dvdmg.com/20yearsagotodayliveaid.shtml 20 Years Ago Today] \u2013 July 2005</ref> The box set contains 10-hour partial footage of the 16-hour length concert. The DVD was produced by Geldof's company, Woodcharm Ltd., and distributed by [[Warner Music Vision]]. The DVD has since been [[out of print]] and no longer available in stores. The decision to finally release it was taken by Bob Geldof nearly 20 years after the original concerts, after he found a number of unlicensed copies of the concert on the Internet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3530269.stm |title=Geldof thwarts 'Live Aid pirate' |work=BBC News |date=3 March 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe most complete footage that exists is used from the [[BBC]] source, and this was the main source of the DVD. During production on the official DVD, [[MTV]] lent Woodcharm Ltd. their B-roll and alternate camera footage where MTV provided extra footage of the Philadelphia concert (where ABC had erased the tapes from the command of Bob Geldof). Songs that were not originally littered with ads were also used on the official DVD.\n\nWorking from the BBC and MTV footage, several degrees of dramatic license were taken, in order to release the concert on DVD. Many songs had their soundtracks altered for the DVD release, mainly in sequences where there were originally microphone problems. In one of those instances, Paul McCartney had re-recorded his failed vocals for \"Let It Be\" in a studio the day after the concert (14 July 1985) but it was never used until the release of the DVD. Also, in the US finale, the original USA for Africa studio track for \"We Are the World\" was overlaid in places where the microphone was absent (consequently, it includes the vocals of [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[James Ingram]], two artists who did not even take part in Live Aid).\n\nSome artists did not want their performances to be featured on the DVD. At their own request, [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Santana (band)|Santana]] were omitted. The former defended their decision not to be included on the grounds that their performance was 'sub-standard', but to lend their support, [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] pledged to donate proceeds from the DVD release of ''Page & Plant: No Quarter'' to the campaign, and [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] pledged proceeds from his American tour with [[Mutual Admiration Society (collaboration)|Mutual Admiration Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm |title=Zeppelin defend Live Aid opt out |website=BBC News |date=4 August 2004 |accessdate=29 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nJudicious decisions were also made on which acts would be included and which ones would not, due to either technical difficulties in the original performances, the absence of original footage, or for music rights reasons. [[Rick Springfield]], [[the Four Tops]], [[the Hooters]], [[The Power Station (band)|the Power Station]], [[Billy Ocean]] and [[Kool and the Gang]]<nowiki/> were among those acts that were left off the DVD. Several artists who did feature on the DVD also had songs that were performed omitted. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] performed three solo songs in the concert, but only two were included on the DVD (\"Love Makes the World Go Round\" was omitted). Phil Collins played \"Against All Odds\" and \"In the Air Tonight\" at both Wembley and JFK, but only the London performance of the former and the Philadelphia performance of the latter were included on the DVD. The JFK performance of \"Against All Odds\" was later included on Collins' ''Finally ... The First Farewell Tour'' DVD. [[Tom Petty]] performed four songs, and only two were included on DVD. Patti LaBelle played six songs but only two songs were included.\n\nIn 2007, [[Queen (band)|Queen]] released a special edition of ''[[Queen Rock Montreal]]'' on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD formats containing their 1981 concert from [[Montreal Forum|The Forum]] in Montreal, Canada, and their complete Live Aid performance, along with Freddie Mercury and Brian May performing \"[[Is This the World We Created...?]]\" from the UK Live Aid finale, all re-mixed in DTS 5.1 sound by Justin Shirley-Smith \u2014 this marked the first Live Aid material officially released in a high-definition/Blu-ray format. Also included is their Live Aid rehearsal, and an interview with the band, from earlier in the week.\n\nOn its release, the then British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]], decided the [[VAT]] collected on sales of the Live Aid DVD would be given back to the charity, which would raise an extra \u00a35 for every DVD sold.\n\nOn 14 November 2004, the DVD entered the UK Official [[UK Music Charts|Music Video Chart]] at number one and stayed in the top position for twelve consecutive weeks.<ref name=\"Official Music Video Chart Top 50\">[https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/music-video-chart/20041114/13/ Official Music Video Chart Top 50] \u2013 14 November 2004 \u2013 20 November 2004</ref>\n\n====Charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable unsortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Many of these recordings were in mono, because in the mid-1980s most home video machines could only record mono sound, and also because the [[Europe]]an [[BBC TV]] broadcast was in mono. The US MTV broadcast, the [[ABC Radio Network]] and [[BBC Radio 1]] simulcasts were stereo. These recordings circulated among collectors, and in recent years, have also appeared on the Internet in [[file sharing networks]].\n\nSince the official DVD release of Live Aid includes only partial footage of this event, unofficial distribution sources continue to be the only source of the most complete recordings of this event. The official DVD is the only authorised video release in which proceeds go directly to famine relief, the cause that the concert was originally intended to help.\n\n== Technical ==\n=== Wembley sound system ===\nThe Wembley speaker system was provided by Hill Pro Audio.
