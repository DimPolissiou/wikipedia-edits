Such wings comprise two layers of fabric that are connected to internal supporting material in such a way as to form a row of cells. By leaving most of the cells open only at the leading edge, incoming air keeps the wing inflated, thus maintaining its shape. When inflated, the wing's cross-section has the typical teardrop aerofoil shape. Modern paraglider wings are made of high-performance non-porous materials such as [[ripstop polyester]]<ref>{{cite book | author=Dan Poynter|title=The Parachute Manual: A Technical Treatise on Aerodynamic Decelerators| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PopFBjLZV8C&pg=PA77| accessdate=28 December 2012| date=1 May 1991| publisher=Para Publishing| isbn=978-0-915516-80-3| page=77}}</ref> or [[nylon]] fabric.<ref group=\"note\">e.g. Gelvenor OLKS</ref>\n\nIn some modern paragliders (from the 1990s onwards), especially higher-performance wings, some of the cells of the leading edge are closed to form a cleaner aerodynamic profile. Holes in the internal ribs allow a free flow of air from the open cells to these closed cells to inflate them, and also to the wingtips, which are also closed.<ref>[http://www.para2000.org/wings/index.html Paraglider wing information]; para2000.org</ref>\n\nThe pilot is supported underneath the wing by a network of suspension lines. These start with two sets of risers made of short (40&nbsp;cm) lengths of strong webbing. Each set is attached to the harness by a [[carabiner]], one on each side of the pilot, and each riser of a set is generally attached to lines from only one row of its side of wing. At the end of each riser of the set, there is a small [[maillon|delta maillon]] with a number (2 \u2013 5) of lines attached, forming a fan. These are typically 4 \u2013 5 metres long, with the end attached to 2 \u2212 4 further lines of around 2 m, which are again joined to a group of smaller, thinner lines. In some cases this is repeated for a fourth cascade.\n\nThe top of each line is attached to small fabric loops sewn into the structure of the wing, which are generally arranged in rows running span-wise (i.e., side to side). The row of lines nearest the front are known as the A lines, the next row back the B lines, and so on.<ref name=\"PagenPF\">{{citation | last=Pagen| first=Dennis| title=Paragliding Flight: Walking on Air| year=1990| publisher=Pagen Books |isbn=0-936310-09-X}}</ref> A typical wing will have A, B, C and D lines, but recently, there has been a tendency to reduce the rows of lines to three, or even two (and experimentally to one), to reduce drag.\n\nParaglider lines are usually made from [[Dyneema]]/Spectra or [[Kevlar]]/[[Aramid]].<ref name=\"PagenPF\"/>  Although they look rather slender, these materials are immensely strong. For example, a single 0.66&nbsp;mm-diameter line (about the thinnest used) can have a breaking strength of 56&nbsp;kg.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ojovolador.com/eng/read/reports/lines/index.htm |title=Paragliding lines |author=Steve Uzochukwu |publisher=Skywings Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029221547/http://www.ojovolador.com/eng/read/reports/lines/index.htm |archivedate=2011-10-29 }}</ref>\n\nParaglider wings typically have an area of {{convert|20| - |35|m2|ft2}} with a span of {{convert|8| - |12|m|ft}} and weigh {{convert|3| - |7|kg|lb}}. Combined weight of wing, harness, reserve, instruments, helmet, etc. is around {{convert|12| - |22|kg|lb}}.\n\nThe [[glide ratio]] of paragliders ranges from 9.3 for recreational wings to about 11.3 for modern competition models,<ref>FAI Website {{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/paragliding |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512031116/http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/paragliding |archivedate=2010-05-12 }}</ref> reaching in some cases up to 13.<ref>U6 at glide ratio competition 2013 http://www.aircross.eu/net/u6-made-longest-flight-at-glide-ratio-competition-2013/?lang=en</ref> For comparison, a typical skydiving parachute will achieve about 3:1 glide. A hang glider ranges from 9.5 for recreational wings to about 16.5 for modern competition models. An idling (gliding) [[Cessna 152]] light aircraft will achieve 9:1. Some [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplanes]] can achieve a glide ratio of up to 72:1.\n\nThe speed range of paragliders is typically {{convert|20|-|75|km/h|mph}}, from [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed to maximum speed. Beginner wings will be in the lower part of this range, high-performance wings in the upper part of the range.<ref group=\"note\">Note:The range for safe flying will be somewhat smaller.</ref>\n\nFor storage and carrying, the wing is usually folded into a stuffsack (bag), which can then be stowed in a large backpack along with the harness. For pilots who may not want the added weight or fuss of a backpack, some modern harnesses include the ability to turn the harness inside out such that it becomes a backpack.\n\nParagliders are unique among human-carrying aircraft in being easily portable. The complete equipment packs into a rucksack and can be carried easily on the pilot's back, in a car, or on public transport.<ref name=\"PagenPF\"/> In comparison with other air sports, this substantially simplifies travel to a suitable takeoff spot, the selection of a landing place and return travel.\n\nTandem paragliders, designed to carry the pilot and one passenger, are larger but otherwise similar. They usually fly faster with higher trim speeds, are more resistant to collapse, and have a slightly higher sink rate compared to solo paragliders.\n\n=== Harness ===\n[[File:Gurtzeug (Gleitschirm).jpg|thumb|upright|A pilot with harness (light blue), performing a reverse launch]]\n[[File:Iran Military Paraglider Hang-glider Qualification Badge.svg|thumb|200px|[[Iran Army]] Paraglider and Hang-glider Badge]]\n\nThe pilot is loosely and comfortably buckled into a harness, which offers support in both the standing and sitting positions. Most harnesses have foam or airbag protectors underneath the seat and behind the back to reduce the impact on failed launches or landings. Modern harnesses are designed to be as comfortable as a lounge chair in the sitting or reclining position. Many harnesses even have an adjustable \"[[lumbar support]]\". A reserve [[parachute]] is also typically connected to a paragliding harness.\n\nHarnesses also vary according to the need of the pilot, and thereby come in a range of designs, mostly: \nTraining harness for beginners,\nPax harness for tandem passengers that often also doubles as a training harness,\nXC Harness for long distance cross country flights,\nAll round harness for basic to intermediate pilots,\nPod harness, which is for intermediate to pro pilots that focus on XC.\nAcro harnesses are special designs for acrobatic pilots,\nKids tandem harnesses are also now available with special child-proof locks.\n\n=== Instruments ===\nMost pilots use [[variometer]]s, [[Two-way radio|radio]]s, and, increasingly, [[GPS navigation device|GPS units]] when they are flying.\n\n;Variometer\n{{main|Variometer}}\nThe main purpose of a variometer is in helping a pilot find and stay in the \"core\" of a thermal to maximise height gain and, conversely, to indicate when a pilot is in sinking air and needs to find rising air.\nHumans can sense the [[acceleration]] when they first hit a thermal, but cannot detect the difference between constant rising air and constant sinking air. Modern [[variometer]]s are capable of detecting rates of climb or sink of 1&nbsp;cm per second.\nA variometer indicates climb rate (or sink-rate) with short audio signals (beeps, which increase in pitch and tempo during ascent, and a droning sound, which gets deeper as the rate of descent increases) and/or a visual display. It also shows [[altitude]]: either above takeoff, above [[sea level]], or (at higher altitudes) [[flight level]].\n\n;Radio\nRadio communications are used in training, to communicate with other pilots, and to report where and when they intend to land. These radios normally operate on a range of frequencies in different countries\u2014some authorised,<ref>''[http://www.glidercom.com/store/radio_faq.html#What%20are%20USHPA%20frequencies,%20do%20I%20need%20a%20license?

Some local authorities (e.g., flight clubs) offer periodic automated weather updates on these frequencies. In rare cases, pilots use radios to talk to airport control towers or air traffic controllers.\nMany pilots carry a cell phone so they can call for pickup should they land away from their intended point of destination.\n\n;GPS\n[[GPS]] (global positioning system) is a necessary accessory when flying competitions, where it has to be demonstrated that [[waypoint|way-points]] have been correctly passed.\nThe recorded GPS track of a flight can be used to analyze flying technique or can be shared with other pilots. GPS is also used to determine drift due to the prevailing wind when flying at altitude, providing position information to allow restricted airspace to be avoided and identifying one's location for retrieval teams after landing out in unfamiliar territory.\nGPS is integrated with some models of variometer. This is not only more convenient, but also allows for a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] record of the flight. The [[navigational track|flight track]] can be used as proof for record claims, replacing the \"old\" method of photo documentation.\n\n== Ground Handling ==\n\nParaglider ground handling, also known as kiting, is the practice of handling the paraglider on land. The primary purpose of ground handling is to practice the skills necessary for launching and landing. However, ground handling could be considered a fun and challenging sport in and of itself.\n\nGround handling is considered an essential part of most paragliding curriculums.\n\n=== Location ===\nThe ideal kiting location for beginning students has the following characteristics:\n* Flat ground (to avoid accidental launches).\n* Free of obstructions that might create a trip or snag hazzard.\n* Soft surface, such as grass or sand, to reduce damage to the handler and wing in case of falls.\n* Steady, laminar [[wind speed]] between {{cvt|1|and|4|m/s|km/h|round=5}}.\n\nAs pilots progress, they may challenge themselves by kiting over and around obstacles, in strong or turbulent wind, and on slopes.\n\n== Flying ==\n[[File:Parapente3D.svg|thumb|left|alt=3d CAD drawing of a paraglider|3d CAD drawing of a paraglider showing the upper surface in green, the lower surface in blue and the leading edge openings in pink.

The wing is placed into an airstream, either by running or being pulled, or an existing wind. The wing moves up over the pilot into a position in which it can carry the passenger. The pilot is then lifted from the ground and, after a safety period, can sit down into his harness. Unlike skydivers, paragliders, like hang gliders, do not \"jump\" at any time during this process. There are two launching techniques used on higher ground<ref>{{cite web|author1=Peter Cr\u00f6niger|title=Aufziehen Kontrollieren Starten|publisher=DHV|accessdate=5 December 2014|url=http://www.dhv.de/web/fileadmin/user_upload/files/2014/sicherheit/Croe_Artikel/artikel_aufziehen_kontrollieren_starten.pdf|pages=41\u201342|language=german|format=pdf|date=July 2007}}</ref> and one assisted launch technique used in flatland areas:\n\n==== Forward launch ====\nIn low winds, the wing is inflated with a forward launch, where the pilot runs forward with the wing behind so that the air pressure generated by the forward movement inflates the wing.\n\nIt is often easier, because the pilot only has to run forward, but the pilot cannot see his wing until it is above him, where he has to check it in a very short time for correct inflation and untangled lines before the launch.\n\n==== Reverse launch ====\n[[File:Paraglider launch Mam Tor.ogv|thumb|right|Paraglider reverse launch, [[Mam Tor]], England]]\nIn higher winds, a reverse launch is used, with the pilot facing the wing to bring it up into a flying position, then turning around under the wing and running to complete the launch.\n\nReverse launches have a number of advantages over a forward launch. It is more straightforward to inspect the wing and check if the lines are free as it leaves the ground. In the presence of wind, the pilot can be tugged toward the wing, and facing the wing makes it easier to resist this force and safer in case the pilot slips (as opposed to being dragged backwards). However, the movement pattern is more complex than forward launch, and the pilot has to hold the brakes in a correct way and turn to the correct side so he does not tangle the lines. These launches are normally attempted with a reasonable wind speed, making the ground speed required to pressurise the wing much lower.\n\nThe launch is initiated by the hands raising the leading edge with the As. As it rises the wing is controlled more by centring the feet than by use of the brakes or Cs. With mid level wings (EN C and D) the wing may try to \"overshoot\" the pilot as it nears the top. This is checked with  Cs or brakes. The wing becomes increasingly sensitive to the Cs and brakes as its internal air pressure rises. This is usually felt from increasing lift of the wing applying harness pressure to the \"seat of the pants\". That pressure indicates that the wing is likely to remain stable when the pilot pirouettes to face the wind.\n\nThe next step in the launch is to bring the wing into the lift zone. There are two techniques for accomplishing this depending on wind conditions. In light wind this is usually done after turning to the front, steering with the feet towards the low wing tip, and applying light brakes in a natural sense to keep the wing horizontal. In stronger wind conditions it is often found to be easier to remain facing downwind while moving slowly and steadily backwards into the wind.\n\nKnees bent to load the wing, foot adjustments to remain central and minimum use of Cs or Brakes to keep the wing horizontal. Pirouette when the feet are close to lifting. This option has two distinct advantages. a) The pilot can see the wing centre marker (an aid to centring the feet) and, if necessary, b) the pilot can move briskly towards the wing to assist with an emergency deflation.\n\nWith either method it is essential to check \"traffic\" across the launch face before committing to flight.\n\n==== Towed launch ====\n[[File:Parapente.ogg|thumb|right|Paraglider launching in [[Arax\u00e1]], Brazil]][[File:Mussel Rock Gliding Bluffs - Pacifica, California.webm|left|thumb|A paragliding flight over the Mussel Rock Gliding Bluffs in [[Pacifica, California]]]]\nIn flatter countryside, pilots can also be launched with a tow. Once at full height (towing can launch pilots up to 3000 feet altitude), the pilot pulls a release cord, and the towline falls away. This requires separate training, as flying on a winch has quite different characteristics from free flying. There are two major ways to tow: pay-in and pay-out towing. Pay-in towing involves a stationary winch that winds in the towline and thereby pulls the pilot in the air. The distance between winch and pilot at the start is around 500 metres or more. Pay-out towing involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, that pays out line slower than the speed of the object, thereby pulling the pilot up in the air. In both cases, it is very important to have a gauge indicating line tension to avoid pulling the pilot out of the air. Another form of towing is \"static line\" towing. This involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, attached to a paraglider or hang glider with a fixed-length line. This can be very dangerous, because now the forces on the line have to be controlled by the moving object itself, which is almost impossible to do, unless stretchy rope and a pressure/tension meter (dynamometer) is used. Static line towing with stretchy rope and a load cell as a tension meter has been used in Poland, Ukraine, Russia, and other Eastern European countries for over twenty years (under the name ''Malinka'') with about the same safety record as other forms of towing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paraplan.ru/forum/topic/49704|title=\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438. :: \u0424\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c\u044b Paraplan.Ru|publisher=}}</ref>  One more form of towing is hand towing. This is where 1\u22123 people pull a paraglider using a tow rope of up to 500 feet.

Once the correct height (about a metre above ground) is achieved the pilot will 'stall' the glider in order to land.\n\n==== Traffic pattern ====\nUnlike during launch, where coordination between multiple pilots is straightforward, landing involves more planning, because more than one pilot might have to land at the same time. Therefore, a specific [[Airfield traffic pattern|traffic pattern]] has been established. Pilots line up into a position above the airfield and to the side of the landing area, which is dependent on the wind direction, where they can lose height (if necessary) by flying circles. From this position, they follow the legs of a flightpath in a rectangular pattern to the landing zone: downwind leg, base leg, and final approach. This allows for synchronization between multiple pilots and reduces the risk of collisions, because a pilot can anticipate what other pilots around him are going to do next.\n\n==== Techniques ====\nLanding involves lining up for an approach into wind and, just before touching down, \"flaring\" the wing to minimise vertical and/or horizontal speed. This consists of gently going from 0% brake at around two metres to 100% brake when touching down on the ground.\n\nDuring the approach descent, at around four metres before touching ground, some momentary braking (50% for around two seconds) can be applied then released, thus using forward pendular momentum to gain speed for flaring more effectively and approaching the ground with minimal vertical speed.\n\nIn light winds, some minor running is common. In moderate to medium headwinds, the landings can be without forward speed, or even going backwards with respect to the ground in strong winds. Landing with winds which force the pilot backwards are particularly hazardous as there is a potential to tumble and be dragged. While the wing is vertically above the pilot there is potential for a reduced risk deflation. This involves taking the leading edge lines (As) in each hand at the mallion/riser junction and applying the pilot's full weight with a deep knee bend action. In almost every case the wing's leading edge will fly forward a little and then \"tuck\". It is then likely to collapse and descend upwind of the pilot. On the ground it will be restrained by the pilot's legs.\n\nLanding in winds which are too strong for the wing is to be avoided where-ever possible. During approach to the intended landing site this potential problem is often obvious and there may be opportunities to extend the flight to find a more sheltered landing area. On every landing it is desirable to have the wing remain flyable with a small amount of forward momentum. This makes deflation much more controllable. While the midsection lines (Bs) are vertical there is much less chance of the wing moving downwind fast. The common deflation cue comes from a vigorous tug on the rear risers' lines (Cs or Ds). Promptly rotate to face down wind, maintain pressure on the rear risers and take brisk steps towards the wing as it falls. With practice there is potential for precision enabling safe \"trouble free parking\".\n\nFor strong winds during the landing approach, \"flapping\" the wing (symmetrical pulsing of brakes) is a common option on final. It reduces the wing's lift performance. The descent rate is increases by the alternate application and release of the brakes about once per second. (The amount of brake applied in each cycle being variable but about 25%.) The system depends on the pilot's wing familiarity. The wing must not become stalled. This should be established with gentle applications in flight, at a safe height, in good conditions and with an observer providing feedback. As a rule the manufacturer has set the safe-brake-travel-range based on average body proportions for pilots in the approved weight range. Making changes to that setting should be undertaken in small increases, with tell-tale marks showing the variations and a test flight to confirm the desired effect. Shortening the brake lines can produce the problematic effect of making the wing sluggish. Lengthening brakes excessively can make it hard to bring the wing to a safe touchdown speed.\n\nAlternative approach techniques for landing in strong winds include the use of a speed bar and big ears. A speed bar increases wing penetration and adds a small increase in the vertical descent rate. This makes it easier to adjust descent rates during a formal circuit. In an extreme situation it might be advisable to stand on the speed bar, after shifting out of the harness, and stay on it till touchdown and deflation. Big ears are commonly applied during circuit height management. The vertical descent speed is increased and that advantage can be used to bring the glider to an appropriate circuit joining height. Most manufacturers change the operation technique for big ears in advanced models. It is common for Big Ears in C-rated gliders to remain folded in after the control line is released. In those cases the wing can be landed with reasonable safety with big ears deployed. In those wing types  it usually takes two or three symmetrical pumps with brakes, over a second or two, to re-inflate the tips. In lower rated wings the Big Ears need the line to remain held to hold the ears in. While they are held-in the wing tends to respond to weight shift slightly better (due to reduced effective area) on the roll axis. They auto re-inflate when the line is released. In general those wings are better suited to the situation where the ears are pulled in simply to get rid of excess height.  Full-wing flight should then be resumed during base leg or several seconds before touch down. Wing familiarity is a key ingredient in applying these controls. Pilots should practise in medium conditions in a safe area, at a safe height and with options for landing.\n\n=== Control ===\n[[File:Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur parapente.gif|right|thumb|upright|Speedbar mechanism]]\n\nBrakes: Controls held in each of the pilot's hands connect to the trailing edge of the left and right sides of the wing. These controls are called \"brakes\" and provide the primary and most general means of control in a paraglider. The brakes are used to adjust speed, to steer (in addition to weight shift), and to flare (during landing).\n\nWeight shift: In addition to manipulating the brakes, a paraglider pilot must also lean in order to steer properly. Such weight shifting can also be used for more limited steering when brake use is unavailable, such as when under \"big ears\" (see below). More advanced control techniques may also involve weight shifting.\n\nSpeed bar: A kind of foot control called the \"speed bar\" (also \"accelerator\") attaches to the paragliding harness and connects to the leading edge of the paraglider wing, usually through a system of at least two pulleys (see animation in margin). This control is used to increase speed and does so by decreasing the wing's [[angle of attack]]. This control is necessary because the brakes can only slow the wing from what is called \"trim speed\" (no brakes applied). The accelerator is needed to go faster than this.\n\nMore advanced means of control can be obtained by manipulating the paraglider's risers or lines directly. Most commonly, the lines connecting to the outermost points of the wing's leading edge can be used to induce the wingtips to fold under. The technique, known as \"big ears\", is used to increase the rate of descent (see picture and the full description below). The risers connecting to the rear of the wing can also be manipulated for steering if the brakes have been severed or are otherwise unavailable. For ground-handling purposes, a direct manipulation of these lines can be more effective and offer more control than the brakes. The effect of sudden wind blasts can be countered by directly pulling on the risers and making the wing unflyable, thereby avoiding falls or unintentional takeoffs.\n\n==== Fast descents ====\nProblems with \u201cgetting down\u201d can occur when the lift situation is very good or when the weather changes unexpectedly. There are three possibilities for rapidly reducing altitude in such situations, each of which has benefits and issues to be aware of. The \"big ears\" manoeuvre induces descent rates of 2.5 to 3.5&nbsp;m/s, 4\u20136&nbsp;m/s with additional speed bar. It is the most controllable of the techniques and the easiest for beginners to learn. The B-line stall induces descent rates of 6\u201310&nbsp;m/s. It increases loading on parts of the wing (the pilot's weight is mostly on the B-lines, instead of spread across all the lines). Finally, a spiral dive offers the fastest rate of descent, at 7\u201325&nbsp;m/s. It places greater loads on the wing than other techniques do and requires the highest level of skill from the pilot to execute safely.\n\n;Big ears\n[[File:Paragliding big ears.gif|thumb|Paraglider in \"Big Ears\" manoeuvre]]\n:Pulling on the outer A-lines during non-accelerated, normal flight folds the wing tips inwards, which substantially reduces the glide angle with only a small decrease in forward speed. As the effective wing area is reduced, the [[wing loading]] is increased, and it becomes more stable. However, the [[angle of attack]] is increased, and the craft is closer to stall speed, but this can be ameliorated by applying the speed bar, which also increases the descent rate. When the lines are released, the wing re-inflates. If necessary, a short pumping on the brakes helps reentering normal flight. Compared to the other techniques, with big ears, the wing still glides forward, which enables the pilot to leave an area of danger. Even landing this way is possible, e.g., if the pilot has to counter an updraft on a slope.\n\n;B-line stall\n:In a B-line stall, the second set of risers from the leading-edge/front (the B-lines) are pulled down independently of the other risers, with the specific lines used to initiate a [[stall (flight)|stall]]. This puts a spanwise crease in the wing, thereby separating the airflow from the upper surface of the wing. It dramatically reduces the lift produced by the canopy and thus induces a higher rate of descent. This can be a strenuous manoeuvre, because these B-lines have to be held in this position, and the tension of the wing puts an upwards force on these lines. The release of these lines has to be handled carefully not to provoke a too fast forward shooting of the wing, which the pilot then could fall into. This is less popular now as it induces high loads on the internal structure of the wing.\n\n;Spiral dive\n:The spiral dive is the most rapid form of controlled fast descent; an aggressive spiral dive can achieve a sink rate of 25&nbsp;m/s. This manoeuvre halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes on one side and shifts his weight onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the wing points directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this manoeuvre by slowly releasing the inner brake, shifting his weight to the outer side and braking on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the spiral dive gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.\n:Spiral dives put a strong [[G-force]] on the wing and glider and must be done carefully and skilfully. The G-forces involved can induce blackouts, and the rotation can produce [[Orientation (mental)|disorientation]]. Some high-end gliders have what is called a \"stable spiral problem\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyozone.com/paragliders/de/learn/tips-and-advice/spiral-dives-and-stable-spiral/|title=Ozone Paragliders > InfoZone > Tipps und Ratschl\u00e4ge|publisher=}}</ref> After inducing a spiral and without further pilot input, some wings do not automatically return to normal flight and stay inside their spiral. Serious injury and fatal accidents have occurred when pilots could not exit this manoeuvre and spiralled into the ground.\n\nThe rate of rotation in a spiral dive can be reduced by using a drogue chute, deployed just before the spiral is induced. This reduces the G forces experienced.<ref>{{cite web|title=PRODUCTS THE ANTI-G :: INFO|url=http://www.flyozone.com/paragliders/en/products/reserves-chutes/the-anti-g/info/|publisher=Ozone|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Soaring ===\n[[File:Paraglider ridge soaring at Torrey Pines.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Ridge soaring along the California coast]]\nSoaring flight is achieved by using wind directed upwards by a fixed object such as a [[dune]] or [[ridge]].\nIn slope soaring, pilots fly along the length of a slope feature in the landscape, relying on the lift provided by the air, which is forced up as it passes over the slope. Slope soaring is highly dependent on a steady wind within a defined range (the suitable range depends on the performance of the wing and the skill of the pilot). Too little wind, and insufficient lift is available to stay airborne (pilots end up scratching along the slope). With more wind, gliders can fly well above and forward of the slope, but too much wind, and there is a risk of being blown back over the slope. A particular form of ridge soaring is \"condo soaring\", where pilots soar a row of buildings that form an artificial \"ridge\". This form of soaring is particularly used in flat lands where there are no natural ridges, but there are plenty of man-made, building \"ridges\".\n\n=== Thermal flying ===\n[[File:paragliding3.jpg|thumb|Paragliders in the air at [[Torrey Pines Gliderport]]]]\nWhen the sun warms the ground, it will warm some features more than others (such as rock faces or large buildings), and these set off thermals which rise through the air. Sometimes these may be a simple rising column of air; more often, they are blown sideways in the wind and will break off from the source, with a new thermal forming later.\n\nOnce a pilot finds a thermal, he begins to fly in a circle, trying to centre the circle on the strongest part of the thermal (the \"core\"), where the air is rising the fastest. Most pilots use a [[Variometer|vario]]-[[altimeter]] (\"vario\"), which indicates climb rate with beeps and/or a visual display, to help core in on a thermal.\n\nOften there is strong sink surrounding thermals, and there is also strong turbulence resulting in wing collapses as a pilot tries to enter a strong thermal. Good thermal flying is a skill that takes time to learn, but a good pilot can often core a thermal all the way to [[cloud base]].\n\n=== Cross-country flying ===\nOnce the skills of using thermals to gain altitude have been mastered, pilots can glide from one thermal to the next to go cross country. Having gained altitude in a thermal, a pilot glides down to the next available thermal.\n\nPotential thermals can be identified by land features that typically generate thermals or by [[cumulus cloud]]s, which mark the top of a rising column of warm, humid air as it reaches the [[dew point]] and [[Condensation|condenses]] to form a cloud.\n\nCross-country pilots also need an intimate familiarity with air law, flying regulations, aviation maps indicating restricted airspace, etc.\n\n=== In-flight wing deflation (collapse) ===\nSince the shape of the wing (airfoil) is formed by the moving air entering and inflating the wing, in turbulent air, part or all of the wing can deflate (collapse). Piloting techniques referred to as \"active flying\" will greatly reduce the frequency and severity of deflations or collapses. On modern recreational wings, such deflations will normally recover without pilot intervention. In the event of a severe deflation, correct pilot input will speed recovery from a deflation, but incorrect pilot input may slow the return of the glider to normal flight, so pilot training and practice in correct response to deflations are necessary.\n\nFor the rare occasions when it is not possible to recover from a deflation (or from other threatening situations such as a spin), most pilots carry a reserve (rescue, emergency) parachute (or even two); however, most pilots never have cause to \"throw\" their reserve. Should a wing deflation occur at low altitude, i.e., shortly after takeoff or just before landing, the wing (paraglider) may not recover its correct structure rapidly enough to prevent an accident, with the pilot often not having enough altitude remaining to deploy a reserve parachute [with the minimum altitude for this being approximately {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but typical deployment to stabilization periods using up {{convert|120|\u2013|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} of altitude] successfully. Different packing methods of the reserve parachute affect its deploying time.\n\nLow-altitude wing failure can result in serious injury or [[death]] due to the subsequent velocity of a ground impact where, paradoxically, a higher altitude failure may allow more time to regain some degree of control in the descent rate and, critically, deploy the reserve if needed. In-flight wing deflation and other hazards are minimized by flying a suitable glider and choosing appropriate weather conditions and locations for the pilot's skill and experience level.\n\n== As a competitive sport ==\n[[File:Pegalajar (Ja\u00e9n) parapente (RPS 23-08-2014).png|thumbnail|Practicing paragliding in [[Pegalajar]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]] - Spain)]]\n\nThere are various disciplines of competitive paragliding:\n* '''Cross-country flying''' is the classical form of paragliding competitions with championships in club, regional, national and international levels (see [[Paragliding World Cup|PWC]]).\n* '''[[Aerobatics|Aerobatic competitions]]''' demand the participants to perform certain manoeuvres. Competitions are held for individual pilots as well as for pairs that show synchronous performances. This form is the most spectacular for spectators on the ground to watch.\n* '''Hike & Fly''' competitions, in which a certain route has to be flown or hiked only over several days: [[Red Bull X-Alps]] \u2013 the unofficial world championship in this category of competition first launched in 2003 and has since taken place every other year.\n\nIn addition to these organized events it is also possible to participate in various online contests that require participants to upload flight track data to dedicated websites like [[Online Contest (gliding)|OLC]].\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:Decolagemparapente.ogg|right|thumb|'''Paraglider launch''' video in [[Arax\u00e1]], Brazil]]\nParagliding, like any [[extreme sport]], is a potentially dangerous activity. In the United States, for example, in 2010 (the last year for which details are available<ref name=\"US Paragliding Injury Summary\">{{cite web|last=Steed|first=Mike|title=2010 US Paragliding Injury Summary|url=https://www.ushpa.org/page/download.aspx?DocKey=767|publisher=The United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>), one paraglider pilot died. This is an equivalent rate of one in 5,000 pilots. Over the years 1994\u22122010, an average of seven in every 10,000 active paraglider pilots have been fatally injured, though with a marked improvement in recent years. In France (with over 25,000 registered fliers), two of every 10,000 pilots were fatally injured in 2011 (a rate that is not atypical of the years 2007\u22122011), although around six of every 1,000 pilots were seriously injured (more than two-day hospital stay).<ref name=\"2011 FFVL Member Accident Report\" />\n\nThe potential for injury can be significantly reduced by training and risk management. The use of proper equipment such as a wing designed for the pilot's size and skill level,<ref>{{cite web|title=EN 926-2:2005|url=http://esearch.cen.eu/esearch/Details.aspx?id=7955730}}</ref> as well as a helmet, a reserve parachute,<ref>{{cite web|title=EN 12491:2001|url=http://esearch.cen.eu/esearch/Details.aspx?id=7955323}}</ref> and a cushioned harness<ref>{{cite web|title=EN 1651:1999|url=http://esearch.cen.eu/esearch/Details.aspx?id=7938699}}</ref> also minimize risk. Pilot safety is influenced by an understanding of the site conditions such as air turbulence (rotors), strong thermals, gusty wind, and ground obstacles such as power lines. Sufficient pilot training in wing control and emergency manoeuvres from competent instructors can minimize accidents. Many paragliding accidents are the result of a combination of pilot error and poor flying conditions.\n\n'''SIV (\u2018Simulation d\u2019Incident en Vol\u2019)'''\n\nSIV, short for Simulation d\u2019Incident en Vol (simulation of incident in flight) are courses which offer teaching in dealing with unstable and potentially dangerous situations such as collapses, full stalls, and cravattes. These courses are typically led by a specially trained instructor over large bodies of water, with the student usually being instructed via radio. Students will be taught how to induce dangerous situations, and thus learn how to both avoid and remedy them once induced. This course is recommended to pilots who are looking to move to more high performance and less stable wings, which is a natural progression for most pilots. In some countries an SIV course is a basic requirement of initial pilot training. In the event of an unrecoverable manoeuvre resulting in water landing, a rescue boat is typically dispatched to collect the pilot. Other added safety features may include buoyancy aids or secondary reserve parachutes. These courses are not considered essential for novice level flying.\n\n==Instruction==\nMost popular paragliding regions have a number of schools, generally registered with and/or organized by national associations. Certification systems vary widely between countries, though around 10 days instruction to basic certification is standard.\n\n[[File:Img20040730 0302 at neustift.jpg|thumb|Flying above [[Stubaital]], Austria]]\n[[File:Paragliding at Langkisau Hill - Painan 2009.JPG|thumb|Tandem Paragliding at [[Painan]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n[[File:Paraglading in elgeyo marakwet.jpg|thumb|Tandem Paraglading in [[Elgeyo Escarpment]]]]\n\nThere are several key components to a paragliding pilot certification instruction program. Initial training for beginning pilots usually begins with some amount of ground school to discuss the basics, including elementary theories of flight as well as basic structure and operation of the paraglider.\n\nStudents then learn how to control the glider on the ground, practising take-offs and controlling the wing 'overhead'. Low, gentle hills are next where students get their first short flights, flying at very low altitudes, to get used to the handling of the wing over varied terrain. Special winches can be used to tow the glider to low altitude in areas that have no hills readily available.\n\nAs their skills progress, students move on to steeper/higher hills (or higher winch tows), making longer flights, and learning to turn the glider, control the glider's speed, then moving on to 360\u00b0 turns, spot landings, \u2018big ears\u2019 (used to increase the rate of descent for the paraglider), and other more advanced techniques. Training instructions are often provided to the student via radio, particularly during the first flights.\n\nA third key component to a complete paragliding instructional program provides substantial background in the key areas of meteorology, aviation law, and general flight area etiquette.\n\nTo give prospective pilots a chance to determine if they would like to proceed with a full pilot training program, most schools offer tandem flights, in which an experienced instructor pilots the paraglider with the prospective pilot as a passenger. Schools often offer pilot's families and friends the opportunity to fly tandem, and sometimes sell tandem pleasure flights at holiday resorts.\n\nMost recognised courses lead to a national licence and an internationally recognised International Pilot Proficiency Information/Identification card. The IPPI specifies five stages of paragliding proficiency, from the entry level ParaPro 1<ref>{{cite web | title=Paragliding 101: Nepali Style | url=http://drshem.com/2011/11/27/paragliding-one-o-one-nepali-style/ | work=Paragliding 101: Nepali Style | accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> to the most advanced stage 5.

Whereas with [[sky diving]] the parachute is \"only\" a tool to safely return to earth after free fall, the paraglider allows longer flights and the use of thermals.\n\n===Hang gliding===\n[[Hang gliding]] is a close cousin, and hang glider and paraglider launches are often found in proximity to one another.<ref>{{citation | url=http://federation.ffvl.fr/pages/rechercher-un-site-vol| title=French Sites Guide|publisher=FFVL| language=French}}</ref> Despite the considerable difference in equipment, the two activities offer similar pleasures, and some pilots are involved in both sports.\n\n===Powered hang glider===\n\n[[Powered hang glider|Foot-launched powered hang gliders]] are powered by an engine and propeller in pusher configuration. An ordinary hang glider is used for its wing and control frame, and the pilot can foot-launch from a hill or from flat ground. \n\n===Powered paragliding===\n[[Powered paragliding]] is the flying of paragliders with a small engine known as a paramotor attached. Powered paragliding is known as paramotoring and requires extra training alongside regular paragliding training. It is often recommended to become competent in paragliding prior to learning to paramotor in order to know fully what one is doing.\n\n===Speed flying===\n[[Speed flying]], or ''speed riding'', is the separate sport of flying paragliders of a reduced size. These wings have increased speed, though they are not normally capable of [[Paragliding#Soaring|soaring]] flight. The sport involves taking off on [[skis]] or on foot and swooping rapidly down in close proximity to a slope, even periodically touching it if skis are used. These smaller wings are also sometimes used where wind speeds are too high for a full-sized paraglider, although this is invariably at coastal sites where the wind is [[Laminar Flow|laminar]] and not subject to as much mechanical turbulence as inland sites.\n\n===Gliding===\nJust like [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplanes]] and hang gliders, paragliders use thermals to extend the time in the air. Air speed, glide ratio and flight distances are superior to the ones achieved by paragliders. Paragliders on the other hand are able to also facilitate thermals that are too small (because of the much larger turn radius) or too weak for [[gliding]].\n\n<!-- not really sure if the following part even belongs here; I'll leave it for now since it is one of the few nicely cited parts -->\nParagliding can be of local importance as a commercial activity.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.drdjs-rhone-alpes.jeunesse-sports.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Fiche_synthetique_BAssin_Annecien.pdf| accessdate=October 30, 2011| publisher=DRDJS Rhone Alpes| title= Paragliding in the Annecy Basin|language=French| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203090604/http://www.drdjs-rhone-alpes.jeunesse-sports.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Fiche_synthetique_BAssin_Annecien.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last=Kohli|first=M.S.|title=Mountains of India: Tourism, Adventure, Pilgrimage| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIs4zv17HHwC&pg=PA290| year=2004| publisher=Indus Publishing| isbn=978-81-7387-135-1| pages=289\u201390}}</ref>  Paid accompanied tandem flights are available in many mountainous regions, both in the winter and in the summer.

Finally, there are the manufacturers and the associated repair and after-sales services.

The PC had cutouts at the rear and sides that enabled it to be towed into the air and steered, leading to [[parasailing]]/parascending.\n\n[[Domina Jalbert]] invented the [[Parafoil]], which had sectioned cells in an [[Airfoil|aerofoil]] shape; an open leading edge and a closed trailing edge, inflated by passage through the air \u2013 the ''ram-air'' design.

In 1997, Neumark was awarded the Gold Medal of the [http://royalaeroclub.co.uk/medals-and-awards.php?title=&id=54 Royal Aero Club] of the UK. Authors Patrick Gilligan (Canada) and Bertrand Dubuis (Switzerland) wrote the first flight manual, ''The Paragliding Manual'' in 1985, coining the word ''paragliding''.\n\nThese developments were combined in June 1978 by three friends, Jean-Claude B\u00e9temps, Andr\u00e9 Bohn and G\u00e9rard Bosson, from Mieussy, [[Haute-Savoie]], France. After inspiration from an article on slope soaring in the ''Parachute Manual'' magazine by parachutist and publisher Dan Poynter,<ref name=\"flyaboveall.com\"/> they calculated that on a suitable slope, a \"square\" ram-air parachute could be inflated by running down the slope; B\u00e9temps launched from Pointe du Pertuiset, Mieussy, and flew 100 m.

Such wings comprise two layers of fabric that are connected to internal supporting material in such a way as to form a row of cells. By leaving most of the cells open only at the leading edge, incoming air keeps the wing inflated, thus maintaining its shape. When inflated, the wing's cross-section has the typical teardrop aerofoil shape. Modern paraglider wings are made of high-performance non-porous materials such as [[ripstop polyester]]<ref>{{cite book | author=Dan Poynter|title=The Parachute Manual: A Technical Treatise on Aerodynamic Decelerators| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PopFBjLZV8C&pg=PA77| accessdate=28 December 2012| date=1 May 1991| publisher=Para Publishing| isbn=978-0-915516-80-3| page=77}}</ref> or [[nylon]] fabric.<ref group=\"note\">e.g. Gelvenor OLKS</ref>\n\nIn some modern paragliders (from the 1990s onwards), especially higher-performance wings, some of the cells of the leading edge are closed to form a cleaner aerodynamic profile. Holes in the internal ribs allow a free flow of air from the open cells to these closed cells to inflate them, and also to the wingtips, which are also closed.<ref>[http://www.para2000.org/wings/index.html Paraglider wing information]; para2000.org</ref>\n\nThe pilot is supported underneath the wing by a network of suspension lines. These start with two sets of risers made of short (40&nbsp;cm) lengths of strong webbing. Each set is attached to the harness by a [[carabiner]], one on each side of the pilot, and each riser of a set is generally attached to lines from only one row of its side of wing. At the end of each riser of the set, there is a small [[maillon|delta maillon]] with a number (2 \u2013 5) of lines attached, forming a fan. These are typically 4 \u2013 5 metres long, with the end attached to 2 \u2212 4 further lines of around 2 m, which are again joined to a group of smaller, thinner lines. In some cases this is repeated for a fourth cascade.\n\nThe top of each line is attached to small fabric loops sewn into the structure of the wing, which are generally arranged in rows running span-wise (i.e., side to side). The row of lines nearest the front are known as the A lines, the next row back the B lines, and so on.<ref name=\"PagenPF\">{{citation | last=Pagen| first=Dennis| title=Paragliding Flight: Walking on Air| year=1990| publisher=Pagen Books |isbn=0-936310-09-X}}</ref> A typical wing will have A, B, C and D lines, but recently, there has been a tendency to reduce the rows of lines to three, or even two (and experimentally to one), to reduce drag.\n\nParaglider lines are usually made from [[Dyneema]]/Spectra or [[Kevlar]]/[[Aramid]].<ref name=\"PagenPF\"/>  Although they look rather slender, these materials are immensely strong. For example, a single 0.66&nbsp;mm-diameter line (about the thinnest used) can have a breaking strength of 56&nbsp;kg.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.ojovolador.com/eng/read/reports/lines/index.htm |title=Paragliding lines |author=Steve Uzochukwu |publisher=Skywings Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029221547/http://www.ojovolador.com/eng/read/reports/lines/index.htm |archivedate=2011-10-29 }}</ref>\n\nParaglider wings typically have an area of {{convert|20| - |35|m2|ft2}} with a span of {{convert|8| - |12|m|ft}} and weigh {{convert|3| - |7|kg|lb}}. Combined weight of wing, harness, reserve, instruments, helmet, etc. is around {{convert|12| - |22|kg|lb}}.\n\nThe [[glide ratio]] of paragliders ranges from 9.3 for recreational wings to about 11.3 for modern competition models,<ref>FAI Website {{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/paragliding |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512031116/http://www.fai.org/hang_gliding/paragliding |archivedate=2010-05-12 }}</ref> reaching in some cases up to 13.<ref>U6 at glide ratio competition 2013 http://www.aircross.eu/net/u6-made-longest-flight-at-glide-ratio-competition-2013/?lang=en</ref> For comparison, a typical skydiving parachute will achieve about 3:1 glide. A hang glider ranges from 9.5 for recreational wings to about 16.5 for modern competition models. An idling (gliding) [[Cessna 152]] light aircraft will achieve 9:1. Some [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplanes]] can achieve a glide ratio of up to 72:1.\n\nThe speed range of paragliders is typically {{convert|20|-|75|km/h|mph}}, from [[Stall (flight)|stall]] speed to maximum speed. Beginner wings will be in the lower part of this range, high-performance wings in the upper part of the range.<ref group=\"note\">Note:The range for safe flying will be somewhat smaller.</ref>\n\nFor storage and carrying, the wing is usually folded into a stuffsack (bag), which can then be stowed in a large backpack along with the harness. For pilots who may not want the added weight or fuss of a backpack, some modern harnesses include the ability to turn the harness inside out such that it becomes a backpack.\n\nParagliders are unique among human-carrying aircraft in being easily portable. The complete equipment packs into a rucksack and can be carried easily on the pilot's back, in a car, or on public transport.<ref name=\"PagenPF\"/> In comparison with other air sports, this substantially simplifies travel to a suitable takeoff spot, the selection of a landing place and return travel.\n\nTandem paragliders, designed to carry the pilot and one passenger, are larger but otherwise similar. They usually fly faster with higher trim speeds, are more resistant to collapse, and have a slightly higher sink rate compared to solo paragliders.\n\n=== Harness ===\n[[File:Gurtzeug (Gleitschirm).jpg|thumb|upright|A pilot with harness (light blue), performing a reverse launch]]\n[[File:Iran Military Paraglider Hang-glider Qualification Badge.svg|thumb|200px|[[Iran Army]] Paraglider and Hang-glider Badge]]\n\nThe pilot is loosely and comfortably buckled into a harness, which offers support in both the standing and sitting positions. Most harnesses have foam or airbag protectors underneath the seat and behind the back to reduce the impact on failed launches or landings. Modern harnesses are designed to be as comfortable as a lounge chair in the sitting or reclining position. Many harnesses even have an adjustable \"[[lumbar support]]\". A reserve [[parachute]] is also typically connected to a paragliding harness.\n\nHarnesses also vary according to the need of the pilot, and thereby come in a range of designs, mostly: \nTraining harness for beginners,\nPax harness for tandem passengers that often also doubles as a training harness,\nXC Harness for long distance cross country flights,\nAll round harness for basic to intermediate pilots,\nPod harness, which is for intermediate to pro pilots that focus on XC.\nAcro harnesses are special designs for acrobatic pilots,\nKids tandem harnesses are also now available with special child-proof locks.\n\n=== Instruments ===\nMost pilots use [[variometer]]s, [[Two-way radio|radio]]s, and, increasingly, [[GPS navigation device|GPS units]] when they are flying.\n\n;Variometer\n{{main|Variometer}}\nThe main purpose of a variometer is in helping a pilot find and stay in the \"core\" of a thermal to maximise height gain and, conversely, to indicate when a pilot is in sinking air and needs to find rising air.\nHumans can sense the [[acceleration]] when they first hit a thermal, but cannot detect the difference between constant rising air and constant sinking air. Modern [[variometer]]s are capable of detecting rates of climb or sink of 1&nbsp;cm per second.\nA variometer indicates climb rate (or sink-rate) with short audio signals (beeps, which increase in pitch and tempo during ascent, and a droning sound, which gets deeper as the rate of descent increases) and/or a visual display. It also shows [[altitude]]: either above takeoff, above [[sea level]], or (at higher altitudes) [[flight level]].\n\n;Radio\nRadio communications are used in training, to communicate with other pilots, and to report where and when they intend to land.

Some local authorities (e.g., flight clubs) offer periodic automated weather updates on these frequencies. In rare cases, pilots use radios to talk to airport control towers or air traffic controllers.\nMany pilots carry a cell phone so they can call for pickup should they land away from their intended point of destination.\n\n;GPS\n[[GPS]] (global positioning system) is a necessary accessory when flying competitions, where it has to be demonstrated that [[waypoint|way-points]] have been correctly passed.\nThe recorded GPS track of a flight can be used to analyze flying technique or can be shared with other pilots. GPS is also used to determine drift due to the prevailing wind when flying at altitude, providing position information to allow restricted airspace to be avoided and identifying one's location for retrieval teams after landing out in unfamiliar territory.\nGPS is integrated with some models of variometer. This is not only more convenient, but also allows for a [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] record of the flight. The [[navigational track|flight track]] can be used as proof for record claims, replacing the \"old\" method of photo documentation.\n\n== Ground Handling ==\n\nParaglider ground handling, also known as kiting, is the practice of handling the paraglider on land. The primary purpose of ground handling is to practice the skills necessary for launching and landing. However, ground handling could be considered a fun and challenging sport in and of itself.\n\nGround handling is considered an essential part of most paragliding curriculums.\n\n=== Location ===\nThe ideal kiting location for beginning students has the following characteristics:\n* Flat ground (to avoid accidental launches).\n* Free of obstructions that might create a trip or snag hazzard.\n* Soft surface, such as grass or sand, to reduce damage to the handler and wing in case of falls.\n* Steady, laminar [[wind speed|wind]] between {{cvt|1|and|4|m/s|km/h|round=5}}.\n\nAs pilots progress, they may challenge themselves by kiting over and around obstacles, in strong or turbulent wind, and on slopes.\n\n== Flying ==\n[[File:Parapente3D.svg|thumb|left|alt=3d CAD drawing of a paraglider|3d CAD drawing of a paraglider showing the upper surface in green, the lower surface in blue and the leading edge openings in pink.

The wing is placed into an airstream, either by running or being pulled, or an existing wind. The wing moves up over the pilot into a position in which it can carry the passenger. The pilot is then lifted from the ground and, after a safety period, can sit down into his harness. Unlike skydivers, paragliders, like hang gliders, do not \"jump\" at any time during this process. There are two launching techniques used on higher ground<ref>{{cite web|author1=Peter Cr\u00f6niger|title=Aufziehen Kontrollieren Starten|publisher=DHV|accessdate=5 December 2014|url=http://www.dhv.de/web/fileadmin/user_upload/files/2014/sicherheit/Croe_Artikel/artikel_aufziehen_kontrollieren_starten.pdf|pages=41\u201342|language=german|format=pdf|date=July 2007}}</ref> and one assisted launch technique used in flatland areas:\n\n==== Forward launch ====\nIn low winds, the wing is inflated with a forward launch, where the pilot runs forward with the wing behind so that the air pressure generated by the forward movement inflates the wing.\n\nIt is often easier, because the pilot only has to run forward, but the pilot cannot see his wing until it is above him, where he has to check it in a very short time for correct inflation and untangled lines before the launch.\n\n==== Reverse launch ====\n[[File:Paraglider launch Mam Tor.ogv|thumb|right|Paraglider reverse launch, [[Mam Tor]], England]]\nIn higher winds, a reverse launch is used, with the pilot facing the wing to bring it up into a flying position, then turning around under the wing and running to complete the launch.\n\nReverse launches have a number of advantages over a forward launch. It is more straightforward to inspect the wing and check if the lines are free as it leaves the ground. In the presence of wind, the pilot can be tugged toward the wing, and facing the wing makes it easier to resist this force and safer in case the pilot slips (as opposed to being dragged backwards). However, the movement pattern is more complex than forward launch, and the pilot has to hold the brakes in a correct way and turn to the correct side so he does not tangle the lines. These launches are normally attempted with a reasonable wind speed, making the ground speed required to pressurise the wing much lower.\n\nThe launch is initiated by the hands raising the leading edge with the As. As it rises the wing is controlled more by centring the feet than by use of the brakes or Cs. With mid level wings (EN C and D) the wing may try to \"overshoot\" the pilot as it nears the top. This is checked with  Cs or brakes. The wing becomes increasingly sensitive to the Cs and brakes as its internal air pressure rises. This is usually felt from increasing lift of the wing applying harness pressure to the \"seat of the pants\". That pressure indicates that the wing is likely to remain stable when the pilot pirouettes to face the wind.\n\nThe next step in the launch is to bring the wing into the lift zone. There are two techniques for accomplishing this depending on wind conditions. In light wind this is usually done after turning to the front, steering with the feet towards the low wing tip, and applying light brakes in a natural sense to keep the wing horizontal. In stronger wind conditions it is often found to be easier to remain facing downwind while moving slowly and steadily backwards into the wind.\n\nKnees bent to load the wing, foot adjustments to remain central and minimum use of Cs or Brakes to keep the wing horizontal. Pirouette when the feet are close to lifting. This option has two distinct advantages. a) The pilot can see the wing centre marker (an aid to centring the feet) and, if necessary, b) the pilot can move briskly towards the wing to assist with an emergency deflation.\n\nWith either method it is essential to check \"traffic\" across the launch face before committing to flight.\n\n==== Towed launch ====\n[[File:Parapente.ogg|thumb|right|Paraglider launching in [[Arax\u00e1]], Brazil]][[File:Mussel Rock Gliding Bluffs - Pacifica, California.webm|left|thumb|A paragliding flight over the Mussel Rock Gliding Bluffs in [[Pacifica, California]]]]\nIn flatter countryside, pilots can also be launched with a tow. Once at full height (towing can launch pilots up to 3000 feet altitude), the pilot pulls a release cord, and the towline falls away. This requires separate training, as flying on a winch has quite different characteristics from free flying. There are two major ways to tow: pay-in and pay-out towing. Pay-in towing involves a stationary winch that winds in the towline and thereby pulls the pilot in the air. The distance between winch and pilot at the start is around 500 metres or more. Pay-out towing involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, that pays out line slower than the speed of the object, thereby pulling the pilot up in the air. In both cases, it is very important to have a gauge indicating line tension to avoid pulling the pilot out of the air. Another form of towing is \"static line\" towing. This involves a moving object, like a car or a boat, attached to a paraglider or hang glider with a fixed-length line. This can be very dangerous, because now the forces on the line have to be controlled by the moving object itself, which is almost impossible to do, unless stretchy rope and a pressure/tension meter (dynamometer) is used. Static line towing with stretchy rope and a load cell as a tension meter has been used in Poland, Ukraine, Russia, and other Eastern European countries for over twenty years (under the name ''Malinka'') with about the same safety record as other forms of towing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paraplan.ru/forum/topic/49704|title=\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430. \u0421\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043f \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438. :: \u0424\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043c\u044b Paraplan.Ru|publisher=}}</ref>  One more form of towing is hand towing. This is where 1\u22123 people pull a paraglider using a tow rope of up to 500 feet. The stronger the wind, the fewer people are needed for a successful hand tow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7X6CSZk8ng|title=15-second hand-tow launch|first=|last=Greg Flymeister|date=3 June 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>  Tows up to 300 feet have been accomplished, allowing the pilot to get into a lift band of a nearby ridge or row of buildings and ridge-soar in the lift the same way as with a regular foot launch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW3JLP_2MrI|title=One Flew Over Florida Coast II|first=|last=Greg Flymeister|date=11 January 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n=== Landing ===\nLanding a paraglider, as with all unpowered aircraft which cannot abort a landing, involves some specific techniques and traffic patterns.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Peter Cr\u00f6niger|title=Perfekte Landeeinteilung f\u00fcr Gleitschirm und Drachen|journal=DHV-Info|date=March 2011|issue=169|pages=61\u201365|url=http://www.dhv.de/web/piloteninfos/sicherheit-und-technik/sicherheit/sicherheitsberichte/gleitschirm/start-landetechnik/perfekte-landeeinteilung/|accessdate=5 December 2014|publisher=DHV|language=german|format=pdf}}</ref> Paragliding pilots most commonly lose their height by flying a figure of 8 in over landing zone until the correct height is achieved, then line up into the wind and give the glider full speed. Once the correct height (about a metre above ground) is achieved the pilot will 'stall' the glider in order to land.\n\n==== Traffic pattern ====\nUnlike during launch, where coordination between multiple pilots is straightforward, landing involves more planning, because more than one pilot might have to land at the same time. Therefore, a specific [[Airfield traffic pattern|traffic pattern]] has been established. Pilots line up into a position above the airfield and to the side of the landing area, which is dependent on the wind direction, where they can lose height (if necessary) by flying circles. From this position, they follow the legs of a flightpath in a rectangular pattern to the landing zone: downwind leg, base leg, and final approach. This allows for synchronization between multiple pilots and reduces the risk of collisions, because a pilot can anticipate what other pilots around him are going to do next.\n\n==== Techniques ====\nLanding involves lining up for an approach into wind and, just before touching down, \"flaring\" the wing to minimise vertical and/or horizontal speed. This consists of gently going from 0% brake at around two metres to 100% brake when touching down on the ground.\n\nDuring the approach descent, at around four metres before touching ground, some momentary braking (50% for around two seconds) can be applied then released, thus using forward pendular momentum to gain speed for flaring more effectively and approaching the ground with minimal vertical speed.\n\nIn light winds, some minor running is common. In moderate to medium headwinds, the landings can be without forward speed, or even going backwards with respect to the ground in strong winds. Landing with winds which force the pilot backwards are particularly hazardous as there is a potential to tumble and be dragged. While the wing is vertically above the pilot there is potential for a reduced risk deflation. This involves taking the leading edge lines (As) in each hand at the mallion/riser junction and applying the pilot's full weight with a deep knee bend action. In almost every case the wing's leading edge will fly forward a little and then \"tuck\". It is then likely to collapse and descend upwind of the pilot. On the ground it will be restrained by the pilot's legs.\n\nLanding in winds which are too strong for the wing is to be avoided where-ever possible. During approach to the intended landing site this potential problem is often obvious and there may be opportunities to extend the flight to find a more sheltered landing area. On every landing it is desirable to have the wing remain flyable with a small amount of forward momentum. This makes deflation much more controllable. While the midsection lines (Bs) are vertical there is much less chance of the wing moving downwind fast. The common deflation cue comes from a vigorous tug on the rear risers' lines (Cs or Ds). Promptly rotate to face down wind, maintain pressure on the rear risers and take brisk steps towards the wing as it falls. With practice there is potential for precision enabling safe \"trouble free parking\".\n\nFor strong winds during the landing approach, \"flapping\" the wing (symmetrical pulsing of brakes) is a common option on final. It reduces the wing's lift performance. The descent rate is increases by the alternate application and release of the brakes about once per second. (The amount of brake applied in each cycle being variable but about 25%.) The system depends on the pilot's wing familiarity. The wing must not become stalled. This should be established with gentle applications in flight, at a safe height, in good conditions and with an observer providing feedback. As a rule the manufacturer has set the safe-brake-travel-range based on average body proportions for pilots in the approved weight range. Making changes to that setting should be undertaken in small increases, with tell-tale marks showing the variations and a test flight to confirm the desired effect. Shortening the brake lines can produce the problematic effect of making the wing sluggish. Lengthening brakes excessively can make it hard to bring the wing to a safe touchdown speed.\n\nAlternative approach techniques for landing in strong winds include the use of a speed bar and big ears. A speed bar increases wing penetration and adds a small increase in the vertical descent rate. This makes it easier to adjust descent rates during a formal circuit. In an extreme situation it might be advisable to stand on the speed bar, after shifting out of the harness, and stay on it till touchdown and deflation. Big ears are commonly applied during circuit height management. The vertical descent speed is increased and that advantage can be used to bring the glider to an appropriate circuit joining height. Most manufacturers change the operation technique for big ears in advanced models. It is common for Big Ears in C-rated gliders to remain folded in after the control line is released. In those cases the wing can be landed with reasonable safety with big ears deployed. In those wing types  it usually takes two or three symmetrical pumps with brakes, over a second or two, to re-inflate the tips. In lower rated wings the Big Ears need the line to remain held to hold the ears in. While they are held-in the wing tends to respond to weight shift slightly better (due to reduced effective area) on the roll axis. They auto re-inflate when the line is released. In general those wings are better suited to the situation where the ears are pulled in simply to get rid of excess height.  Full-wing flight should then be resumed during base leg or several seconds before touch down. Wing familiarity is a key ingredient in applying these controls. Pilots should practise in medium conditions in a safe area, at a safe height and with options for landing.\n\n=== Control ===\n[[File:Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur parapente.gif|right|thumb|upright|Speedbar mechanism]]\n\nBrakes: Controls held in each of the pilot's hands connect to the trailing edge of the left and right sides of the wing. These controls are called \"brakes\" and provide the primary and most general means of control in a paraglider. The brakes are used to adjust speed, to steer (in addition to weight shift), and to flare (during landing).\n\nWeight shift: In addition to manipulating the brakes, a paraglider pilot must also lean in order to steer properly. Such weight shifting can also be used for more limited steering when brake use is unavailable, such as when under \"big ears\" (see below). More advanced control techniques may also involve weight shifting.\n\nSpeed bar: A kind of foot control called the \"speed bar\" (also \"accelerator\") attaches to the paragliding harness and connects to the leading edge of the paraglider wing, usually through a system of at least two pulleys (see animation in margin). This control is used to increase speed and does so by decreasing the wing's [[angle of attack]]. This control is necessary because the brakes can only slow the wing from what is called \"trim speed\" (no brakes applied). The accelerator is needed to go faster than this.\n\nMore advanced means of control can be obtained by manipulating the paraglider's risers or lines directly. Most commonly, the lines connecting to the outermost points of the wing's leading edge can be used to induce the wingtips to fold under. The technique, known as \"big ears\", is used to increase the rate of descent (see picture and the full description below). The risers connecting to the rear of the wing can also be manipulated for steering if the brakes have been severed or are otherwise unavailable. For ground-handling purposes, a direct manipulation of these lines can be more effective and offer more control than the brakes. The effect of sudden wind blasts can be countered by directly pulling on the risers and making the wing unflyable, thereby avoiding falls or unintentional takeoffs.\n\n==== Fast descents ====\nProblems with \u201cgetting down\u201d can occur when the lift situation is very good or when the weather changes unexpectedly. There are three possibilities for rapidly reducing altitude in such situations, each of which has benefits and issues to be aware of. The \"big ears\" manoeuvre induces descent rates of 2.5 to 3.5&nbsp;m/s, 4\u20136&nbsp;m/s with additional speed bar. It is the most controllable of the techniques and the easiest for beginners to learn. The B-line stall induces descent rates of 6\u201310&nbsp;m/s. It increases loading on parts of the wing (the pilot's weight is mostly on the B-lines, instead of spread across all the lines). Finally, a spiral dive offers the fastest rate of descent, at 7\u201325&nbsp;m/s. It places greater loads on the wing than other techniques do and requires the highest level of skill from the pilot to execute safely.\n\n;Big ears\n[[File:Paragliding big ears.gif|thumb|Paraglider in \"Big Ears\" manoeuvre]]\n:Pulling on the outer A-lines during non-accelerated, normal flight folds the wing tips inwards, which substantially reduces the glide angle with only a small decrease in forward speed. As the effective wing area is reduced, the [[wing loading]] is increased, and it becomes more stable. However, the [[angle of attack]] is increased, and the craft is closer to stall speed, but this can be ameliorated by applying the speed bar, which also increases the descent rate. When the lines are released, the wing re-inflates. If necessary, a short pumping on the brakes helps reentering normal flight. Compared to the other techniques, with big ears, the wing still glides forward, which enables the pilot to leave an area of danger. Even landing this way is possible, e.g., if the pilot has to counter an updraft on a slope.\n\n;B-line stall\n:In a B-line stall, the second set of risers from the leading-edge/front (the B-lines) are pulled down independently of the other risers, with the specific lines used to initiate a [[stall (flight)|stall]]. This puts a spanwise crease in the wing, thereby separating the airflow from the upper surface of the wing. It dramatically reduces the lift produced by the canopy and thus induces a higher rate of descent. This can be a strenuous manoeuvre, because these B-lines have to be held in this position, and the tension of the wing puts an upwards force on these lines. The release of these lines has to be handled carefully not to provoke a too fast forward shooting of the wing, which the pilot then could fall into. This is less popular now as it induces high loads on the internal structure of the wing.\n\n;Spiral dive\n:The spiral dive is the most rapid form of controlled fast descent; an aggressive spiral dive can achieve a sink rate of 25&nbsp;m/s. This manoeuvre halts forward progress and brings the flier almost straight down. The pilot pulls the brakes on one side and shifts his weight onto that side to induce a sharp turn. The flight path then begins to resembles a corkscrew. After a specific downward speed is reached, the wing points directly to the ground. When the pilot reaches his desired height, he ends this manoeuvre by slowly releasing the inner brake, shifting his weight to the outer side and braking on this side. The release of the inner brake has to be handled carefully to end the spiral dive gently in a few turns. If done too fast, the wing translates the turning into a dangerous upward and pendular motion.\n:Spiral dives put a strong [[G-force]] on the wing and glider and must be done carefully and skilfully. The G-forces involved can induce blackouts, and the rotation can produce [[Orientation (mental)|disorientation]]. Some high-end gliders have what is called a \"stable spiral problem\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyozone.com/paragliders/de/learn/tips-and-advice/spiral-dives-and-stable-spiral/|title=Ozone Paragliders > InfoZone > Tipps und Ratschl\u00e4ge|publisher=}}</ref> After inducing a spiral and without further pilot input, some wings do not automatically return to normal flight and stay inside their spiral. Serious injury and fatal accidents have occurred when pilots could not exit this manoeuvre and spiralled into the ground.\n\nThe rate of rotation in a spiral dive can be reduced by using a drogue chute, deployed just before the spiral is induced. This reduces the G forces experienced.<ref>{{cite web|title=PRODUCTS THE ANTI-G :: INFO|url=http://www.flyozone.com/paragliders/en/products/reserves-chutes/the-anti-g/info/|publisher=Ozone|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Soaring ===\n[[File:Paraglider ridge soaring at Torrey Pines.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Ridge soaring along the California coast]]\nSoaring flight is achieved by using wind directed upwards by a fixed object such as a [[dune]] or [[ridge]].\nIn slope soaring, pilots fly along the length of a slope feature in the landscape, relying on the lift provided by the air, which is forced up as it passes over the slope. Slope soaring is highly dependent on a steady wind within a defined range (the suitable range depends on the performance of the wing and the skill of the pilot). Too little wind, and insufficient lift is available to stay airborne (pilots end up scratching along the slope). With more wind, gliders can fly well above and forward of the slope, but too much wind, and there is a risk of being blown back over the slope. A particular form of ridge soaring is \"condo soaring\", where pilots soar a row of buildings that form an artificial \"ridge\". This form of soaring is particularly used in flat lands where there are no natural ridges, but there are plenty of man-made, building \"ridges\".\n\n=== Thermal flying ===\n[[File:paragliding3.jpg|thumb|Paragliders in the air at [[Torrey Pines Gliderport]]]]\nWhen the sun warms the ground, it will warm some features more than others (such as rock faces or large buildings), and these set off thermals which rise through the air. Sometimes these may be a simple rising column of air; more often, they are blown sideways in the wind and will break off from the source, with a new thermal forming later.\n\nOnce a pilot finds a thermal, he begins to fly in a circle, trying to centre the circle on the strongest part of the thermal (the \"core\"), where the air is rising the fastest. Most pilots use a [[Variometer|vario]]-[[altimeter]] (\"vario\"), which indicates climb rate with beeps and/or a visual display, to help core in on a thermal.\n\nOften there is strong sink surrounding thermals, and there is also strong turbulence resulting in wing collapses as a pilot tries to enter a strong thermal. Good thermal flying is a skill that takes time to learn, but a good pilot can often core a thermal all the way to [[cloud base]].\n\n=== Cross-country flying ===\nOnce the skills of using thermals to gain altitude have been mastered, pilots can glide from one thermal to the next to go cross country. Having gained altitude in a thermal, a pilot glides down to the next available thermal.\n\nPotential thermals can be identified by land features that typically generate thermals or by [[cumulus cloud]]s, which mark the top of a rising column of warm, humid air as it reaches the [[dew point]] and [[Condensation|condenses]] to form a cloud.\n\nCross-country pilots also need an intimate familiarity with air law, flying regulations, aviation maps indicating restricted airspace, etc.\n\n=== In-flight wing deflation (collapse) ===\nSince the shape of the wing (airfoil) is formed by the moving air entering and inflating the wing, in turbulent air, part or all of the wing can deflate (collapse). Piloting techniques referred to as \"active flying\" will greatly reduce the frequency and severity of deflations or collapses. On modern recreational wings, such deflations will normally recover without pilot intervention. In the event of a severe deflation, correct pilot input will speed recovery from a deflation, but incorrect pilot input may slow the return of the glider to normal flight, so pilot training and practice in correct response to deflations are necessary.\n\nFor the rare occasions when it is not possible to recover from a deflation (or from other threatening situations such as a spin), most pilots carry a reserve (rescue, emergency) parachute (or even two); however, most pilots never have cause to \"throw\" their reserve. Should a wing deflation occur at low altitude, i.e., shortly after takeoff or just before landing, the wing (paraglider) may not recover its correct structure rapidly enough to prevent an accident, with the pilot often not having enough altitude remaining to deploy a reserve parachute [with the minimum altitude for this being approximately {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but typical deployment to stabilization periods using up {{convert|120|\u2013|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} of altitude] successfully. Different packing methods of the reserve parachute affect its deploying time.\n\nLow-altitude wing failure can result in serious injury or [[death]] due to the subsequent velocity of a ground impact where, paradoxically, a higher altitude failure may allow more time to regain some degree of control in the descent rate and, critically, deploy the reserve if needed. In-flight wing deflation and other hazards are minimized by flying a suitable glider and choosing appropriate weather conditions and locations for the pilot's skill and experience level.\n\n== As a competitive sport ==\n[[File:Pegalajar (Ja\u00e9n) parapente (RPS 23-08-2014).png|thumbnail|Practicing paragliding in [[Pegalajar]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]] - Spain)]]\n\nThere are various disciplines of competitive paragliding:\n* '''Cross-country flying''' is the classical form of paragliding competitions with championships in club, regional, national and international levels (see [[Paragliding World Cup|PWC]]).\n* '''[[Aerobatics|Aerobatic competitions]]''' demand the participants to perform certain manoeuvres. Competitions are held for individual pilots as well as for pairs that show synchronous performances. This form is the most spectacular for spectators on the ground to watch.\n* '''Hike & Fly''' competitions, in which a certain route has to be flown or hiked only over several days: [[Red Bull X-Alps]] \u2013 the unofficial world championship in this category of competition first launched in 2003 and has since taken place every other year.\n\nIn addition to these organized events it is also possible to participate in various online contests that require participants to upload flight track data to dedicated websites like [[Online Contest (gliding)|OLC]].\n\n== Safety ==\n[[File:Decolagemparapente.ogg|right|thumb|'''Paraglider launch''' video in [[Arax\u00e1]], Brazil]]\nParagliding, like any [[extreme sport]], is a potentially dangerous activity. In the United States, for example, in 2010 (the last year for which details are available<ref name=\"US Paragliding Injury Summary\">{{cite web|last=Steed|first=Mike|title=2010 US Paragliding Injury Summary|url=https://www.ushpa.org/page/download.aspx?DocKey=767|publisher=The United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>), one paraglider pilot died. This is an equivalent rate of one in 5,000 pilots. Over the years 1994\u22122010, an average of seven in every 10,000 active paraglider pilots have been fatally injured, though with a marked improvement in recent years. In France (with over 25,000 registered fliers), two of every 10,000 pilots were fatally injured in 2011 (a rate that is not atypical of the years 2007\u22122011), although around six of every 1,000 pilots were seriously injured (more than two-day hospital stay).<ref name=\"2011 FFVL Member Accident Report\" />\n\nThe potential for injury can be significantly reduced by training and risk management. The use of proper equipment such as a wing designed for the pilot's size and skill level,<ref>{{cite web|title=EN 926-2:2005|url=http://esearch.cen.eu/esearch/Details.aspx?id=7955730}}</ref> as well as a helmet, a reserve parachute,<ref>{{cite web|title=EN 12491:2001|url=http://esearch.cen.eu/esearch/Details.aspx?id=7955323}}</ref> and a cushioned harness<ref>{{cite web|title=EN 1651:1999|url=http://esearch.cen.eu/esearch/Details.aspx?id=7938699}}</ref> also minimize risk. Pilot safety is influenced by an understanding of the site conditions such as air turbulence (rotors), strong thermals, gusty wind, and ground obstacles such as power lines. Sufficient pilot training in wing control and emergency manoeuvres from competent instructors can minimize accidents. Many paragliding accidents are the result of a combination of pilot error and poor flying conditions.\n\n'''SIV (\u2018Simulation d\u2019Incident en Vol\u2019)'''\n\nSIV, short for Simulation d\u2019Incident en Vol (simulation of incident in flight) are courses which offer teaching in dealing with unstable and potentially dangerous situations such as collapses, full stalls, and cravattes. These courses are typically led by a specially trained instructor over large bodies of water, with the student usually being instructed via radio. Students will be taught how to induce dangerous situations, and thus learn how to both avoid and remedy them once induced. This course is recommended to pilots who are looking to move to more high performance and less stable wings, which is a natural progression for most pilots. In some countries an SIV course is a basic requirement of initial pilot training. In the event of an unrecoverable manoeuvre resulting in water landing, a rescue boat is typically dispatched to collect the pilot. Other added safety features may include buoyancy aids or secondary reserve parachutes. These courses are not considered essential for novice level flying.\n\n==Instruction==\nMost popular paragliding regions have a number of schools, generally registered with and/or organized by national associations. Certification systems vary widely between countries, though around 10 days instruction to basic certification is standard.\n\n[[File:Img20040730 0302 at neustift.jpg|thumb|Flying above [[Stubaital]], Austria]]\n[[File:Paragliding at Langkisau Hill - Painan 2009.JPG|thumb|Tandem Paragliding at [[Painan]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n[[File:Paraglading in elgeyo marakwet.jpg|thumb|Tandem Paraglading in [[Elgeyo Escarpment]]]]\n\nThere are several key components to a paragliding pilot certification instruction program. Initial training for beginning pilots usually begins with some amount of ground school to discuss the basics, including elementary theories of flight as well as basic structure and operation of the paraglider.\n\nStudents then learn how to control the glider on the ground, practising take-offs and controlling the wing 'overhead'. Low, gentle hills are next where students get their first short flights, flying at very low altitudes, to get used to the handling of the wing over varied terrain. Special winches can be used to tow the glider to low altitude in areas that have no hills readily available.\n\nAs their skills progress, students move on to steeper/higher hills (or higher winch tows), making longer flights, and learning to turn the glider, control the glider's speed, then moving on to 360\u00b0 turns, spot landings, \u2018big ears\u2019 (used to increase the rate of descent for the paraglider), and other more advanced techniques. Training instructions are often provided to the student via radio, particularly during the first flights.\n\nA third key component to a complete paragliding instructional program provides substantial background in the key areas of meteorology, aviation law, and general flight area etiquette.\n\nTo give prospective pilots a chance to determine if they would like to proceed with a full pilot training program, most schools offer tandem flights, in which an experienced instructor pilots the paraglider with the prospective pilot as a passenger. Schools often offer pilot's families and friends the opportunity to fly tandem, and sometimes sell tandem pleasure flights at holiday resorts.\n\nMost recognised courses lead to a national licence and an internationally recognised International Pilot Proficiency Information/Identification card. The IPPI specifies five stages of paragliding proficiency, from the entry level ParaPro 1<ref>{{cite web | title=Paragliding 101: Nepali Style | url=http://drshem.com/2011/11/27/paragliding-one-o-one-nepali-style/ | work=Paragliding 101: Nepali Style | accessdate=2012-03-17}}</ref> to the most advanced stage 5. Attaining a level of ParaPro 3 typically allows the pilot to fly solo or without instructor supervision.\n\n== World records ==\nFAI (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale) world records:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fai.org/page/civl-records |title=FAI Hang Gliding and Paragliding World Records}}</ref>\n* Straight Distance \u2013 {{convert|564.3|km|mi|abbr=on}}: Donizete Baldessar Lemos ([[Brazil]]), Rafael Monteiro Saladini (Brazil) and Samuel Nascimento (Brazil); [[Tacima]] (Brazil) \u2013 [[Para\u00edba]] (Brazil) \u2013 13 October 2016<ref>{{cite web |date=2019-03-01 |title=FAI Record ID #18027 |url=https://www.fai.org/record/18027}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2016-10-13 |title=Flight detail Donizete Lemos |url=http://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:Donizete/13.10.2016/09:05 |accessdate=2016-11-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2019-03-01 |title=FAI Record ID #18028 |url=https://www.fai.org/record/18028}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2016-10-13 |title=Flight detail Rafael Saladini |url=http://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:sardinha/13.10.2016/08:58 |accessdate=2016-11-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2019-03-01 |title=FAI Record ID #18029 |url=https://www.fai.org/record/18029 }}</ref>\n* Straight distance (female) \u2013 {{convert|552.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}: Yael Margelisch (Switzerland);  Caic\u00f3 (Brazil) \u2013 12 October 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.org/record/19132|title=FAI Record ID #19132 |date=2019-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web|url=https://xcmag.com/news/paragliding-world-records-tumble-over-four-days-in-brazil/|title=Paragliding world records tumble over four days in Brazil|date=2019-12-16}}</ref>\n* Straight distance to declared goal \u2013 {{convert|478.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}: Jouni Makkonen (Finland); Brazil; 11 October 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.org/record/18723|title=FAI Record ID #18723 |date=2019-03-01}}</ref>\n* Gain of height \u2013 {{convert|5854|m|ft|abbr=on}}: Antoine Girard (France); Aconcagua (Argentina); 15 February 2019<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fai.org/record/18853|title=Fai Record ID #18853 |date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\nOthers:\n* Highest flight \u2013 {{convert|8157|m|ft|abbr=on}}: Antoine Girard; [[Broad Peak]] (Pakistan).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xcmag.com/2016/07/antoine-girard-breaks-8100m-in-karakoram/|title=Antoine Girard breaks 8,100m in Karakoram|date=26 July 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Oldest paraglider passenger is Peggy McAlpine from [[Northern Cyprus]].

Whereas with [[sky diving]] the parachute is \"only\" a tool to safely return to earth after free fall, the paraglider allows longer flights and the use of thermals.\n\n===Hang gliding===\n[[Hang gliding]] is a close cousin, and hang glider and paraglider launches are often found in proximity to one another.<ref>{{citation | url=http://federation.ffvl.fr/pages/rechercher-un-site-vol| title=French Sites Guide|publisher=FFVL| language=French}}</ref> Despite the considerable difference in equipment, the two activities offer similar pleasures, and some pilots are involved in both sports.\n\n===Powered hang glider===\n\n[[Powered hang glider|Foot-launched powered hang gliders]] are powered by an engine and propeller in pusher configuration. An ordinary hang glider is used for its wing and control frame, and the pilot can foot-launch from a hill or from flat ground. \n\n===Powered paragliding===\n[[Powered paragliding]] is the flying of paragliders with a small engine known as a paramotor attached. Powered paragliding is known as paramotoring and requires extra training alongside regular paragliding training. It is often recommended to become competent in paragliding prior to learning to paramotor in order to know fully what one is doing.\n\n===Speed flying===\n[[Speed flying]], or ''speed riding'', is the separate sport of flying paragliders of a reduced size. These wings have increased speed, though they are not normally capable of [[Paragliding#Soaring|soaring]] flight. The sport involves taking off on [[skis]] or on foot and swooping rapidly down in close proximity to a slope, even periodically touching it if skis are used. These smaller wings are also sometimes used where wind speeds are too high for a full-sized paraglider, although this is invariably at coastal sites where the wind is [[Laminar Flow|laminar]] and not subject to as much mechanical turbulence as inland sites.\n\n===Gliding===\nJust like [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplanes]] and hang gliders, paragliders use thermals to extend the time in the air. Air speed, glide ratio and flight distances are superior to the ones achieved by paragliders. Paragliders on the other hand are able to also facilitate thermals that are too small (because of the much larger turn radius) or too weak for [[gliding]].\n\n<!-- not really sure if the following part even belongs here; I'll leave it for now since it is one of the few nicely cited parts -->\nParagliding can be of local importance as a commercial activity.<ref>{{citation | url=http://www.drdjs-rhone-alpes.jeunesse-sports.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Fiche_synthetique_BAssin_Annecien.pdf| accessdate=October 30, 2011| publisher=DRDJS Rhone Alpes| title= Paragliding in the Annecy Basin|language=French| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203090604/http://www.drdjs-rhone-alpes.jeunesse-sports.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Fiche_synthetique_BAssin_Annecien.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last=Kohli|first=M.S.|title=Mountains of India: Tourism, Adventure, Pilgrimage| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIs4zv17HHwC&pg=PA290| year=2004| publisher=Indus Publishing| isbn=978-81-7387-135-1| pages=289\u201390}}</ref>  Paid accompanied tandem flights are available in many mountainous regions, both in the winter and in the summer.

Finally, there are the manufacturers and the associated repair and after-sales services. Paraglider-like wings also find other uses, for example, in ship propulsion and wind energy exploitation, and are related to some forms of [[power kite]].  [[Kite skiing]] uses equipment similar to paragliding sails.\n\n**Georgian Paragliding Federation**Georgia Tbilisi \n==National Organizations==\n* [[USHPA|United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (''USHPA'')]] \u2013 United States\n* [[British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association|British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (''BHPA'')]] \u2013 United Kingdom\n** [[Flyability]] \u2013 BHPA associated charity for disabled paragliding and hang gliding\n* {{lang|fr|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Vol Libre}} (FFVL) \u2013 France<ref>{{cite web|url=https://federation.ffvl.fr/|title=FFVL.FR - Site officiel de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Vol Libre|website=federation.ffvl.fr}}</ref>\n* Association of Paragliding Pilots and Instructors (APPI)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appifly.org/|title=APPI : Association of Paragliding Pilots and Instructors|website=appifly.org}}</ref> \n* Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association of Canada (HPAC) \u2013 Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hpac.ca/pub/|title=Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association of Canada|website=www.hpac.ca}}</ref>\n* {{lang|es|Federaci\u00f3n Argentina de Vuelo Libre}} (FAVL) \u2013 Argentina<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.favl.com.ar//|title=FAVL.com.ar - Official site of the National Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association of Argentina|website=favl.com.ar}}</ref>\n* {{lang|de|Deutscher H\u00e4ngegleiter Verband}} (DHV)  (<small>Eng.

After initial English successes, the war ended in a Dutch victory. It was the second of [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|a series of naval wars]] fought between the English and the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Anglo-Dutch relations ===\nTraditionally, many historians considered that the [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and Second Anglo-Dutch Wars arose from commercial and maritime rivalry between England and the Netherlands, although conceding that the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] was less the result of commercial rivalry.{{sfn|Rommelse|2010|p=492}} However, more recent research has suggested that political issues, particularly in England, had a significant effect on the outbreak of these conflicts. Although continuing commercial tensions formed the background to the second war, a group of ambitious English politicians and naval officers frustrated diplomatic efforts to reach any accommodation between the parties.{{sfn|Rommelse|2010|p=493}} Religious and political differences between the Anglican royalists in England and the Calvinist republicans that formed the ruling group in the Netherlands, each seeing the other as an ideological threat, also hampered agreement.{{sfn|Pincus|2002|pp=246\u2013262}}\n\nThe last major battle of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was an English victory in the [[battle of Scheveningen]] in August 1653. However, after this the Dutch turned to using smaller warships and [[privateer]]ing and, by November Cromwell was willing to make peace as the Dutch were capturing numerous English merchant ships.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=721-722}} His only stipulation was that no Prince of Orange or other member of the [[House of Orange]] should hold the office of [[stadtholder]] or any other public office in the Netherlands. When this demand was made public, it was strongly opposed by Orangists, so it was dropped from formal negotiations.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=722}} De Witt realised that he would not persuade most of the provinces to accept the exclusion of members of the House of Orange from public office as part of a peace treaty, so the public terms of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]] made no mention of this. However, the two members of the negotiating team from Holland, unknown to their colleagues, agreed to a secret annexe providing, although the Netherlands would ratify the treaty without delay, England would only do so once the States of Holland had passed an [[Act of Seclusion]], excluding the House of Orange from holding public office in the province of Holland.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=722}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe States General of the United Provinces approved and ratified the Treaty of Westminster, unaware of the secret annexe attached to version of the treaty that the English would ratify.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=722}} De Witt had to use his influence to persuade delegates from the towns of Holland, many initially unfavourable, to support Exclusion, and some of their pensionaries resisted to the end, although they did not try to involve other provinces. Holland passed its Act of Exclusion on 4 May 1654.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=722-723}} Adverse reactions from the public in other provinces was strong, but their provincial assemblies could neither overcome their own internal divisions nor act with other provinces to oppose it. However, any expectation that the other provinces would enact their own Act of Exclusion after Holland had passed its act was not realised in the short term, although in practice the policy was not opposed. Only after the war did four provinces besides Holland adopt the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)]] sanctioning Exclusion.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=723-724}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] government of [[Oliver Cromwell]] wished to avoid further conflict with the Dutch Republic, as it was planning war with Spain, which began as the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u20131660)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1654\u20131660 after the Treaty of Westminster was signed.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=24}} The English feared Dutch intervention in this war on the side of the Spanish, as the Republic contained an Orangist party hostile to Cromwell. However, Orangist sentiments were found more among the common people than those with political influence. The controversy over Exclusion strengthened de Witt's position in Holland and increased the influence of Holland over the other provinces.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=726-727}} De Witt's position was further strengthened by increasing Dutch dominance in international trade, which replaced English trade with Spain and its possessions in Italy and America during the Anglo-Spanish War. Once the Netherlands had supplanted England on these areas, its traders were very reluctant to see English rivals readmitted.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=727}}\n\nAfter the First Anglo-Dutch War [[Johan de Witt]], who had been elected Grand [[Pensionary]] of Holland, took over effective control of Netherlands' foreign policy until his death in 1672. He realised that the Netherlands could never win a war with England or France conclusively, and that even surviving a war with either power would only be possible at enormous cost. He therefore strove for a neutrality in which Dutch commerce could flourish, supported by sufficiently strong land and naval forces to deter either of these two nations as a possible adversary.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=23-24}} Despite traditional Dutch hostility towards Spain, de Witt declined to join Cromwell in attacking it, but the Dutch had no desire to aid their hated former master, so remained neutral. De Witt was, however, prepared to act alone against Sweden in 1655 and, jointly with Denmark, again in 1658. Although the Commonwealth was an ally of Sweden, it did not come to the aid of its ally, even when the Dutch thwarted the Swedish attempt to conquer Denmark in the [[battle of the Sound]] on 8 November 1658.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=736}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=24}} De Witt's aim was to establish peace in the Baltic for the benefit of Dutch commerce there. With a similar aim, he attempted to end the long-running conflict with Portugal, allowing it to retain Brazil over the protests of two of the five Netherlands provinces in 1661.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=25,31}}\n\nThe Dutch used the years of peace to build up their commercial fleet again, following its devastation in the First Anglo-Dutch War. De Witt also achieved the post-war completion of many new warships, ordered during the war to augment the existing fleet, including several large ships comparable in armament to the all but the largest English ones. These had been given greater constructional strength and a wider beam to support heavier guns.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|pp=64-66}} However, despite the pleas of the admirals for more of these powerful ships, many of those built were relatively small and designed as convoy escorts, protecting trade routes, not to fight in fleet actions.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=66}}{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=716-717}} In addition, the [[Dutch East India Company]] built hybrid ships that could be used for carrying cargo, as convoy escorts or in battle, although they were not as strongly built as pure warships.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=74}}\n\nWhile the English had won the majority of naval battles and destroyed or captured a great many Dutch merchant ships during the First Anglo-Dutch War, they failed to win the war.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=717}} The Republic was in a better financial position than the Commonwealth of England, potentially enabling the Dutch to complete the fitting out their naval fleet to replace their losses at faster pace than England.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=721}} However, de Witt was unable to put naval finances on a centralised basis, as each of the five admiralties and the three provinces that maintained them retained considerable independence.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=67}} In addition, as the Dutch navy did not rely on [[Impressment|the press gang]], securing sufficient manpower could be a problem,{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=32}} although abandoning the practice of paying off seamen and laying up ships in the winter promoted a more professional and permanent body of sailors, committed to naval service,{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|pp=71-72}}\n\nWhile the war continued, the Dutch had also been free to expand their trade networks along the main sea routes outside English home waters without fear of English retaliation, as the majority of English warships were in home waters, with only a relatively few available overseas. English commerce was grinding to a halt as they lost access to the Baltic and the Mediterranean Seas, and when the two sides signed the peace treaty in 1654, the English were in essentially the same position that they had begun: watching the Dutch Republic outstrip their economy to become the premier European trade power.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=721}}\n\n=== England ===\n\n==== Trade ====\nTo make matters worse for England, the conclusion of the First Anglo-Dutch War was immediately followed by the Anglo-Spanish War of 1654\u20131660, which disrupted the remnants of trade the Commonwealth had with Spain and southern Italy. The Dutch were left with free rein to expand their influence in the area: this period was one of the highest points in the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and ironically the English interference was partly responsible.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=727}}\n\nA major problem with the English trading system was that it was based on prohibitions, such as the [[Navigation Acts]], tariffs and customs, and the regulation of manufacturing. All these measures, even tariffs which were originally designed to raise revenue, were directed to the protection of English trade.{{sfn|Vries|2015|p=340}} Although the Dutch system was said to be based on [[free trade]], this only applied to Europe, and not to Dutch trading settlements elsewhere. The prices of Dutch goods were more attractive around the world because the Dutch taxation system imposed excise duties on its own consumers, rather than customs duties on the foreign users of its exports.{{sfn|Hughes|1934|p=125}} The end of the First Anglo-Dutch War had not changed this dynamic. Indeed, the end of the war had set the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands|United Provinces]] free to expand their trade while the English were still hindered by the same tariff system.{{sfn|Ashley|1961|p=365}} Thus, another war seemed inevitable to many people of the time, as the Commonwealth was unlikely to give up its naval and economic superiority without a fight.\n\n==== Restoration ====\nThe [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], in 1660, initially produced a general surge of optimism in England. Many hoped to reverse the Dutch dominance in world trade.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=713\u2013714}} At first, however, Charles II sought to remain on friendly terms with the Republic, as he was personally greatly in debt to the House of Orange, which had lent large sums to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] during the [[English Civil War]].{{sfn|Groenveld|1991|pp=960, 963}} Nevertheless, a conflict soon developed between the [[States of Holland]] and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]] over the education and future prospects of [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], the posthumous son of Dutch stadtholder [[William II of Orange]] and Charles' nephew. William was designated a \"Child of State\" in 1660, implying he would be trained for high office by the States-General. When Mary died in 1661,  she named Charles as a guardian of William, allowing England a measure of influence in Dutch politics.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=751-753}}\n\nThe Dutch, in a move coordinated by [[Cornelis de Graeff|Cornelis]] and [[Andries de Graeff]], tried to placate the king with prodigious gifts, such as the [[Dutch Gift]] of 1660.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=750}} Negotiations were started in 1661 to solve these issues, which ended in the treaty of 1662, in which the Dutch conceded on most points.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=92}} In 1663, [[Louis XIV]] of [[France]] stated his claim to portions of the [[Habsburg]] [[southern Netherlands]], leading to a short rapprochement between England and the Republic.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|pp=33\u201334}} During this time, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], serving as chief minister to King Charles II of England, felt that France had become the greatest danger to England.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=49}}\n\nIn 1664, however, the situation quickly changed: Clarendon's enemy, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], became the favourite of the king, and he and his client [[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Sir Thomas Clifford M.P., later Lord Clifford]], began to cooperate with the king's brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=101-102}} James, Arlington and Clifford, who was chairman of a House of Commons committee investigating the supposed depression in English maritime commerce agreed that Dutch commercial competition had to be stifled, even if this led to war with the United Provinces,{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=102}} as they considered the United Provinces were a greater threat to English interests than was France. They coordinated their efforts in order to reduce Dutch competition through a policy of reprisals against Dutch ships, which were captured in significant numbers.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=105}} and expected significant personal gain from this policy. James, the Duke of York, headed the [[Royal African Company]] and hoped to seize the possessions of the [[Dutch West India Company]], including [[New Amsterdam]].{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=103}}\n\nThis aggressive policy was supported by the English ambassador in [[The Hague]], Sir [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]], who acted as agent for James, Arlington and Clifford{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=2}} From his position in the Hague, Downing gave a full and detailed account of all the political affairs in the United Provinces to Charles as well as James and his associates. Downing reported back to London that the Republic was politically divided and that the Dutch would submit to English demands rather than go to war.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=103}} Even after the English fleet began seizing Dutch ships and an attack on Dutch possessions in West Africa, he reported in August 1664 that the Dutch would probably accept reducing their share of overseas trade in favour of England, although contemporary Dutch sources reported strengthening Dutch resistance to these provocations.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=105-106}} Since 1661, Downing had been in contact with the Orangists, who he believed would collaborate with England against their enemy, the republican States faction.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=83}} However, although some Orangists entered into treasonable correspondence with England in an attempt to end the war and overthrow de Witt, the rapid arrest and execution of [[Henri de Fleury de Coulan|de Buat]] showed their weakness.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}}\n\nCharles was influenced by James and Arlington as he sought a popular and lucrative foreign war at sea to bolster his authority as king.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=65}} Many naval officers welcomed the prospect of a conflict with the Dutch as they expected to make their name and fortune in battles they hoped to win as decisively as in the previous war.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=65}}\n\n==== War agitation ====\n[[Image:James, Duke of York - Romanesque.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], the [[Lord High Admiral of England]] and openly Catholic, argued in favour of war between England and the Dutch]]\nAs enthusiasm for war rose among the English populace, [[privateer]]s began to join navy ships in attacking Dutch ships, capturing them and taking them to English harbors.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=93}} By the time that the United Provinces declared war on England, about two hundred Dutch ships had been brought to English ports.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=766}} Dutch ships were obligated by the new treaty to salute the [[Flag of England|English flag]] first. In 1664, English ships began to provoke the Dutch by not saluting in return. Though ordered by the Dutch government to continue saluting first, many Dutch commanders could not bear the insult.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nWhether to secure concessions from the Dutch or provoke open conflict with them, James already in late 1663 had sent [[Robert Holmes (admiral)|Robert Holmes]], to protect the interests of the Royal African Company.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=93}} Holmes captured the Dutch trading post of Cabo Verde in June 1664 and confiscated several ships of the Dutch West India company in [[West Africa]], ,{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=67}} allegedly as reprisals for English ships captured by that company, and England refused any compensation for these captures, for disrupting that company's trading operations or for other hostile acts.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=93-94}} Slightly later, the English invaded the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] in North America on 24 June 1664, and had taken control of it by October.{{sfn|Pomfret|1973|p=22}}\n\nThe States General responded by sending a fleet under [[Michiel de Ruyter]] that recaptured their African trading posts and captured most of the English trading stations there, then crossed the Atlantic for a [[punitive expedition]] against the English in America.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=68}} In December 1664, the English suddenly attacked the Dutch [[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] fleet. Though the attack failed, the Dutch in January 1665 allowed their ships to open fire on English warships in the colonies when threatened.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=135,139}}\n\n[[Image:AmboynaFort1655.jpg|thumb|English propaganda in 1655: the [[Amboyna massacre]] of 1623, in which Dutch agents tortured and executed Englishmen]]\nThe war was supported in England by propaganda concerning the much earlier [[Amboyna Massacre]] of 1623. In that year, ten English [[factor (agent)|factors]], resident in the Dutch fortress of Victoria and ten Japanese and Portuguese employees of the Dutch East India Company on [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] were executed by beheading following accusations of treason. After their arrest, many of the English prisoners were, according to the trial records, tortured by having a cloth placed over their faces, upon which water was poured to cause near suffocation, now called [[waterboarding]]. Other, more sadistic, tortures were alleged although denied by the Dutch. The incident provoked a major crisis in Anglo-Dutch relations at the time and continuing popular anger,{{sfn|Armitage|2000|p=87}} although the matter had been be officially settled with the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]]. The [[East India Company]] set out its case against the [[Dutch East India Company]] in a pamphlet published in 1631, which was used for anti-Dutch propaganda during the First Anglo-Dutch War and revived by pamphleteers as a second war neared. When De Ruyter recaptured the West African trading posts, many pamphlets were written about presumed new Dutch atrocities, although these contained no basis in fact.{{sfn|Pincus|2002|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nAnother cause of conflict was mercantile competition. The major monopolistic English trading companies had suffered from a loss of trade on the 1650s, which they attributed to illegal contraband trading and Dutch competition. They wished the government to exclude the Dutch from trading with British colonies, and force those colonies to trade only with the licensed English trading companies.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=46\u201347}} The Dutch, whose maritime trade was substantially that of an intermediary, rejected the policies of [[Mercantilism]] in favour of the ''[[International waters|mare liberum]]'' where it was in their interest to do so, while enforcing a strict monopoly in the [[Dutch Indies]], and attempted to expand it to their other settlements.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n=== Dutch Republic ===\n\n==== Preparedness ====\n[[Image:Anglo-Dutch-War-2english.png|thumb|Apart from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], most fighting took place in the southern North Sea]]\nAfter their defeat in the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch became much better prepared. From 1653, De Witt began to make plans for a \"New Navy\" to be constructed, with a core of sixty-four new, heavier ships of the line with 40 to 60 guns and 90 smaller convoy escorts, and more professional captains were sought for these.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|pp=64-5}} However, even the heavier Dutch ships were much lighter than the ten \"big ships\" of the English navy and, in 1664, when war threatened, the decision was taken to expand the core Dutch fleet with still heavier ships, although on the outbreak of war in 1665, these new vessels were mostly still under construction, and the Dutch only possessed four heavier [[ships of the line]].{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=66}} At the time of the [[Battle of Lowestoft]], the Dutch fleet included eighteen older warships reactivated after being laid up after the First Anglo-Dutch war, and several very large [[Dutch East India Company]] built hybrid ships which could be used for carrying cargo or in battle, although not as strongly built as pure warships.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=74}} During the second war, the Dutch Republic was in a better financial position than England and quickly completed the new ships, whereas England could only build a dozen ships, due to financial difficulties.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=721}} However, de Witt saw that men, not materiel, were critical, and attempted to deal with the insubordination, lack of discipline and apparent cowardice among captains at the start of the war.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=127}}\n\nIn 1665, England boasted a population about four times as large as that of the Dutch Republic. This population was dominated by poor peasants, however, and so the only source of ready cash were the cities. The Dutch urban population exceeded that of England in both proportional and absolute terms and the Republic would be able to spend more than twice the amount of money on the war as England, the equivalent of \u00a311,000,000.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=79}} The outbreak of war was followed ominously by the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] and the [[Great Fire of London]], hitting the only major urban centre of the country. These events, occurring in such close succession, virtually brought England to its knees, as the English fleet had suffered from cash shortages even before these calamities, despite having been voted a record budget of [[GBP|\u00a3]]2,500,000 by the English parliament. However, as Charles lacked effective means of enforcing taxation; those taxes voted were collected neither in full nor quickly. For much of the war, Charles was dependent on loans raised in the City of London at interest rates which increased as the war progressed, to cover both collection delays and for expenditure in excess of the budget.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=43}} Although the Duke of York had attempted to reform the finances of the [[Navy Board]], cash flow remained a problem, and sailors were not paid wholly in cash, but mainly with \"tickets\", or debt certificates, which were only redeemed after long delays when cash was available.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=42,193}} Receipts from the sale of goods carried by Dutch ships captured by Royal Navy warships and the ships themselves or, to a lesser extent, by privateers, were a valuable source of funds to finance for the Navy Board, and the attack Dutch East Indies fleet at [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] had this as at least one of its objectives.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=123-125}} However, a large part of the proceeds of these captures was retained by the captors, either illegally or returned to them as prize money and, although it has been claimed that English financial penury made the war's outcome dependent on the fortunes of its privateers,{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=78}} this was never more than an irregular windfall, and opportunities for capturing Dutch merchant vessels were greatest before and just after war was declared, diminishing as the war forced them to stay in port.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=124-125,149}} Far fewer prizes were taken by the Royal Navy than in the First Anglo-Dutch War and, overall and particularly after 1665, Dutch privateers would be the more successful.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=175,195}}\n\n=== France ===\nA Franco-Dutch treaty had been signed in 1662, which involved a defensive alliance between the two countries, giving the Netherlands protection against an English attack and assuring France that the Netherlands would not assist Spain in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=33-4}} Although [[Louis XIV of France]] had signed this treaty, he considered that an Anglo-Dutch war was likely to obstruct his plans to acquire Habsburg territory there.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=109}} Charles' ambassador in France reported the French opposition to the outbreak of such a war gave him the hope that, if the Dutch were provoked into declaring war, the French would evade their treaty obligations, and refuse to be drawn into a naval war with England.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=69, 136}} In the summer of 1664, Louis attempted to avert the threatened Anglo-Dutch war or, failing that, to confine it to Africa and America.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|p=119}} These efforts to mediate an agreement failed, and the war commenced with a declaration of war by the Dutch on 4 March 1665, following English attacks on two Dutch convoys off Cadiz and in the English Channel.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=67-68}}\n\nEven after the war began, Louis attempted to evade his obligation by strengthening the French embassy in London with two envoys&nbsp; under the name of the ''c\u00e9l\u00e8bre ambassade'', which included an [[Ambassador Extraordinary]] in addition to the resident ambassador, to begin negotiations for a settlement of the Anglo-Dutch conflict. Its instructions were to offer terms including the restitution of each country's ships captured off America and Africa, and of their West African bases, and also financial compensation for English ships captured earlier in West Africa. However, the instructions did not propose that the [[New Netherlands]] should be included in any treaty, but settled by local fighting that would not involve a European War. The Dutch complained that these terms denied their rights to the New Netherlands.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|pp=119, 120}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=151, 152}}\n\n== Hostilities ==\n\n=== First year, 1665 ===\n{{main|Battle of Lowestoft}}\n[[Image:Van Minderhout Battle of Lowestoft.jpg|thumb|The battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, showing {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|6}} and ''Eendracht'']]\nAt the start of the war, both sides considered an early decisive battle was desirable, as English government finances could not sustain a long war, and an English blockade of Dutch ports and attacks on their merchant and fishing fleets would soon bring about their economic ruin.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=69-70}} De Witt and the States General put pressure on their commander [[Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam]] to seek out the English fleet and bring it into battle, although his fleet was inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower to the English fleet.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=74}}{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=83-85}} In their first at the [[Battle of Lowestoft]] on 13 June 1665, the Dutch suffered the worst defeat in the history the Dutch Republic's navy, with at least sixteen ships lost, and one-third of its personnel killed or captured.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=126-127}}\n\nHowever, the English were unable to capitalise on their victory at Lowestoft, as the majority of the Dutch fleet escaped. The leading Dutch politician, the [[Grand Pensionary]] of Holland [[Johan de Witt]], attempted to restore confidence by joining the fleet personally and dealt with failed or ineffective captains by executing three and exiling and dismissing others. [[Michiel de Ruyter]] was appointed to lead the Dutch fleet in July 1665, despite the previous appointment of Cornelis Tromp as acting commander in chief, and he formalised new tactics.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=125-127}} The Spice Fleet from the Dutch East Indies managed to return home safely after the [[battle of V\u00e5gen]], although it was at first blockaded at Bergen, causing the financial position to swing in favour of the Dutch.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=70}}\n\nIn the summer of 1665 the [[bishop of M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]], an old enemy of the Dutch, was induced by promises of English subsidies to invade the Republic.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} At the same time, the English made overtures to Spain.

He first arranged for other German states to obstruct the passage of Munster troops and promised to send a French army corps to Germany.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=143}} Louis was still unwilling to act against England under the 1662 defensive treaty, so he revived his attempts to mediate a settlement.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=109}} The French ambassadors, with de Witt's assent, offered to accept the loss of the New Netherlands and of two West African posts seized by Holmes and to return a third post seized by de Ruyter. However, the English fleet's success at Lowestoft prompted Charles and his ministers to reject this offer and demand further surrenders of territory and a Dutch agreement to bear the costs of the war. When, in December 1665, Charles refused a French counter-offer, Louis withdrew both his ambassadors, signalling his intention to declare war.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|p=120}}\n\n[[Image:BloemVaagen1665.jpg|thumb|Attack on Bergen, Norway, on 12 August 1665]]\nThese events caused consternation at the English court. It now seemed that the Republic could end up as either a Habsburg possession or a French protectorate: either outcome would be disastrous for England's strategic position. Clarendon was ordered to make peace with the Dutch, quickly and without French mediation. Downing used his Orangist contacts to induce the province of [[Overijssel]], whose countryside had been ravaged by Galen's troops, to ask the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] for a peace with England{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} The Orangists naively wished to gain peace by conceding the English demand that the young William III should be made captain-general and admiral-general of the republic, which would ensure his eventual appointment to the stadtholderate. De Witt's position was, however, too strong for this Orangist attempt to seize power to succeed.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} In November, he promised Louis never to conclude a separate peace with England.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=146}} On 11 December he openly declared that the only acceptable peace terms would be either a return to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', or a quick end to hostilities under a ''[[uti possidetis]]'' clause.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=151}}\n\nAt the end of 1665, [[Henri de Fleury de Coulan|Henri Buat]] a Frenchman with connections to the House of Orange became involved in unofficial correspondence with Sir [[Gabriel Sylvius]], who was acting on behalf of [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], a minister of Charles II. Their correspondence was a means for the Dutch and English governments to explore possibilities of peace without commitment.{{sfn|Molhuysen|Blok|1911|p=509}} At an early stage, Buat made the Grand Pensionary [[Johan de Witt]] fully aware of this correspondence, and Buat added material provided by de Witt to his letter, including possible peace terms, although de Witt was unsure whether Charles was genuinely seeking peace.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} Moreover, 1665 had seen Scotland enter the war, principally in a privateering capacity in which they proved to be particularly successful.{{sfn|Murdoch|2010|pp=237-254}} However, Scottish privateering activities in 1665 were limited, because of delays in the Scottish Admiral issuing regular [[Letters of marque]] at the start of the war.{{sfn|Graham|1982|p=68}}\n\n=== Second year, 1666 ===\n{{main|Four Days' Battle}}\nAfter Battle of Lowestoft, Louis XIV was concerned that the destruction of the Dutch fleet would allow the English fleet to interfere with his plans in the Spanish Netherlands, so he again offered mediation, but as his credibility as mediator been undermined, this offer was rejected by England.

No clarification was provided, only repeated English insistence that someone duly authorised should be sent to London to negotiate peace.

This was the last time in history that an English admiral surrendered in battle.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=75}} After this loss and the return of several badly damaged ships to port, Albemarle, reinforced by Rupert's fresh squadron had 52 ships to face the Dutch with 57 ships.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=248}} After Rupert broke the Dutch line and, with Albemarle attacked Tromp with superior numbers,{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=254-256}} de Ruyter decided the battle on the fourth day, by a surprise all-out attack when Tromp seemed about to be defeated.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=263-264}} When the English retreated, De Ruyter was reluctant to follow, perhaps because of lack of gunpowder.\n\nThe battle ended with both sides claiming victory: the English because they contended Dutch Lieutenant Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] had retreated first, the Dutch because they had inflicted much greater losses on the English, who lost ten ships against the Dutch four.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=276-277}} Although the Dutch claim seems more valid, their rejoicing was out of proportion to what had been achieved. It had taken four days to force a weaker, and before Rupert's return much weaker, English opponent that had close to defeating them on the second and fourth days. and their belief that the English fleet was destroyed as a fighting force was shown to be false a few weeks later.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=276}}\n\n[[Image:St. James Day Fight, Pic 1.jpg|thumb|[[St. James's Day Battle]] 4 August 1666]]\nOne more major sea battle would be fought in the conflict. [[St. James's Day Battle]] of 4 and 5 August ended in English victory, but failed to decide the war as the Dutch fleet escaped annihilation, although suffering heavy casualties.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=295-296}} At this stage, simply surviving was sufficient for the Dutch, as the English could hardly afford to replace their losses even after a victory. Tactically indecisive, with the Dutch losing two ships and the English one, the battle would have enormous political implications. Cornelis Tromp, commanding the Dutch rear, had defeated his English counterpart, but was accused by De Ruyter of being responsible for the plight of the main body of the Dutch fleet by chasing the English rear squadron as far as the English coast. As Tromp was the champion of the Orange party, the conflict led to much party strife. Because of this, Tromp was fired by the States of Holland on August 13.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/23/ |title = Monday 23 July 1666}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to proposing peace to de Witt, Arlington and Sylvius had plotted to provoke Orangist coup d'\u00e9tat against the Republic, to restore the stadtholderate, overthrow de Witt and end the war. Five days after St. James's Day Battle, Charles sent another peace offer, again using Buat as an intermediary. Sylvius also sent Buat details of the plot: these were for his contacts in the Orange party but were mistakenly included by Buat with the peace offer handed to the Grand Pensionary. Buat was arrested and those most involved in the conspiracy, including Kievit, fled to England. De Witt used the evidence of the plot to isolate the Orange movement and reaffirm his commitment to the French alliance. Buat was condemned for treason and beheaded in October 1666.{{sfn|Molhuysen|Blok|1911|p=509}}\n\n[[Image:Holmesbonfire.jpg|thumb|[[Holmes's Bonfire]]: the burning of [[West-Terschelling]]]]\nThe mood in the Republic now turned very belligerent, because on 19 August, the English Vice-Admiral [[Robert Holmes (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Holmes]] raided the [[Vlie]] estuary and destroyed up to 150 merchantmen sheltering there valued at around \u00a31 million, with only ten escaping, in an action later known as [[Holmes's Bonfire]]. The next day Holmes' men also landed on the island of [[Terschelling]] and, finding little of value, they burnt the small town of [[West-Terschelling]] to the ground, an act regarded by the Dutch as senseless destruction of a harmless fishing village.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=296-297}} In this, he was assisted by a Dutch captain, Laurens Heemskerck, who had fled from the Netherlands for cowardice shown during the battle of Lowestoft, and was afterwards condemned [[in absentia]] to perpetual banishment from the Netherlands.{{sfn|Van der Aa|1867|p=349}}\n\nAfter the [[Fire of London]] in September, the [[Navy Board]] was unable to pay the wages of the fleet and began to discharge many sailors without paying their wages, ensuring that it would be impossible to send out a major fleet in 1667.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=299-300}} Swedish mediation was offered in the autumn and informal discussions began, which led to the opening of formal negotiations in the following March. Charles was prepared to make some concessions, although he still required the return of the nutmeg island of [[Run (island)|Pulau Run]] and certain indemnities. The Dutch were unwilling to concede even his reduced demands, although discussions continued.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=300}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=18}}\n\nThe extent of Scottish privateering greatly increased in this year with the issue of twenty-five commissions in the three months from April 1666, the start of an intense 17-month period in which 108 Dutch, French and Danish vessels were recorded as captured by twenty or so Scottish privateers. Their success arose from the strategic position of Scotland, once most of the Atlantic seaborne trade of northern Europe was diverted around Scotland to avoid the English Channel, and the Dutch whaling and herring fleets operated in waters north and east of Scotland, so they were vulnerable Scottish privateers. Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned.{{sfn|Graham|1982|pp=68-70}}\n\n=== Third year, 1667 ===\n{{main|Raid on the Medway}}\n[[Image:MedwayRaidMap.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Raid on the Medway]] of 9\u201314 June 1667]]\nBy early-1667, the financial position of the English crown had become desperate. The kingdom lacked sufficient funds to maintain their fleet's seaworthiness, so it was decided in February that the heavy ships were to remain laid up at [[Chatham, England|Chatham]], with only a small ''Flying Fleet'' manned to attack Dutch merchant shipping, which lowered morale in the fleet and prevented merchant ship from sailing and [[collier (ship)|colliers]] from reaching London without fear of Dutch interception.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=139}} Clarendon informed Charles as to his only two options: to make very substantial concessions to Parliament, or to initiate peace talks with the Dutch under their conditions, which began in March. Charles had wished for peace talks to be held in England or, failing that, at the Hague, but the Dutch offered three other cities where support for the House of Orange was less and Charles selected [[Breda]], in the southern [[Generality Lands]].{{sfn|Davenport|2004|pp=121}} In the meantime, a Dutch fleet was assembled in the Texel under the command of William Van Ghent. One of the motives was to destroy the Scottish privateering fleet in the Firth of Forth. In a series of running encounters with Scottish privateers at sea, and various shore batteries (particularly at Burntisland) the Dutch were seen off with the loss of three ships damaged. {{sfn|Murdoch|2010|pp=247-251}} Thereafter, Scottish privateers followed the Dutch into the North Sea where they picked off stragglers without any difficulty. In the southern part of Britain, things did not go so well.\n\nAs England was also at war with France, Charles sent envoys to Paris in March for unofficial preliminary talks on peace terms.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=206}} In view of deteriorating Franco-Dutch relations, these talks turned to a third option not considered by Clarendon: a secret alliance with France.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=76}} In April, Charles concluded his first secret treaty with Louis, stipulating that England would not enter into alliances that might oppose a French conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]].{{sfn|Davenport|2004|p=122}} In May, the French invaded, starting the [[War of Devolution]].{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=206}} Charles hoped, by means of stalling the talks at Breda, to gain enough time to ready his fleet to obtain concessions from the Dutch, using the French advance as leverage.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDe Witt was aware of Charles's general intentions&nbsp;\u2013 though not of the secret treaty. He decided to attempt to end the war with a single stroke. Ever since its actions in Denmark in 1659, involving many landings to liberate the Danish Isles, the Dutch navy had made a special study of amphibious operations; the [[Dutch Marine Corps]] was established in 1665. After the [[Four Days' Battle]], a Dutch marine contingent had been ready to land in Kent or Essex following a possible Dutch victory at sea. The Dutch fleet was, however, unable to force a safe passage into the Thames as navigational buoys had been removed and a strong English squadron was ready to dispute their passage.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=287}} But now there was no English fleet able to contest a similar attack. De Witt conceived the plan for a landing of marines, to be overseen by his brother Cornelius, at Chatham where the fleet lay effectively defenceless, to destroy it.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=301}}\n\n[[Image:The Dutch burn English ships during the expedition to Chatham (Raid on Medway, 1667)(Jan van Leyden, 1669).jpg|thumb|''The Dutch burn English ships during the expedition to Chatham'' by [[Jan van Leyden (painter)|Jan van Leyden]]]]\nIn June, De Ruyter, with [[Cornelis de Witt]] supervising, launched the Dutch [[raid on the Medway]] at the mouth of the [[River Thames]]. After capturing the fort at [[Sheerness]], the Dutch fleet went on to break through the massive chain protecting the entrance to the Medway and, on the 13th, attacked the laid up English fleet.\n\nThe daring raid remains the most humiliating naval disaster in the history of the [[Royal Navy]] and its predecessors.{{sfn|Boxer|1974|p=39}} Fifteen of the Royal Navy's remaining ships were destroyed, either by the Dutch or by being scuttled by the English to block the river. Three of the eight remaining \"big ships\" were burnt: ''Royal Oak'', the new ''Loyal London'' and ''Royal James''. The largest English flagship, {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|6}}, was abandoned by its skeleton crew, captured without a shot being fired, and towed back to the United Provinces as a trophy. Its coat of arms is now on display in the [[Rijksmuseum]]. Fortunately for the English, the Dutch marines spared the [[Chatham Dockyard]], at the time England's largest industrial complex; a land attack on the docks themselves would have set back English naval power for a generation.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=77}} A Dutch attack on the English anchorage at [[Harwich]] had to be abandoned however after the [[battle of Landguard Fort]] ended in Dutch failure.\n\nThe Dutch success made a major psychological impact throughout England, with London feeling especially vulnerable just a year after the [[Great Fire of London]]. However, for a second time, the Dutch had been unable to land substantial land forces in Britain, or even do substantial damage to the Chatham dockyard.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=302}} The raid did, together with the English financial crisis, speed up negotiations.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=175}}{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=140}} All this, together with the cost of the war, of the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] and the extravagant spending of Charles's court, produced a rebellious atmosphere in London. Clarendon ordered the English envoys at Breda to sign a peace quickly, as Charles feared an open revolt.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== War in the Caribbean ===\n{{main|Battle of Martinique (1667)}}\n[[File:Martinique 1667.jpg|thumb|French ships under attack at Martinique, 1667]]\nThe Second Anglo-Dutch war had spread to the [[Caribbean]] islands, and in late 1665 an English force, mainly consisting of [[buccaneer]]s under the command of Lieutenant-colonel [[Edward Morgan (governor)|Edward Morgan]], the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Deputy Governor of Jamaica]], assisted by his nephew Thomas Morgan, quickly captured the Dutch islands of [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]]. After his uncle's death in December 1665, Thomas Morgan was appointed as governor of these two islands.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|pp=38-39}} Also in late 1665, an English force from Jamaica and [[Barbados]] captured the Dutch possession of [[Tobago]].{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=40}} The French declaration of war on the side of the Dutch altered the balance of power in the Caribbean and facilitated a Dutch counterattack. The first successes of the new allies were the French recapture of Tobago in August 1666, a joint Franco-Dutch recapture of Sint Eustatius in November 1666 and a French capture of the English island of [[Antigua]] in the same month.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=41}} The arrival of a French squadron under [[Joseph-Antoine de La Barre]] in January 1667 allowed the French to occupy the English half of St Kitts and [[Montserrat]], leaving only [[Nevis]] of the [[Leeward Islands]] in English hands, together with Jamaica and Barbados to the west.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|pp=41-42}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=36}}\n\nA Dutch force under Admiral [[Abraham Crijnssen]], organised by the province of Zeeland, not the States General, arrived at [[Cayenne]] in February 1667 and captured [[Suriname]] from the English in the same month.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=42}}{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=36}} Crijnssen delayed in Suriname until April, then sailed to Tobago, which had been vacated by the French after expelling the English garrison, where he rebuilt the fort and left a small garrison.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=42}} Although Crijnssen was instructed not to delay, it was not until early May that he and de La Barre combined forces, agreeing to a Franco-Dutch invasion of [[Nevis]], which sailed on 17 May 1667. However, their attack was repelled in the [[Battle of Nevis]] on 17 May by a smaller English force. This confused naval action was the only one in this war were all three navies fought: it failed largely through de la Barre's incompetence.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|pp=42-3}} After this failed attack, Crijnssen left in disgust and sailed to the north to attack the Virginia colony,{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=183}} while the French, under de la Barre, moved to Martinique. The Battle of Nevis restored English naval control in the Caribbean and allowed the early recapture of Antigua and Montserrat and an unsuccessful attack on St Kitts soon after.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=43}}\n\nIn April, a new English squadron of nine warships and two fireships under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir [[John Harman (Admiral)|John Harman]] sailed for the West Indies, reaching them in early June. Harman encountered the French with seven larger and 14 smaller warships and three fireships under la Barre anchored under the batteries of Fort [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]], Martinique. He attacked on 6 July and sunk, burnt or captured all but two the French ships.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=43}} With the French fleet neutralised, Harman then attacked the French at [[Cayenne]] on 15 September forcing its garrison to surrender. The English fleet then went on to recapture [[Fort Zeelandia (Guyana)|Fort Zeelandia]] in Suriname in October. News of these English victories only reached England in September, after the Treaty of Breda had been signed, and possessions captured after 31 July had to be returned.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=303}} Crijnssen sailed back to the Caribbean only to find the French fleet destroyed and the English back in possession of Suriname.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=223}}\n\n== Treaty of Breda ==\n{{Main|Treaty of Breda (1667)}}\n[[Image:Congress of Breda.jpg|thumb|The conclusion of the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]], at [[Breda Castle]]]]\nOn 31 July 1667, what is generally known as the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] concluded peace between England and the Netherlands. The treaty allowed the English to keep possession of [[New Netherland]], while the Dutch kept control over Pulau Run and the valuable sugar plantations of [[Suriname]] and regained Tobago, St Eustatius, and its West African trading posts.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=774}} This ''[[uti possidetis]]'' solution was later confirmed in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]].{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=47}} The [[Act of Navigation]] was modified in favour of the Dutch by England agreeing to treat Germany as part of the Netherlands' commercial hinterland, so that Dutch ships would now be allowed to carry German goods to English ports.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=774}}{{sfn|MacInnes|2008|p=114}}\n\nIn the same date and also at Breda, a public treaty was concluded between England and France that stipulated the return to England of the former English part of [[St Christopher]] and the islands of [[Antigua]] and [[Montserrat]], all of which the French had occupied in the war, and that England should surrender ''Acadia'' to France, although the extent of Acadia was not defined. This public treaty had been preceded by a secret treaty signed on 17 April in which, in addition to these exchanges of territory, Louis and Charles agreed not to enter into alliances opposed to the interests of the other, by which Louis secured the neutrality of England in the war he planned against Spain.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|pp=122, 132}}\n\nThe order of priorities whereby the Dutch preferred to give up what would become a major part of the United States, and instead retain a tropical colony, would seem strange by present-day standards. However, in the 17th century tropical colonies producing agricultural products which could not be grown in Europe were deemed more valuable than ones with a climate similar to that of Europe where Europeans could settle in comfort.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe peace was generally seen as a personal triumph for Johan de Witt and an embarrassment to the Orangists, who seemed reluctant to support the war and eager to accept a disadvantageous early peace.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=774-775}} The Republic was jubilant about the Dutch victory. De Witt used the occasion to induce four provinces to adopt the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)|Perpetual Edict of 1667]] abolishing the stadtholderate forever. He used the weak position of Charles II to force him into the [[Triple Alliance of 1668]] which again forced Louis to temporarily abandon his plans for the conquest of the southern Netherlands. But de Witt's success would eventually produce his downfall and nearly that of the Republic with it. Both humiliated monarchs intensified their secret cooperation and would, joined by the bishop of M\u00fcnster, attack the Dutch in 1672 in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]. De Witt was unable to counter this attack, as he could not create a strong Dutch army for lack of money and for fear that it would strengthen the position of the young [[William III of England|William III]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} That same year de Witt was assassinated, and William became stadtholder.\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n |last       = Armitage\n |first      = D.\n |date       = 2000\n |title      = The Ideological Origins of the British Empire\n |location   = Cambridge\n |publisher  = Cambridge University Press\n |isbn       = 9780521789783\n |ref        = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last       = Ashley\n |first      = M.

After initial English successes, the war ended in a Dutch victory. It was the second of [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|a series of naval wars]] fought between the English and the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Anglo-Dutch relations ===\nTraditionally, many historians considered that the [[First Anglo-Dutch War|First]] and Second Anglo-Dutch Wars arose from commercial and maritime rivalry between England and the Netherlands, although conceding that the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] was less the result of commercial rivalry.{{sfn|Rommelse|2010|p=492}} However, more recent research has suggested that political issues, particularly in England, had a significant effect on the outbreak of these conflicts. Although continuing commercial tensions formed the background to the second war, a group of ambitious English politicians and naval officers frustrated diplomatic efforts to reach any accommodation between the parties.{{sfn|Rommelse|2010|p=493}} Religious and political differences between the Anglican royalists in England and the Calvinist republicans that formed the ruling group in the Netherlands, each seeing the other as an ideological threat, also hampered agreement.{{sfn|Pincus|2002|pp=246\u2013262}}\n\nThe last major battle of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]] was an English victory in the [[battle of Scheveningen]] in August 1653. However, after this the Dutch turned to using smaller warships and [[privateer]]ing and, by November Cromwell was willing to make peace as the Dutch were capturing numerous English merchant ships.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=721-722}} His only stipulation was that no Prince of Orange or other member of the [[House of Orange]] should hold the office of [[stadtholder]] or any other public office in the Netherlands. When this demand was made public, it was strongly opposed by Orangists, so it was dropped from formal negotiations.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=722}} De Witt realised that he would not persuade most of the provinces to accept the exclusion of members of the House of Orange from public office as part of a peace treaty, so the public terms of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]] made no mention of this. However, the two members of the negotiating team from Holland, unknown to their colleagues, agreed to a secret annexe providing, although the Netherlands would ratify the treaty without delay, England would only do so once the States of Holland had passed an [[Act of Seclusion]], excluding the House of Orange from holding public office in the province of Holland.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=722}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe States General of the United Provinces approved and ratified the Treaty of Westminster, unaware of the secret annexe attached to version of the treaty that the English would ratify.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=722}} De Witt had to use his influence to persuade delegates from the towns of Holland, many initially unfavourable, to support Exclusion, and some of their pensionaries resisted to the end, although they did not try to involve other provinces. Holland passed its Act of Exclusion on 4 May 1654.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=722-723}} Adverse reactions from the public in other provinces was strong, but their provincial assemblies could neither overcome their own internal divisions nor act with other provinces to oppose it. However, any expectation that the other provinces would enact their own Act of Exclusion after Holland had passed its act was not realised in the short term, although in practice the policy was not opposed. Only after the war did four provinces besides Holland adopt the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)]] sanctioning Exclusion.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=723-724}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] government of [[Oliver Cromwell]] wished to avoid further conflict with the Dutch Republic, as it was planning war with Spain, which began as the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1654\u20131660)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1654\u20131660 after the Treaty of Westminster was signed.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=24}} The English feared Dutch intervention in this war on the side of the Spanish, as the Republic contained an Orangist party hostile to Cromwell. However, Orangist sentiments were found more among the common people than those with political influence. The controversy over Exclusion strengthened de Witt's position in Holland and increased the influence of Holland over the other provinces.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=726-727}} De Witt's position was further strengthened by increasing Dutch dominance in international trade, which replaced English trade with Spain and its possessions in Italy and America during the Anglo-Spanish War. Once the Netherlands had supplanted England on these areas, its traders were very reluctant to see English rivals readmitted.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=727}}\n\nAfter the First Anglo-Dutch War [[Johan de Witt]], who had been elected Grand [[Pensionary]] of Holland, took over effective control of Netherlands' foreign policy until his death in 1672. He realised that the Netherlands could never win a war with England or France conclusively, and that even surviving a war with either power would only be possible at enormous cost. He therefore strove for a neutrality in which Dutch commerce could flourish, supported by sufficiently strong land and naval forces to deter either of these two nations as a possible adversary.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=23-24}} Despite traditional Dutch hostility towards Spain, de Witt declined to join Cromwell in attacking it, but the Dutch had no desire to aid their hated former master, so remained neutral. De Witt was, however, prepared to act alone against Sweden in 1655 and, jointly with Denmark, again in 1658. Although the Commonwealth was an ally of Sweden, it did not come to the aid of its ally, even when the Dutch thwarted the Swedish attempt to conquer Denmark in the [[battle of the Sound]] on 8 November 1658.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=736}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=24}} De Witt's aim was to establish peace in the Baltic for the benefit of Dutch commerce there. With a similar aim, he attempted to end the long-running conflict with Portugal, allowing it to retain Brazil over the protests of two of the five Netherlands provinces in 1661.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=25,31}}\n\nThe Dutch used the years of peace to build up their commercial fleet again, following its devastation in the First Anglo-Dutch War. De Witt also achieved the post-war completion of many new warships, ordered during the war to augment the existing fleet, including several large ships comparable in armament to the all but the largest English ones. These had been given greater constructional strength and a wider beam to support heavier guns.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|pp=64-66}} However, despite the pleas of the admirals for more of these powerful ships, many of those built were relatively small and designed as convoy escorts, protecting trade routes, not to fight in fleet actions.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=66}}{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=716-717}} In addition, the [[Dutch East India Company]] built hybrid ships that could be used for carrying cargo, as convoy escorts or in battle, although they were not as strongly built as pure warships.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=74}}\n\nWhile the English had won the majority of naval battles and destroyed or captured a great many Dutch merchant ships during the First Anglo-Dutch War, they failed to win the war.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=717}} The Republic was in a better financial position than the Commonwealth of England, potentially enabling the Dutch to complete the fitting out their naval fleet to replace their losses at faster pace than England.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=721}} However, de Witt was unable to put naval finances on a centralised basis, as each of the five admiralties and the three provinces that maintained them retained considerable independence.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=67}} In addition, as the Dutch navy did not rely on [[Impressment|the press gang]], securing sufficient manpower could be a problem,{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=32}} although abandoning the practice of paying off seamen and laying up ships in the winter promoted a more professional and permanent body of sailors, committed to naval service,{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|pp=71-72}}\n\nWhile the war continued, the Dutch had also been free to expand their trade networks along the main sea routes outside English home waters without fear of English retaliation, as the majority of English warships were in home waters, with only a relatively few available overseas. English commerce was grinding to a halt as they lost access to the Baltic and the Mediterranean Seas, and when the two sides signed the peace treaty in 1654, the English were in essentially the same position that they had begun: watching the Dutch Republic outstrip their economy to become the premier European trade power.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=721}}\n\n=== England ===\n\n==== Trade ====\nTo make matters worse for England, the conclusion of the First Anglo-Dutch War was immediately followed by the Anglo-Spanish War of 1654\u20131660, which disrupted the remnants of trade the Commonwealth had with Spain and southern Italy. The Dutch were left with free rein to expand their influence in the area: this period was one of the highest points in the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and ironically the English interference was partly responsible.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=727}}\n\nA major problem with the English trading system was that it was based on prohibitions, such as the [[Navigation Acts]], tariffs and customs, and the regulation of manufacturing. All these measures, even tariffs which were originally designed to raise revenue, were directed to the protection of English trade.{{sfn|Vries|2015|p=340}} Although the Dutch system was said to be based on [[free trade]], this only applied to Europe, and not to Dutch trading settlements elsewhere. The prices of Dutch goods were more attractive around the world because the Dutch taxation system imposed excise duties on its own consumers, rather than customs duties on the foreign users of its exports.{{sfn|Hughes|1934|p=125}} The end of the First Anglo-Dutch War had not changed this dynamic. Indeed, the end of the war had set the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands|United Provinces]] free to expand their trade while the English were still hindered by the same tariff system.{{sfn|Ashley|1961|p=365}} Thus, another war seemed inevitable to many people of the time, as the Commonwealth was unlikely to give up its naval and economic superiority without a fight.\n\n==== Restoration ====\nThe [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], in 1660, initially produced a general surge of optimism in England. Many hoped to reverse the Dutch dominance in world trade.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=713\u2013714}} At first, however, Charles II sought to remain on friendly terms with the Republic, as he was personally greatly in debt to the House of Orange, which had lent large sums to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] during the [[English Civil War]].{{sfn|Groenveld|1991|pp=960, 963}} Nevertheless, a conflict soon developed between the [[States of Holland]] and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary]] over the education and future prospects of [[William III of England|William III of Orange]], the posthumous son of Dutch stadtholder [[William II of Orange]] and Charles' nephew. William was designated a \"Child of State\" in 1660, implying he would be trained for high office by the States-General. When Mary died in 1661,  she named Charles as a guardian of William, allowing England a measure of influence in Dutch politics.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=751-753}}\n\nThe Dutch, in a move coordinated by [[Cornelis de Graeff|Cornelis]] and [[Andries de Graeff]], tried to placate the king with prodigious gifts, such as the [[Dutch Gift]] of 1660.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=750}} Negotiations were started in 1661 to solve these issues, which ended in the treaty of 1662, in which the Dutch conceded on most points.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=92}} In 1663, [[Louis XIV]] of [[France]] stated his claim to portions of the [[Habsburg]] [[southern Netherlands]], leading to a short rapprochement between England and the Republic.{{sfn|Lynn|1999|pp=33\u201334}} During this time, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], serving as chief minister to King Charles II of England, felt that France had become the greatest danger to England.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=49}}\n\nIn 1664, however, the situation quickly changed: Clarendon's enemy, [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], became the favourite of the king, and he and his client [[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Sir Thomas Clifford M.P., later Lord Clifford]], began to cooperate with the king's brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], the [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=101-102}} James, Arlington and Clifford, who was chairman of a House of Commons committee investigating the supposed depression in English maritime commerce agreed that Dutch commercial competition had to be stifled, even if this led to war with the United Provinces,{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=102}} as they considered the United Provinces were a greater threat to English interests than was France. They coordinated their efforts in order to reduce Dutch competition through a policy of reprisals against Dutch ships, which were captured in significant numbers.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=105}} and expected significant personal gain from this policy. James, the Duke of York, headed the [[Royal African Company]] and hoped to seize the possessions of the [[Dutch West India Company]], including [[New Amsterdam]].{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=103}}\n\nThis aggressive policy was supported by the English ambassador in [[The Hague]], Sir [[Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet|George Downing]], who acted as agent for James, Arlington and Clifford{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=2}} From his position in the Hague, Downing gave a full and detailed account of all the political affairs in the United Provinces to Charles as well as James and his associates. Downing reported back to London that the Republic was politically divided and that the Dutch would submit to English demands rather than go to war.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=103}} Even after the English fleet began seizing Dutch ships and an attack on Dutch possessions in West Africa, he reported in August 1664 that the Dutch would probably accept reducing their share of overseas trade in favour of England, although contemporary Dutch sources reported strengthening Dutch resistance to these provocations.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=105-106}} Since 1661, Downing had been in contact with the Orangists, who he believed would collaborate with England against their enemy, the republican States faction.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=83}} However, although some Orangists entered into treasonable correspondence with England in an attempt to end the war and overthrow de Witt, the rapid arrest and execution of [[Henri de Fleury de Coulan|de Buat]] showed their weakness.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}}\n\nCharles was influenced by James and Arlington as he sought a popular and lucrative foreign war at sea to bolster his authority as king.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=65}} Many naval officers welcomed the prospect of a conflict with the Dutch as they expected to make their name and fortune in battles they hoped to win as decisively as in the previous war.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=65}}\n\n==== War agitation ====\n[[Image:James, Duke of York - Romanesque.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], the [[Lord High Admiral of England]] and openly Catholic, argued in favour of war between England and the Dutch]]\nAs enthusiasm for war rose among the English populace, [[privateer]]s began to join navy ships in attacking Dutch ships, capturing them and taking them to English harbors.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=93}} By the time that the United Provinces declared war on England, about two hundred Dutch ships had been brought to English ports.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=766}} Dutch ships were obligated by the new treaty to salute the [[Flag of England|English flag]] first. In 1664, English ships began to provoke the Dutch by not saluting in return. Though ordered by the Dutch government to continue saluting first, many Dutch commanders could not bear the insult.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nWhether to secure concessions from the Dutch or provoke open conflict with them, James already in late 1663 had sent [[Robert Holmes (admiral)|Robert Holmes]], to protect the interests of the Royal African Company.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=93}} Holmes captured the Dutch trading post of Cabo Verde in June 1664 and confiscated several ships of the Dutch West India company in [[West Africa]], ,{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=67}} allegedly as reprisals for English ships captured by that company, and England refused any compensation for these captures, for disrupting that company's trading operations or for other hostile acts.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=93-94}} Slightly later, the English invaded the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] in North America on 24 June 1664, and had taken control of it by October.{{sfn|Pomfret|1973|p=22}}\n\nThe States General responded by sending a fleet under [[Michiel de Ruyter]] that recaptured their African trading posts and captured most of the English trading stations there, then crossed the Atlantic for a [[punitive expedition]] against the English in America.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=68}} In December 1664, the English suddenly attacked the Dutch [[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] fleet. Though the attack failed, the Dutch in January 1665 allowed their ships to open fire on English warships in the colonies when threatened.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=135,139}}\n\n[[Image:AmboynaFort1655.jpg|thumb|English propaganda in 1655: the [[Amboyna massacre]] of 1623, in which Dutch agents tortured and executed Englishmen]]\nThe war was supported in England by propaganda concerning the much earlier [[Amboyna Massacre]] of 1623. In that year, ten English [[factor (agent)|factors]], resident in the Dutch fortress of Victoria and ten Japanese and Portuguese employees of the Dutch East India Company on [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] were executed by beheading following accusations of treason. After their arrest, many of the English prisoners were, according to the trial records, tortured by having a cloth placed over their faces, upon which water was poured to cause near suffocation, now called [[waterboarding]]. Other, more sadistic, tortures were alleged although denied by the Dutch. The incident provoked a major crisis in Anglo-Dutch relations at the time and continuing popular anger,{{sfn|Armitage|2000|p=87}} although the matter had been be officially settled with the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|Treaty of Westminster]]. The [[East India Company]] set out its case against the [[Dutch East India Company]] in a pamphlet published in 1631, which was used for anti-Dutch propaganda during the First Anglo-Dutch War and revived by pamphleteers as a second war neared. When De Ruyter recaptured the West African trading posts, many pamphlets were written about presumed new Dutch atrocities, although these contained no basis in fact.{{sfn|Pincus|2002|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nAnother cause of conflict was mercantile competition. The major monopolistic English trading companies had suffered from a loss of trade on the 1650s, which they attributed to illegal contraband trading and Dutch competition. They wished the government to exclude the Dutch from trading with British colonies, and force those colonies to trade only with the licensed English trading companies.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=46\u201347}} The Dutch, whose maritime trade was substantially that of an intermediary, rejected the policies of [[Mercantilism]] in favour of the ''[[International waters|mare liberum]]'' where it was in their interest to do so, while enforcing a strict monopoly in the [[Dutch Indies]], and attempted to expand it to their other settlements.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n=== Dutch Republic ===\n\n==== Preparedness ====\n[[Image:Anglo-Dutch-War-2english.png|thumb|Apart from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], most fighting took place in the southern North Sea]]\nAfter their defeat in the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch became much better prepared. From 1653, De Witt began to make plans for a \"New Navy\" to be constructed, with a core of sixty-four new, heavier ships of the line with 40 to 60 guns and 90 smaller convoy escorts, and more professional captains were sought for these.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|pp=64-5}} However, even the heavier Dutch ships were much lighter than the ten \"big ships\" of the English navy and, in 1664, when war threatened, the decision was taken to expand the core Dutch fleet with still heavier ships, although on the outbreak of war in 1665, these new vessels were mostly still under construction, and the Dutch only possessed four heavier [[ships of the line]].{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=66}} At the time of the [[Battle of Lowestoft]], the Dutch fleet included eighteen older warships reactivated after being laid up after the First Anglo-Dutch war, and several very large [[Dutch East India Company]] built hybrid ships which could be used for carrying cargo or in battle, although not as strongly built as pure warships.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=74}} During the second war, the Dutch Republic was in a better financial position than England and quickly completed the new ships, whereas England could only build a dozen ships, due to financial difficulties.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=721}} However, de Witt saw that men, not materiel, were critical, and attempted to deal with the insubordination, lack of discipline and apparent cowardice among captains at the start of the war.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=127}}\n\nIn 1665, England boasted a population about four times as large as that of the Dutch Republic. This population was dominated by poor peasants, however, and so the only source of ready cash were the cities. The Dutch urban population exceeded that of England in both proportional and absolute terms and the Republic would be able to spend more than twice the amount of money on the war as England, the equivalent of \u00a311,000,000.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=79}} The outbreak of war was followed ominously by the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] and the [[Great Fire of London]], hitting the only major urban centre of the country. These events, occurring in such close succession, virtually brought England to its knees, as the English fleet had suffered from cash shortages even before these calamities, despite having been voted a record budget of [[GBP|\u00a3]]2,500,000 by the English parliament. However, as Charles lacked effective means of enforcing taxation; those taxes voted were collected neither in full nor quickly. For much of the war, Charles was dependent on loans raised in the City of London at interest rates which increased as the war progressed, to cover both collection delays and for expenditure in excess of the budget.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=43}} Although the Duke of York had attempted to reform the finances of the [[Navy Board]], cash flow remained a problem, and sailors were not paid wholly in cash, but mainly with \"tickets\", or debt certificates, which were only redeemed after long delays when cash was available.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=42,193}} Receipts from the sale of goods carried by Dutch ships captured by Royal Navy warships and the ships themselves or, to a lesser extent, by privateers, were a valuable source of funds to finance for the Navy Board, and the attack Dutch East Indies fleet at [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] had this as at least one of its objectives.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=123-125}} However, a large part of the proceeds of these captures was retained by the captors, either illegally or returned to them as prize money and, although it has been claimed that English financial penury made the war's outcome dependent on the fortunes of its privateers,{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=78}} this was never more than an irregular windfall, and opportunities for capturing Dutch merchant vessels were greatest before and just after war was declared, diminishing as the war forced them to stay in port.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=124-125,149}} Far fewer prizes were taken by the Royal Navy than in the First Anglo-Dutch War and, overall and particularly after 1665, Dutch privateers would be the more successful.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=175,195}}\n\n=== France ===\nA Franco-Dutch treaty had been signed in 1662, which involved a defensive alliance between the two countries, giving the Netherlands protection against an English attack and assuring France that the Netherlands would not assist Spain in the [[Spanish Netherlands]].{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=33-4}} Although [[Louis XIV of France]] had signed this treaty, he considered that an Anglo-Dutch war was likely to obstruct his plans to acquire Habsburg territory there.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=109}} Charles' ambassador in France reported the French opposition to the outbreak of such a war gave him the hope that, if the Dutch were provoked into declaring war, the French would evade their treaty obligations, and refuse to be drawn into a naval war with England.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=69, 136}} In the summer of 1664, Louis attempted to avert the threatened Anglo-Dutch war or, failing that, to confine it to Africa and America.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|p=119}} These efforts to mediate an agreement failed, and the war commenced with a declaration of war by the Dutch on 4 March 1665, following English attacks on two Dutch convoys off Cadiz and in the English Channel.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=67-68}}\n\nEven after the war began, Louis attempted to evade his obligation by strengthening the French embassy in London with two envoys&nbsp; under the name of the ''c\u00e9l\u00e8bre ambassade''&nbsp, which included an [[Ambassador Extraordinary]] in addition to the resident ambassador, to begin negotiations for a settlement of the Anglo-Dutch conflict. Its instructions were to offer terms including the restitution of each country's ships captured off America and Africa, and of their West African bases, and also financial compensation for English ships captured earlier in West Africa. However, the instructions did not propose that the [[New Netherlands]] should be included in any treaty, but settled by local fighting that would not involve a European War. The Dutch complained that these terms denied their rights to the New Netherlands.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|pp=119, 120}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=151, 152}}\n\n== Hostilities ==\n\n=== First year, 1665 ===\n{{main|Battle of Lowestoft}}\n[[Image:Van Minderhout Battle of Lowestoft.jpg|thumb|The battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, showing {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|6}} and ''Eendracht'']]\nAt the start of the war, both sides considered an early decisive battle was desirable, as English government finances could not sustain a long war, and an English blockade of Dutch ports and attacks on their merchant and fishing fleets would soon bring about their economic ruin.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=69-70}} De Witt and the States General put pressure on their commander [[Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam]] to seek out the English fleet and bring it into battle, although his fleet was inferior in organisation, training, discipline and firepower to the English fleet.{{sfn|Bruijn|2011|p=74}}{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=83-85}} In their first at the [[Battle of Lowestoft]] on 13 June 1665, the Dutch suffered the worst defeat in the history the Dutch Republic's navy, with at least sixteen ships lost, and one-third of its personnel killed or captured.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=126-127}}\n\nHowever, the English were unable to capitalise on their victory at Lowestoft, as the majority of the Dutch fleet escaped. The leading Dutch politician, the [[Grand Pensionary]] of Holland [[Johan de Witt]], attempted to restore confidence by joining the fleet personally and dealt with failed or ineffective captains by executing three and exiling and dismissing others. [[Michiel de Ruyter]] was appointed to lead the Dutch fleet in July 1665, despite the previous appointment of Cornelis Tromp as acting commander in chief, and he formalised new tactics.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=125-127}} The Spice Fleet from the Dutch East Indies managed to return home safely after the [[battle of V\u00e5gen]], although it was at first blockaded at Bergen, causing the financial position to swing in favour of the Dutch.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=70}}\n\nIn the summer of 1665 the [[bishop of M\u00fcnster]], [[Bernhard von Galen]], an old enemy of the Dutch, was induced by promises of English subsidies to invade the Republic.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} At the same time, the English made overtures to Spain. [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was now concerned by the attack by M\u00fcnster and the prospect of an English\u2013Spanish coalition, and the effect this might have on his conquering the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. He first arranged for other German states to obstruct the passage of Munster troops and promised to send a French army corps to Germany.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=143}} Louis was still unwilling to act against England under the 1662 defensive treaty, so he revived his attempts to mediate a settlement.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=109}} The French ambassadors, with de Witt's assent, offered to accept the loss of the New Netherlands and of two West African posts seized by Holmes and to return a third post seized by de Ruyter. However, the English fleet's success at Lowestoft prompted Charles and his ministers to reject this offer and demand further surrenders of territory and a Dutch agreement to bear the costs of the war. When, in December 1665, Charles refused a French counter-offer, Louis withdrew both his ambassadors, signalling his intention to declare war.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|p=120}}\n\n[[Image:BloemVaagen1665.jpg|thumb|Attack on Bergen, Norway, on 12 August 1665]]\nThese events caused consternation at the English court. It now seemed that the Republic could end up as either a Habsburg possession or a French protectorate: either outcome would be disastrous for England's strategic position. Clarendon was ordered to make peace with the Dutch, quickly and without French mediation. Downing used his Orangist contacts to induce the province of [[Overijssel]], whose countryside had been ravaged by Galen's troops, to ask the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] for a peace with England{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} The Orangists naively wished to gain peace by conceding the English demand that the young William III should be made captain-general and admiral-general of the republic, which would ensure his eventual appointment to the stadtholderate. De Witt's position was, however, too strong for this Orangist attempt to seize power to succeed.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} In November, he promised Louis never to conclude a separate peace with England.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=146}} On 11 December he openly declared that the only acceptable peace terms would be either a return to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', or a quick end to hostilities under a ''[[uti possidetis]]'' clause.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=151}}\n\nAt the end of 1665, [[Henri de Fleury de Coulan|Henri Buat]] a Frenchman with connections to the House of Orange became involved in unofficial correspondence with Sir [[Gabriel Sylvius]], who was acting on behalf of [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], a minister of Charles II. Their correspondence was a means for the Dutch and English governments to explore possibilities of peace without commitment.{{sfn|Molhuysen|Blok|1911|p=509}} At an early stage, Buat made the Grand Pensionary [[Johan de Witt]] fully aware of this correspondence, and Buat added material provided by de Witt to his letter, including possible peace terms, although de Witt was unsure whether Charles was genuinely seeking peace.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=168}} Moreover, 1665 had seen Scotland enter the war, principally in a privateering capacity in which they proved to be particularly successful.{{sfn|Murdoch|2010|pp=237-254}} However, Scottish privateering activities in 1665 were limited, because of delays in the Scottish Admiral issuing regular [[Letters of marque]] at the start of the war.{{sfn|Graham|1982|p=68}}\n\n=== Second year, 1666 ===\n{{main|Four Days' Battle}}\nAfter Battle of Lowestoft, Louis XIV was concerned that the destruction of the Dutch fleet would allow the English fleet to interfere with his plans in the Spanish Netherlands, so he again offered mediation, but as his credibility as mediator been undermined, this offer was rejected by England. Louis declared war on England on 16 January 1666,{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=136}} and the anti-English alliance was strengthened in the winter of 1666, when, in February, [[Frederick III of Denmark]] also declared war after receiving a large subsidy.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=148, 152}} Next, [[Brandenburg]] which had earlier been prompted by France to offer mediation, threatened to attack M\u00fcnster from the east: as the promised English subsidies had remained largely hypothetical, Von Galen made peace with the Republic in April at [[Cleves]].{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|pp=147, 151-152}}\n\nBy February 1666, the negotiations using Buat as an intermediary had progressed to the stage where de Witt invited Charles II to start formal peace negotiations.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=169}} An outline of the English peace proposals was forwarded through Buat but rejected by de Witt pending clarification of its terms. No clarification was provided, only repeated English insistence that someone duly authorised should be sent to London to negotiate peace. Both the States of Holland and the French ambassador rejected this proposal. During these negotiations, Buat was in contact with leading Orangists, including [[Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein|the Lord of Zuylestein]] and the Rotterdam regent [[Johan Kievit]], although the Prince himself was not involved.{{sfn|Molhuysen|Blok|1911|p=509}}\n\nBy the spring of 1666, the Dutch had rebuilt their fleet with much heavier ships, thirty of them possessing more cannon than any Dutch ship available in early 1665, and threatened to join forces with the French.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=71}} The greater part of the French fleet was in the Mediterranean under the [[Fran\u00e7ois de Vend\u00f4me, duc de Beaufort|duc de Beaufort]], and Louis intended that much of this would be brought into the Atlantic to join up with the Atlantic squadron commanded by [[Abraham Duquesne]]. The combined fleet would then, it was intended, link up with the Dutch in the [[English Channel]] and outnumber the English fleet.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=123-127}}\n\n[[Image:Storck, Four Days Battle.jpg|thumb|The [[Four Days' Battle]] as depicted by [[Abraham Storck]]]]\nDespite administrative and logistic difficulties, an English fleet of some eighty ships, under the joint command of [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|the Duke of Albemarle]] and [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], set sail at the end of May 1666. The French intention to bring the bulk of their Mediterranean fleet to join the Dutch fleet at [[Dunkirk]] was known to Prince Rupert by 10 May and discussed by Charles and his [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 13 May. When [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|the Duke of Albemarle]] was informed, he agreed to detach a squadron of 20 generally fast or well-armed ships under Prince Rupert to block the [[Strait of Dover]],{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=116-117}} provided he were left with at least 70 ships to fight the Dutch.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=143}} Rupert was detached on 29 May ([[Julian calendar]]) to prevent Beaufort passing through the English Channel to join the Dutch fleet.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=72}} In the event the French fleet did not appear, because Beaufort, who had left Toulon in April 1666 with 32 fighting ships, delayed at Lisbon for six weeks,{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=173-175, 180}} during which time the English and Dutch fleets fought the [[Four Days' Battle]], one of the longest naval engagements in history.\n\nLeaving [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]], Albemarle came upon De Ruyter's fleet of 85 ships at anchor, and he immediately engaged the nearest Dutch ship before the rest of the fleet could come to its assistance. The Dutch rearguard under Lieutenant-Admiral [[Cornelis Tromp]] withdrew upon a [[Port and starboard|starboard]] [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]], taking the battle toward the Flemish shoals, compelling Albemarle to turn about to prevent being outflanked by the Dutch rear and centre. This culminated in a ferocious unremitting battle that raged until nightfall.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=73}} At daylight on 2 June, Albemarle's strength of operable vessels was reduced to 44 ships, but with these, he renewed the battle tacking past the enemy four times in close action. With his fleet in too poor a condition to continue to challenge, he then retired towards the Thames Estuary with the Dutch in pursuit.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=234-236}}\nThe following day Albemarle ordered the damaged ships to lead, protecting them from the Dutch fleet by stationing his most powerful ships as a rearguard on the 3rd, until Prince Rupert, returning with his twenty ships, joined him.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=236-238}}{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=74}} During this stage of the battle, Vice-Admiral [[George Ayscue]], accidentally grounded in the ''Prince Royal'', one of the nine remaining \"big ships\", and surrendered. This was the last time in history that an English admiral surrendered in battle.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=75}} After this loss and the return of several badly damaged ships to port, Albemarle, reinforced by Rupert's fresh squadron had 52 ships to face the Dutch with 57 ships.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=248}} After Rupert broke the Dutch line and, with Albemarle attacked Tromp with superior numbers,{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=254-256}} de Ruyter decided the battle on the fourth day, by a surprise all-out attack when Tromp seemed about to be defeated.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=263-264}} When the English retreated, De Ruyter was reluctant to follow, perhaps because of lack of gunpowder.\n\nThe battle ended with both sides claiming victory: the English because they contended Dutch Lieutenant Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]] had retreated first, the Dutch because they had inflicted much greater losses on the English, who lost ten ships against the Dutch four.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=276-277}} Although the Dutch claim seems more valid, their rejoicing was out of proportion to what had been achieved. It had taken four days to force a weaker, and before Rupert's return much weaker, English opponent that had close to defeating them on the second and fourth days. and their belief that the English fleet was destroyed as a fighting force was shown to be false a few weeks later.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=276}}\n\n[[Image:St. James Day Fight, Pic 1.jpg|thumb|[[St. James's Day Battle]] 4 August 1666]]\nOne more major sea battle would be fought in the conflict.

Tactically indecisive, with the Dutch losing two ships and the English one, the battle would have enormous political implications. Cornelis Tromp, commanding the Dutch rear, had defeated his English counterpart, but was accused by De Ruyter of being responsible for the plight of the main body of the Dutch fleet by chasing the English rear squadron as far as the English coast. As Tromp was the champion of the Orange party, the conflict led to much party strife. Because of this, Tromp was fired by the States of Holland on August 13.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1666/07/23/ |title = Monday 23 July 1666}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to proposing peace to de Witt, Arlington and Sylvius had plotted to provoke Orangist coup d'\u00e9tat against the Republic, to restore the stadtholderate, overthrow de Witt and end the war. Five days after St. James's Day Battle, Charles sent another peace offer, again using Buat as an intermediary. Sylvius also sent Buat details of the plot: these were for his contacts in the Orange party but were mistakenly included by Buat with the peace offer handed to the Grand Pensionary. Buat was arrested and those most involved in the conspiracy, including Kievit, fled to England. De Witt used the evidence of the plot to isolate the Orange movement and reaffirm his commitment to the French alliance. Buat was condemned for treason and beheaded in October 1666.{{sfn|Molhuysen|Blok|1911|p=509}}\n\n[[Image:Holmesbonfire.jpg|thumb|[[Holmes's Bonfire]]: the burning of [[West-Terschelling]]]]\nThe mood in the Republic now turned very belligerent, because on 19 August, the English Vice-Admiral [[Robert Holmes (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Holmes]] raided the [[Vlie]] estuary and destroyed up to 150 merchantmen sheltering there valued at around \u00a31 million, with only ten escaping, in an action later known as [[Holmes's Bonfire]]. The next day Holmes' men also landed on the island of [[Terschelling]] and, finding little of value, they burnt the small town of [[West-Terschelling]] to the ground, an act regarded by the Dutch as senseless destruction of a harmless fishing village.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=296-297}} In this, he was assisted by a Dutch captain, Laurens Heemskerck, who had fled from the Netherlands for cowardice shown during the battle of Lowestoft, and was afterwards condemned [[in absentia]] to perpetual banishment from the Netherlands.{{sfn|Van der Aa|1867|p=349}}\n\nAfter the [[Fire of London]] in September, the [[Navy Board]] was unable to pay the wages of the fleet and began to discharge many sailors without paying their wages, ensuring that it would be impossible to send out a major fleet in 1667.{{sfn|Fox|2018|pp=299-300}} Swedish mediation was offered in the autumn and informal discussions began, which led to the opening of formal negotiations in the following March. Charles was prepared to make some concessions, although he still required the return of the nutmeg island of [[Run (island)|Pulau Run]] and certain indemnities. The Dutch were unwilling to concede even his reduced demands, although discussions continued.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=300}}{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=18}}\n\nThe extent of Scottish privateering greatly increased in this year with the issue of twenty-five commissions in the three months from April 1666, the start of an intense 17-month period in which 108 Dutch, French and Danish vessels were recorded as captured by twenty or so Scottish privateers. Their success arose from the strategic position of Scotland, once most of the Atlantic seaborne trade of northern Europe was diverted around Scotland to avoid the English Channel, and the Dutch whaling and herring fleets operated in waters north and east of Scotland, so they were vulnerable Scottish privateers. Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned.{{sfn|Graham|1982|pp=68-70}}\n\n=== Third year, 1667 ===\n{{main|Raid on the Medway}}\n[[Image:MedwayRaidMap.png|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Raid on the Medway]] of 9\u201314 June 1667]]\nBy early-1667, the financial position of the English crown had become desperate. The kingdom lacked sufficient funds to maintain their fleet's seaworthiness, so it was decided in February that the heavy ships were to remain laid up at [[Chatham, England|Chatham]], with only a small ''Flying Fleet'' manned to attack Dutch merchant shipping, which lowered morale in the fleet and prevented merchant ship from sailing and [[collier (ship)|colliers]] from reaching London without fear of Dutch interception.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=139}} Clarendon informed Charles as to his only two options: to make very substantial concessions to Parliament, or to initiate peace talks with the Dutch under their conditions, which began in March. Charles had wished for peace talks to be held in England or, failing that, at the Hague, but the Dutch offered three other cities where support for the House of Orange was less and Charles selected [[Breda]], in the southern [[Generality Lands]].{{sfn|Davenport|2004|pp=121}} In the meantime, a Dutch fleet was assembled in the Texel under the command of William Van Ghent. One of the motives was to destroy the Scottish privateering fleet in the Firth of Forth. In a series of running encounters with Scottish privateers at sea, and various shore batteries (particularly at Burntisland) the Dutch were seen off with the loss of three ships damaged. {{sfn|Murdoch|2010|pp=247-251}} Thereafter, Scottish privateers followed the Dutch into the North Sea where they picked off stragglers without any difficulty. In the southern part of Britain, things did not go so well.\n\nAs England was also at war with France, Charles sent envoys to Paris in March for unofficial preliminary talks on peace terms.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=206}} In view of deteriorating Franco-Dutch relations, these talks turned to a third option not considered by Clarendon: a secret alliance with France.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=76}} In April, Charles concluded his first secret treaty with Louis, stipulating that England would not enter into alliances that might oppose a French conquest of the [[Spanish Netherlands]].{{sfn|Davenport|2004|p=122}} In May, the French invaded, starting the [[War of Devolution]].{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=206}} Charles hoped, by means of stalling the talks at Breda, to gain enough time to ready his fleet to obtain concessions from the Dutch, using the French advance as leverage.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDe Witt was aware of Charles's general intentions&nbsp;\u2013 though not of the secret treaty. He decided to attempt to end the war with a single stroke. Ever since its actions in Denmark in 1659, involving many landings to liberate the Danish Isles, the Dutch navy had made a special study of amphibious operations; the [[Dutch Marine Corps]] was established in 1665. After the [[Four Days' Battle]], a Dutch marine contingent had been ready to land in Kent or Essex following a possible Dutch victory at sea. The Dutch fleet was, however, unable to force a safe passage into the Thames as navigational buoys had been removed and a strong English squadron was ready to dispute their passage.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=287}} But now there was no English fleet able to contest a similar attack. De Witt conceived the plan for a landing of marines, to be overseen by his brother Cornelius, at Chatham where the fleet lay effectively defenceless, to destroy it.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=301}}\n\n[[Image:The Dutch burn English ships during the expedition to Chatham (Raid on Medway, 1667)(Jan van Leyden, 1669).jpg|thumb|''The Dutch burn English ships during the expedition to Chatham'' by [[Jan van Leyden (painter)|Jan van Leyden]]]]\nIn June, De Ruyter, with [[Cornelis de Witt]] supervising, launched the Dutch [[raid on the Medway]] at the mouth of the [[River Thames]]. After capturing the fort at [[Sheerness]], the Dutch fleet went on to break through the massive chain protecting the entrance to the Medway and, on the 13th, attacked the laid up English fleet.\n\nThe daring raid remains the most humiliating naval disaster in the history of the [[Royal Navy]] and its predecessors.{{sfn|Boxer|1974|p=39}} Fifteen of the Royal Navy's remaining ships were destroyed, either by the Dutch or by being scuttled by the English to block the river. Three of the eight remaining \"big ships\" were burnt: ''Royal Oak'', the new ''Loyal London'' and ''Royal James''. The largest English flagship, {{HMS|Royal Charles|1655|6}}, was abandoned by its skeleton crew, captured without a shot being fired, and towed back to the United Provinces as a trophy. Its coat of arms is now on display in the [[Rijksmuseum]]. Fortunately for the English, the Dutch marines spared the [[Chatham Dockyard]], at the time England's largest industrial complex; a land attack on the docks themselves would have set back English naval power for a generation.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=77}} A Dutch attack on the English anchorage at [[Harwich]] had to be abandoned however after the [[battle of Landguard Fort]] ended in Dutch failure.\n\nThe Dutch success made a major psychological impact throughout England, with London feeling especially vulnerable just a year after the [[Great Fire of London]]. However, for a second time, the Dutch had been unable to land substantial land forces in Britain, or even do substantial damage to the Chatham dockyard.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=302}} The raid did, together with the English financial crisis, speed up negotiations.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=175}}{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=140}} All this, together with the cost of the war, of the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] and the extravagant spending of Charles's court, produced a rebellious atmosphere in London.

This confused naval action was the only one in this war were all three navies fought: it failed largely through de la Barre's incompetence.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|pp=42-3}} After this failed attack, Crijnssen left in disgust and sailed to the north to attack the Virginia colony,{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=183}} while the French, under de la Barre, moved to Martinique. The Battle of Nevis restored English naval control in the Caribbean and allowed the early recapture of Antigua and Montserrat and an unsuccessful attack on St Kitts soon after.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=43}}\n\nIn April, a new English squadron of nine warships and two fireships under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir [[John Harman (Admiral)|John Harman]] sailed for the West Indies, reaching them in early June. Harman encountered the French with seven larger and 14 smaller warships and three fireships under la Barre anchored under the batteries of Fort [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]], Martinique. He attacked on 6 July and sunk, burnt or captured all but two the French ships.{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=43}} With the French fleet neutralised, Harman then attacked the French at [[Cayenne]] on 15 September forcing its garrison to surrender. The English fleet then went on to recapture [[Fort Zeelandia (Guyana)|Fort Zeelandia]] in Suriname in October. News of these English victories only reached England in September, after the Treaty of Breda had been signed, and possessions captured after 31 July had to be returned.{{sfn|Fox|2018|p=303}} Crijnssen sailed back to the Caribbean only to find the French fleet destroyed and the English back in possession of Suriname.{{sfn|Rommelse|2006|p=223}}\n\n== Treaty of Breda ==\n{{Main|Treaty of Breda (1667)}}\n[[Image:Congress of Breda.jpg|thumb|The conclusion of the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]], at [[Breda Castle]]]]\nOn 31 July 1667, what is generally known as the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] concluded peace between England and the Netherlands. The treaty allowed the English to keep possession of [[New Netherland]], while the Dutch kept control over Pulau Run and the valuable sugar plantations of [[Suriname]] and regained Tobago, St Eustatius, and its West African trading posts.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=774}} This ''[[uti possidetis]]'' solution was later confirmed in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]].{{sfn|Goslinga|2012|p=47}} The [[Act of Navigation]] was modified in favour of the Dutch by England agreeing to treat Germany as part of the Netherlands' commercial hinterland, so that Dutch ships would now be allowed to carry German goods to English ports.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=774}}{{sfn|MacInnes|2008|p=114}}\n\nIn the same date and also at Breda, a public treaty was concluded between England and France that stipulated the return to England of the former English part of [[St Christopher]] and the islands of [[Antigua]] and [[Montserrat]], all of which the French had occupied in the war, and that England should surrender ''Acadia'' to France, although the extent of Acadia was not defined. This public treaty had been preceded by a secret treaty signed on 17 April in which, in addition to these exchanges of territory, Louis and Charles agreed not to enter into alliances opposed to the interests of the other, by which Louis secured the neutrality of England in the war he planned against Spain.{{sfn|Davenport|2004|pp=122, 132}}\n\nThe order of priorities whereby the Dutch preferred to give up what would become a major part of the United States, and instead retain a tropical colony, would seem strange by present-day standards. However, in the 17th century tropical colonies producing agricultural products which could not be grown in Europe were deemed more valuable than ones with a climate similar to that of Europe where Europeans could settle in comfort.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe peace was generally seen as a personal triumph for Johan de Witt and an embarrassment to the Orangists, who seemed reluctant to support the war and eager to accept a disadvantageous early peace.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=774-775}} The Republic was jubilant about the Dutch victory. De Witt used the occasion to induce four provinces to adopt the [[Perpetual Edict (1667)|Perpetual Edict of 1667]] abolishing the stadtholderate forever. He used the weak position of Charles II to force him into the [[Triple Alliance of 1668]] which again forced Louis to temporarily abandon his plans for the conquest of the southern Netherlands. But de Witt's success would eventually produce his downfall and nearly that of the Republic with it. Both humiliated monarchs intensified their secret cooperation and would, joined by the bishop of M\u00fcnster, attack the Dutch in 1672 in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]. De Witt was unable to counter this attack, as he could not create a strong Dutch army for lack of money and for fear that it would strengthen the position of the young [[William III of England|William III]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} That same year de Witt was assassinated, and William became stadtholder.\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n |last       = Armitage\n |first      = D.\n |date       = 2000\n |title      = The Ideological Origins of the British Empire\n |location   = Cambridge\n |publisher  = Cambridge University Press\n |isbn       = 9780521789783\n |ref        = harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last       = Ashley\n |first      = M.
