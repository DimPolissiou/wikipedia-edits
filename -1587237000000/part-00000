It is the [[List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income|#7 wealthiest]] municipality in Massachusetts and functions largely as a [[commuter town|bedroom community]] for professionals who work in the greater Boston area. The population was 21,374 at the 2010 United States Census.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nThe land on which Winchester now sits was purchased from Native Americans by representatives of the settlement of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] in 1639, and the area was first settled by Europeans in 1640. In the early years of the settlement, the area was known informally as Waterfield, a reference to its many ponds and to the river which bisected the central village. In its second century, the area was referred to as Black Horse Village, after the busy tavern and hostelry in its center.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, parts of [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] comprised what is now Winchester. The movement toward incorporation of what, by this time, was called South Woburn was likely precipitated by the rise of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in Massachusetts (''History of Winchester, Massachusetts'' by H. S. Chapman and Bruce W. Stone, 1936, 1975).\n\nThe Whigs sought to split a new jurisdiction away from heavily Democratic Woburn and found enough supporters in the burgeoning village to organize a movement toward incorporation. Representatives of the planned new town selected the name Winchester in recognition of Colonel [[William P. Winchester]] of nearby Watertown, who pledged $3,000 toward the construction of the first town hall. Upon the signature of then Governor Briggs, the town of Winchester was officially incorporated on April 30, 1850. Colonel Winchester did not live to visit the town that had honored his family name. He succumbed to typhoid fever within months of its incorporation.\n\nThe town's early growth paralleled improvements in transportation. Prior to incorporation, the [[Middlesex Canal]], linking the [[Merrimack River]] to Boston, was completed through then Waterfield. It flourished from 1803\u201336, until the [[Lowell Line|Boston and Lowell Railroad]] completed a line which neatly bisected the town and provided it with two stations. Able to deliver passengers as well as goods, the railroad soon bankrupted the canal and spurred more people to move to the area. The first church was built in 1840, the Post Office followed in 1841, and soon after incorporation town schools were started. Industries small and large followed, including the Beggs and Cobb tannery and the Winn Watch Hand factory which would operate well into the 20th century.\n\nBy the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], to which Winchester lent many citizens, the need for a municipal water supply became apparent. Engineers convinced a skeptical public to fund a dam in the highlands to the east of town. The structure blocked the creek which flowed from the [[Middlesex Fells Reservation|Middlesex Fells]] and produced the first of three reservoirs which continue to provide clear water today.\n\nIn the early 20th century, growth continued apace as Winchester evolved from its agri-industrial roots into the bedroom community it is today. A rich mix of immigrants\u2014the Irish in the northern and eastern neighborhoods, a smattering of African-Americans who flocked to the New Hope Baptist Church in the highlands, and finally Italians who came to work in the westside farms and live in the \"Plains\" to the east\u2014complemented Winchester's Yankee forebears.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 6.3&nbsp;square miles (16.3&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which 6.0&nbsp;square miles (15.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) is land and 0.2&nbsp;square miles (0.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) is water. The total area is 3.97% water.\n\nThe town is roughly bisected by a central valley which is the remnant of the original course of the [[Merrimack River]]. After glacial debris effectively rerouted the Merrimack north to its current location, all that remained of its original course through present day Winchester is the [[Aberjona River]] and the several ponds it feeds en route to the [[Mystic Lakes]] on Winchester's southern border.\n\nOn its eastern third, the valley rises steeply into the wooded hills of the [[Middlesex Fells Reservation]], in which lie the North, Middle, and South Reservoirs. The western edge of the valley yields to Arlington and Lexington heights, and the boundaries with those two towns. To the north, the town's longest border is shared with Woburn.\n\nWinchester has several major bodies of water, including the [[Mystic Lakes (Boston)|Mystic Lakes]], Wedge Pond, Winter Pond, and the [[Aberjona River]], as well as several minor bodies of water such as Sucker Brook and Sachem Swamp.\n\nWinchester borders the towns of [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]], [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], and [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA\n | 1850|1353\n | 1860|1937\n | 1870|2645\n | 1880|3802\n | 1890|4861\n | 1900|7248\n | 1910|9309\n | 1920|10485\n | 1930|12719\n | 1940|15081\n | 1950|15509\n | 1960|19376\n | 1970|22269\n | 1980|20701\n | 1990|20267\n | 2000|20810\n | 2010|21374\n | footnote=* = population estimate.  {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref> of 2010, there were 21,382 people, 7,647 households, and 5,785 families residing in the town.

It is the [[List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income|#7 wealthiest]] municipality in Massachusetts and functions largely as a [[commuter town|bedroom community]] for professionals who work in the greater Boston area. The population was 21,374 at the 2010 United States Census.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nThe land on which Winchester now sits was purchased from Native Americans by representatives of the settlement of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] in 1639, and the area was first settled by Europeans in 1640. In the early years of the settlement, the area was known informally as Waterfield, a reference to its many ponds and to the river which bisected the central village. In its second century, the area was referred to as Black Horse Village, after the busy tavern and hostelry in its center.\n\nUntil the middle of the 19th century, parts of [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] comprised what is now Winchester. The movement toward incorporation of what, by this time, was called South Woburn was likely precipitated by the rise of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in Massachusetts (''History of Winchester, Massachusetts'' by H. S. Chapman and Bruce W. Stone, 1936, 1975).\n\nThe Whigs sought to split a new jurisdiction away from heavily Democratic Woburn and found enough supporters in the burgeoning village to organize a movement toward incorporation. Representatives of the planned new town selected the name Winchester in recognition of Colonel [[William P. Winchester]] of nearby Watertown, who pledged $3,000 toward the construction of the first town hall. Upon the signature of then Governor Briggs, the town of Winchester was officially incorporated on April 30, 1850. Colonel Winchester did not live to visit the town that had honored his family name. He succumbed to typhoid fever within months of its incorporation.\n\nThe town's early growth paralleled improvements in transportation. Prior to incorporation, the [[Middlesex Canal]], linking the [[Merrimack River]] to Boston, was completed through then Waterfield. It flourished from 1803\u201336, until the [[Lowell Line|Boston and Lowell Railroad]] completed a line which neatly bisected the town and provided it with two stations. Able to deliver passengers as well as goods, the railroad soon bankrupted the canal and spurred more people to move to the area. The first church was built in 1840, the Post Office followed in 1841, and soon after incorporation town schools were started. Industries small and large followed, including the Beggs and Cobb tannery and the Winn Watch Hand factory which would operate well into the 20th century.\n\nBy the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], to which Winchester lent many citizens, the need for a municipal water supply became apparent. Engineers convinced a skeptical public to fund a dam in the highlands to the east of town. The structure blocked the creek which flowed from the [[Middlesex Fells Reservation|Middlesex Fells]] and produced the first of three reservoirs which continue to provide clear water today.\n\nIn the early 20th century, growth continued apace as Winchester evolved from its agri-industrial roots into the bedroom community it is today. A rich mix of immigrants\u2014the Irish in the northern and eastern neighborhoods, a smattering of African-Americans who flocked to the New Hope Baptist Church in the highlands, and finally Italians who came to work in the westside farms and live in the \"Plains\" to the east\u2014complemented Winchester's Yankee forebears.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 6.3&nbsp;square miles (16.3&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which 6.0&nbsp;square miles (15.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) is land and 0.2&nbsp;square miles (0.6&nbsp;km\u00b2) is water. The total area is 3.97% water.\n\nThe town is roughly bisected by a central valley which is the remnant of the original course of the [[Merrimack River]]. After glacial debris effectively rerouted the Merrimack north to its current location, all that remained of its original course through present day Winchester is the [[Aberjona River]] and the several ponds it feeds en route to the [[Mystic Lakes]] on Winchester's southern border.\n\nOn its eastern third, the valley rises steeply into the wooded hills of the [[Middlesex Fells Reservation]], in which lie the North, Middle, and South Reservoirs. The western edge of the valley yields to Arlington and Lexington heights, and the boundaries with those two towns. To the north, the town's longest border is shared with Woburn.\n\nWinchester has several major bodies of water, including the [[Mystic Lakes (Boston)|Mystic Lakes]], Wedge Pond, Winter Pond, and the [[Aberjona River]], as well as several minor bodies of water such as Sucker Brook and Sachem Swamp.\n\nWinchester borders the towns of [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]], [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]], [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], and [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA\n | 1850|1353\n | 1860|1937\n | 1870|2645\n | 1880|3802\n | 1890|4861\n | 1900|7248\n | 1910|9309\n | 1920|10485\n | 1930|12719\n | 1940|15081\n | 1950|15509\n | 1960|19376\n | 1970|22269\n | 1980|20701\n | 1990|20267\n | 2000|20810\n | 2010|21374\n | footnote=* = population estimate.  {{Historical populations/Massachusetts municipalities references}}\n}}\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|access-date=August 10, 2016}}</ref> of 2010, there were 21,382 people, 7,647 households, and 5,785 families residing in the town.

Baltimore running back [[Terry Allen (running back)|Terry Allen]] ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, while quarterback [[Elvis Grbac]] completed 12 of 18 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown. Throughout the day, the Dolphins were unable to move the ball on the ground.

The Dolphins responded with a drive to the Ravens 41. On first and 10, Fiedler's 40-yard pass to [[James McKnight (American football)|James McKnight]] at the Ravens 5-yard line bounced off the receiver's shoulder and was intercepted by defensive back [[Duane Starks]], who returned the ball 26 yards to the 28-yard line. Baltimore's offense subsequently drove 50 yards and took 6:30 off the clock, including five carries by [[Jason Brookins]] for 36 yards, setting up Stover's second field goal to put the game away.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Miami Dolphins}}\n{{Miami Dolphins seasons}}\n{{2001 NFL season by team}}\n\n[[Category:2001 National Football League season by team|Miami]]\n[[Category:Miami Dolphins seasons]]\n[[Category:2001 in sports in Florida|Miami Dolphins]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|36th season in franchise history}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Infobox NFL season\n| team = Miami Dolphins\n| year = 2001\n| record = 11\u20135\n| division_place = 2nd [[AFC East]]\n| coach = [[Dave Wannstedt]]\n|owner = [[Wayne Huizenga]]\n| stadium = [[Pro Player Stadium]]\n| playoffs = Lost [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|Wild Card Playoffs]] ([[2001 Baltimore Ravens season|Ravens]]) 3\u201320\n| pro bowlers = 4\n<!-- Commented out: | uniform         = Image:AFCE-Uniform-MIA.PNG -->\n| shortnavlink   = Dolphins seasons\n}}\nThe '''2001 Miami Dolphins season''' was the franchise's 32nd season in the [[National Football League]] and the 36th season in the AFC division under the guidance of Dave Wannstedt, who was entering his 2nd year as Dolphins head coach.

Baltimore running back [[Terry Allen (running back)|Terry Allen]] ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, while quarterback [[Elvis Grbac]] completed 12 of 18 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown. Throughout the day, the Dolphins were unable to move the ball on the ground. Running backs [[Travis Minor]] and [[Lamar Smith (American football)|Lamar Smith]] were held to a combined total of 20 yards on 11 carries, while quarterback [[Jay Fiedler]] ended up as the leading rusher with 16 yards.

In the second quarter, the Ravens finished a 17-play, 90-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run from Allen to take a 7\u20133 lead.

Taylor finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown catch to give the Ravens a 14\u20133 lead with 1:20 left in the third quarter.\n\nEarly in the final quarter, Boulware forced a fumble while sacking Fiedler that Ravens lineman [[Sam Adams (American football)|Sam Adams]] recovered on the Dolphins 37-yard line, leading to Stover's 35-yard field goal with 11:26 left in the game. The Dolphins responded with a drive to the Ravens 41. On first and 10, Fiedler's 40-yard pass to [[James McKnight (American football)|James McKnight]] at the Ravens 5-yard line bounced off the receiver's shoulder and was intercepted by defensive back [[Duane Starks]], who returned the ball 26 yards to the 28-yard line. Baltimore's offense subsequently drove 50 yards and took 6:30 off the clock, including five carries by [[Jason Brookins]] for 36 yards, setting up Stover's second field goal to put the game away.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Miami Dolphins}}\n{{Miami Dolphins seasons}}\n{{2001 NFL season by team}}\n\n[[Category:2001 National Football League season by team|Miami]]\n[[Category:Miami Dolphins seasons]]\n[[Category:2001 in sports in Florida|Miami Dolphins]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:James McKnight", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Miami_Dolphins_season"}

The designation \"57 mm automatkanon m/45\" is translated to \"57 mm autocannon model 1947\". It is referred to as the '''Bofors 57&nbsp;mm type L50''' by the manufacturer.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nIt was an effective and modern weapon for its time, and was capable of firing through a full magazine smoothly due to its reliable design and the use of a powerful muzzle brake. The recoil could be felt by the pilot, but this didn't interfere with the pilot's aim, and the weapon was accurate up to {{Convert|2000|m|yd|abbr=on}}.\n\n== History ==\nTowards the end of the 1930s and into the early 1940s, the [[Swedish Air Force]] was looking for a new torpedo bomber, since they had not been able to acquire enough units of the previous model, the [[Heinkel He 115|T 2]]. The Swedish Air Force then asked the Swedish airplane manufacturer [[Saab AB]] (formerly SAAB) to design a Torpedo bomber based on their existing design, the Saab 18. SAAB accepted the request and commenced work on the design titled \"T 18B\" immediately after they received the requirements for the project.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Flyghistorisk revy number 31, Saab 18|last=|first=|publisher=The Swedish air historical society|year=1984|isbn=|location=Sweden|pages=10}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Swedish Air Force kept changing their specifications, and in February 1944 they informed SAAB that it might be necessary to equip the T 18B with a 57&nbsp;mm autocannon as an alternative to its torpedo. Conveniently, Bofors had already been commissioned to develop such a gun for the Swedish Air Force, which resulted in the development of a 57&nbsp;mm [[Fully-automatic|fully automatic]] [[recoilless rifle]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe weapon was ready for testing in June 1944 and was tested by mounting it in a [[Saab 18]] that had crashed. The tests showed that the [[Backblast area|blackblast]] caused by the weapon lead to so much damage to the plane that it made the weapon impossible to use safely.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAfter their failure, Bofors offered to develop a new cannon that used conventional ammunition instead; this new weapon would be ready for testing in the autumn of 1947. Test firings on the ground had produced positive results, and the weapon was approved for service with the type designation m/45.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe T 18B had already been adopted by Swedish Air Force, not as a torpedo bomber, but instead as a conventional bomb and attack aircraft. During the prototype phase of the T 18B, it was shown that the T 18B was too fast to work as a torpedo bomber; so the 57&nbsp;mm was the perfect replacement for the torpedo.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn January 1948, the Swedish Air Force section [[Blekinge Air Force Wing|F 17]] conducted extensive tests with the new gun in [[Kiruna]]. The new gun was then installed in the T 18B. In the air the 57&nbsp;mm m/45 performed well as it had very little spread, with the heavy muzzle brake absorbing all the recoil. This made it possible to fire a full magazine in one go. Thanks to this, the stability of the plane was barely affected, which made the plane very easy to keep the line of sight. In addition to good combat performance, the weapon was very easy to install, as it could be installed on the plane in less than 3 hours.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn service, the weapon proved problematic to train with, as its high rate of fire and high damage destroyed practice targets too quickly. This meant that during larger exercises the last aircraft in line to shoot didn't have anything to shoot at. Even when the fleet used obsolete armored boats as practice targets, they didn't last long against the new m/45.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Ammunition ==\n\n*57&nbsp;mm sk ptr m/47 pprj m/47 ([[Armor-piercing shell]]) Color: Black<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Flygvapnets Eldvapenammunition Serie 2.|last=|first=|publisher=The Swedish air force|year=1949|isbn=|location=Sweden|pages=27}}</ref>\n*57&nbsp;mm sk ptr m/47 sgr m/47 ([[High-explosive shell]]) Color: Grey with yellow stripe<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n*57&nbsp;mm sk ptr m/47 \u00f6vnprj m/47 (Training-shell) Color: Brown<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBeyond the above-mentioned munitions the gun also acquired newer ammunition with time such as [[Mine shell]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Flyghistorisk revy nummer 31, SAAB 18.|last=|first=|publisher=The Swedish air historical society|year=1984|isbn=|location=Sweden|pages=76}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Saab T 18B kanon.png|T 18B with 57&nbsp;mm akan m/45.\nFile:57 mm akan m47 ritning.png|Blueprint of the Bofors 57&nbsp;mm m/45 aircraft gun.\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n*Torpedflyget i Sverige by Mikael Forslund (The torpedo bombers of Sweden)\n*Flygvapnets Eldvapenammunition 1949.

However, another matchup between DePauw and Purdue had also been scheduled in the city for the same day and time, which angered all 4 parties, considering the attendance and profit for both games would essentially be split in half.

The ILA's game against Butler would be played at 2:30 in the afternoon at the baseball park, with reserved room coming at 50 cents a seat. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322167802/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=27 Nov 1894, 5 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>.  The Indianapolis Light Artillery would lose a close contest to the Bulldogs, 4\u20136, in their final game of the season.  In early 1896, after more heating argument in the IIAA's president's meeting over whether or not to allow Athletic Clubs on the schedule any longer, Purdue backed out of the league, which led to its subsequent dissolution before the 1896 season.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 19\n| time = 2pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = Chicago AC<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n| site_stadium = Indianapolis Baseball Park<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322141533/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=19 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n| site_cityst = [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, IN]]\n| score = 0-16\n| attend = >400\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 24\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Indiana Hoosiers football team|Indiana]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n| site_stadium = Jordan Field\n| site_cityst = [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington, IN]]\n| score = 16-8\n| attend = ~500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 2\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Noblesville AC<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = Indianapolis, IN\n| score = 22-4\n| attend =\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 17\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Louisville AC<ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, KY]]\n| score = 20-12\n| attend = ~800\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 22\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Notre Dame football team|Notre Dame]]<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n| site_stadium = Cartier Field\n| site_cityst = [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend, IN]]\n| score = 18-0\n| attend =\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 23\n| time =\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = Chicago AC<ref name=\"auto5\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago, IL]]\n| score = 0-4\n| attend = ~500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 28\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[Butler Bulldogs football|Butler]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322132717/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=1 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/322144488/?</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322160527/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=27 Nov 1895, 6 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = East Ohio-Street grounds\n| site_cityst = Indianapolis, IN\n| score = 28-0\n| attend = 2000-3000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Post season==\n\nWilliam (Winchester) Osgood would not coach the Light Artillery again, as he would join the [[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895-98, also a part of the greater [[Spanish American War]]), and reportedly died in March 1896<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322002792/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=18 Mar 1896, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>.

Chicago AC was considered, according to the Indianapolis Journal, one of the best teams of the west (more specifically Midwest) besides Michigan University.  The contest was 50 minutes long, with two 25 minute halves.  Chicago AC (Also known as Chicago Athletic Association, or C.A.A) scored all of there 16 points against the Light Artillerymen in the first half.  Not more than 400 people were said to have braved the icy cold wind to spectate the contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n===October 24- Indiana===\n\nOn October 23rd the Indianapolis Light Artillery football team set out for Bloomington for there first collegiate contest of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322143756/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=23 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  Coming into the game, Indiana was 2\u20130, having won easy contests against the Louisville and Noblesville Athletic clubs, by scores of 36-0 and 30-0 respectively (two teams the Light Artillery would beat later in the season).  The weather was cool and cloudy.  The game was an hour long, with 60 minute halves.  The halftime score was 10\u20134, and the final was 16\u20138.  One of the touchdowns scored for Indiana was by player-coach William Osgood<ref name=\"auto\"/>, who would go on to assist the Light Artillery in the remainder of their football season<ref name=\"auto7\"/>, presumably when Robert Wrenn was hired as the new head coach for Indiana.  Indiana would finish with a casual 4-3-1, although they did manage to secure their first intercollegiate win since the program was established in 1887 by beating Rose Polytechnic 8\u20134.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/active/i/indiana/1895-1899_yearly_results.php|title=Indiana Yearly Results|website=www.cfbdatawarehouse.com}}</ref>\n\n===November 1st- Knightstown Club===\n\nThis unofficial matchup was played between a handful of players from Butler and Indianapolis Light Artillery against the Knightstown Club on the first day of November.  Heralded as the most exciting and interesting game of football seen in  Indianapolis for the 1895 season, 1500 spectators showed up for the exhibition.  Knightstown scored first, going up 6\u20130, before they were tied 6-6 right before the half.  The club would ultimately prevail though, beating the mix of college and semi-professional football players 12\u20136.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 2nd- Noblesville AC===\n\nThe game was played in Indianapolis, in the same ball park as the one against Chicago AC.  Noblesville came in with at least one loss to Indiana, and that is all that is known about the rather obscure program.  Surrounded by an apparently riotous crowd, the Indianapolis Light Artillery eleven met the Athletic Club's eleven on the afternoon of November 2nd.  by halftime, the score was a tight 6\u20134 in favor of the Artillerymen, but the military team blew away the athletic club in the 2nd half, securing their 3rd official victory, 22\u20134.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 17th- Louisville AC===\n\nA good matchup between the ILA and the Louisville AC was played in Louisville in front of a sizeable crowd of 800 on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The contest was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.  The Artillery men scored early points in the first half to go up 10\u20130, before Louisville rallied with two field goals to usurp the military team, 12\u201310 at the half in favor of the AC.  This was the first time since Chicago AC that the Light Artillery had faced a halftime deficit.  The military team came out of the 2nd half with 10 unanswered points by left halfback Thompson and kicker Scott to win 20\u201312.  <ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n===November 22nd- Notre Dame===\n\nIn a minor upset, The Indianapolis Light Artillery beat Notre Dame college 18\u20130, on their own Cartier Field in South Bend.  This game is famous because of HG Haddon, coach of the 1895 Notre Dame football team, who inserted himself into the line-up as a left tackle, gaining considerable ground on the semi-professionals before the end of the game through a returned kickoff, recovering a fumble, and a number of other carries.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyg3NJ4VVuAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = Fighting Irish: Legends, Lists, and Lore|isbn = 9781582617527|last1 = Heisler|first1 = Karen Croake|year = 2006}}</ref>  Immediately after the game, the ILA left for Chicago for a rematch with the Chicago Athletic Association's football team.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===November 23rd- Chicago AC===\n\nIn the 2nd contest between the two teams, Chicago AC won by a narrow margin of 4 to 0.  The day was cold and icy, with only 500 spectators coming to watch the event in Chicago.  The game was 40 minutes long, with two 20 minute halves.  After a scoreless half, Chicago scored a controversial touchdown that awarded them the 4 points they needed to win.  The Light Artillery blamed the Linesman for bad officiating and bias towards the Chicago team, as one of the Linesman was a brother of a Chicago AC player.  <ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Thanksgiving Day Game- Butler===\n\nThe Indianapolis Light Artillery destroyed Butler to close out the 1895 season at the East Ohio-Street grounds in Indianapolis.  The game was over from the start, with the Butler players apparently unable to move the ball without penalties, and a 22-0 ILA lead by the half.  The game was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n== References ==\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/1894-schedule.html |title = 1894 Schedule and Results}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [[1895 Notre Dame football team]]\n* [[1895 Indiana Hoosiers football team]]\n[[:Category:1895 college football season]]\n[[:Category: Indianapolis Light Artillery football seasons]]\n[[:Category:1895 in sports in Indiana|1895 in sports in Indiana]]\n\n== I cited all of my sources. ==\n\n{{AFC submission|||ts=20200408131130|u=Murphanian777|ns=118}}\n", "text_old": "{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{AFC submission|d|v|u=Murphanian777|ns=118|decliner=Sulfurboy|declinets=20200406201027|ts=20200406200457}} <!-- Do not remove this line! -->\n{{short description|American military football team}}\n{{Infobox NCAA team season\n| year = 1895\n| team = Indianapolis Light Artillery\n| sport = football\n| image = \n| image_size = \n| conference = Independent\n| record = 5-2\n| head_coach = [[Winchester Osgood]]\n| gm = [[Robert Navin]]\n| hc_year = 1st\n| stadium = East Ohio Street Baseball Park\n| captain = Harold Joss (Right Tackle)\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe '''1895 Indianapolis Light Artillery football team''' was an [[American football]] team that represented the [[Indianapolis Light Artillery]] in the [[1895 college football season]].<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/search/|title=Newspapers.com search|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  The team compiled a 5\u20132 record and outscored its opponents, 108 to 46.

Chicago AC was considered, according to the Indianapolis Journal, one of the best teams of the west (more specifically Midwest) besides Michigan University.  The contest was 50 minutes long, with two 25 minute halves.  Chicago AC (Also known as Chicago Athletic Association, or C.A.A) scored all of there 16 points against the Light Artillerymen in the first half.  Not more than 400 people were said to have braved the icy cold wind to spectate the contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\n===October 24- Indiana===\n\nOn October 23rd the Indianapolis Light Artillery football team set out for Bloomington for there first collegiate contest of the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322143756/?terms=Indianapolis+Light+Artillery+football|title=23 Oct 1895, 8 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com}}</ref>  Coming into the game, Indiana was 2\u20130, having won easy contests against the Louisville and Noblesville Athletic clubs, by scores of 36-0 and 30-0 respectively (two teams the Light Artillery would beat later in the season).  The weather was cool and cloudy.  The game was an hour long, with 60 minute halves.  The halftime score was 10\u20134, and the final was 16\u20138.  One of the touchdowns scored for Indiana was by player-coach William Osgood<ref name=\"auto\"/>, who would go on to assist the Light Artillery in the remainder of their football season<ref name=\"auto7\"/>, presumably when Robert Wrenn was hired as the new head coach for Indiana.

Heralded as the most exciting and interesting game of football seen in  Indianapolis for the 1895 season, 1500 spectators showed up for the exhibition.  Knightstown scored first, going up 6\u20130, before they were tied 6-6 right before the half.  The club would ultimately prevail though, beating the mix of college and semi-professional football players 12\u20136.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 2nd- Noblesville AC===\n\nThe game was played in Indianapolis, in the same ball park as the one against Chicago AC.  Noblesville came in with at least one loss to Indiana, and that is all that is known about the rather obscure program.  Surrounded by an apparently riotous crowd, the Indianapolis Light Artillery eleven met the Athletic Club's eleven on the afternoon of November 2nd.  by halftime, the score was a tight 6\u20134 in favor of the Artillerymen, but the military team blew away the athletic club in the 2nd half, securing their 3rd official victory, 22\u20134.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n===November 17th- Louisville AC===\n\nA good matchup between the ILA and the Louisville AC was played in Louisville in front of a sizeable crowd of 800 on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The contest was 70 minutes long, with two 35 minute halves.  The Artillery men scored early points in the first half to go up 10\u20130, before Louisville rallied with two field goals to usurp the military team, 12\u201310 at the half in favor of the AC.  This was the first time since Chicago AC that the Light Artillery had faced a halftime deficit.  The military team came out of the 2nd half with 10 unanswered points by left halfback Thompson and kicker Scott to win 20\u201312.  <ref name=\"auto7\"/>\n\n===November 22nd- Notre Dame===\n\nIn a minor upset, The Indianapolis Light Artillery beat Notre Dame college 18\u20130, on their own Cartier Field in South Bend.  This game is famous because of HG Haddon, coach of the 1895 Notre Dame football team, who inserted himself into the line-up as a left tackle, gaining considerable ground on the semi-professionals before the end of the game through a returned kickoff, recovering a fumble, and a number of other carries.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nyg3NJ4VVuAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |title = Fighting Irish: Legends, Lists, and Lore|isbn = 9781582617527|last1 = Heisler|first1 = Karen Croake|year = 2006}}</ref>  Immediately after the game, the ILA left for Chicago for a rematch with the Chicago Athletic Association's football team.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===November 23rd- Chicago AC===\n\nIn the 2nd contest between the two teams, Chicago AC won by a narrow margin of 4 to 0.  The day was cold and icy, with only 500 spectators coming to watch the event in Chicago.  The game was 40 minutes long, with two 20 minute halves.  After a scoreless half, Chicago scored a controversial touchdown that awarded them the 4 points they needed to win.  The Light Artillery blamed the Linesman for bad officiating and bias towards the Chicago team, as one of the Linesman was a brother of a Chicago AC player.  <ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Thanksgiving Day Game- Butler===\n\nThe Indianapolis Light Artillery destroyed Butler to close out the 1895 season at the East Ohio-Street grounds in Indianapolis.  The game was over from the start, with the Butler players apparently unable to move the ball without penalties, and a 22-0 ILA lead by the half.

The British in particular had a deep trade deficit with China, and the sale of British-owned Indian opium helped balance it.\n\nMany modern writers, particularly in the 19th century, have written on the opium poppy and its effects, notably [[Thomas de Quincey]] in ''[[Confessions of an English Opium Eater]]''.\n\nThe French Romantic composer [[Hector Berlioz]] used opium for inspiration, subsequently producing his [[Symphonie Fantastique]]. In this work, a young artist overdoses on opium and experiences a series of visions of his unrequited love.\n\nThe [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] raided [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] estate in 1987.

Tyrosine can follow two different routes: by tyrosine hydroxylase it can form L-[[dopamine]] (L-DOPA), or it can be reduced to form 4-phenylhydroxyacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Subsequently, L-DOPA reacts with 4-HPAA and, through a series of reactions, forms (S) -norcoclaurine, which carries the benzylisoquinoline skeleton that gives its name to this pathway. The conversion of (S) -norcoclaurin to (S) -reticulin is one of the key points, since from (S) -reticulin morphine can be formed through the morphinan route, noscapine through the path of the noscapina or berberina.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Ye|first=Kai|last2=Graham|first2=Ian A.|last3=Bowser|first3=Tim A.|last4=Lu|first4=Ying|last5=Teodor|first5=Roxana|last6=He|first6=Zhesi|last7=Ning|first7=Zemin|last8=Li|first8=Yi|last9=Yang|first9=Xiaofei|date=2018-10-19|title=The opium poppy genome and morphinan production|journal=Science|volume=362|issue=6412|pages=343\u2013347|doi=10.1126/science.aat4096|issn=0036-8075|pmid=30166436}}</ref>\n\n=== Genome analysis ===\nThe poppy genome contains 51,213 genes encoding proteins distributed 81.6% in 11 individual chromosomes and 18.4% remaining in unplaced scaffolds.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition, 70.9% of the genome is made up of repetitive elements, of which the most represented are the long terminal repeat [[retrotransposons]].

Poppies are sought after by gardeners for the vivid coloration of the blooms, the hardiness and reliability of the poppy plants, the exotic chocolate-vegetal fragrance note of some cultivars,{{which|date=June 2018}} and the ease of growing the plants from purchased flats of seedlings or by direct sowing of the seed. Poppy seed pods are also sold for dried flower arrangements.\n\nSince \"opium poppy and poppy straw\" are listed in Schedule II of the United States' [[Controlled Substances Act]], a DEA license may be required to grow poppies in ornamental or display gardens. In fact, the legal status of strictly ornamental poppy gardens is more nuanced. During the summer, opium poppies can be seen flowering in gardens throughout North America and Europe, and displays are found in many private plantings, as well as in public botanical and museum gardens such as [[United States Botanical Garden]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], and [[North Carolina Botanical Garden]].\n\nMany countries grow the plants, and some rely heavily on the commercial production of the drug as a major source of income. As an additional source of profit, the seeds of the same plants are sold for use in foods, so the cultivation of the plant is a significant source of income. This international trade in seeds of ''P. somniferum'' was addressed by a UN resolution \"to fight the international trade in illicit opium poppy seeds\" on 28 July 1998.\n\nAs many non-opium cultivars are available, there has been a shift to selling ornamental varieties of those types. Unlike opium-heavy varieties, these cannot be easily processed into usable narcotics by anyone lacking the requisite lab. The Sujata type produces no latex at all so it cannot be used for any kind of drug production.\n\n==Market==\n\n===Food===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; clear:left; width:18em;\"\n! colspan=2|Poppy seed production \u2013 2016\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:75%;\"| Country\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:25%;\"| <small>([[tonne]]s)</small>\n|-\n| <center>{{CZE}}</center> || <center>28,574</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{TUR}}</center> || <center>18,205</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{ESP}}</center> || <center>13,377</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{HUN}}</center> || <center>8,948</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{FRA}}</center> || <center>5,777</center>\n|-\n| <center>'''World'''</center> || <center>'''92,610'''</center>\n|-\n|colspan=2|<small>Source: [[FAOSTAT]] of the [[United Nations]]<ref name=\"faostat16\">{{cite web|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QC/E |title= Poppy seed production in 2016, Crops/Regions/World list/Production Quantity (pick lists)|date=2017|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT)|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn 2016, world production of poppy seeds for consumption was 92,610 [[tonne]]s, led by the [[Czech Republic]] with 31% of the world total (table).

The British in particular had a deep trade deficit with China, and the sale of British-owned Indian opium helped balance it.\n\nMany modern writers, particularly in the 19th century, have written on the opium poppy and its effects, notably [[Thomas de Quincey]] in ''[[Confessions of an English Opium Eater]]''.\n\nThe French Romantic composer [[Hector Berlioz]] used opium for inspiration, subsequently producing his [[Symphonie Fantastique]]. In this work, a young artist overdoses on opium and experiences a series of visions of his unrequited love.\n\nThe [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] raided [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] estate in 1987.

Tyrosine can follow two different routes: by tyrosine hydroxylase it can form L-[[dopamine]] (L-DOPA), or it can be reduced to form 4-phenylhydroxyacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Subsequently, L-DOPA reacts with 4-HPAA and, through a series of reactions, forms (S) -norcoclaurine, which carries the benzylisoquinoline skeleton that gives its name to this pathway. The conversion of (S) -norcoclaurin to (S) -reticulin is one of the key points, since from (S) -reticulin morphine can be formed through the morphinan route, noscapine through the path of the noscapina or berberina.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Ye|first=Kai|last2=Graham|first2=Ian A.|last3=Bowser|first3=Tim A.|last4=Lu|first4=Ying|last5=Teodor|first5=Roxana|last6=He|first6=Zhesi|last7=Ning|first7=Zemin|last8=Li|first8=Yi|last9=Yang|first9=Xiaofei|date=2018-10-19|title=The opium poppy genome and morphinan production|journal=Science|volume=362|issue=6412|pages=343\u2013347|doi=10.1126/science.aat4096|issn=0036-8075|pmid=30166436}}</ref>\n\n=== Genome analysis ===\nThe poppy genome contains 51,213 genes encoding proteins distributed 81.6% in 11 individual chromosomes and 18.4% remaining in unplaced scaffolds.<ref name=\":3\" /> In addition, 70.9% of the genome is made up of repetitive elements, of which the most represented are the long terminal repeat [[retrotransposons]].

Tincture of opium or [[laudanum]], consisting of opium dissolved in alcohol or a mixture of alcohol and water, is one of many unapproved drugs regulated by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

Poppies are sought after by gardeners for the vivid coloration of the blooms, the hardiness and reliability of the poppy plants, the exotic chocolate-vegetal fragrance note of some cultivars,{{which|date=June 2018}} and the ease of growing the plants from purchased flats of seedlings or by direct sowing of the seed. Poppy seed pods are also sold for dried flower arrangements.\n\nSince \"opium poppy and poppy straw\" are listed in Schedule II of the United States' [[Controlled Substances Act]], a DEA license may be required to grow poppies in ornamental or display gardens. In fact, the legal status of strictly ornamental poppy gardens is more nuanced. During the summer, opium poppies can be seen flowering in gardens throughout North America and Europe, and displays are found in many private plantings, as well as in public botanical and museum gardens such as [[United States Botanical Garden]], [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], and [[North Carolina Botanical Garden]].\n\nMany countries grow the plants, and some rely heavily on the commercial production of the drug as a major source of income. As an additional source of profit, the seeds of the same plants are sold for use in foods, so the cultivation of the plant is a significant source of income. This international trade in seeds of ''P. somniferum'' was addressed by a UN resolution \"to fight the international trade in illicit opium poppy seeds\" on 28 July 1998.\n\nAs many non-opium cultivars are available, there has been a shift to selling ornamental varieties of those types. Unlike opium-heavy varieties, these cannot be easily processed into usable narcotics by anyone lacking the requisite lab. The Sujata type produces no latex at all so it cannot be used for any kind of drug production.\n\n==Market==\n\n===Food===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; clear:left; width:18em;\"\n! colspan=2|Poppy seed production \u2013 2016\n|-\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:75%;\"| Country\n!  style=\"background:#ddf; width:25%;\"| <small>([[tonne]]s)</small>\n|-\n| <center>{{CZE}}</center> || <center>28,574</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{TUR}}</center> || <center>18,205</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{ESP}}</center> || <center>13,377</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{HUN}}</center> || <center>8,948</center>\n|-\n| <center>{{FRA}}</center> || <center>5,777</center>\n|-\n| <center>'''World'''</center> || <center>'''92,610'''</center>\n|-\n|colspan=2|<small>Source: [[FAOSTAT]] of the [[United Nations]]<ref name=\"faostat16\">{{cite web|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QC/E |title= Poppy seed production in 2016, Crops/Regions/World list/Production Quantity (pick lists)|date=2017|publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT)|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn 2016, world production of poppy seeds for consumption was 92,610 [[tonne]]s, led by the [[Czech Republic]] with 31% of the world total (table).

{"title_page": "Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation", "text_new": "[[File:Bell AH-1 Cobra flying head on.jpg|thumb|right|Masking their approach using trees, TOW-firing Cobras proved to be devastatingly effective anti-tank weapons.]] \n\nThe '''Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation''' was a series of [[military exercise]]s that tested the use of [[attack helicopter]]s against simulated [[Warsaw Pact]] formations. They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these comments home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref> This turned produced a complex design and development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US equipment that had been captured earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum. On 25 May, the battle opened in earnest. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets. The two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given the increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]]s [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these comments home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref> This turned produced a complex design and development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US equipment that had been captured earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum. On 25 May, the battle opened in earnest. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets. The two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given the increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach conclusively demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Although superior to any NATO [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] of the era, Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for the helicopters flying pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]].

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy.

These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\nJack the Ripper (1988 TV series) contains numerous historical inaccuracies:\n\nPrince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as The Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume this title until May 1890, two years after the murders.\n\nJane Seymour's character, Emma Prentiss, claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication did exist until 1891.\n\nA photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene. In reality, photographing a murder scene was not common practice at the time and the body was not photographed until being transferred to the mortuary.\n\nAccording to their uniforms, the constables in the film were assigned to 'J' division, whereas Whitechapel was actually 'H' division.\n\nThe film claims that the murderer has cut off the years of Catharine Eddowes. In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary.\n\nBloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation.\n\nWhen the body of Mary Jane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corspe through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face-on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right.\n\nSusan George, playing common prostitute Catharine Eddowes is far too well-dressed for a woman of Eddowes' class, clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress.\n\nThe film depicts Frederick Abberline as being transferred to Whitechapel as a form of demotion. In fact, Abberline was re-assigned to field work from Scotland Yard due to his intimate knowledge of the area, having previously worked there for fourteen years from 1873-1887.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n''Jack the Ripper'' was nominated for the following awards:\n\n*[[Emmy Award|Emmy]] -1989- Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n*[[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Michael Caine]] Won (Award Tied)\n*Golden Globe -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Murder by Decree]]''\n*''[[From Hell (film)]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095388|title=Jack the Ripper}}\n*{{amg title|25712|Jack the Ripper}}\n*[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm Review on Eofftv.com]\n\n{{Jack the Ripper media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jack the Ripper (1988 Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1988 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British television miniseries]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1888]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] - Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], an aging [[alcoholic]] whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking\n* [[Lewis Collins]] - Sergeant [[George Godley]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] - [[Richard Mansfield]], American Stage actor in the theatrical play ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]''\n* [[Ray McAnally]] - [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Physician-in-Ordinary to [[Queen Victoria]] \n* [[Ken Bones]] - [[Robert James Lees]], Queen Victoria's psychic medium\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] - [[Catherine Eddowes]], fourth victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] - Emma Prentiss \n* [[Harry Andrews]] - [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]] \n* [[Lysette Anthony]] - [[Mary Jane Kelly]], fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Gerald Sim]] - Dr. [[George Bagster Phillips]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] - [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]] [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] - Chief Superintendent of Police [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]]\n* [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]] - [[Coach (carriage)|Coach]] driver [[John Netley]]\n* [[Michael Gothard]] - [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], and a violent [[Marxism|Marxist]] and power-hungry politician\n* [[T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\nJack the Ripper (1988 TV series) contains numerous historical inaccuracies:\n\nPrince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as The Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume this title until May 1890, two years after the murders.\n\nJane Seymour's character, Emma Prentiss, claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication did exist until 1891.\n\nA photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene. In reality, photographing a murder scene was not common practice at the time and the body was not photographed until being transferred to the mortuary.\n\nAccording to their uniforms, the constables in the film were assigned to 'J' division, whereas Whitechapel was actually 'H' division.\n\nThe film claims that the murderer has cut off the years of Catharine Eddowes. In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary.\n\nBloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation.\n\nWhen the body of Mary Jane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corspe through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face-on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right.\n\nSusan George, playing common prostitute Catharine Eddowes is far too well-dressed for a woman of Eddowes' class, clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress.\n\nFrederick Abberline is portrayed as both single and an alcoholic, who is transferred to Whitechapel as a form of demotion. In fact, Abberline was happily married at the time of murders and there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that he was an alcoholic. Furthermore, Abberline was re-assigned to field work from Scotland Yard due to his intimate knowledge of the area, having worked there for fourteen years.\n\nFar from being a violet anarchist and socialist as depicted in the film, George Lusk was in fact a respected and mild-mannered local builder and recent widower with seven children.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n''Jack the Ripper'' was nominated for the following awards:\n\n*[[Emmy Award|Emmy]] -1989- Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n*[[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Michael Caine]] Won (Award Tied)\n*Golden Globe -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Murder by Decree]]''\n*''[[From Hell (film)]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095388|title=Jack the Ripper}}\n*{{amg title|25712|Jack the Ripper}}\n*[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm Review on Eofftv.com]\n\n{{Jack the Ripper media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jack the Ripper (1988 Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1988 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British television miniseries]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1888]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

Construction of railroad lines to the city sparked its growth in the decades following the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===American Civil War and late 19th century (1861\u20131900)===\n[[File:Jackson-StarsAndStripesHarpers.jpg|thumb|1000px|centre|\"Raising the Stars and Stripes Over the Capitol of the State of Mississippi\", engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 20 June 1863, after the capture of Jackson by Union forces during the American Civil War]]\n[[File:Jacksonsiege1863.jpg|right|thumb|September 1863 map of the Siege of Jackson]]\nDespite its small population, during the Civil War, Jackson became a strategic center of manufacturing for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. In 1863, during the military campaign which ended in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|capture of Vicksburg]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces captured Jackson during two battles\u2014once before the fall of Vicksburg and once after the fall of Vicksburg.\n\nOn May 13, 1863, Union forces won the first [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Battle of Jackson]], forcing [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces to flee northward towards [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]]. On May 15, Union troops under the command of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] burned and looted key facilities in Jackson, a strategic manufacturing and railroad center for the Confederacy. After driving the Confederate forces out of Jackson, Union forces turned west and engaged the Vicksburg defenders at the [[Battle of Champion Hill]] in nearby [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards]]. The Union forces began their siege of Vicksburg soon after their victory at Champion Hill. Confederate forces began to reassemble in Jackson in preparation for an attempt to break through the Union lines surrounding Vicksburg and end the siege. The Confederate forces in Jackson built defensive [[fortification]]s encircling the city while preparing to march west to Vicksburg.\n\nConfederate forces marched out of Jackson in early July 1863 to break the siege of Vicksburg. But, unknown to them, Vicksburg had already surrendered on July 4, 1863. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] dispatched General Sherman to meet the Confederate forces heading west from Jackson. Upon learning that Vicksburg had already surrendered, the Confederates retreated into Jackson. Union forces began the [[Siege of Jackson]], which lasted for approximately one week. Union forces encircled the city and began an [[artillery]] bombardment. One of the Union artillery emplacements has been preserved on the grounds of the [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]] in Jackson. Another Federal position is preserved on the campus of [[Millsaps College]]. [[John C. Breckinridge]], former United States [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], served as one of the Confederate generals defending Jackson. On July 16, 1863, Confederate forces slipped out of Jackson during the night and retreated across the Pearl River.\n\nUnion forces completely burned the city after its capture this second time. The city was called \"Chimneyville\" because only the chimneys of houses were left standing. The northern line of Confederate defenses in Jackson during the siege was located along a road near downtown Jackson, now known as Fortification Street.\n\n[[File:Jackson December 2018 37 (Old Mississippi State Capitol).jpg|thumb|[[Old Mississippi State Capitol|Mississippi Old Capitol]], downtown Jackson|alt=]]\n\nBecause of the siege and following destruction, few [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] structures have survived in Jackson. The [[Mississippi Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]], built in 1842, served as Sherman's headquarters and has been preserved. Another is the [[Old Mississippi State Capitol|Old Capitol]] building, which served as the home of the Mississippi state legislature from 1839 to 1903. The Mississippi legislature passed the ordinance of [[secession]] from the Union on January 9, 1861 there, becoming the second state to secede from the United States. The [[Jackson City Hall]], built in 1846 for less than $8,000, also survived. It is said that Sherman, a [[Freemasonry|Mason]], spared it because it housed a [[Masonic Lodge]], though a more likely reason is that it housed an army hospital.\n\nDuring [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], Mississippi had considerable insurgent action, as whites struggled to maintain supremacy. In 1875, the [[Red Shirts (United States)|Red Shirts]] were formed, one of a second wave of insurgent [[paramilitary]] organizations that essentially operated as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\" to take back political power from the Republicans and to drive blacks from the polls.<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876. The constitutional convention of 1890, which produced [[Mississippi's Constitution of 1890]], was also held at the capitol.\n\nThis was the first of new constitutions or amendments ratified in each Southern state through 1908 that effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most [[African Americans]] and many poor whites, through provisions making voter registration more difficult: such as [[poll taxes in the United States|poll taxes]], residency requirements, and [[literacy test]]s.

Her [[memoir]] of development as a writer, ''[[One Writer's Beginnings]]'' (1984), presented a picture of the city in the early 20th century. She won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1973 for her novel, ''[[The Optimist's Daughter]],'' and is best known for her novels and short stories. The main Jackson [[Public Library]] was named in her honor, and her home has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n\n[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], a highly acclaimed African-American author, lived in Jackson as an adolescent and young man in the 1910s and 1920s. He related his experience in his memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945). He described the harsh and largely terror-filled life most African Americans experienced in the South and in Northern ghettos such as [[Chicago]] under [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in the early 20th century.\nJackson had significant growth in the early 20th century, which produced dramatic changes in the city's skyline. Jackson's new [[Union Station (Jackson, Mississippi)|Union Station]] downtown reflected the city's service by multiple rail lines, including the [[Illinois Central]]. The railroads were among the new work opportunities for African Americans, who moved into the city from rural areas for such industrial-type jobs.\n\nAcross the street, the new, luxurious [[King Edward Hotel (Jackson, Mississippi)|King Edward Hotel]] opened its doors in 1923, having been built according to a design by New Orleans architect [[William T. Nolan]]. It became a center for prestigious events held by Jackson society and Mississippi politicians. Nearby, the 18-story [[Standard Life Building]], designed in 1929 by Claude Lindsley, was the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world upon its completion.\n\nJackson's economic growth was further stimulated in the 1930s by the discovery of [[natural gas]] fields nearby. Speculators had begun searching for oil and natural gas in Jackson beginning in 1920. The initial drilling attempts came up empty. This failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state's insane asylum to begin a well on its grounds in 1924, where he found natural gas. (Render eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did not have the right to lease the state's property.) Businessmen jumped on the opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area. The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment. By 1930, there were 14 derricks in the Jackson skyline.\n\nMississippi Governor [[Theodore Bilbo]] stated:{{quote|It is no idle dream to prophecy that the state's share [of the oil and natural gas profits] properly safe-guarded would soon pay the state's entire bonded indebtedness and even be great enough to defray all the state's expenses and make our state tax free so long as obligations are concerned.}}\n\nThis enthusiasm was subdued when the first wells failed to produce oil of a sufficiently high gravity for commercial success. The barrels of oil had considerable amounts of salt water, which lessened the quality. The governor's prediction was wrong in hindsight, but the oil and natural gas industry did provide an economic boost for the city and state. The effects of the [[Great Depression]] were mitigated by the industry's success. At its height in 1934, there were 113 producing wells in the state. The overwhelming majority were closed by 1955.<ref>Dudley J.

Those illegal casinos, bootleg liquor stores, and nightclubs made up the Gold Coast, a strip of mostly [[black-market]] businesses that operated for decades along Flowood Road. Although outside the law, the Gold Coast was a thriving center of nightlife and music, with many local blues musicians appearing regularly in the clubs.\n\nThe Gold Coast declined and businesses disappeared after Mississippi's prohibition laws were repealed in 1966, allowing Hinds County, including Jackson, to go \"wet\".<ref>[http://blues.goodbarry.com/_webapp_2758974/Gold_Coast \"Gold Coast\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711110655/http://blues.goodbarry.com/_webapp_2758974/Gold_Coast |date=July 11, 2011 }}, Blues website</ref> In addition, [[racial integration|integration]] drew off business from establishments that earlier had catered to African Americans, such as the [[Summers Hotel and Subway Lounge|Summers Hotel]]. When it opened in 1943 on Pearl Street, it was one of two hotels in the city that served black clients. For years its Subway Lounge was a prime performance spot for black musicians playing jazz and blues.\n\nIn another major change, in 1990 the state approved gaming on riverboats. Numerous casinos have been developed on riverboats, mostly in [[Mississippi Delta]] towns such as [[Tunica Resorts]], [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], and [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], as well as [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]].

She taught there until 1979, and founded the university's Center for African-American Studies. Her poetry collection won a [[Yale Younger Poets Prize]]. Her second novel, ''[[Jubilee (novel)|Jubilee]]'' (1966), is considered a major work of African-American literature. She has influenced many younger writers.\n\n===Civil rights movement in Jackson===\nThe [[civil rights movement]] had been active for decades, particularly mounting legal challenges to Mississippi's constitution and laws that disfranchised blacks. Beginning in 1960, Jackson as the state capital became the site for dramatic non-violent protests in a new phase of activism that brought in a wide variety of participants in the performance of mass demonstrations.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Jackson's population as 64.3% white and 35.7% black.<ref name=\"census1\" /> At the time, public facilities were segregated and [[Jim Crow]] was in effect. Efforts to desegregate Jackson facilities began when nine [[Tougaloo College]] students tried to read books in the \"white only\" public library and were arrested. Founded as a [[historically black college]] (HBCU) by the [[American Missionary Association]] after the Civil War, Tougaloo College helped organize both black and white students of the region to work together for civil rights.

Blacks had been essentially disfranchised since 1890. In a pilot project in 1963, activists rapidly registered 80,000 voters across the state, demonstrating the desire of African Americans to vote.

for much of the 19th century. Before the Civil War, Jackson's population remained small, particularly in contrast to the river towns along the commerce-laden [[Mississippi River]]. Despite the city's status as the state capital, the 1850 census counted only 1,881 residents, and by 1900 the population of Jackson was still less than 8,000. Although it expanded rapidly, during this period [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] became Mississippi's largest city, based on trade, manufacturing, and access to transportation via railroad and highway.\n\nIn the early 20th century, as can be seen by the table, Jackson had its largest rates of growth, but ranked second to Meridian in Mississippi. By 1944, Jackson's population had risen to some 70,000 inhabitants, and it became the largest city in the state. It has maintained its position, achieving a peak population in the 1980 census of more than 200,000 residents in the city. Since then, Jackson has steadily seen a decline in its population, while its suburbs have had a boom. This change has occurred in part due to [[white flight]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110209111820/http://majorityinms.com/2011/02/07/some-census-quick-hits/ Some Census Quick Hits].

Thompson Field, east of Jackson and north of [[Pearl, Mississippi|Pearl]] in Rankin County. Its IATA code is JAN. The airport has non-stop service to eight cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Washington D.C., Dallas, Houston, Orlando, Denver, and Charlotte) throughout the United States and is served by five scheduled carriers (American, Delta, United, Frontier, and ViaAir). Jackson became one of the only cities to ever lose [[Southwest Airlines]] service when the carrier ceased service in the summer of 2014.\n\nOn December 22, 2004, the Jackson City Council voted 6\u20130 to rename Jackson International Airport in honor of slain civil rights leader and field secretary for the Mississippi chapter of the [[NAACP]], [[Medgar Evers]]. This decision took effect on January 22, 2005.\n\nFormerly Jackson was served by [[Hawkins Field (airport)|Hawkins Field Airport]], located in northwest Jackson, with IATA code HKS, which is now used for private air traffic only.\n\nUnderway is the [[Airport Parkway (Mississippi)|Airport Parkway]] project. The environmental impact study is complete and final plans are drawn and awaiting Mississippi Department of Transportation approval. Right-of-way acquisition is underway at an estimated cost of $19&nbsp;million. The Airport Parkway will connect High Street in downtown Jackson to [[Mississippi Highway 475]] in [[Flowood, Mississippi|Flowood]] at Jackson-Evers International Airport. The Airport Parkway Commission consists of the Mayor of Pearl, the Mayor of Flowood, and the Mayor of Jackson, as the Airport Parkway will run through and have access from each of these three cities.\n\n===Ground transportation===\n\n====Interstate highways====\n[[File:I-20.svg|20 px]] '''[[Interstate 20]]'''<br />Runs east-west from near [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], Texas to [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], South Carolina.

No evening or Sunday service provided.\n\n===Railroads===\n{{See also|Jackson, Mississippi (Amtrak station)}}\n\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Jackson. The Amtrak station is located at 300 West Capitol Street. The southbound [[City of New Orleans (train)|''City of New Orleans'']] provides service from Jackson to [[New Orleans]] and some points between; it leaves at 11:20&nbsp;a.m. and arrives in New Orleans about 3:30&nbsp;p.m. The northbound ''City of New Orleans'' provides service from Jackson to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign-Urbana]], [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]], and some points between. It leaves at 5:40&nbsp;p.m., arrives in Memphis at 10 p.m., and in Chicago at 9 a.m. the new day. Efforts to establish service with another long-distance train, the proposed ''Crescent Star'', an extension of the [[Crescent (train)|''Crescent'']] westward from [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], Mississippi, to [[Dallas]], failed in 2003, because Congress refused any growth in Amtrak routes.  This would have represented the first instance of passenger trains from Meridian, Mississippi to Jackson, to [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana since the 1967 cancellation of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]]'s ''[[Southwestern Limited (IC train)|Southwestern Limited]].''\n\nDuring the two waves of [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] in the 20th century, thousands of African Americans used trains to move to Northern and Midwestern cities, with many traveling to [[Chicago]] from rural Mississippi. They settled in neighborhoods with people they had known at home.\n\nThe growth of competition from highways and airline traffic meant widespread restructuring in the railroad industry since the mid-20th century. Passenger service was decreased, as people increasingly chose to use cars and planes. For freight traffic, Jackson is served by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) and [[Kansas City Southern Railway]] (KCS). CN has a medium-sized yard downtown which Mill Street parallels, and KCS has a large [[classification yard]] in [[Richland, Mississippi|Richland]].\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nIn 2015, 11 percent of city of Jackson households lacked a car, which decreased to 7.6 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016.

(1903) \"Historic Clinton\". ''Publications of the Mississippi Historical Society''. v. 7, p.285.</ref> Jackson was first connected by railroad to other cities in 1840. An 1844 map shows Jackson linked by an east-west rail line running between Vicksburg, [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]], and [[Brandon, Mississippi|Brandon]]. Unlike Vicksburg, [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], Jackson is not located on the [[Mississippi River]], and it did not develop during the [[antebellum era]] as those cities did from major river commerce. Construction of railroad lines to the city sparked its growth in the decades following the [[American Civil War]].\n\n===American Civil War and late 19th century (1861\u20131900)===\n[[File:Jackson-StarsAndStripesHarpers.jpg|thumb|1000px|centre|\"Raising the Stars and Stripes Over the Capitol of the State of Mississippi\", engraving from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', 20 June 1863, after the capture of Jackson by Union forces during the American Civil War]]\n[[File:Jacksonsiege1863.jpg|right|thumb|September 1863 map of the Siege of Jackson]]\nDespite its small population, during the Civil War, Jackson became a strategic center of manufacturing for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. In 1863, during the military campaign which ended in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|capture of Vicksburg]], [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces captured Jackson during two battles\u2014once before the fall of Vicksburg and once after the fall of Vicksburg.\n\nOn May 13, 1863, Union forces won the first [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Battle of Jackson]], forcing [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces to flee northward towards [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]]. On May 15, Union troops under the command of [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] burned and looted key facilities in Jackson, a strategic manufacturing and railroad center for the Confederacy. After driving the Confederate forces out of Jackson, Union forces turned west and engaged the Vicksburg defenders at the [[Battle of Champion Hill]] in nearby [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards]]. The Union forces began their siege of Vicksburg soon after their victory at Champion Hill. Confederate forces began to reassemble in Jackson in preparation for an attempt to break through the Union lines surrounding Vicksburg and end the siege. The Confederate forces in Jackson built defensive [[fortification]]s encircling the city while preparing to march west to Vicksburg.\n\nConfederate forces marched out of Jackson in early July 1863 to break the siege of Vicksburg. But, unknown to them, Vicksburg had already surrendered on July 4, 1863. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] dispatched General Sherman to meet the Confederate forces heading west from Jackson. Upon learning that Vicksburg had already surrendered, the Confederates retreated into Jackson. Union forces began the [[Siege of Jackson]], which lasted for approximately one week. Union forces encircled the city and began an [[artillery]] bombardment. One of the Union artillery emplacements has been preserved on the grounds of the [[University of Mississippi Medical Center]] in Jackson. Another Federal position is preserved on the campus of [[Millsaps College]]. [[John C. Breckinridge]], former United States [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], served as one of the Confederate generals defending Jackson. On July 16, 1863, Confederate forces slipped out of Jackson during the night and retreated across the Pearl River.\n\nUnion forces completely burned the city after its capture this second time. The city was called \"Chimneyville\" because only the chimneys of houses were left standing. The northern line of Confederate defenses in Jackson during the siege was located along a road near downtown Jackson, now known as Fortification Street.\n\n[[File:Jackson December 2018 37 (Old Mississippi State Capitol).jpg|thumb|[[Old Mississippi State Capitol|Mississippi Old Capitol]], downtown Jackson|alt=]]\n\nBecause of the siege and following destruction, few [[Antebellum architecture|antebellum]] structures have survived in Jackson. The [[Mississippi Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]], built in 1842, served as Sherman's headquarters and has been preserved. Another is the [[Old Mississippi State Capitol|Old Capitol]] building, which served as the home of the Mississippi state legislature from 1839 to 1903. The Mississippi legislature passed the ordinance of [[secession]] from the Union on January 9, 1861 there, becoming the second state to secede from the United States. The [[Jackson City Hall]], built in 1846 for less than $8,000, also survived. It is said that Sherman, a [[Freemasonry|Mason]], spared it because it housed a [[Masonic Lodge]], though a more likely reason is that it housed an army hospital.\n\nDuring [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], Mississippi had considerable insurgent action, as whites struggled to maintain supremacy. In 1875, the [[Red Shirts (United States)|Red Shirts]] were formed, one of a second wave of insurgent [[paramilitary]] organizations that essentially operated as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\" to take back political power from the Republicans and to drive blacks from the polls.<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref> Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876. The constitutional convention of 1890, which produced [[Mississippi's Constitution of 1890]], was also held at the capitol.\n\nThis was the first of new constitutions or amendments ratified in each Southern state through 1908 that effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most [[African Americans]] and many poor whites, through provisions making voter registration more difficult: such as [[poll taxes in the United States|poll taxes]], residency requirements, and [[literacy test]]s.

Their exclusion from politics was maintained into the late 1960s.\n\nThe economic recovery from the Civil War was slow through the start of the 20th century, but there were some developments in transportation. In 1871, the city introduced mule-drawn streetcars which ran on State Street, which were replaced by electric ones in 1899.<ref>Todd Sanders, ''Images of America: Jackson's North State Street'' (Charleston: Arcadia Publishing, 2009), 58 and 40.</ref>\n\nThe so-called [[Mississippi State Capitol|New Capitol]] replaced the older structure upon its completion in 1903.

Her [[memoir]] of development as a writer, ''[[One Writer's Beginnings]]'' (1984), presented a picture of the city in the early 20th century. She won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1973 for her novel, ''[[The Optimist's Daughter]],'' and is best known for her novels and short stories. The main Jackson [[Public Library]] was named in her honor, and her home has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n\n[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], a highly acclaimed African-American author, lived in Jackson as an adolescent and young man in the 1910s and 1920s. He related his experience in his memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945). He described the harsh and largely terror-filled life most African Americans experienced in the South and in Northern ghettos such as [[Chicago]] under [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in the early 20th century.\nJackson had significant growth in the early 20th century, which produced dramatic changes in the city's skyline. Jackson's new [[Union Station (Jackson, Mississippi)|Union Station]] downtown reflected the city's service by multiple rail lines, including the [[Illinois Central]]. The railroads were among the new work opportunities for African Americans, who moved into the city from rural areas for such industrial-type jobs.\n\nAcross the street, the new, luxurious [[King Edward Hotel (Jackson, Mississippi)|King Edward Hotel]] opened its doors in 1923, having been built according to a design by New Orleans architect [[William T. Nolan]]. It became a center for prestigious events held by Jackson society and Mississippi politicians. Nearby, the 18-story [[Standard Life Building]], designed in 1929 by Claude Lindsley, was the largest reinforced concrete structure in the world upon its completion.\n\nJackson's economic growth was further stimulated in the 1930s by the discovery of [[natural gas]] fields nearby. Speculators had begun searching for oil and natural gas in Jackson beginning in 1920. The initial drilling attempts came up empty. This failure did not stop Ella Render from obtaining a lease from the state's insane asylum to begin a well on its grounds in 1924, where he found natural gas. (Render eventually lost the rights when courts determined that the asylum did not have the right to lease the state's property.) Businessmen jumped on the opportunity and dug wells in the Jackson area. The continued success of these ventures attracted further investment. By 1930, there were 14 derricks in the Jackson skyline.\n\nMississippi Governor [[Theodore Bilbo]] stated:{{quote|It is no idle dream to prophecy that the state's share [of the oil and natural gas profits] properly safe-guarded would soon pay the state's entire bonded indebtedness and even be great enough to defray all the state's expenses and make our state tax free so long as obligations are concerned.}}\n\nThis enthusiasm was subdued when the first wells failed to produce oil of a sufficiently high gravity for commercial success. The barrels of oil had considerable amounts of salt water, which lessened the quality. The governor's prediction was wrong in hindsight, but the oil and natural gas industry did provide an economic boost for the city and state. The effects of the [[Great Depression]] were mitigated by the industry's success. At its height in 1934, there were 113 producing wells in the state. The overwhelming majority were closed by 1955.<ref>Dudley J.

Those illegal casinos, bootleg liquor stores, and nightclubs made up the Gold Coast, a strip of mostly [[black-market]] businesses that operated for decades along Flowood Road. Although outside the law, the Gold Coast was a thriving center of nightlife and music, with many local blues musicians appearing regularly in the clubs.\n\nThe Gold Coast declined and businesses disappeared after Mississippi's prohibition laws were repealed in 1966, allowing Hinds County, including Jackson, to go \"wet\".<ref>[http://blues.goodbarry.com/_webapp_2758974/Gold_Coast \"Gold Coast\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711110655/http://blues.goodbarry.com/_webapp_2758974/Gold_Coast |date=July 11, 2011 }}, Blues website</ref> In addition, [[racial integration|integration]] drew off business from establishments that earlier had catered to African Americans, such as the [[Summers Hotel and Subway Lounge|Summers Hotel]]. When it opened in 1943 on Pearl Street, it was one of two hotels in the city that served black clients. For years its Subway Lounge was a prime performance spot for black musicians playing jazz and blues.\n\nIn another major change, in 1990 the state approved gaming on riverboats. Numerous casinos have been developed on riverboats, mostly in [[Mississippi Delta]] towns such as [[Tunica Resorts]], [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], and [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], as well as [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. Before the damage and losses due to [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, the state ranked second nationally in gambling revenues.\n\n====World War II and later development====\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Hawkins Field (airport)|Hawkins Field]] (at that time, also known as the Jackson Army Airbase) the American 21st, 309th, and 310th Bomber Groups that were stationed at the base were re-deployed for combat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patriots without a Country: Dutch Wings over Jackson|author1=Amanda Lyons|author2=Will Morgan|url=http://www.mdah.ms.gov/new/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/01_Lyons-Morgan.pdf|date=May 1, 2018|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref>  Following the [[Battle of the Netherlands|German invasion of the Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch East Indies campaign|Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies]], between 688 and 800 members of the Dutch Airforce escaped to the UK or Australia for training and, out of necessity, were eventually given permission by the United States to make use of Hawkins Field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jackson's Flying Dutchmen: The Significance of the Royal Netherlands Military Flying School|author=Samuel Howard Well|publisher=University of Mississippi|date=August 2018|access-date=February 24, 2020|url=https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1055&context=masters_theses}}</ref>\n\nFrom May 1942 until the end of the war, all Dutch military aircrews trained at the base and went on to serve in either the British or Australian Air Forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering the fallen airmen of the Royal Netherlands Flying School in Mississippi|url=http://nlintheusa.com/royal-netherlands-flying-school/|date=May 22, 2018|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the poet [[Margaret Walker]] began teaching at [[Jackson State University]], a [[historically black college]]. She taught there until 1979, and founded the university's Center for African-American Studies. Her poetry collection won a [[Yale Younger Poets Prize]]. Her second novel, ''[[Jubilee (novel)|Jubilee]]'' (1966), is considered a major work of African-American literature. She has influenced many younger writers.\n\n===Civil rights movement in Jackson===\nThe [[civil rights movement]] had been active for decades, particularly mounting legal challenges to Mississippi's constitution and laws that disfranchised blacks. Beginning in 1960, Jackson as the state capital became the site for dramatic non-violent protests in a new phase of activism that brought in a wide variety of participants in the performance of mass demonstrations.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Jackson's population as 64.3% white and 35.7% black.<ref name=\"census1\" /> At the time, public facilities were segregated and [[Jim Crow]] was in effect. Efforts to desegregate Jackson facilities began when nine [[Tougaloo College]] students tried to read books in the \"white only\" public library and were arrested. Founded as a [[historically black college]] (HBCU) by the [[American Missionary Association]] after the Civil War, Tougaloo College helped organize both black and white students of the region to work together for civil rights. It created partnerships with the neighboring mostly white [[Millsaps College]] to work with student activists. It has been recognized as a site on the \"Civil Rights Trail\" by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Civil Rights Movement Veterans\n  | title = Tougaloo 9\n  | url = http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961t9\n  | access-date = December 21, 2007\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100707051408/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis61.htm#1961t9\n  | archive-date = July 7, 2010\n  | url-status = live\n  }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jackson December 2018 20 (Old Greyhound Bus Station).jpg|thumb|[[Old Greyhound Bus Station (Jackson, Mississippi)|Old Greyhound Bus Station]]]]\n\nThe mass demonstrations of the 1960s were initiated with the arrival of more than 300 [[Freedom Riders]] on May 24, 1961. They were arrested in Jackson for [[breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] after they disembarked from their interstate buses.

New participants kept joining the movement, as they intended to fill the jails in Jackson with their protest.

They attracted national media attention to the struggle for constitutional rights.\n\nAfter the Freedom Rides, students and activists of the Freedom Movement launched a series of merchant [[boycott]]s,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Civil Rights Movement Veterans\n  | title = Jackson MS, Boycotts\n  | url = http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962jackson\n  | access-date = December 21, 2007\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004011259/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis62.htm#1962jackson\n  | archive-date = October 4, 2006\n  | url-status = live\n  }}</ref> sit-ins and protest marches,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Civil Rights Movement Veterans\n  | title = Jackson Sit-in & Protests\n  | url = http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963woolworth\n  | access-date = December 21, 2007\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090615060449/http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis63.htm#1963woolworth\n  | archive-date = June 15, 2009\n  | url-status = live\n  }}</ref> from 1961 to 1963. Businesses discriminated against black customers. For instance, at the time, department stores did not hire black salesclerks or allow black customers to use their fitting rooms to try on clothes, or lunch counters for meals while in the store, but they wanted them to shop in their stores.\n\nIn Jackson, shortly after midnight on June 12, 1963, [[Medgar Evers]], civil rights activist and leader of the Mississippi chapter of the [[NAACP]], was assassinated by [[Byron De La Beckwith]], a [[white supremacist]] associated with the [[White Citizens' Council]].

In 1994, prosecutors Ed Peters and [[Bobby DeLaughter]] finally obtained a murder conviction in a state trial of De La Beckwith based on new evidence.\n\nDuring 1963 and 1964, civil rights organizers gathered local residents for voter education and [[voter registration]]. Blacks had been essentially disfranchised since 1890. In a pilot project in 1963, activists rapidly registered 80,000 voters across the state, demonstrating the desire of African Americans to vote. In 1964 they created the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] as an alternative to the all-white state Democratic Party, and sent an alternate slate of candidates to the national Democratic Party convention in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], New Jersey, that year.\n\nSegregation and the disfranchisement of African Americans gradually ended after the Civil Rights Movement gained Congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965. In June 1966, Jackson was the terminus of the James Meredith March, organized by [[James Meredith]], the first [[African American]] to enroll at the [[University of Mississippi]]. The march, which began in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee, was an attempt to garner support for full implementation of civil rights in practice, following the legislation. It was accompanied by a new drive to register African Americans to vote in Mississippi. In this latter goal, it succeeded in registering between 2,500 and 3,000 black Mississippians to vote. The march ended on June 26 after Meredith, who had been wounded by a sniper's bullet earlier on the march, addressed a large rally of some 15,000 people in Jackson.\n\nIn September 1967 a [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapter bombed the synagogue of the [[Congregation Beth Israel (Jackson, Mississippi)|Beth Israel Congregation]] in Jackson, and in November bombed the house of its rabbi, Dr. [[Congregation Beth Israel (Jackson, Mississippi)#Perry Nussbaum era|Perry Nussbaum]].<ref name=\"BethIsrael\">[http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/historyofbethisraeljackson.htm  History of Beth Israel, Jackson, Mississippi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005050359/http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/ms/historyofbethisraeljackson.htm |date=October 5, 2007 }}, Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life website, History Department, Digital Archive, Mississippi, Jackson, Beth Israel.

for much of the 19th century. Before the Civil War, Jackson's population remained small, particularly in contrast to the river towns along the commerce-laden [[Mississippi River]]. Despite the city's status as the state capital, the 1850 census counted only 1,881 residents, and by 1900 the population of Jackson was still less than 8,000. Although it expanded rapidly, during this period [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] became Mississippi's largest city, based on trade, manufacturing, and access to transportation via railroad and highway.\n\nIn the early 20th century, as can be seen by the table, Jackson had its largest rates of growth, but ranked second to Meridian in Mississippi. By 1944, Jackson's population had risen to some 70,000 inhabitants, and it became the largest city in the state. It has maintained its position, achieving a peak population in the 1980 census of more than 200,000 residents in the city. Since then, Jackson has steadily seen a decline in its population, while its suburbs have had a boom. This change has occurred in part due to [[white flight]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110209111820/http://majorityinms.com/2011/02/07/some-census-quick-hits/ Some Census Quick Hits].

Thompson Field, east of Jackson and north of [[Pearl, Mississippi|Pearl]] in Rankin County. Its IATA code is JAN. The airport has non-stop service to eight cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Washington D.C., Dallas, Houston, Orlando, Denver, and Charlotte) throughout the United States and is served by five scheduled carriers (American, Delta, United, Frontier, and ViaAir). Jackson became one of the only cities to ever lose [[Southwest Airlines]] service when the carrier ceased service in the summer of 2014.\n\nOn December 22, 2004, the Jackson City Council voted 6\u20130 to rename Jackson International Airport in honor of slain civil rights leader and field secretary for the Mississippi chapter of the [[NAACP]], [[Medgar Evers]]. This decision took effect on January 22, 2005.\n\nFormerly Jackson was served by [[Hawkins Field (airport)|Hawkins Field Airport]], located in northwest Jackson, with IATA code HKS, which is now used for private air traffic only.\n\nUnderway is the [[Airport Parkway (Mississippi)|Airport Parkway]] project. The environmental impact study is complete and final plans are drawn and awaiting Mississippi Department of Transportation approval. Right-of-way acquisition is underway at an estimated cost of $19&nbsp;million. The Airport Parkway will connect High Street in downtown Jackson to [[Mississippi Highway 475]] in [[Flowood, Mississippi|Flowood]] at Jackson-Evers International Airport. The Airport Parkway Commission consists of the Mayor of Pearl, the Mayor of Flowood, and the Mayor of Jackson, as the Airport Parkway will run through and have access from each of these three cities.\n\n===Ground transportation===\n\n====Interstate highways====\n[[File:I-20.svg|20 px]] '''[[Interstate 20]]'''<br />Runs east-west from near [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], Texas to [[Florence, South Carolina|Florence]], South Carolina.

The highway is six lanes from Interstate 220 to MS 468 in Pearl.\n\n[[File:I-55.svg|20 px]] '''[[Interstate 55]]'''<br />Runs north-south from [[Chicago]] through Jackson towards [[Brookhaven, Mississippi|Brookhaven]], [[McComb, Mississippi|McComb]], and the [[Louisiana]] state line to [[New Orleans]]. Jackson is roughly halfway between New Orleans and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee. The highway maintains eight to ten lanes in the northern part of the city, six lanes in the center, and four lanes south of [[Interstate 20|I-20]].\n\n[[File:I-220.svg|25 px]] '''[[Interstate 220 (Mississippi)|Interstate 220]]'''<br />Connects Interstates 55 and 20 on the north and west sides of the city and is four lanes throughout its route.\n\n====U.S. highways====\n[[File:US 49.svg|20 px]] '''[[U.S. Highway 49]]'''<br />Runs north-south from the [[Arkansas]] state line at [[Lula, Mississippi|Lula]] via [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]] and [[Yazoo City, Mississippi|Yazoo City]], towards [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]] and [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]].

No evening or Sunday service provided.\n\n===Railroads===\n{{See also|Jackson, Mississippi (Amtrak station)}}\n\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Jackson. The Amtrak station is located at 300 West Capitol Street. The southbound [[City of New Orleans (train)|''City of New Orleans'']] provides service from Jackson to [[New Orleans]] and some points between; it leaves at 11:20&nbsp;a.m. and arrives in New Orleans about 3:30&nbsp;p.m. The northbound ''City of New Orleans'' provides service from Jackson to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign-Urbana]], [[Chicago Union Station|Chicago]], and some points between. It leaves at 5:40&nbsp;p.m., arrives in Memphis at 10 p.m., and in Chicago at 9 a.m. the new day. Efforts to establish service with another long-distance train, the proposed ''Crescent Star'', an extension of the [[Crescent (train)|''Crescent'']] westward from [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]], Mississippi, to [[Dallas]], failed in 2003, because Congress refused any growth in Amtrak routes.  This would have represented the first instance of passenger trains from Meridian, Mississippi to Jackson, to [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], Louisiana since the 1967 cancellation of the [[Illinois Central Railroad]]'s ''[[Southwestern Limited (IC train)|Southwestern Limited]].''\n\nDuring the two waves of [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] in the 20th century, thousands of African Americans used trains to move to Northern and Midwestern cities, with many traveling to [[Chicago]] from rural Mississippi. They settled in neighborhoods with people they had known at home.\n\nThe growth of competition from highways and airline traffic meant widespread restructuring in the railroad industry since the mid-20th century. Passenger service was decreased, as people increasingly chose to use cars and planes. For freight traffic, Jackson is served by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) and [[Kansas City Southern Railway]] (KCS). CN has a medium-sized yard downtown which Mill Street parallels, and KCS has a large [[classification yard]] in [[Richland, Mississippi|Richland]].\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nIn 2015, 11 percent of city of Jackson households lacked a car, which decreased to 7.6 percent in 2016. The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Jackson averaged 1.68 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|accessdate=May 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511162014/http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|archive-date=May 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nJackson is home to several major industries.
