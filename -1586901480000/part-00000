bushfire/wildfire event]] in recorded history.\n\n==Responses==\n{{Main|Reactions to the Black Saturday bushfire crisis}}\nResponses to the Black Saturday bushfires included immediate community response, donations, and international aid efforts. Later responses included Government inquiries including a Royal Commission, and recommendations and discussions from a wide variety of bodies, organisations, authorities and communities.\n\nIn September 2009 it was announced that Australia's most prominent [[fire ecology|fire ecologist]], Kevin Tolhurst, was developing a new course for the [[University of Melbourne]] on fire behaviour.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Costigan |first=Justine |title=Responding to Tragedy |work=Melbourne University Magazine |date=September 2009 |pages=15\u201317 |url=http://mag.alumni.unimelb.edu.au/major-feature/responding-tragedy |accessdate=3 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910093356/http://mag.alumni.unimelb.edu.au/major-feature/responding-tragedy |archivedate=10 September 2009 }}</ref> Later that month the [[City of Manningham]] announced it was developing the state's first integrated fire management plan in conjunction with the interim findings of the Royal Commission.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Crowe | first = Danielle | title = Hotspots register | work = Manningham Leader | date = 9 September 2009 | page = 5 | url = http://manningham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/pilot-project-manningham-council-is-mapping-our-fire-hotspots/ | accessdate = 22 September 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090914125600/http://manningham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/pilot-project-manningham-council-is-mapping-our-fire-hotspots/ | archive-date = 14 September 2009 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is expected that eventually all Victorian councils responsible for both urban and rural land will need to develop such plans, which define fire risks in [[Landscape|open space]] areas, along major roads, and in parkland.\n\nIn September/October 2009, it was announced that a new fire hazard system would replace the previous one. The new system involves a six-tier scale to indicating such things as the level of risk and activity of the fire. This standardised ''[[Bushfires in Australia#Warnings|Fire Danger Rating]]'' (FDR) was subsequently adopted by all Australian states in late 2009. Every day during the fire season the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)]] forecasts an outlook of the ''Fire Danger Index'' (FDI) by considering the predicted weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of vegetation.<ref name=\"Country Fire Authority\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfaconnect.net.au/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=873 |title=New Warning System Explained |publisher=[[Country Fire Authority]] |accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref> On the highest risk days, residents are advised to leave the potentially affected areas.\n\nThe [[RSPCA Australia|RSPCA]] estimated that over a million animals perished in the bushfires.<ref name=age-4.4bill /> Additionally, many of the surviving [[Fauna of Australia|wildlife]] suffered from severe burns.

This figure was composed of 84 per cent for property or contents, and 16 per cent for vehicles. However the report also estimated that up to 13 per cent of residential properties destroyed may have had no insurance, with many more under-insured, thus suggesting that the actual cost of asset damage in the bushfires was considerably higher than that recorded. The report from the commission said that: \"...&nbsp;the level of insurance claims is likely to underestimate the true extent of property losses, but it is unable to calculate the extent of this underestimation\".<ref name=age-4.4bill />\n\nAlso omitted from the $4.4 billion figure were the agricultural losses sustained in the fires, and the ongoing impacts on agriculture in following seasons. The Victorian Department of Primary Industries estimated losses shortly after the fires as 11,800 head of livestock, {{convert|62000|ha|acres}} of grazing [[pasture]], and {{Convert|32000|t|ton}} of [[hay]] and [[silage]].<ref name=age-4.4bill />\n\nAs of February 2011, two years after the fires, the ''Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority'' stated that based on figures from the end of 2010, permits had been issued for the rebuilding of only 731 of the 1,795, or 41 per cent of the principal places of residence destroyed in the fires.<ref name=age-slowpath>{{cite news|last=Johanson|first=Simon|title=Recovery a painfully slow path|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/recovery-a-painfully-slow-path-20110206-1aigz.html|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=15 February 2011|date=7 February 2011|location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\n====Lawsuits====\nA [[class action]] lawsuit was initiated in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] on 13 February 2009 by [[Slidders Lawyers]] against electricity distribution company [[SP AusNet]], in relation to the [[Kilmore East, Victoria|Kilmore East]] fire that became part of the Kinglake complex, and the [[Beechworth, Victoria|Beechworth]] fires.<ref name=\"age class action\">{{cite news|author1=Houston, Cameron |authorlink2=Michael Bachelard|author2=Bachelard, Michael  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Huge fire class action launched | newspaper = The Age | date = 15 February 2009 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/national/huge-fire-class-action-launched-20090214-87pg.html?page=-1 | accessdate = 15 February 2009 | location=Melbourne}}</ref> A partner at the firm indicated that the claim would centre on alleged [[negligence]] by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure.<ref name=\"age class action\" /> On 12 February police had taken away a section of power line as well as a power pole from near Kilmore East, part of a two-kilometre section of line that fell on the morning of 7 February and was believed to have started the fire there.<ref name=\"age class action\" />\n\nThe class action was ultimately run by law firm [[Maurice Blackburn (law firm)|Maurice Blackburn]].

Naomi Brown, chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council, argued that the high number of fatalities in these fires, as opposed to earlier fires such as the [[Ash Wednesday fires]], was partly attributable to increased population densities on Melbourne's fringes.<ref name=\"age strategies questioned\" /> David Packham, bushfire expert and research fellow at [[Monash University]], argued that high fuel loads in bushland led to the destructive intensity of the fires, saying that \"There has been total mismanagement of the Australian forest

investigated by a [[Royal Commission]], the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[John Brumby]], suggested that the long-standing \"stay-and-defend-or-leave-early\" policy would be reviewed, saying that while it

\"Decades of science, practice and history show that a well-prepared home provides the best refuge in the event of fire\".<ref name=\"australian nsw commissioner policy\" /> Nixon also dismissed potential policies involving forced evacuations, saying \"There used to be policies where you could make people leave but we're talking about adults.\"<ref name=\"abc nixon defends policy\" /> A

response, donations, and international aid efforts. Later responses included Government inquiries including a Royal Commission, and recommendations and discussions from a wide variety of bodies, organisations, authorities and communities.\n\nIn September 2009 it was announced that Australia's most prominent [[fire ecology|fire ecologist]], Kevin Tolhurst, was developing a new course for the [[University of Melbourne]] on fire behaviour.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Costigan |first=Justine |title=Responding to Tragedy |work=Melbourne University Magazine |date=September 2009 |pages=15\u201317 |url=http://mag.alumni.unimelb.edu.au/major-feature/responding-tragedy |accessdate=3 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910093356/http://mag.alumni.unimelb.edu.au/major-feature/responding-tragedy |archivedate=10 September 2009 }}</ref> Later that month the [[City of Manningham]] announced it was developing the state's first integrated fire management plan in conjunction with the interim findings of the Royal Commission.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Crowe | first = Danielle | title = Hotspots register | work = Manningham Leader | date = 9 September 2009 | page = 5 | url = http://manningham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/pilot-project-manningham-council-is-mapping-our-fire-hotspots/ | accessdate = 22 September 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090914125600/http://manningham-leader.whereilive.com.au/news/story/pilot-project-manningham-council-is-mapping-our-fire-hotspots/ | archive-date = 14 September 2009 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is expected that eventually all Victorian councils responsible for both urban and rural land will need to develop such plans, which define fire risks in [[Landscape|open space]] areas, along major roads, and in parkland.\n\nIn September/October 2009, it was announced that a new fire hazard system would replace the previous one. The new system involves a six-tier scale to indicating such things as the level of risk and activity of the fire. This standardised ''[[Bushfires in Australia#Warnings|Fire Danger Rating]]'' (FDR) was subsequently adopted by all Australian states in late 2009. Every day during the fire season the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)]] forecasts an outlook of the ''Fire Danger Index'' (FDI) by considering the predicted weather including temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and dryness of vegetation.<ref name=\"Country Fire Authority\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfaconnect.net.au/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=873 |title=New Warning System Explained |publisher=[[Country Fire Authority]] |accessdate=1 February 2010}}</ref> On the highest risk days, residents are advised to leave the potentially affected areas.\n\nThe [[RSPCA Australia|RSPCA]] estimated that over a million animals perished in the bushfires.<ref name=age-4.4bill /> Additionally, many of the surviving [[Fauna of Australia|wildlife]] suffered from severe burns.

This figure was composed of 84 per cent for property or contents, and 16 per cent for vehicles. However the report also estimated that up to 13 per cent of residential properties destroyed may have had no insurance, with many more under-insured, thus suggesting that the actual cost of asset damage in the bushfires was considerably higher than that recorded. The report from the commission said that: \"...&nbsp;the level of insurance claims is likely to underestimate the true extent of property losses, but it is unable to calculate the extent of this underestimation\".<ref name=age-4.4bill />\n\nAlso omitted from the $4.4 billion figure were the agricultural losses sustained in the fires, and the ongoing impacts on agriculture in following seasons.

Naomi Brown, chief executive of the Australasian Fire and Emergency Services Authorities Council, argued that the high number of fatalities in these fires, as opposed to earlier fires such as the [[Ash Wednesday fires]], was partly attributable to increased population densities on Melbourne's fringes.<ref name=\"age strategies questioned\" /> David Packham, bushfire expert and research fellow at [[Monash University]], argued that high fuel loads in bushland led to the destructive intensity of the fires, saying that \"There has been total mismanagement of the Australian forest

investigated by a [[Royal Commission]], the [[Premier of Victoria]], [[John Brumby]], suggested that the long-standing \"stay-and-defend-or-leave-early\" policy would be reviewed, saying that while it

{"title_page": "Mathematics education in New York", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=September 2011}}\n\n'''Mathematics education in New York''' in regard to both content and teaching method can vary depending on the type of school a person attends. Private school math education varies between schools whereas New York has statewide public school requirements where standardized tests are used to determine if the teaching method and educator are effective in transmitting content to the students. While an individual private school can choose the content and educational method to use, New York State mandates content and methods statewide. Some public schools have and continue to use established methods, such as Montessori for teaching such required content. New York State has used various foci of content and methods of teaching math including New Math (1960s), 'back to the basics' (1970s), Whole Math (1990s), Integrated Math, and Everyday Mathematics.\n\nHow to teach math, what to teach, and its effectiveness has been a topic of debate in New York State and nationally since the \"Math Wars\" started in the 1960s. Often, current political events influence how and what is taught. The politics in turn influence state legislation. California, New York, and several other states have influenced textbook content produced by publishers.<ref>http://www.csun.edu/~vcmth00m/AHistory.html</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] has implemented a novel curriculum for [[high school]] [[mathematics]].\n\nThe courses ''Algebra I'', ''Geometry'', and ''Algebra II/Trigonometry'' are required [[Course (education)|course]]s mandated by the [[New York State Department of Education]] for [[high school]] [[graduation]].\n\n==2007-present==\n===Algebra===\nThis is the first course in the new three-year curriculum. It was originally \"Math A,\" but was replaced with \"Integrated Algebra.\" In 2009 when Common Core was adopted, \"Algebra I\" replaced \"Integrated Algebra\" and is still in use today. \n\nStudents learn to how write, solve, and graph [[equation]]s and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]. They will also learn how to solve [[system of equations|systems of equations]], as well as how to simplify [[exponent]]s, [[quadratic equation]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[polynomial]]s, [[square root|radicals]], and [[rational fraction|rational expressions]]. Other topics included are [[probability]] and [[statistics]].\n\nSome schools divided Algebra 1 into a two-year sequence. The students who receive it begin with Algebra 1A, and will cover the rest of the Algebra 1 topics in Algebra 1B in the next school year. Typically, most students are placed in Algebra 1 which covers all lessons rather than splitting them. \n\nAt the conclusion of the one-year course, students take the New York State Regents Exam. The first administration of this exam was in June 2008.\n\n===Geometry===\nThis is the second course in the new three year curriculum. It replaced part of \"Math A\" and part of \"Math B\"\n\n[[Geometry|Geometric]] concepts such as [[right triangle]]s are introduced. The course also covers topics including [[perpendicular]] and [[parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]], [[triangles]], [[quadrilateral]]s, and [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformations]].\n\nAt the conclusion of this one-year course, students take a New York State Regents exam in Geometry. The first administration of this exam was in June 2009.\n\n===Algebra II===\nThis is the third and last course of the new three-year curriculum. It replaced the elements of \"Math B\" not covered in geometry.\n\nThis course covers concepts of advanced [[algebra]], and as well prepares students for [[pre-calculus]] and [[calculus]]. In 2016, the Board of Regents removed some of the [[trigonometry]] concepts and lessons from the course, and the Regents exam has been renamed from \n\"Algebra 2/Trigonometry\" to \"Algebra II\".   \n\nAt the conclusion of the one-year course, students take the New York State Regents exam for Algebra II. This is the last Regents exam in mathematics students could take. Like the former \"Math B\" Regents, it is considered one of the hardest High School Regents examinations, along with the Physical Setting/Chemistry regents and the Physical Setting/Physics regents. The Algebra 2/Trigonometry exam was given from June 2010 through January 2017 and the new Algebra II Exam has been given since June 2016.\n\n==2001-2009==\n===Math A (former course)===\nMath A replaced the former \"Course 1\" curriculum which focused solely on the topic of [[algebra]], while Math A covered a whole range of topics. After algebra, you take Geometry in the 10th grade and than Algebra II in the 11th grade.\n\nIn Math A, students learn to how write, solve, and graph [[equation]]s and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]. They will also learn how to solve [[system of equations|systems of equations]], [[quadratic equation|quadratic]]s, as well as [[exponent]]s, [[exponential function]]s, [[polynomial]]s, [[square root|radicals]], and [[rational fraction|rational expressions]]. Other topics included are [[probability]] and [[statistics]]. Geometric concepts such as [[right triangle]]s are also introduced. The course works in conjunction with [[New York State]]'s Standards for Mathematics.[http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/ciai/mst/pub/mststa1_2.pdf] One course lasted three semesters, after which students took the Regents Math A Examination.\n\n===Math A/B (former course)===\nMath A/B took the place of the former \"Course 2\" curriculum, which focused almost solely on [[geometry]], while Math A/B focused on a whole range of topics. Math A/B served as a bridge between the Math A and Math B courses.\n\nMath A/B stayed true to its geometric roots, as the first half of the course covered topics such as [[perpendicular]] and [[parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]], [[triangles]], [[quadrilateral]]s, and [[Transformation (mathematics)|transformations]]. After their first [[semester]], students took the [[New York State]] Math A [[Regents|Regents exam]]. June 2008 was the last administration of this exam. For the second half of the year, students would begin Math B. They covered [[logic]], [[geometric|geometric figures]], and an introduction to [[trigonometry]].\n\n===Math B (former course)===\nMath B was required to receive a High School Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation. The course replaces the former \"Course 3\" curriculum, which focused almost solely on [[trigonometry]]. Math B focused on a whole range of topics. It was taken after the student has completed and passed Math A.\n\nA Regents exam was taken at the end of the {{frac|1|1|2}}-year course. The Math B Regents was often considered one of the most difficult New York State Regents.\n\nMath B covered concepts that can be found in [[trigonometry]] and advanced [[algebra]], and prepared students for [[pre-calculus]] and [[calculus]] and reviewed past topics. During their year of study, students learned different [[theorem]]s, graphed complex [[number]]s and [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s, as well as reviewed topics such as [[exponential function]]s, systems of inequalities, and [[Nth root|radical]]s. As the year progressed, students were expected to relate these [[function (mathematics)|functions]] to the real world, create [[conjecture]]s through their own [[research]], and begin a [[classroom]] discussion about these topics. At the end of their studies, they would take the [[New York State]] Math B [[Regents (Examinations)|Regents Examination]]. The last administration of this exam was in August 2010.\n\n===Changes proposed in 2004===\nIn November 2004, the Mathematics Standards Committee made a report to the [[Board of Regents]][https://web.archive.org/web/20051227034410/http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/osa/mathre/new_mathregents.htm] about the State's requirements for high school graduation as related to mathematics. The committee recommended that:\n\n*The curriculum should return to its old format as a one-year course with a Regents exam taken at the end of the year, with the new exam to be administered no earlier than June 2007. Math A would have its name changed to Integrated Algebra.\n*In addition to the current Regents exam at the end of the Math B course, there should be another Regents exam, at the end of the first half of Math B study (currently Math A/B), to be administered no later than June 2006, bringing the total number of Regents exams to three.\n*The course's name should be changed to ''Geometry'' for the first half of the course, and ''Algebra II and Trigonometry'' for the second half of the course (currently Math B). Integrated is only used in the new Algebra course.\n**The State of New York has announced that these changes will be implemented in the 2009/10 scholastic year.\n*In 2009, Integrated Algebra was switched to Algebra 1, due to the common core adoption. \n\nThe move was praised by many who thought the changes to the original draft curriculum were unnecessary.\n\n==Pre-2002==\n===Sequential Mathematics===\nPrior to the 2001-2002 school year, the New York State Board of Regents mandated a three-year Sequential Mathematics series divided into three Courses I, II, and III. <ref>[https://www.jmap.org/JMAP_REGENTS_EXAM_ARCHIVES.htm]</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Archived Sequential Mathematics Examinations |url=https://nysedregents.org/SequentialMathematicsI/ |accessdate=14 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190504191021/http://www.nysedregents.org/SequentialMathematicsI/ |archive-date=4 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mathematics education in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051227034410/http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/osa/mathre/new_mathregents.htm Mathematics' Standard Committee's recommendations]\n<!-- no longer on the website \n*[http://www.prenticehall.com/sales_support/new_york/ny_math/index.html Prentice Hall]\n-->\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.prenticehall.com Official website of textbook developer]\n*[http://www.nysed.gov New York State Department of Education]\n*[http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/ciai/ New York State Department of Education: Curriculum, Instruction and Instructional Technology]\n*[http://www.math.com Math Help and Resources]\n*[http://www.jmap.org JMAP - Free resources for teachers]\n*[http://www.regentsprep.org  Regents preparation site for New York]\n\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mathematics Education In New York}}\n[[Category:Education in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Mathematics education in the United States|New York]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=September 2011}}\n\n'''Mathematics education in New York''' in regard to both content and teaching method can vary depending on the type of school a person attends.
