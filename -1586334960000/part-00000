{"title_page": "List of islands of Thailand", "text_new": "[[Image:Ang Thong.jpg|thumb|right|Ang Thong Marine Park]]\n[[File:Kohtao997001.jpg|thumb|Ko Nang Yuan]]\nThis is a '''list of [[islands]] of [[Thailand]]'''.\n{{Expand list|date=February 2011}}\n\nThailand has hundreds of islands both in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and in the [[Andaman Sea]]. The islands of the central Gulf of Thailand are mostly located near the coast. Formerly most of the islands in Thailand were uninhabited, but in recent times many have been developed for tourism.\n\nSome of the island groups in Thailand come in clusters of numerous individual islands: [[Phang Nga Bay]] has 67, the [[Mu Ko Chang National Park]] has 52, [[Tarutao National Marine Park]] has 51, and [[Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park]] has 42.\n\n{{Anchor|Notes}}Notes:\n# In [[Thai language|Thai]], the names of islands are usually preceded with the word ''ko'' ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]] \u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30), the Thai word for ''island''. This word is often alternately romanized as ''koh'', ''go'' or ''goh''.  [[English language]] references to the names of the Thai islands should not have an additional \"island\" added to their names, or else the ''ko'' should be left off.  For example, \"Ko Phi Phi Island\" would be redundant, since \"Ko Phi Phi\" already means \"Phi Phi Island\"\n#  Various [[map]]s commonly spell Thai names differently, using different [[transliteration]]s.  For example, ''Ko Mak'' may be seen as ''Koh Mak'', ''Koh Maak'' or even ''Koh Mark''. This list gives precedence to the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] favored by the Government of Thailand, for the English-based Thai transcription is now becoming obsolete.\nTo help in using search engines, the list also contains alternative names (used on some maps) either in the \"Alternate spellings\" column, or in parentheses.\n\n==List of Larger Thai Islands==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=1| Name !!

The islands of the central Gulf of Thailand are mostly located near the coast. Formerly most of the islands in Thailand were uninhabited, but in recent times many have been developed for tourism.\n\nSome of the island groups in Thailand come in clusters of numerous individual islands: [[Phang Nga Bay]] has 67, the [[Mu Ko Chang National Park]] has 52, [[Tarutao National Marine Park]] has 51, and [[Mu Ko Ang Thong National Park]] has 42.\n\n{{Anchor|Notes}}Notes:\n# In [[Thai language|Thai]], the names of islands are usually preceded with the word ''ko'' ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]] \u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30), the Thai word for ''island''. This word is often alternately romanized as ''koh'', ''go'' or ''goh''.  [[English language]] references to the names of the Thai islands should not have an additional \"island\" added to their names, or else the ''ko'' should be left off.  For example, \"Ko Phi Phi Island\" would be redundant, since \"Ko Phi Phi\" already means \"Phi Phi Island\"\n#  Various [[map]]s commonly spell Thai names differently, using different [[transliteration]]s.  For example, ''Ko Mak'' may be seen as ''Koh Mak'', ''Koh Maak'' or even ''Koh Mark''. This list gives precedence to the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] favored by the Government of Thailand, for the English-based Thai transcription is now becoming obsolete.\nTo help in using search engines, the list also contains alternative names (used on some maps) either in the \"Alternate spellings\" column, or in parentheses.\n\n==List of Larger Thai Islands==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=1| Name !!

{"title_page": "Wiki software", "text_new": "{{short description|Collaborative software that runs a wiki}}\n{{primary sources|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Homepage of Wikipedia.png|thumb|Homepage of Wikipedia, which runs on [[MediaWiki extension|MediaWiki]], one of the most popular wiki software packages]] \n'''[[Wiki]] software''' (also known as a '''wiki engine''' or '''wiki application''') is [[collaborative software]] that runs a [[wiki]], which allows users to create and collaboratively edit pages or entries via a [[web browser]]. A wiki system is usually a [[web application]] that runs on one or more [[web server]]s. The content, including previous revisions, is usually stored in either a [[file system]] or a [[database]]. Wikis are a type of [[web content management system]], and the most commonly supported off-the-shelf software that [[web hosting]] facilities offer.\n\nThere are dozens of actively maintained wiki engines. They vary in the platforms they run on,  the programming language they were developed in, whether they are [[Open-source software|open source]] or [[proprietary software|proprietary]], their support for natural language characters and conventions, and their assumptions about technical versus social control of editing.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of wikis}}\n\nThe first generally recognized \"wiki\" application, [[WikiWikiWeb]], was created by American computer programmer [[Ward Cunningham]] in 1994 and launched on c2.com in 1995.<ref>''The Wiki Way. Quick collaboration on the Web'', Addison-Wesley (April 2001) {{ISBN|0-201-71499-X}}</ref> \"WikiWikiWeb\" was also the name of the wiki that ran on the software, and in the first years of wikis' existence there was no great distinction made between the contents of wikis and the software they ran on, possibly because almost every wiki ran on its own customized software.\n\nWiki software originated from older [[version control]] systems used for documentation and software in the 1980s.  By the mid-1990s these generally had [[web browser]] interfaces.  However, they lacked the ability to easily create links between internal pages without writing HTML code.  For WikiWikiWeb, the [[CamelCase]] naming convention was used to indicate internal links, without requiring HTML code.\n\nBy the time [[MediaWiki]] appeared, this convention had been largely abandoned in favor of explicitly marking links in edited source code with double square brackets.  Page names thus did not interrupt the flow of English and could follow standard English capitalization convention.  Case-sensitivity on the first letter but not subsequent letters supported standard English capitalization conventions and let writers author their pages in ordinary English, with the linking of particular words and phrases afterward.  This proved to be the critical change that allowed ordinary authors of English to write wiki pages, and non-technical users to read them.  This policy was extended to other natural languages, avoiding the use of unusual-looking text or awkward capitalization that violates the language's own rules.\n\nOver the next 10 years, many more wiki applications were written, in a variety of programming languages. After 2005, there began to be a move toward increasing consolidation and standardization: many less-popular wiki applications were gradually abandoned, and fewer new applications were created. Relatively few of the wiki engines currently in use were created after 2006.\n\nThe idea of having wiki functionality is  now seen as desirable generally and some aspects of wiki functionality has also been added to existing [[content management system]]s, such as [[Microsoft SharePoint]]. Some writers have pointed out that Sharepoint does not in fact function as a wiki, even with this functionality in use.\n\n== Data compatibility ==\n\nIn general new wiki engines have not followed the data formats of the existing engines, making them of limited use for those who have already invested in large knowledge bases in existing software.  As a rule newer wiki projects have not succeeded in attracting large numbers of users from the existing wiki software base.\n\nOnly one data format has ever been implemented in more than one wiki, that being MediaWiki's:\n* [[WordPress]] has extensions to display and edit MediaWiki-format pages, and to frame MediaWiki.\n* Jamwiki is a MediaWiki clone in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], that supports MediaWiki-format pages but not extensions.\n* Other commercial projects or clones often (or have in the past) follow the MediaWiki format. [[BlueSpice MediaWiki]] is the only such software with a free version available.\n\nNone of these alternatives support the extensions available under standard MediaWiki, some of which extend or alter its data format.\n\n== Types of usage ==\n\nThere are essentially three types of usage for wiki software: public-facing wikis with a potentially large community of readers and editors, private [[enterprise wiki]]s for data management by corporations and other organizations, and [[personal wiki]]s, meant to be used by a single person to manage notes, and usually run on a desktop. Some wiki software is specifically geared for one of the usage types, while other software can be used for all three, but contains functionality, either in its core or through plugins, that help with one or more of the usage types.\n\n=== Public wikis ===\n\nPublic wikis are wikis that can be read by anyone; usually, though not always, the contents can be edited by anyone as well, though sometimes registration is required. Among public wikis, [[MediaWiki]] is the dominant software: it powers the world's most popular (as per August, 2015) public wiki,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites|title=Alexa Top 500 Global Sites|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> [[Wikipedia]] (free), as well as the most popular wiki farm, [[Wikia]] (commercial), and it is the most popular software in use on other public wikis as well.<ref name=\"wikiindex\">[http://wikiindex.org/Special:BrowseData/All?_single&Status%5B0%5D=Active&Status%5B1%5D=New&Status%5B2%5D=Vibrant Breakdown of active wikis on WikiIndex]</ref> Other wiki engines used regularly for public wikis include [[MoinMoin]] and [[PmWiki]], [[List of wiki software|along with many others]].<ref name=\"wikiindex\" />\n\nOther Internet websites, based on wiki software, include encyclopedies such as [[Sensei's Library]], [[Parlia]], and  [[WikiTree]].\n\n=== Enterprise wikis ===\n\n[[Enterprise software|Enterprise]] wiki software is software intended to be used in a corporate (or organizational) context,<ref>[http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/year-enterprise-wiki-305 Year of the enterprise Wiki: Lightweight Web collaboration gets down to business] Jon Udell | ''[[InfoWorld]]'' | December 30, 2004</ref> especially to enhance internal [[knowledge sharing]]. It tends to have a greater emphasis on features like access control, integration with other software, and [[document management system|document management]]. Most proprietary wiki applications specifically market themselves as enterprise solutions, including [[Socialtext]], [[Jive (software)|Jive]], [[Traction TeamPage]], and [[Nuclino]]. \n\nIncreasingly offerings appear which use the name 'wiki' but do not offer basic elements common to established wikis, like Wiki Markup and Link-first workflow [[Confluence]](since 2018) <ref>https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFCLOUD-67129</ref>, or Version Control of Full Text Search [[Microsoft Teams]].<ref>https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/33575167-wiki-search</ref> It is the amalgam of basic functions which make the wiki concept pragmatically distinct from a web content editor like [[Wix.com|Wix]] or [[Squarespace]].\n\nIn addition, some quality open source wiki applications also describe themselves as enterprise solutions, including [[XWiki]], [[Foswiki]]<ref>[http://foswiki.org/ Foswiki homepage] - \"the free and open source enterprise collaboration platform\"</ref>, [[TWiki]]<ref>[http://twiki.org/ TWiki homepage] - \"the Open Source Enterprise Wiki\"</ref>, and [[BlueSpice MediaWiki|BlueSpice]].<ref>[https://bluespice.com/ BlueSpice homepage] - \"the Enterprise Wiki Software\"</ref> Some open-source wiki applications, though they do not specifically bill themselves as enterprise solutions, have marketing materials geared for enterprise users, like [[Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tiki.org/Enterprise|title=Enterprise - Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware :: Community|first=Tiki|last=Community|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> and [[MediaWiki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Enterprise_hub|title=Enterprise hub - MediaWiki|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> Many other wiki applications have also been used within enterprises.\n\nAmong the many companies and government organizations that use wikis internally are [[Adobe Systems]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and the [[Intellipedia|United States intelligence community]].\n\nWithin organizations, wikis may either add to or replace centrally managed content management systems. Their decentralized nature allows them, in principle, to disseminate needed information across an organization more rapidly and more cheaply than a centrally controlled knowledge repository. Wikis can also be used for [[document management]], [[project management]], [[customer relationship management]], [[enterprise resource planning]], and many other kinds of data management.\n\nFeatures of wikis which can serve an enterprise include:\n* Entering information into quick and easy-to-create pages, including hyperlinks to other corporate information systems like people directories, [[Content management system|CMS]], applications, and thus to facilitate the buildup of useful knowledge bases.\n* Reduces [[e-mail]] overload. Wikis allow all relevant information to be shared by people working on a given project. Conversely, only the wiki users interested in a given project need look at its associated wiki pages, in contrast to high-traffic mailing lists which may burden subscribers with many messages, regardless of their relevance. It is also very useful for the project manager to have all the communication stored in one place, which allows them to link the responsibility for every action taken to a particular team member.\n* Organizes information. Wikis help users structure information into discoverable and searchable categories. These may arise from users in a bottom-up way.  Users can create lists, tables, timelines and other ways of expressing order.\n* Builds consensus. Wikis allow structuring the expression of views, on a topic being considered by authors, on the same page. This feature is very useful when writing documentation, preparing presentations, when author opinions differ, and so on.\n* Access levels by rights and roles. Users can be denied access to view and/or edit given pages, depending upon their department or role within the organization.\n* Knowledge management with comprehensive searches. This includes document management, project management, and knowledge repositories useful during times of employee turnover or retirement.\n\n=== Personal wikis ===\nSoftware that is specifically designed for running personal wikis includes [[Tomboy (software)|Tomboy]], [[WikidPad]], [[PmWiki]], and [[ConnectedText]] (now discontinued). Other, more general, wiki applications have components geared for individual users, including [[MoinMoin]] (which offers a \"DesktopEdition\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moinmo.in/DesktopEdition|title=DesktopEdition - MoinMoin|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>), and [[TiddlyWiki]].\n\n== Editing ==\n\nMost wiki software uses a special syntax, known as [[wiki markup]], for users to format the text, instead of requiring them to enter in [[HTML]]. Some wiki applications also include a [[WYSIWYG]] editor, either instead of or in addition to the wiki markup editing.\n\nBased on the [[atomicity (database systems)|atomic]] property of [[database|database systems]], any edit should be [[tracking and tracing|traced]]. On wiki software, the [[chronology]] of edits (e.g. published by Internet users) in any given article may be [[Import and export of data|locally saved]] with a common [[XML|.xml]] file extension by people having [[superuser|administrator rights]].\n\n== Hosted application ==\n\nThere are a variety of [[wiki hosting service]]s, otherwise known as wiki farms, that host users' wikis on a server. Some wiki software is only available in hosted form: [[PBworks]], [[Wetpaint]] and [[Wikispaces]] are all examples of wiki hosting services that run on code that is only available on those sites. Other wiki software is available in both [[Web hosting service|hosted]] and downloadable form, including [[Confluence (software)|Confluence]], [[Socialtext]], [[MediaWiki]] and [[XWiki]].\n\n== Additional features ==\n\n=== Content-management features ===\n\nWiki software can include features that come with traditional content management systems, such as calendars, to-do lists, [[blog]]s and discussion forums. All of these can either be stored via versioned wiki pages, or simply be a separate piece of functionality. Software that supports blogs with wiki-style editing and versioning is sometimes known as \"bliki\" software.\n\nTiki Wiki CMS Groupware is an example of wiki software that is designed to support such features at its core. Many of the enterprise wiki applications, such as [[TWiki]], [[Confluence (software)|Confluence]] and [[SharePoint]], also support such features, as do open-source applications like [[MediaWiki]] and [[XWiki]], via [[plugins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://platform.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Features/Applications|title=Applications &amp; Extensions (Features.Applications) - XWiki|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Scripting ===\n\nSome wiki applications let users embed [[Scripting language|scripting]]-style calls into wiki pages, which are processed by the wiki's parser and run either when the page is saved or when it is displayed. [[XWiki]] and [[MediaWiki]] are examples of such applications.<ref>{{citation|citeseerx = 10.1.1.131.2458|title=Lightweight End-User Programming with Wikis| first1 = C. | last1 = Anslow | first2 = D. | last2 = Riehle|year=2007|publisher=SAP Research}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically XWiki offers support for the following scripting languages: [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]], [[Velocity (JavaScript library)|Velocity]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[PHP]] or more generally any [[Scripting for the Java Platform|JSR223]] scripting language.\n\n=== Semantic annotation ===\n\nWiki software can let users store data via the wiki, in a way that can be exported via the [[Semantic Web]], or queried internally within the wiki. A wiki that allows such annotation is known as a [[semantic wiki]]. The current best-known semantic wiki software is [[Semantic MediaWiki]], a plugin to MediaWiki.\n\n=== Mobile access ===\n\nSome wiki software have special handling for accessing by mobile devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s. This is usually done by displaying conservative [[HTML]] coding.<ref>[http://www.cio.com/article/19955/Socialtext_Optimizes_Wiki_for_Mobile_Users?contentId=19955&slug=& Socialtext Optimizes Wiki for Mobile Users], CIO Magazine, April 5, 2006, retrieved 2008-09-20</ref><ref>[http://www.tuaw.com/2007/07/15/w2-a-little-iphone-wiki/ W2: a little iPhone wiki], tuaw, July 15, 2007, retrieved 2008-09-20</ref>\n\n=== Offline viewing and editing ===\n\nVarious approaches to providing wiki functionality when the user is not online have been tried. For users who need to simply read the wiki's content when offline, a copy of the content can often be made easily; in the case of Wikipedia, [[CD-ROM]]s and printed versions have been made of parts of Wikipedia's content.\n\nAllowing offline editing, however (where the changes are synchronized when the user is back online), is a much more difficult process. One approach to doing this is using a [[distributed revision control system]] as a [[Front and back ends|backend]] of the wiki, in [[peer-to-peer]] style. With this approach, there is no central store of the wiki's content; instead, every user keeps a complete copy of the wiki locally, and the software handles merging and propagating of changes when they are made. This is the approach taken by the [[ikiwiki]] engine (which can use the distributed revision control system [[Git (software)|Git]] as its back-end), and [[Code Co-op]] (a distributed revision control system that includes a wiki component).\n\n=== Distributing and decentralizing ===\n\nWiki software can be [[Peer-to-peer|distributed]].<ref name=\"DavoustSkaf-Molli2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Davoust|first1=Alan|last2=Skaf-Molli|first2=Hala|last3=Molli|first3=Pascal|last4=Esfandiari|first4=Babak|last5=Aslan|first5=Khaled|title=Distributed wikis: a survey|journal=Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience|volume=27|issue=11|year=2015|pages=2751\u20132777|issn=1532-0626|doi=10.1002/cpe.3439|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01100371/document}}</ref> XWiki is able to function in this way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://concerto.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome|title=XWiki Concerto Project homepage|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> Smallest Federated Wiki promotes a federation of wiki servers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fed.wiki.org|title=Welcome Visitors|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been research done on allowing Wikipedia to be run as a decentralized wiki.<ref>[http://www.globule.org/publi/DWECWH_webist2007.html A Decentralized Wiki Engine for Collaborative Wikipedia Hosting], Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre and Maarten van Steen, ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technology (''[[Webist]]'')'', March 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.globule.org/publi/WWADH_comnet2009.html Wikipedia Workload Analysis for Decentralized Hosting], Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre, Maarten van Steen, ''Elsevier Computer Networks'' 53(11), pp. 1830\u20131845, July 2009</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Collaborative editing]]\n* [[Comparison of wiki software]]\n* [[Enterprise portal]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[List of collaborative software]]\n* [[List of wiki software]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* Andersen, Espen (2005).

A wiki system is usually a [[web application]] that runs on one or more [[web server]]s. The content, including previous revisions, is usually stored in either a [[file system]] or a [[database]]. Wikis are a type of [[web content management system]], and the most commonly supported off-the-shelf software that [[web hosting]] facilities offer.\n\nThere are dozens of actively maintained wiki engines. They vary in the platforms they run on,  the programming language they were developed in, whether they are [[Open-source software|open source]] or [[proprietary software|proprietary]], their support for natural language characters and conventions, and their assumptions about technical versus social control of editing.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of wikis}}\n\nThe first generally recognized \"wiki\" application, [[WikiWikiWeb]], was created by American computer programmer [[Ward Cunningham]] in 1994 and launched on c2.com in 1995.<ref>''The Wiki Way. Quick collaboration on the Web'', Addison-Wesley (April 2001) {{ISBN|0-201-71499-X}}</ref> \"WikiWikiWeb\" was also the name of the wiki that ran on the software, and in the first years of wikis' existence there was no great distinction made between the contents of wikis and the software they ran on, possibly because almost every wiki ran on its own customized software.\n\nWiki software originated from older [[version control]] systems used for documentation and software in the 1980s.  By the mid-1990s these generally had [[web browser]] interfaces.  However, they lacked the ability to easily create links between internal pages without writing HTML code.  For WikiWikiWeb, the [[CamelCase]] naming convention was used to indicate internal links, without requiring HTML code.\n\nBy the time [[MediaWiki]] appeared, this convention had been largely abandoned in favor of explicitly marking links in edited source code with double square brackets.

With this approach, there is no central store of the wiki's content; instead, every user keeps a complete copy of the wiki locally, and the software handles merging and propagating of changes when they are made. This is the approach taken by the [[ikiwiki]] engine (which can use the distributed revision control system [[Git (software)|Git]] as its back-end), and [[Code Co-op]] (a distributed revision control system that includes a wiki component).\n\n=== Distributing and decentralizing ===\n\nWiki software can be [[Peer-to-peer|distributed]].<ref name=\"DavoustSkaf-Molli2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Davoust|first1=Alan|last2=Skaf-Molli|first2=Hala|last3=Molli|first3=Pascal|last4=Esfandiari|first4=Babak|last5=Aslan|first5=Khaled|title=Distributed wikis: a survey|journal=Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience|volume=27|issue=11|year=2015|pages=2751\u20132777|issn=1532-0626|doi=10.1002/cpe.3439|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01100371/document}}</ref> XWiki is able to function in this way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://concerto.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome|title=XWiki Concerto Project homepage|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref> Smallest Federated Wiki promotes a federation of wiki servers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fed.wiki.org|title=Welcome Visitors|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been research done on allowing Wikipedia to be run as a decentralized wiki.<ref>[http://www.globule.org/publi/DWECWH_webist2007.html A Decentralized Wiki Engine for Collaborative Wikipedia Hosting], Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre and Maarten van Steen, ''Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technology (''[[Webist]]'')'', March 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.globule.org/publi/WWADH_comnet2009.html Wikipedia Workload Analysis for Decentralized Hosting], Guido Urdaneta, Guillaume Pierre, Maarten van Steen, ''Elsevier Computer Networks'' 53(11), pp. 1830\u20131845, July 2009</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Collaborative editing]]\n* [[Comparison of wiki software]]\n* [[Enterprise portal]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[List of collaborative software]]\n* [[List of wiki software]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* Andersen, Espen (2005).

He began his career at his hometown side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] after impressing the club's coaching staff in a trial match in 1912 organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling [[Defender (association football)|defender]], he appeared sporadically for the team in the [[Southern Football League]] before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, led by Major [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Frank Buckley]], which became known as the [[Football Battalion]]. He fought in the [[Battle of the Somme]], suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. He returned to Britain and after a lengthy rehabilitation he ended the war as a physical training instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. He also appeared as a guest player for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] during the war.\n\nOvercoming doubts about the possibility of playing again, Keenor returned to the game with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history. They won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] one season after joining the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920. Keenor helped the club to the [[1925 FA Cup Final]], in which Cardiff suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. In 1926, he replaced the departing [[Jimmy Blair (footballer, born 1888)|Jimmy Blair]] as club captain, leading the team to success in the [[1927 FA Cup Final]] later in the season, in which they defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20130. Their triumph remains the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England.\n\nKeenor was released by Cardiff at the end of the [[1930\u201331 in English football|1930\u201331 season]], which saw the club relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. During his time at Cardiff, he made more than 500 appearances for the club, winning four [[Welsh Cup]] titles, the FA Cup and the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] in a 19-year association with the side. He is regarded as one of the club's all-time greats. A statue of Keenor, lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new ground, the [[Cardiff City Stadium]], in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign.\n\nKeenor finished his career with spells at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], [[Oswestry Town F.C.|Oswestry Town]] and [[Tunbridge Wells F.C.|Tunbridge Wells Rangers]]. During his career, he also attained 32 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[Wales national football team]]. He helped the side win the [[British Home Championship]] three times, in 1920, 1924 and 1928, and captained the side on numerous occasions, scoring two goals. Following his death in 1972, the [[Football Association of Wales]] secretary [[Trevor Morris (footballer)|Trevor Morris]] commented, \"Fred Keenor will go down as one of the greatest players and greatest characters ever produced by Wales\".<ref name=\"Leighton 2010 158\">{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=158}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nFrederick Charles Keenor was born in [[Cardiff]], Wales, on 31 July 1894. He was one of eleven children born to Robert and Mary Keenor. The family lived in a terraced house in Theodora Street in [[Roath]], a working class suburb of Cardiff.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=11}}</ref> His father was a stonemason in the city, working long hours to be able to afford employing Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions; Keenor shared a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house that did not have an inside toilet. Their home did have electricity, which had been introduced in Cardiff fewer than ten years earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=12}}</ref>\n\nKeenor developed a keen interest in football as a child, using tennis balls to play the game in his local streets. Due to the cost of footballs, he and his friends would also use rags tied together to form a ball.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=14}}</ref> He attended Stacey Road Primary School in [[Adamsdown]] where he captained the school's football team for several years.

A loss to Camerton during a Western League fixture left a lasting impression on him after an over-confident Cardiff side suffered an upset, losing 3\u20131 in a match they were widely expected to win.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=23}}</ref> Keenor often spoke of using the defeat as motivation in later stages of his career, remarking, \"In subsequent seasons I always thought of that game when we were supposed to be on a 'good thing'. It has a moral which I pass on to every young footballer\".<ref name=\"Leighton 2010 24\">{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=24}}</ref>\n\nHis whole-hearted performances for the amateur side persuaded the club to offer Keenor his first professional contract. Although he was given a wage of 10 [[shillings]] per week, he continued to work locally as a labourer. He described his two streams of income as making him \"feel like a millionaire\".<ref name=\"J107\" /><ref name=\"Leighton 2010 24\" /> The Cardiff squad was undergoing a significant overhaul under the management team of secretary-manager [[Fred Stewart (football manager)|Fred Stewart]] and trainer [[George Latham (footballer)|George Latham]]; all but four of the senior team players they had inherited from previous manager [[Davy McDougall]] were released.<ref>{{harvnb|Lloyd|1999|p=45}}</ref> The pair were impressed by Keenor's performances and handed him first-team opportunities at the end of the [[1912\u201313 Southern Football League|1912\u201313 season]].

After missing the opening game of the season, a defeat to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], he featured in five consecutive matches to replace an injured Cassidy. His performance during a victory over [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] earned glowing reviews in the ''[[Athletic News]]''.<ref name=\"L2728\" /> Cassidy's return from injury saw Keenor drop out of the side. He did not appear for the first team from October 1914 until a match on 2 January 1915.

Keenor travelled by train every weekend to the venue of each Cardiff fixture to keep playing and was listed in the matchday programmes as \"Private Keenor\" for the remainder of the season. Cardiff finished the season in third place in the First Division.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=37}}</ref> Keenor made 21 appearances in the league during the season, scoring two goals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballandthefirstworldwar.org/cardiff-city-squad-1914-15/ |title=Cardiff City Squad 1914/15 |publisher=Football and the First World War |accessdate=9 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809191312/http://www.footballandthefirstworldwar.org/cardiff-city-squad-1914-15/ |archive-date=9 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> The effects of the war effort crippled the club's finances. With travel restrictions placed on train services, and local men enlisting en masse, Cardiff's income from attendances dwindled. The situation became so dire that players were told to look for part-time jobs during the summer break in case the club was unable to pay their wages.

The match ended in a 1\u20130 victory for the battalion.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=41}}</ref>\n\nOne month after the match, on 16 November, Keenor and his battalion began the journey to France to join the [[front line]]s. They [[billet]]ed in the village of Les Ciseaux for one month before moving to the city of [[B\u00e9thune]]. Most of his posting during his battalion's first months in France involved training and guard duty. On 9 December 1915, they were posted to [[Annequin]] near the front line.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=42}}</ref> They were soon moved into the main trenches, which were knee-deep in mud and infested with rats. His battalion remained on duty until 22 December when they were relieved, resting in the nearby village of [[Beuvry]] over Christmas. Cardiff City organised regular collections at their wartime fixtures during this period to send parcels to Keenor and Jack Stephenson containing letters from fans and home comforts. The Middlesex Battalion claimed the Divisional Football Cup with relative ease, defeating a team from the [[34th Brigade (United Kingdom)|34th Brigade]] 11\u20130 in the final on 11 April 1916; each player received a winners' medal made of bronze.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=44}}</ref>\n\nThe war soon took its toll on the battalion as they began suffering casualties from the fighting, including Buckley who suffered severe shrapnel injuries. Having returned to the front, the regiment was involved in the [[Battle of the Somme]], one of the bloodiest battles in history, in particularly the [[Battle of Delville Wood]].<ref name=\"Page 46\">{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=46}}</ref> Keenor later described the scene during what he called a \"hellish battle\", stating:\n\n{{quote|One must pay tribute to the good work of the Footballers' Battalion.

An unknown soldier saw him attempting to crawl away from the incoming fire and managed to help him back to the nearby medical facilities where army doctors were able to tend to his injury. The wound was so severe that they considered amputating the leg but decided against it. He was removed from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and transported to an army hospital in [[Dublin]] where he spent six months undergoing rehabilitation on his injured leg.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=47}}</ref> Following his return to service, Keenor was stationed in [[Chatham, Kent]], as a physical training instructor for the [[British Army First World War reserve brigades|5th Reserve Brigade]].<ref name=\"warrecord\" /> He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]], the [[1914\u201315 Star]] and the [[British War Medal]] for his service during the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=49}}</ref> Between 1915 and 1919, Keenor appeared as a guest for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in the [[London Combination]].

Having mostly been a member of the reserve team before the outbreak of the war, Keenor returned to Cardiff as an experienced member of the squad having played for his battalion and Brentford during wartime. He featured in two of the club's three pre-season fixtures. Fred Stewart resumed his role of secretary-manager following the war. He was given a selection issue in the form of Keenor and the presence of his regular first choice Patrick Cassidy. However, Cassidy pushed for Keenor to be given the chance to play due to his \"youth and promise\".<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=52}}</ref> After this, Keenor featured regularly for the first team. Cardiff's squad had escaped the war relatively intact with most of the side returning to play.

He began his career at his hometown side [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] after impressing the club's coaching staff in a trial match in 1912 organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling [[Defender (association football)|defender]], he appeared sporadically for the team in the [[Southern Football League]] before his spell at the club was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]. Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, led by Major [[Frank Buckley (footballer)|Frank Buckley]], which became known as the [[Football Battalion]]. He fought in the [[Battle of the Somme]], suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. He returned to Britain and after a lengthy rehabilitation he ended the war as a physical training instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant. He also appeared as a guest player for [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] during the war.\n\nOvercoming doubts about the possibility of playing again, Keenor returned to the game with Cardiff as they embarked on the most successful period in their history. They won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] one season after joining the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920. Keenor helped the club to the [[1925 FA Cup Final]], in which Cardiff suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. In 1926, he replaced the departing [[Jimmy Blair (footballer, born 1888)|Jimmy Blair]] as club captain, leading the team to success in the [[1927 FA Cup Final]] later in the season, in which they defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20130. Their triumph remains the only time the competition has been won by a team based outside England.\n\nKeenor was released by Cardiff at the end of the [[1930\u201331 in English football|1930\u201331 season]], which saw the club relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. During his time at Cardiff, he made more than 500 appearances for the club, winning four [[Welsh Cup]] titles, the FA Cup and the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] in a 19-year association with the side. He is regarded as one of the club's all-time greats. A statue of Keenor, lifting the FA Cup, was erected outside Cardiff's new ground, the [[Cardiff City Stadium]], in November 2012 following a public fundraising campaign.\n\nKeenor finished his career with spells at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]], [[Oswestry Town F.C.|Oswestry Town]] and [[Tunbridge Wells F.C.|Tunbridge Wells Rangers]]. During his career, he also attained 32 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for the [[Wales national football team]]. He helped the side win the [[British Home Championship]] three times, in 1920, 1924 and 1928, and captained the side on numerous occasions, scoring two goals. Following his death in 1972, the [[Football Association of Wales]] secretary [[Trevor Morris (footballer)|Trevor Morris]] commented, \"Fred Keenor will go down as one of the greatest players and greatest characters ever produced by Wales\".<ref name=\"Leighton 2010 158\">{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=158}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nFrederick Charles Keenor was born in [[Cardiff]], Wales, on 31 July 1894. He was one of eleven children born to Robert and Mary Keenor. The family lived in a terraced house in Theodora Street in [[Roath]], a working class suburb of Cardiff.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=11}}</ref> His father was a stonemason in the city, working long hours to be able to afford employing Elizabeth Maler, a live-in nanny, to help his wife care for their children. Although they were not regarded as being in poverty, the family lived in cramped conditions; Keenor shared a bedroom with three of his brothers in a house that did not have an inside toilet. Their home did have electricity, which had been introduced in Cardiff fewer than ten years earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Leighton|2010|p=12}}</ref>\n\nKeenor developed a keen interest in football as a child, using tennis balls to play the game in his local streets.

In the 18th century, French explorers canoed up to the area and also harvested the salt.  They named the local river ''Saline'', which means \"salty\" in French.  Europeans settled the area in the 19th century, most of them coming from England and Germany.

Saline experiences a four-season climate, with summer temperatures reaching as high as 105&nbsp;\u00b0F and temperatures falling as low as -29&nbsp;\u00b0F in the winter. Average high temperatures in the summer range between 70&nbsp;\u00b0F and 85&nbsp;\u00b0F, with average high temperatures in the winter ranging from 15&nbsp;\u00b0F to 35&nbsp;\u00b0F. Precipitation falls year round, with snow being the main form of precipitation during the winter months. Saline experiences an average yearly snowfall of {{convert|53|in|m}}, with most of that coming from \"Snowstorms\" and \"Clippers\". \"Lake effect\" is a common sight in Saline during the winter months; however, the snow is typically much lighter than the heavy accumulations that occur on the western side of the state, which is closer to Lake Michigan. The Great Lakes influence the weather in other ways in Saline, bringing constant clouds in the winter, even with dry air masses in place. Summers are cooler than those in surrounding states, with cool breezes off the Great Lakes when the water temperature is colder than the air temperature.\n\nThe main weather hazard in Saline\u2014as well as in all of Southeast Michigan\u2014is severe thunderstorms and snowstorms. Tornadoes, high winds, large hail, and lightning are the most frequent causes of death from weather in the area.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 858\n|1890= 706\n|1900= 584\n|1910= 816\n|1920= 830\n|1930= 1009\n|1940= 1227\n|1950= 1533\n|1960= 2334\n|1970= 4811\n|1980= 6483\n|1990= 6660\n|2000= 8034\n|2010= 8810\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=9363\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 8,810 people, 3,699 households, and 2,336 families residing in the city.

Erected 1898.]] -->\n\nBefore the 18th century, Native Americans traveled to what is now Saline to hunt wildlife and gather salt from the salt springs they found nearby.  In the 18th century, French explorers canoed up to the area and also harvested the salt.  They named the local river ''Saline'', which means \"salty\" in French.  Europeans settled the area in the 19th century, most of them coming from England and Germany.  Together with [https://web.archive.org/web/20070526050541/http://salinehistory.org/index.php?section=history&content=orange_risdon Orange Risdon], a government surveyor who is generally considered to be the city's founder, the residents named the town Saline, which was officially established in 1832.

Saline experiences a four-season climate, with summer temperatures reaching as high as 105&nbsp;\u00b0F and temperatures falling as low as -29&nbsp;\u00b0F in the winter. Average high temperatures in the summer range between 70&nbsp;\u00b0F and 85&nbsp;\u00b0F, with average high temperatures in the winter ranging from 15&nbsp;\u00b0F to 35&nbsp;\u00b0F. Precipitation falls year round, with snow being the main form of precipitation during the winter months. Saline experiences an average yearly snowfall of {{convert|53|in|m}}, with most of that coming from \"Snowstorms\" and \"Clippers\". \"Lake effect\" is a common sight in Saline during the winter months; however, the snow is typically much lighter than the heavy accumulations that occur on the western side of the state, which is closer to Lake Michigan. The Great Lakes influence the weather in other ways in Saline, bringing constant clouds in the winter, even with dry air masses in place. Summers are cooler than those in surrounding states, with cool breezes off the Great Lakes when the water temperature is colder than the air temperature.\n\nThe main weather hazard in Saline\u2014as well as in all of Southeast Michigan\u2014is severe thunderstorms and snowstorms. Tornadoes, high winds, large hail, and lightning are the most frequent causes of death from weather in the area.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 858\n|1890= 706\n|1900= 584\n|1910= 816\n|1920= 830\n|1930= 1009\n|1940= 1227\n|1950= 1533\n|1960= 2334\n|1970= 4811\n|1980= 6483\n|1990= 6660\n|2000= 8034\n|2010= 8810\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=9363\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 8,810 people, 3,699 households, and 2,336 families residing in the city.
