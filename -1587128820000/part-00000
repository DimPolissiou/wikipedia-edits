{"title_page": "History of the Texas Rangers (baseball)", "text_new": "The '''History of the Texas Rangers''' started when [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|the old Washington Senators]] team of the [[American League]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) left [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1960. A new expansion team was formed with the same name and stayed in the same town until its last season in 1971. The next year, the franchise renamed itself as the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and started its first season in [[Arlington, Texas]], as part of the [[American League West Division]], where it remains today.\n\n==Washington Senators: 1961\u20131971==\n\nWhen the original Washington Senators moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 as the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off threats of losing its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. At the winter meetings that year, it awarded a new team to Los Angeles ([[Los Angeles Angels|the Angels]]) as well as a new team in the nation's capital. This new team adopted the old Senators name, but was (and still is) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to District of Columbia Stadium (now the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]]). {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators\u2014\"Washington: first in war, first in peace and ''still'' last in the American League.\" [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Owner [[Elwood Richard Quesada|Pete Queseda]] once wondered why he needed to pay players who didn't belong in the majors and later agreed to a ten-year lease at D.C. Stadium\u2014a move that would come back to haunt the Senators. In {{MLBy|1963}}, Quesada sold his stake in the club and resigned. Washington stockbrokers [[James Johnston (baseball owner) | James Johnston]] and [[James Lemon]] owned the team briefly, suffering massive financial losses. Johnston died in {{MLBy|1967}} and Lemon sold the team a year later to hotel and trucking executive [[Bob Short]], who outbid a group headed by [[Bob Hope]]. Short named himself general manager and hired [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] as manager. Although Williams had never coached or managed at any level of baseball, he seemed to light a spark under the once-moribund Senators. Williams kept them in contention for most of the 1969 season; their 86\u201376 record would be its only winning season in Washington, and indeed the only winning season the franchise would tally in its first 12 seasons.\n[[Image:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing out the first ball of the Senators' season in April 1969 with manager [[Ted Williams]] (left) and owner [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by Yankees manager [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nHowever, this would not last. Short had borrowed most of the $9.4 million he had paid for the team. Serving as his own general manager, Short was forced to make many questionable trades to service the debt and bring in much-needed revenue. As a result, the team rapidly fell back into the American League's cellar. Fans kept their distance from the Senators while the [[Baltimore Orioles]], {{convert|45|mi|km}} to the northeast, won four American League pennants and two World Series from 1966 through 1971. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} season, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (in comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and move the team elsewhere. At that season's end, Short dealt his best starting pitcher and the left side of his infield to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for erstwhile 30-game-winner [[Denny McLain]], who had spent most of the 1970 campaign suspended because of gambling allegations. The deal\u2014alleged by onetime Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield to have been made in order to secure the Tigers' vote in favor of the Senators' eventual move to Texas\u2014turned Detroit back into contenders, while McLain was a monumental bust, losing a league-worst 22 games.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer from [[Arlington, Texas]] mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to get a Major League team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to move his team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed by the other AL team owners.\n\nArlington's [[hole card]] was Turnpike Stadium, a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the AA [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to Major League specifications and also located in a natural bowl, meaning only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate Major League crowds.\n\nAfter Vandergriff offered a multimillion-dollar down payment, Short decided to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, (by a vote of 10 to{{nbsp}}2, the Orioles' [[Jerold Hoffberger]] and [[John Allyn]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] registering the dissenting votes), American League owners granted approval for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref>\n\nSenators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the [[1971 Washington Senators season|Senators]] leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] crew chief [[Jim Honochick]] forfeited the game to the [[1971 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]].<ref name=\"sensforfeit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra |last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|publisher=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}</ref>\n\nEven after the move, the Rangers retained the rights to the Senators name, which meant the current Washington team, who relocated from [[Montreal Expos|Montreal]] in {{mlby|2005}}, would revive another longtime name, the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]] (which was used by several NL teams in the 19th century, as well as the first AL Senators team from 1905 to 1956). However, the Rangers allowed the Nationals to use the curly W logo that originated with the expansion Senators.\n\n==First years in Texas: 1972\u20131984==\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Turnpike Stadium.JPG|thumb|right|260px|[[Turnpike Stadium]]]] -->\n\nDuring the off-season, improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as [[Arlington Stadium]] for [[1972 Major League Baseball season|the 1972 season]]. Meanwhile, ownership announced that the franchise would be renamed the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at [[1972 California Angels season|the California Angels]]. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels 5\u20131 for the club's first victory. After the season [[Ted Williams]] retired as manager; he had made no secret of his displeasure with the franchise's new location. [[Whitey Herzog]] was named the new manager, but he was replaced before the end of the 1973 season by [[Billy Martin]].\n\nIn [[1974 Major League Baseball season|1974]], the Rangers began to come into their own as a team. They finished the season second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[1974 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. [[1974 Texas Rangers season|The 1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded A.L. Rookie of the Year, Billy Martin was named Manager of the Year, [[Jeff Burroughs]] won American League MVP, and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the Comeback Player of the Year after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. However, after a 44\u201351 start in [[1975 Texas Rangers season|1975]], Martin was fired as the Rangers' manager and was replaced by [[Frank Lucchesi]].\n\nAfter excellent seasons between 1977\u201379, the Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in the first half of [[1981 Major League Baseball season|1981]]. But when Texas lost its last game before [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|the players' strike]] began, [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|the Oakland A's]] won the AL West in the first half by a half-game. After 1981, the Rangers would not post another winning record for five seasons. During this stretch, the Rangers made one of their most unpopular trades ever, sending multi-[[Gold Glove]] catcher and fan favorite [[Jim Sundberg]] to [[1984 Milwaukee Brewers season|the Milwaukee Brewers]] for future Brewers\u2019 manager [[Ned Yost]], who later managed [[history of the Kansas City Royals|the Kansas City Royals]] to the [[2015 World Series]] championship.\n\nThe Rangers faced attendance problems for a few years after moving to Texas, in part due to the team's inconsistent performance and in part due to the oppressive heat and humidity that can overtake the area in the summer. Until [[history of the Miami Marlins|the Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the Majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F|C|1|disp=or}} throughout the summer months. In part because of this, the Rangers began playing most of even their weekend games between May and September at night\u2014a tradition that continues to this day. They usually get a waiver from [[ESPN]] to play [[Sunday Night Baseball|Sunday night games]].\n\n==The Valentine, Ryan, and Bush years: 1985\u20131994==\n\n[[Bobby Valentine]], who would eventually become the Rangers' longest-serving manager at 1,186 games, became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of many stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished in 2nd place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division champion [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]]. The [[1986 Major League Baseball season|season]] marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in a yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the [[1989 Major League Baseball season|1989 season]] allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and sixth and seventh [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Coupled with powerful batters like [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], [[Bobby Witt]], [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], fans held high expectations for the Rangers. However, the team never posted a finish higher than second place and Valentine was relieved of his duties during the [[1992 Major League Baseball season|1992 season]].\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Rangers Ballpark in Arlington]]\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]], son of the [[President of the United States]], [[George H. W. Bush]]. After hearing that Chiles planned to sell the team, Bush headed a group of investors that bought the team for $89 million. While his own equity in the team was a small one (about ten percent), he was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment the following year.\n\nDuring his tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging [[Arlington Stadium]] with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991 on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]). The city, through the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority, also controversially authorized the seizure of {{convert|13|acre|m2}} of land through [[eminent domain]] for the Rangers future development. Landowners filed lawsuits over the acquisition and eventually won settlements of $22.2 million which the Rangers failed to pay.\n\nBush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States in 2000. Although Bush no longer has any ownership stake in the Rangers, he remains a fan of the team to this day and regularly attends the team's home games.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]], [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the A.L. West prior to the players' strike. The [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] prematurely ended what could have been the Rangers' first division championship when commissioner [[Bud Selig]] canceled the remainder of the season and the playoffs. Regardless of the unceremonious end to the [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 season]], Kenny Rogers pitched [[Kenny Rogers' perfect game|the 12th perfect game]] in Major League history on July 28.\n\n==First success: 1995\u20132000==\n\nThe year 1995 saw the beginnings of promise for the Rangers. With a brand new ballpark that hosted its first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] that year, [[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager. Oates and company promptly helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the [[1996 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], three games to one. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and Juan Gonz\u00e1lez was named A.L. MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters with [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Will Clark]], [[Mark McLemore]], [[Dean Palmer]], [[Rusty Greer]], [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], and [[Mickey Tettleton]] but continued to struggle with pitching\u2014a common stereotype of Rangers teams\u2014despite having [[Rick Helling]], and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive A.L. West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three world championships in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team would be the last playoff-bound team for over a decade, as the Rangers took a step backwards at the beginning of the new millennium. En route to a second straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28 games into the 2001 season. The Rangers finished the decade going 1\u20139 in the postseason, without a single home win.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250 million. Hicks also agreed to pay the $22.2 million awarded in settlements in relation to the 1991 eminent domain litigation concerning the Ballpark in Arlington.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W.

The move was considered controversial and was frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season. He was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]].\n\nThe 2003 season signified the fourth straight last-place finish, and after a post-season fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning A.L. MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infielder prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers. During the investigations into PED use earlier in the decade, several other former Rangers players were criticized for possible use of performance-enhancers. These included notable '90s sluggers Jose Canseco, Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, and Rafael Palmeiro.\n\n===2004===\n\n{{main|2004 Texas Rangers season}}\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]]]]\n\nPrior to the 2004 season, little hope was held out for the Rangers to improve on their losing ways. However, the Rangers battled with the [[2004 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] and [[2004 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] for first place in the A.L. West for much of the season. [[Mark Teixeira]], [[Alfonso Soriano]], [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano were named to the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2{{nbsp}}for{{nbsp}}3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Late in September, the Oakland A's visited Arlington for a three-game series. After taking the first two games of the series, the Rangers trailed 4\u20132, in the bottom of the ninth. A loss would have dropped them to four games behind the Athletics. A home run by Hank Blalock and a dramatic two-out, two-run double by [[David Dellucci]] (known amongst fans as the \"Dellucci Double\") gave the Rangers a 5\u20134 win, one of the most memorable in club history. It also allowed the Rangers to sweep the first-place Athletics and leave them just two games behind with ten to play. Unfortunately, the Rangers ended up losing six of the final ten games and another turnaround season came up short. The club finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n==2005\u20132009==\n===2005===\n\n{{main|2005 Texas Rangers season}}\n\nIn [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries, notwithstanding that the team swept an entire homestand for the first time in its history. [[Frank Francisco]] and [[Carlos Almanzar]], two key members of the bullpen, were sidelined for [[Tommy John surgery]]. [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], the team's ace pitcher, received a 20-game suspension from commissioner [[Bud Selig]] for attacking a cameraman at [[Ameriquest Field]] prior to a game. Management later placed opening day starter [[Ryan Drese]] on waivers, where he was claimed by the [[Washington Nationals]]. After Drese's release and Rogers' suspension, the Rangers' performance on the mound faltered, and a disastrous 1\u201312 August road trip all but sealed the squad's fate.\n\nOn October 4, 2005, the Rangers announced that [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] would step down as general manager and that [[Jon Daniels]] was being promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, would become the youngest general manager in Major League history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in the 2005\u201306 offseason. [[Alfonso Soriano]], who had often been mentioned in trade speculation, was finally dealt to the Nationals for outfielders [[Brad Wilkerson]] and [[Terrmel Sledge]]. The Rangers then began making moves to acquire pitching talent. The Rangers gained enigmatic starter [[Vicente Padilla]] from the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in exchange for [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]] and acquired [[San Diego Padres]] pitchers [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]] and [[Akinori Otsuka]] in exchange for [[Chris Young (pitcher)|Chris Young]], [[Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], and Sledge. Finally, they signed free agent starter [[Kevin Millwood]] to a five-year contract worth $60 million.\n\n===2006: Building the brand===\n\n{{main|2006 Texas Rangers season}}\n\nThe Rangers 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the West. Though the club showed strength in the early going, the team proved unable to keep pace with the surging [[Oakland Athletics]] in the second half and fell out of contention in September. To some extent the Rangers were the victims of bad luck, as their win-loss record was worse than their +51 run differential for the season would normally indicate. However, the element the club continued to lack was a solid pitching staff, whose combined ERA ranked 9th in the A.L. at the season's end. The Rangers were represented in the 2006 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star game]] by center fielder [[Gary Matthews, Jr.]] and shortstop [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], who was named the MVP for his game-winning two-run triple in the ninth inning.\n\nSignificant player moves in-season included a July 28 deal acquiring outfielders [[Carlos Lee]] and [[Nelson Cruz]] from the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in exchange for [[Kevin Mench]], [[Francisco Cordero]], and [[Laynce Nix]].\n\nOn October 4 after two attempts to replicate the success of the 2004 team, the Rangers dismissed [[Buck Showalter]] as manager with three years left on his contract. A month later, the team announced that [[Oakland Athletics]] third base coach [[Ron Washington]] had accepted their offer to manage the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061105&content_id=1733731&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|title=Rangers select Washington to manage|first=T.

The Rangers later added reliever [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]] and veteran outfielders [[Kenny Lofton]] and [[Sammy Sosa]] on short-term deals. In a sign that GM Jon Daniels was looking for results in 2007, the Rangers' top pitching prospect [[John Danks]] was traded to the [[Chicago White Sox]] along with reliever [[Nick Masset]] for 23-year-old starter [[Brandon McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061223&content_id=1767476&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|title=Rangers acquire McCarthy from Sox|first=T.

All three pitchers would eventually reach the majors, with varying degrees of success, while McCarthy's career became marred by injury.\n\n[[File:Rangers Ball Park in Arlington Home Plate.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Home Plate Entrance at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington]]\n\nThe Rangers previously negotiated a 30-year, $75 million stadium naming rights agreement with [[Ameriquest Mortgage Company]] in 2004, renaming the Ballpark \"Ameriquest Field\". Under the Ameriquest moniker, the Ballpark featured a replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] in the stands above the Diamond Club (representing Ameriquest's logo) that rang after home runs. In 2007, though, the Rangers announced the termination of the agreement with Ameriquest, and changed the name to [[Rangers Ballpark in Arlington]]. Club president Jeff Cogen cited that the team was more concerned about getting their name back on the ballpark than Ameriquest's public financial troubles. \"It's all about the brand\", Cogen said. The Rangers lost a reported $2.5 million per year from the lack of naming rights but regained advertising space given over to Ameriquest in the naming rights deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070319&content_id=1850374&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|title=It's now Rangers Ballpark in Arlington|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|date=2007-03-19|accessdate=2007-05-30|publisher=MLB.com}}</ref> Regardless of Cogen's comments, Ameriquest dissolved within months after the naming rights were terminated, and the company ended most business operations in September 2007.\n\n===2007\u20132009: Financial troubles===\n\n{{Wikinews|MLB: Rangers score 30 runs against Orioles in first game of doubleheader}}\n\nThe Rangers struggled offensively early in the season, despite playing in a notoriously hitter-friendly park. On June 20, [[Sammy Sosa]] hit his 600th career home run against the Chicago Cubs at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. [[Hank Blalock]], the starting 3rd baseman who had been enjoying a good season, was placed on the 60-day disabled list on May 19 due to [[thoracic outlet syndrome]], and [[Mark Teixeira]] followed him onto the disabled list on June{{nbsp}}9 (for the first time in his career) with a strained left [[quadriceps]] muscle. With a record of 46\u201359 at the July 31 trade deadline, the team traded [[Mark Teixeira]] and [[Ron Mahay]] to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in a deal that would eventually bring five prospects to the Rangers organization, including four of Atlanta's top prospects [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], [[Elvis Andrus]], [[Matt Harrison (pitcher)|Matt Harrison]], and [[Neftal\u00ed Feliz]]. The team also traded closer [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for left-hander [[Kason Gabbard]] and Minor League outfielders [[David Murphy (baseball)|David Murphy]] and [[Engel Beltre]]. These moves were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. The objective of Daniels' plan was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe 2007 season remains notable in the minds of baseball fans for two inexplicable oddities. On August 19 at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]], the [[Minnesota Twins]] logged 19 strikeouts against the Rangers, one short of the Major League record. Three days later, the 22nd, in the first game of a doubleheader at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], the Rangers' bats came alive with a modern record for runs by one team, defeating the [[Baltimore Orioles]] 30\u20133.

A new expansion team was formed with the same name and stayed in the same town until its last season in 1971. The next year, the franchise renamed itself as the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and started its first season in [[Arlington, Texas]], as part of the [[American League West Division]], where it remains today.\n\n==Washington Senators: 1961\u20131971==\n\nWhen the original Washington Senators moved to [[Minnesota]] in 1960 as the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]], Major League Baseball decided to expand a year earlier than planned to stave off threats of losing its [[Federal Baseball Club v. National League|exemption]] from the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. At the winter meetings that year, it awarded a new team to Los Angeles ([[Los Angeles Angels|the Angels]]) as well as a new team in the nation's capital. This new team adopted the old Senators name, but was (and still is) considered an expansion team since the Twins retained the old Senators' records and history. The Senators and Angels began to fill their rosters with American League players in an [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft|expansion draft]]. The team played the {{MLBy|1961}} season at old [[Griffith Stadium]] before moving to District of Columbia Stadium (now the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]]). {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nFor most of their existence, the new Senators were the definition of futility, losing an average of 90 games a season. The team's struggles led to a twist on a joke about the old Senators\u2014\"Washington: first in war, first in peace and ''still'' last in the American League.\" [[Frank Howard (baseball)|Frank Howard]], known for his towering home runs, was the team's most accomplished player, winning two home run titles.\n\nOwnership changed hands several times during the franchise's stay in Washington and was often plagued by poor decision-making and planning. Owner [[Elwood Richard Quesada|Pete Queseda]] once wondered why he needed to pay players who didn't belong in the majors and later agreed to a ten-year lease at D.C. Stadium\u2014a move that would come back to haunt the Senators. In {{MLBy|1963}}, Quesada sold his stake in the club and resigned. Washington stockbrokers James Johnson and [[James Lemon]] owned the team briefly, suffering massive financial losses. Johnson died in {{MLBy|1967}} and Lemon sold the team a year later to hotel and trucking executive [[Bob Short]], who outbid a group headed by [[Bob Hope]]. Short named himself general manager and hired [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ted Williams]] as manager. Although Williams had never coached or managed at any level of baseball, he seemed to light a spark under the once-moribund Senators. Williams kept them in contention for most of the 1969 season; their 86\u201376 record would be its only winning season in Washington, and indeed the only winning season the franchise would tally in its first 12 seasons.\n[[Image:Richard Nixon throwing out opening pitch at Senators game, 1969.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Richard Nixon]] throwing out the first ball of the Senators' season in April 1969 with manager [[Ted Williams]] (left) and owner [[Bob Short]] (right, partially obscured by Yankees manager [[Ralph Houk]])]]\n\nHowever, this would not last. Short had borrowed most of the $9.4 million he had paid for the team. Serving as his own general manager, Short was forced to make many questionable trades to service the debt and bring in much-needed revenue. As a result, the team rapidly fell back into the American League's cellar. Fans kept their distance from the Senators while the [[Baltimore Orioles]], {{convert|45|mi|km}} to the northeast, won four American League pennants and two World Series from 1966 through 1971. By the end of the {{MLBy|1970}} season, Short had issued an ultimatum: unless someone was willing to buy the Senators for $12 million (in comparison, the [[New York Yankees]] were sold in 1973 for $8.8 million), he would not renew the stadium lease and move the team elsewhere. At that season's end, Short dealt his best starting pitcher and the left side of his infield to the [[Detroit Tigers]] for erstwhile 30-game-winner [[Denny McLain]], who had spent most of the 1970 campaign suspended because of gambling allegations. The deal\u2014alleged by onetime Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield to have been made in order to secure the Tigers' vote in favor of the Senators' eventual move to Texas\u2014turned Detroit back into contenders, while McLain was a monumental bust, losing a league-worst 22 games.\n\nShort was especially receptive to an offer from [[Arlington, Texas]] mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]], who had been trying to get a Major League team to play in the Metroplex for over a decade. Years earlier, [[Charles O. Finley]], the owner of the [[Kansas City Athletics]], sought to move his team to Dallas, but the idea was rebuffed by the other AL team owners.\n\nArlington's [[hole card]] was Turnpike Stadium, a 10,000-seat park which had been built in {{MLBy|1965}} to house the AA [[Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs]] of the [[Texas League]]. However, it had been built to Major League specifications and also located in a natural bowl, meaning only minor excavations would be necessary to expand the park to accommodate Major League crowds.\n\nAfter Vandergriff offered a multimillion-dollar down payment, Short decided to make the move to Arlington. On September 21, 1971, (by a vote of 10 to{{nbsp}}2, the Orioles' [[Jerold Hoffberger]] and [[John Allyn]] of the [[Chicago White Sox]] registering the dissenting votes), American League owners granted approval for the {{MLBy|1972}} season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Minot, Jr.|first=George|title=Short Takes Senators to Texas|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 22, 1971}}</ref>\n\nSenators fans were livid. Enmity came to a head at the club's last game in Washington. Thousands of fans simply walked in without paying after the security guards left early, swelling the paid attendance of 14,460 to around 25,000, while fans unfurled a banner reading \"SHORT STINKS\". With the [[1971 Washington Senators season|Senators]] leading 7\u20135 and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, several hundred youths stormed the field, raiding it for souvenirs. One man grabbed [[first base]] and ran off with it. With no security in sight and only three bases, [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] crew chief [[Jim Honochick]] forfeited the game to the [[1971 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]].<ref name=\"sensforfeit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/history/rfk/articles/baseball.htm|last=McPherson|first=Myra |last2=Huth|first2=Tom|title=Rowdy Fans Hand Senators Final Loss|publisher=The Washington Post|date=October 1, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last2=Shannon|first2=Bill|last=Kalinsky|first=George|title=The Ballparks|location=New York|publisher=Hawthorn Books, Inc|year=1975|authorlink=George Kalinsky}}</ref>\n\nEven after the move, the Rangers retained the rights to the Senators name, which meant the current Washington team, who relocated from [[Montreal Expos|Montreal]] in {{mlby|2005}}, would revive another longtime name, the [[Washington Nationals|Nationals]] (which was used by several NL teams in the 19th century, as well as the first AL Senators team from 1905 to 1956). However, the Rangers allowed the Nationals to use the curly W logo that originated with the expansion Senators.\n\n==First years in Texas: 1972\u20131984==\n\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Turnpike Stadium.JPG|thumb|right|260px|[[Turnpike Stadium]]]] -->\n\nDuring the off-season, improvements were made to Turnpike Stadium, which reopened as [[Arlington Stadium]] for [[1972 Major League Baseball season|the 1972 season]]. Meanwhile, ownership announced that the franchise would be renamed the Texas Rangers. The team played its first game on April 15, 1972, a 1\u20130 loss at [[1972 California Angels season|the California Angels]]. The next day, the Rangers defeated the Angels 5\u20131 for the club's first victory. After the season [[Ted Williams]] retired as manager; he had made no secret of his displeasure with the franchise's new location. [[Whitey Herzog]] was named the new manager, but he was replaced before the end of the 1973 season by [[Billy Martin]].\n\nIn [[1974 Major League Baseball season|1974]], the Rangers began to come into their own as a team. They finished the season second in the American League West with an 84\u201376 record, behind the eventual [[World Series]] champion [[1974 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. [[1974 Texas Rangers season|The 1974 Rangers]] are still the only MLB team to finish above .500 after two consecutive 100-loss seasons. [[Mike Hargrove]] was awarded A.L. Rookie of the Year, Billy Martin was named Manager of the Year, [[Jeff Burroughs]] won American League MVP, and [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was named the Comeback Player of the Year after winning 25 games, a club record to this day. However, after a 44\u201351 start in [[1975 Texas Rangers season|1975]], Martin was fired as the Rangers' manager and was replaced by [[Frank Lucchesi]].\n\nAfter excellent seasons between 1977\u201379, the Rangers came very close to clinching a playoff spot in the first half of [[1981 Major League Baseball season|1981]]. But when Texas lost its last game before [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|the players' strike]] began, [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|the Oakland A's]] won the AL West in the first half by a half-game. After 1981, the Rangers would not post another winning record for five seasons. During this stretch, the Rangers made one of their most unpopular trades ever, sending multi-[[Gold Glove]] catcher and fan favorite [[Jim Sundberg]] to [[1984 Milwaukee Brewers season|the Milwaukee Brewers]] for future Brewers\u2019 manager [[Ned Yost]], who later managed [[history of the Kansas City Royals|the Kansas City Royals]] to the [[2015 World Series]] championship.\n\nThe Rangers faced attendance problems for a few years after moving to Texas, in part due to the team's inconsistent performance and in part due to the oppressive heat and humidity that can overtake the area in the summer. Until [[history of the Miami Marlins|the Florida Marlins]] arrived in 1993, Arlington Stadium was often the hottest stadium in the Majors, with temperatures frequently topping {{convert|100|F|C|1|disp=or}} throughout the summer months. In part because of this, the Rangers began playing most of even their weekend games between May and September at night\u2014a tradition that continues to this day. They usually get a waiver from [[ESPN]] to play [[Sunday Night Baseball|Sunday night games]].\n\n==The Valentine, Ryan, and Bush years: 1985\u20131994==\n\n[[Bobby Valentine]], who would eventually become the Rangers' longest-serving manager at 1,186 games, became steward over an influx of talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A winning season in 1986 was a shock to pundits and fans alike as the Rangers remained in the race for the American League pennant for the entire season. With a team consisting of many stellar young rookies such as [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Pete Incaviglia]], [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], [[Bobby Witt]], and [[Edwin Correa]], the Rangers finished in 2nd place with an 87\u201375 record, just five games behind the division champion [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]]. The [[1986 Major League Baseball season|season]] marked a dramatic 25-win improvement over the 1985 season, which resulted in a yet another last-place finish in the West. The signing of 41-year-old star pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]] prior to the [[1989 Major League Baseball season|1989 season]] allowed Ryan to reach his 5,000th [[strikeout]], 300th [[Win (baseball)|win]], and sixth and seventh [[no-hitter]]s with the Rangers. Coupled with powerful batters like [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Rub\u00e9n Sierra]], [[Julio Franco]], and [[Rafael Palmeiro]] and a pitching staff that also included [[Charlie Hough]], [[Bobby Witt]], [[Kevin Brown (right-handed pitcher)|Kevin Brown]], and [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], fans held high expectations for the Rangers. However, the team never posted a finish higher than second place and Valentine was relieved of his duties during the [[1992 Major League Baseball season|1992 season]].\n[[File:Rangersballparkinarlington.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Rangers Ballpark in Arlington]]\n\nIn April 1989, Rangers owner and oil tycoon [[Eddie Chiles]], sold the team to an investment group headed by [[George W. Bush]], son of the [[President of the United States]], [[George H. W. Bush]]. After hearing that Chiles planned to sell the team, Bush headed a group of investors that bought the team for $89 million. While his own equity in the team was a small one (about ten percent), he was named Managing General Partner of the new ownership group. He increased his investment the following year.\n\nDuring his tenure, the Rangers and the City of Arlington decided to replace the aging [[Arlington Stadium]] with a new publicly funded stadium, at a cost of $193 million, financed by Arlington residents, through a sales tax increase. Ground was broken on October 30, 1991 on what would become The Ballpark in Arlington (now named [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]). The city, through the Arlington Sports Facilities Development Authority, also controversially authorized the seizure of {{convert|13|acre|m2}} of land through [[eminent domain]] for the Rangers future development. Landowners filed lawsuits over the acquisition and eventually won settlements of $22.2 million which the Rangers failed to pay.\n\nBush left his position with the Rangers when he was elected [[Governor of Texas]] in 1994, and was elected the 43rd President of the United States in 2000. Although Bush no longer has any ownership stake in the Rangers, he remains a fan of the team to this day and regularly attends the team's home games.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]], [[Kevin Kennedy (baseball)|Kevin Kennedy]] took over managerial duties, presiding over the team for two seasons, keeping the 1993 Rangers in the hunt for a playoff berth into mid-September. Kennedy was let go in 1994, although the team led the A.L. West prior to the players' strike. The [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] prematurely ended what could have been the Rangers' first division championship when commissioner [[Bud Selig]] canceled the remainder of the season and the playoffs. Regardless of the unceremonious end to the [[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994 season]], Kenny Rogers pitched [[Kenny Rogers' perfect game|the 12th perfect game]] in Major League history on July 28.\n\n==First success: 1995\u20132000==\n\nThe year 1995 saw the beginnings of promise for the Rangers. With a brand new ballpark that hosted its first [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] that year, [[Johnny Oates]] was hired as the Rangers' manager. Oates and company promptly helped to bring home the 1996 AL Western Division championship, the first division championship in franchise history. The first playoff series, 24 years after the franchise came to Texas, saw the Rangers lose to the [[1996 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], three games to one. Oates was named AL Manager of the Year and Juan Gonz\u00e1lez was named A.L. MVP. The team featured a powerful lineup of hitters with [[Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Will Clark]], [[Mark McLemore]], [[Dean Palmer]], [[Rusty Greer]], [[Juan Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Juan Gonz\u00e1lez]], and [[Mickey Tettleton]] but continued to struggle with pitching\u2014a common stereotype of Rangers teams\u2014despite having [[Rick Helling]], and [[Aaron Sele]] on their roster. Oates led the team to consecutive A.L. West championships in 1998 and 1999. Neither of Oates' last two playoff teams could win a single game, losing all six in back-to-back sweeps at the hands of the Yankees, a team that won three world championships in the 1990s after defeating Rangers teams in the first round. The 1999 team would be the last playoff-bound team for over a decade, as the Rangers took a step backwards at the beginning of the new millennium. En route to a second straight last-place finish, Oates resigned his position 28 games into the 2001 season. The Rangers finished the decade going 1\u20139 in the postseason, without a single home win.\n\nIn 1998, venture capital billionaire [[Tom Hicks]] bought the team for $250 million. Hicks also agreed to pay the $22.2 million awarded in settlements in relation to the 1991 eminent domain litigation concerning the Ballpark in Arlington.<ref name=test>[http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/bush/timeline.html George W.

The move was considered controversial and was frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought owner Tom Hicks was placing too much emphasis on one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially for a team that lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle and manager [[Jerry Narron]] was fired following the 2002 season. He was replaced by seasoned manager [[Buck Showalter]].\n\nThe 2003 season signified the fourth straight last-place finish, and after a post-season fallout between Rodriguez and club management, the reigning A.L. MVP and newly appointed Rangers captain was traded to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and infielder prospect [[Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias (baseball)|Joaquin Arias]].\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers. During the investigations into PED use earlier in the decade, several other former Rangers players were criticized for possible use of performance-enhancers. These included notable '90s sluggers Jose Canseco, Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, and Rafael Palmeiro.\n\n===2004===\n\n{{main|2004 Texas Rangers season}}\n[[File:Michael Young on April 25, 2009.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]]]]\n\nPrior to the 2004 season, little hope was held out for the Rangers to improve on their losing ways. However, the Rangers battled with the [[2004 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] and [[2004 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] for first place in the A.L. West for much of the season. [[Mark Teixeira]], [[Alfonso Soriano]], [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], and [[Hank Blalock]] became some of the best-hitting infielders in the league, with Young, Blalock, and Soriano were named to the [[2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2004 All-Star Game]]. Soriano was named the All-Star MVP after going 2{{nbsp}}for{{nbsp}}3 with a three-run [[home run]]. Late in September, the Oakland A's visited Arlington for a three-game series. After taking the first two games of the series, the Rangers trailed 4\u20132, in the bottom of the ninth. A loss would have dropped them to four games behind the Athletics. A home run by Hank Blalock and a dramatic two-out, two-run double by [[David Dellucci]] (known amongst fans as the \"Dellucci Double\") gave the Rangers a 5\u20134 win, one of the most memorable in club history. It also allowed the Rangers to sweep the first-place Athletics and leave them just two games behind with ten to play. Unfortunately, the Rangers ended up losing six of the final ten games and another turnaround season came up short. The club finished in third place behind the Angels and A's, a mere three games out of first place.\n\n==2005\u20132009==\n===2005===\n\n{{main|2005 Texas Rangers season}}\n\nIn [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], the Rangers again struggled to find consistency amid controversy and injuries, notwithstanding that the team swept an entire homestand for the first time in its history. [[Frank Francisco]] and [[Carlos Almanzar]], two key members of the bullpen, were sidelined for [[Tommy John surgery]]. [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]], the team's ace pitcher, received a 20-game suspension from commissioner [[Bud Selig]] for attacking a cameraman at [[Ameriquest Field]] prior to a game. Management later placed opening day starter [[Ryan Drese]] on waivers, where he was claimed by the [[Washington Nationals]]. After Drese's release and Rogers' suspension, the Rangers' performance on the mound faltered, and a disastrous 1\u201312 August road trip all but sealed the squad's fate.\n\nOn October 4, 2005, the Rangers announced that [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] would step down as general manager and that [[Jon Daniels]] was being promoted from assistant general manager to replace him. Daniels, at 28 years and one month, would become the youngest general manager in Major League history.\n\nDaniels and the Rangers front office were very active in the 2005\u201306 offseason. [[Alfonso Soriano]], who had often been mentioned in trade speculation, was finally dealt to the Nationals for outfielders [[Brad Wilkerson]] and [[Terrmel Sledge]]. The Rangers then began making moves to acquire pitching talent. The Rangers gained enigmatic starter [[Vicente Padilla]] from the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in exchange for [[Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez (baseball)|Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez]] and acquired [[San Diego Padres]] pitchers [[Adam Eaton (pitcher)|Adam Eaton]] and [[Akinori Otsuka]] in exchange for [[Chris Young (pitcher)|Chris Young]], [[Adri\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez]], and Sledge. Finally, they signed free agent starter [[Kevin Millwood]] to a five-year contract worth $60 million.\n\n===2006: Building the brand===\n\n{{main|2006 Texas Rangers season}}\n\nThe Rangers 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the West. Though the club showed strength in the early going, the team proved unable to keep pace with the surging [[Oakland Athletics]] in the second half and fell out of contention in September. To some extent the Rangers were the victims of bad luck, as their win-loss record was worse than their +51 run differential for the season would normally indicate. However, the element the club continued to lack was a solid pitching staff, whose combined ERA ranked 9th in the A.L. at the season's end. The Rangers were represented in the 2006 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star game]] by center fielder [[Gary Matthews, Jr.]] and shortstop [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], who was named the MVP for his game-winning two-run triple in the ninth inning.\n\nSignificant player moves in-season included a July 28 deal acquiring outfielders [[Carlos Lee]] and [[Nelson Cruz]] from the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in exchange for [[Kevin Mench]], [[Francisco Cordero]], and [[Laynce Nix]].\n\nOn October 4 after two attempts to replicate the success of the 2004 team, the Rangers dismissed [[Buck Showalter]] as manager with three years left on his contract.

All three pitchers would eventually reach the majors, with varying degrees of success, while McCarthy's career became marred by injury.\n\n[[File:Rangers Ball Park in Arlington Home Plate.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Home Plate Entrance at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington]]\n\nThe Rangers previously negotiated a 30-year, $75 million stadium naming rights agreement with [[Ameriquest Mortgage Company]] in 2004, renaming the Ballpark \"Ameriquest Field\". Under the Ameriquest moniker, the Ballpark featured a replica of the [[Liberty Bell]] in the stands above the Diamond Club (representing Ameriquest's logo) that rang after home runs. In 2007, though, the Rangers announced the termination of the agreement with Ameriquest, and changed the name to [[Rangers Ballpark in Arlington]]. Club president Jeff Cogen cited that the team was more concerned about getting their name back on the ballpark than Ameriquest's public financial troubles. \"It's all about the brand\", Cogen said. The Rangers lost a reported $2.5 million per year from the lack of naming rights but regained advertising space given over to Ameriquest in the naming rights deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070319&content_id=1850374&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex|title=It's now Rangers Ballpark in Arlington|first=T.R.|last=Sullivan|date=2007-03-19|accessdate=2007-05-30|publisher=MLB.com}}</ref> Regardless of Cogen's comments, Ameriquest dissolved within months after the naming rights were terminated, and the company ended most business operations in September 2007.\n\n===2007\u20132009: Financial troubles===\n\n{{Wikinews|MLB: Rangers score 30 runs against Orioles in first game of doubleheader}}\n\nThe Rangers struggled offensively early in the season, despite playing in a notoriously hitter-friendly park. On June 20, [[Sammy Sosa]] hit his 600th career home run against the Chicago Cubs at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington. [[Hank Blalock]], the starting 3rd baseman who had been enjoying a good season, was placed on the 60-day disabled list on May 19 due to [[thoracic outlet syndrome]], and [[Mark Teixeira]] followed him onto the disabled list on June{{nbsp}}9 (for the first time in his career) with a strained left [[quadriceps]] muscle. With a record of 46\u201359 at the July 31 trade deadline, the team traded [[Mark Teixeira]] and [[Ron Mahay]] to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in a deal that would eventually bring five prospects to the Rangers organization, including four of Atlanta's top prospects [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], [[Elvis Andrus]], [[Matt Harrison (pitcher)|Matt Harrison]], and [[Neftal\u00ed Feliz]]. The team also traded closer [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for left-hander [[Kason Gabbard]] and Minor League outfielders [[David Murphy (baseball)|David Murphy]] and [[Engel Beltre]]. These moves were the beginnings of a rebuilding project headed by Jon Daniels with a focus on the acquisition and development of young players. In the coming years, more club resources would be dedicated to improving the quality of the farm system and scouting departments, most notably in Latin America and the Far East. The objective of Daniels' plan was to field a legitimately competitive team by the 2010 season.\n\nThe 2007 season remains notable in the minds of baseball fans for two inexplicable oddities. On August 19 at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]], the [[Minnesota Twins]] logged 19 strikeouts against the Rangers, one short of the Major League record. Three days later, the 22nd, in the first game of a doubleheader at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], the Rangers' bats came alive with a modern record for runs by one team, defeating the [[Baltimore Orioles]] 30\u20133. Their 27-run margin of victory is also a modern-day MLB record. [[Wes Littleton]] gained probably the easiest save in Major League history\u2014entering the game in the bottom of the seventh, with his team already ahead 14\u20133, he pitched three innings finishing the game, and gave up just two hits and a walk.\n\nThe Rangers began the 2008 season red hot, headlined by newcomer [[Josh Hamilton]] who looked to be a threat to win the [[Triple Crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]], before fading off as the season wore on. During the All-Star festivities at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], Hamilton crushed a first round home run record in the 2008 [[Home Run Derby]] with 28. Hamilton hit another four in the second round and three during the final round, for a total of 35 home runs, but lost to the Twins' [[Justin Morneau]]. Four Rangers played in the [[All Star Game]]: [[Josh Hamilton]], [[Ian Kinsler]], [[Milton Bradley (baseball)|Milton Bradley]], and [[Michael Young (baseball)|Michael Young]], who would repeat his 2006 All-Star Game feat by driving in the winning run via a sac fly.\n\nThe Rangers would finish the season with yet another sub-.500 record (79\u201383), yet ended the season second in the West, the club's best finish since 1999.

The Rangers finished the season at 87\u201375, their first winning season since 2004 and good enough for second place in the A.L. West.

On October 15, they went back to the World Series, beating the Detroit Tigers 15\u20135 in Game{{nbsp}}6 of the ALCS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_10_15_detmlb_texmlb_1&mode=recap_home&c_id=tex |title=MLB.com Gameday &#124; texasrangers.com: Gameday |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref> The series featured Nelson Cruz hitting six home runs, the most home runs by one player in a playoff series in MLB history. In game two, Cruz also became the first player in postseason history to win a game with a walk-off grand slam as the Rangers defeated the Tigers 7\u20133 in 11 innings. However, they would proceed to lose the [[2011 World Series|World Series]] in seven games.\n\n=====2012: Staff changes=====\n\n{{Main|2012 Texas Rangers season}}\n\nThe Rangers did a lot of retooling in the 2011\u20132012 off season. Staff ace [[C. J. Wilson]] left the team to join the division rival [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. The Angels also upgraded their offense with the signing of [[Albert Pujols]], causing more parity within the division. The Rangers responded by signing [[Yu Darvish]] of the [[Nippon Ham Fighters]] of the [[Central League]] in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] of Japan. The team also converted closer [[Neftal\u00ed Feliz]] to a starting pitcher upon signing [[Joe Nathan]] to take over closing duties in the bullpen. The Rangers would not repeat as AL West champions, but would qualify for the postseason as the top wild card team in the AL. They would lose the wild game to the Orioles.\n\n=====2013-14: Missed postseasons=====\n\n{{Main|2013 Texas Rangers season|2014 Texas Rangers season}}\n\nIn 2013, the Rangers finished 91\u201371, which tied them with Tampa Bay for the final wild card position. The Rangers would lose the tie-breaker game to the Rays 5\u20132. In 2014, the Rangers slumped to their first losing season since 2008. Late in the season, manager Ron Washington resigned, citing personal reasons.\n\n=====2015-16: Back-to-back AL West champions=====\n\n{{Main|2015 Texas Rangers season|2015 American League Division Series|2016 Texas Rangers season|2016 American League Division Series}}\n\nIn 2015, under new manager [[Jeff Banister]], the Rangers overcame a slow start to win the AL West. The club was aided by the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Cole Hamels. On the last day of the regular season, Hamels would pitch a complete game in a victory over the Angels that clinched the division for the Rangers. In the Division Series against the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], the Rangers would win the first two games in Toronto, but then lose three straight to end their season.\n\nIn 2016, the Rangers repeated as AL West champions with the best record in the AL. They would face the Blue Jays again in the ALDS. This time, the Blue Jays swept the series.\n\n=====2017: Missed postseason=====\n\n{{Main|2017 Texas Rangers season}}\n\nWith a returning top [[bullpen]] and new recruits,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=A rival scout sizes up Texas|url=|journal=Sports Illustrated|volume=126|pages=90|via=EBSCO}}</ref> the Rangers had hopes of postseason success.

Eventing consisted of a dressage test, a cross-country test, and a jumping test.\n\nThe dressage test was a 12 section test.

p. 899</ref> Of the 46 pairs remaining by that point in the competition, 28 had a fall of the horse or the rider at that obstacle.<ref name=OR899/> This included one of the equine fatalities, the American horse Slippery Slim.<ref name=OR901>Official Report, p. 901</ref> The [[International Equestrian Federation]] subsequently temporarily banned such jumps.<ref name=OR900>Official Report, p. 900</ref>\n\n==Competition format==\nThe team and individual eventing competitions used the same scores. Eventing consisted of a dressage test, a cross-country test, and a jumping test.\n\nThe dressage test was a 12 section test. The maximum time allotted was 13 minutes; points were deducted over that time. The maximum score was 400 points, though the results typically listed the difference between the score and that maximum (that is, a score of 250 would be listed as a \"loss of points\" of 150).<ref name=OR902>Official Report, p. 902</ref>\n\nThe 36 km cross-country test had five phases: (1) a 7 km road stretch; (2) a 4 km, 12 obstacle steeplechase; (3) a 15 km road stretch; (4) an 8 km, 35 obstacle cross-country course; and (5) a 2 km road stretch.<ref name=OR894>Official Report, p. 894</ref> Points could be lost for refusals or falls at the obstacles in the second an fourth phases, with three refusals at the same obstacle resulting in elimination.<ref name=OR903>Official Report, p. 903</ref> Points could also be lost if maximum time limits for each phase were exceeded; however, points could be gained instead if the pair finished the obstacle phases under the allotted time.<ref name=OR903/>\n\nThe jumping test featured 12 obstacles and had a time limit of 155 seconds. Points were lost for faults (including elimination for the third refusal on the course) and for exceeding the time limit.<ref name=OR903/>\n\n==Results==\n\n===Standings after dressage===\n\n{|

During its service, the battalion made a grueling march of nearly 2,100 miles from [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]], to [[San Diego, California]].\n\nThe battalion\u2019s march and service supported the eventual [[Mexican Cession|cession]] of much of the American Southwest from Mexico to the United States, especially the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of 1853 of southern Arizona and New Mexico. The march also opened a southern wagon route to California. Veterans of the battalion played significant roles in America's westward expansion in California, Utah, Arizona and other parts of the [[Western United States|West]].\n\n==Enlistment==\nAt the time they enlisted, members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] were seeking U.S. government aid for their migration west to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Salt Lake Valley]], despite having their previous petitions for redress of grievances denied. Under continued religious persecution, they had fled [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], on February 4, 1846 across the Mississippi River. They camped among the [[Potawatomi]] Indians near present-day [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]].\n\n[[Brigham Young]], the [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], sent Elder [[Jesse C. Little]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], to seek assistance from the federal government for the Mormon Pioneers fleeing from the Illinois mobs. Little arrived in Washington D.C. on May 21, 1846, only eight days after Congress had declared war on Mexico.<ref name=UHE/> Pennsylvania Army officer and attorney [[Thomas L. Kane]] offered the Mormons his advice and assistance. Politically well connected through his jurist father, Kane provided letters of recommendation and joined Little in Washington, D.C. The two called on the secretary of state, secretary of war, and President [[James K. Polk]]. After several interviews in early June 1846, President Polk agreed to Little's offer{{clarify|date=February 2014}} if \"a few hundred\" men enlisted. On June 2, 1846, President Polk wrote in his diary: \"Col. [Stephen W.] Kearny was ... authorized to receive into service as volunteers a few hundred of the Mormons who are now on their way to California, with a view to conciliate them, attach them to our country, and prevent them from taking part against us.\"<ref>{{citation|authorlink=James K.

After carrying dispatches relating to the land agreements and battalion criteria to [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kane sought out Little in the Mormon encampments on the Missouri. On July 17, 1846, he held a meeting with church leaders and Captain Allen.\n\nBrigham Young had planned on [[Mormon pioneers|moving the Mormons west]] that summer, but circumstances were against his plan. He saw several possible advantages to the Saints in the proposed federal service. Their enlistment would be a public relations victory for the church, demonstrating additional evidence of its loyalty to the United States.<ref name=mclynn/> As the men were given a uniform allowance at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., of US$42 each, paid in advance, for their one-year enlistment and as they were allowed to wear their civilian clothing for the march, the bulk of those funds were immediately donated to a general Church fund. These funds were used to purchase wagons, teams, and other necessities for the American exodus (Actual wages paid over the next year to the Mormon Battalion totaled nearly $30,000).<ref name=\"Pioneer Trail Map: Council Bluffs\">{{citation |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek|title=The Pioneer Story: Pioneer Trail Map|work=churchofjesuschrist.org }}</ref> Having been forced to leave farms and homes in Nauvoo, the Latter-day Saints were going to spend the winter on the banks of the Missouri River. Raising a group of able-bodied men would be difficult. Many men had already scattered to outlying areas where they sought jobs with wages to help support the group. Young wrote a letter to the Saints living in Garden Grove, in which he justified the call-up and asked for their help:\n\n{{quote|The President wants to do us good and secure our confidence. The outfit of this five hundred men costs us nothing, and their pay will be sufficient to take their families over the mountains.

His units included two regiments of Missouri volunteers, a regiment of New York volunteers who traveled by ships to California to meet him there, artillery and infantry battalions, Kearny's own [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st US Dragoons]], and the battalion of Mormons. For years afterward, some Mormons viewed the Mormon Battalion as an unjust imposition and as an act of persecution by the United States.{{Harv|Carrington|1857|p=5}}\n\n==Journey begins==\n[[File:Mormon_Battalion_Routes_1846-47_HENSON.jpg|thumb|Revised map of Mormon Battalion routes]]\nThe battalion arrived at [[Fort Leavenworth]] on August 1.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter Twenty-Six: Pioneers to the West|chapterurl=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/chapter-twenty-six?lang=eng|title= Church History in the Fulness of Times Student Manual: Religion 341-43|year=2003|publisher=[[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]], [[Church Educational System]], LDS Church|page=323}}</ref> For the next two weeks, they drew their pay, received their equipment ([[Model 1816 Musket|Model 1816]] [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock]] [[musket]]s and a few [[Harper's Ferry Model 1803 Rifle]]s), and were more formally organized into a combat battalion. The volunteers took the army's uniform allowance in cash per regulations. To assure the main body of the group benefited from the men's wages, Young sent Orson Pratt to see that the men handed over the pay they had committed to contribute. Young used this and the wages they earned later to buy supplies for the main group at wholesale prices in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He wrote to the enlistees that the money was a \"peculiar manifestation of the kind providence of our Heavenly Father at this time.\"<ref name=Roberts1919 /> There was little time for training and instilling discipline. Newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel James Allen became ill but ordered the battalion forward along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] to overtake Kearny's Army of the West. On August 23, Allen died and was the first officer buried in what became [[Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery|Fort Leavenworth National Military Cemetery]].\n\nCaptain [[Jefferson Hunt]], commanding A Company, was the acting commander until word reached [[Council Grove, Kansas]], that Allen had died. A few days later Lieutenant [[Andrew Jackson Smith]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] Class of 1838, arrived and was given temporary command of the battalion with the Mormons' consent. For the next several weeks, the Mormon soldiers came to hate \"AJ\" Smith and the assistant surgeon, Dr. George B. Sanderson, for their treatment of the men, and the long marches suffered across the dry plains of Kansas and New Mexico. The Mormon men were not accustomed to the austere military standards of the day nor to the medical treatments imposed by Dr. Sanderson, including the use of feeding mercury to the sick, which were standard for the time. Because the church leaders had counseled the battalion members to avoid military medical treatment, they challenged the doctor's authority and unrest arose among the men. Smith and Sanderson continued to hold the Mormon Battalion to ordinary standards of discipline, and tensions continued.\n\n===Cooke assumes command===\n[[File:Philip St. George Cooke.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Philip St. George Cooke]]]]\nArriving in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in October, General Kearny had dispatched Captain (brevet promotion to Lieutenant Colonel) [[Philip St. George Cooke]], West Point class of 1827, to assume command of the battalion. His assignment was to march them to California and to build a wagon road along the way. In Santa Fe 91 sick men and all but a few of the women and children were sent to [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], in present-day [[Colorado]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/overlandtravel/companies/391|title=Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel: 1847\u20131868|work=history.churchofjesuschrist.org|publisher=[[Church Historian and Recorder|Church History Department]], LDS Church|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}</ref> Three separate detachments left the battalion and went to Pueblo to winter. For the next four months and 1,100 miles, Cooke led the battalion across some of the most arduous terrain in North America. Most of the Mormon soldiers soon learned to respect and follow him. The group acquired another guide in New Mexico \u2013 adventurer and mountain man [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]], who as an infant had traveled with his mother [[Sacagawea]] across the continent with the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].\n\nLieutenant Smith and Dr. Sanderson continued with the battalion, along with Lt. [[George Stoneman]], newly graduated from West Point that Spring. During the Civil War, all three officers were promoted to high-level commands for the [[Union Army]], and Stoneman would later be elected [[Governor of California]].\n\n===Battle of the Bulls===\n[[File:Mormon Battalion painting.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A later-19th-century painting depicting the Mormon Battalion in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona]]\nThe only \"battle\" they fought was near the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]] in present-day [[Arizona]] against a sizable number of wild cattle. The battalion reached this area in November 1846, and their presence aroused curiosity among these animals. After the bulls of these herds caused destruction to some of the mules and wagons and resulted in two men being wounded, the men loaded their guns and attacked the charging bulls, killing 10\u201315 of the wild cattle, causing the event to be termed the \"Battle of the Bulls\".<ref name=Roberts1919/>\n\n===Capture of Tucson===\n{{Main article|Capture of Tucson (1846)}}\nApproaching [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], in present-day [[Arizona]], the battalion nearly had a [[Capture of Tucson (1846)|battle]] with a small detachment of provisional Mexican soldiers on December 16, 1846. The Mexicans retreated as the US battalion approached. The local O'odham and other Piman tribes along the march route were helpful and charitable to the American soldiers. Mormon soldiers learned many methods of irrigation from these native inhabitants and employed the methods later as pioneers in Utah and other areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Temecula Massacre===\nNearing the end of their journey, the battalion passed through [[Temecula, California]], during the aftermath of the [[Temecula Massacre]], a conflict between Mexican government forces and the [[Luise\u00f1o people|Luise\u00f1o]] tribe.

For the next five months until their discharge on July 16, 1847 in Los Angeles, the battalion trained and also performed occupation duties in several locations in [[southern California]]. The most significant service the battalion provided in California was as a reliable unit under Cooke to reinforce General Kearny's one company of army troops. The construction of [[Fort Moore]] in Los Angeles was one measure Cooke employed to protect military control under Kearny. Some 22 Mormon men died from disease or other natural causes during their service. About 80 of the men re-enlisted for another six months of service.\n\nAfter being mustered out, Jesse D. Hunter, captain of Company B, was appointed [[Indian Agent]] for southern California by the military governor, [[Richard Barnes Mason|Colonel Richard Mason]]. Hunter was California's third indian agent, the first two being [[Johann Sutter]] and [[Mariano Vallejo]], both appointed by Mason's predecessor, [[Stephen Kearny]].  Hunter's mission was to protect [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] and [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] from [[depredations]], and to generally control the Indian labor force, to the point of requiring Indians to carry passports.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hurtado |first=Albert L. |date=Fall 1979 |title=Controlling California's Indian Labor Force; Federal Administration of California Indian Affairs During the Mexican War |jstor=41170828 |journal=Southern California Quarterly |publisher=University of California Press |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=225\u2013226 |doi= }}</ref>\n\nFifteen men were selected to escort [[John C.

The march also opened a southern wagon route to California. Veterans of the battalion played significant roles in America's westward expansion in California, Utah, Arizona and other parts of the [[Western United States|West]].\n\n==Enlistment==\nAt the time they enlisted, members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] were seeking U.S. government aid for their migration west to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Salt Lake Valley]], despite having their previous petitions for redress of grievances denied. Under continued religious persecution, they had fled [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], on February 4, 1846 across the Mississippi River. They camped among the [[Potawatomi]] Indians near present-day [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]].\n\n[[Brigham Young]], the [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], sent Elder [[Jesse C. Little]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], to seek assistance from the federal government for the Mormon Pioneers fleeing from the Illinois mobs. Little arrived in Washington D.C. on May 21, 1846, only eight days after Congress had declared war on Mexico.<ref name=UHE/> Pennsylvania Army officer and attorney [[Thomas L. Kane]] offered the Mormons his advice and assistance. Politically well connected through his jurist father, Kane provided letters of recommendation and joined Little in Washington, D.C. The two called on the secretary of state, secretary of war, and President [[James K. Polk]]. After several interviews in early June 1846, President Polk agreed to Little's offer{{clarify|date=February 2014}} if \"a few hundred\" men enlisted. On June 2, 1846, President Polk wrote in his diary: \"Col.

After carrying dispatches relating to the land agreements and battalion criteria to [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kane sought out Little in the Mormon encampments on the Missouri. On July 17, 1846, he held a meeting with church leaders and Captain Allen.\n\nBrigham Young had planned on [[Mormon pioneers|moving the Mormons west]] that summer, but circumstances were against his plan. He saw several possible advantages to the Saints in the proposed federal service. Their enlistment would be a public relations victory for the church, demonstrating additional evidence of its loyalty to the United States.<ref name=mclynn/> As the men were given a uniform allowance at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., of US$42 each, paid in advance, for their one-year enlistment and as they were allowed to wear their civilian clothing for the march, the bulk of those funds were immediately donated to a general Church fund. These funds were used to purchase wagons, teams, and other necessities for the American exodus (Actual wages paid over the next year to the Mormon Battalion totaled nearly $30,000).<ref name=\"Pioneer Trail Map: Council Bluffs\">{{citation |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek|title=The Pioneer Story: Pioneer Trail Map|work=churchofjesuschrist.org }}</ref> Having been forced to leave farms and homes in Nauvoo, the Latter-day Saints were going to spend the winter on the banks of the Missouri River. Raising a group of able-bodied men would be difficult. Many men had already scattered to outlying areas where they sought jobs with wages to help support the group. Young wrote a letter to the Saints living in Garden Grove, in which he justified the call-up and asked for their help:\n\n{{quote|The President wants to do us good and secure our confidence.

For years afterward, some Mormons viewed the Mormon Battalion as an unjust imposition and as an act of persecution by the United States.{{Harv|Carrington|1857|p=5}}\n\n==Journey begins==\n[[File:Mormon_Battalion_Routes_1846-47_HENSON.jpg|thumb|Revised map of Mormon Battalion routes]]\nThe battalion arrived at [[Fort Leavenworth]] on August 1.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter Twenty-Six: Pioneers to the West|chapterurl=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times/chapter-twenty-six?lang=eng|title= Church History in the Fulness of Times Student Manual: Religion 341-43|year=2003|publisher=[[Institute of Religion|Institutes of Religion]], [[Church Educational System]], LDS Church|page=323}}</ref> For the next two weeks, they drew their pay, received their equipment ([[Model 1816 Musket|Model 1816]] [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock]] [[musket]]s and a few [[Harper's Ferry Model 1803 Rifle]]s), and were more formally organized into a combat battalion. The volunteers took the army's uniform allowance in cash per regulations. To assure the main body of the group benefited from the men's wages, Young sent Orson Pratt to see that the men handed over the pay they had committed to contribute. Young used this and the wages they earned later to buy supplies for the main group at wholesale prices in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He wrote to the enlistees that the money was a \"peculiar manifestation of the kind providence of our Heavenly Father at this time.\"<ref name=Roberts1919 /> There was little time for training and instilling discipline. Newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel James Allen became ill but ordered the battalion forward along the [[Santa Fe Trail]] to overtake Kearny's Army of the West. On August 23, Allen died and was the first officer buried in what became [[Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery|Fort Leavenworth National Military Cemetery]].\n\nCaptain [[Jefferson Hunt]], commanding A Company, was the acting commander until word reached [[Council Grove, Kansas]], that Allen had died. A few days later Lieutenant [[Andrew Jackson Smith]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] Class of 1838, arrived and was given temporary command of the battalion with the Mormons' consent. For the next several weeks, the Mormon soldiers came to hate \"AJ\" Smith and the assistant surgeon, Dr. George B. Sanderson, for their treatment of the men, and the long marches suffered across the dry plains of Kansas and New Mexico. The Mormon men were not accustomed to the austere military standards of the day nor to the medical treatments imposed by Dr. Sanderson, including the use of feeding mercury to the sick, which were standard for the time. Because the church leaders had counseled the battalion members to avoid military medical treatment, they challenged the doctor's authority and unrest arose among the men. Smith and Sanderson continued to hold the Mormon Battalion to ordinary standards of discipline, and tensions continued.\n\n===Cooke assumes command===\n[[File:Philip St. George Cooke.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Philip St. George Cooke]]]]\nArriving in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in October, General Kearny had dispatched Captain (brevet promotion to Lieutenant Colonel) [[Philip St. George Cooke]], West Point class of 1827, to assume command of the battalion. His assignment was to march them to California and to build a wagon road along the way. In Santa Fe 91 sick men and all but a few of the women and children were sent to [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], in present-day [[Colorado]].<ref>{{citation|url=https://history.churchofjesuschrist.org/overlandtravel/companies/391|title=Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel: 1847\u20131868|work=history.churchofjesuschrist.org|publisher=[[Church Historian and Recorder|Church History Department]], LDS Church|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}</ref> Three separate detachments left the battalion and went to Pueblo to winter. For the next four months and 1,100 miles, Cooke led the battalion across some of the most arduous terrain in North America. Most of the Mormon soldiers soon learned to respect and follow him. The group acquired another guide in New Mexico \u2013 adventurer and mountain man [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]], who as an infant had traveled with his mother [[Sacagawea]] across the continent with the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].\n\nLieutenant Smith and Dr. Sanderson continued with the battalion, along with Lt. [[George Stoneman]], newly graduated from West Point that Spring. During the Civil War, all three officers were promoted to high-level commands for the [[Union Army]], and Stoneman would later be elected [[Governor of California]].\n\n===Battle of the Bulls===\n[[File:Mormon Battalion painting.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A later-19th-century painting depicting the Mormon Battalion in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona]]\nThe only \"battle\" they fought was near the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]] in present-day [[Arizona]] against a sizable number of wild cattle. The battalion reached this area in November 1846, and their presence aroused curiosity among these animals. After the bulls of these herds caused destruction to some of the mules and wagons and resulted in two men being wounded, the men loaded their guns and attacked the charging bulls, killing 10\u201315 of the wild cattle, causing the event to be termed the \"Battle of the Bulls\".<ref name=Roberts1919/>\n\n===Capture of Tucson===\n{{Main article|Capture of Tucson (1846)}}\nApproaching [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], in present-day [[Arizona]], the battalion nearly had a [[Capture of Tucson (1846)|battle]] with a small detachment of provisional Mexican soldiers on December 16, 1846. The Mexicans retreated as the US battalion approached. The local O'odham and other Piman tribes along the march route were helpful and charitable to the American soldiers. Mormon soldiers learned many methods of irrigation from these native inhabitants and employed the methods later as pioneers in Utah and other areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Temecula Massacre===\nNearing the end of their journey, the battalion passed through [[Temecula, California]], during the aftermath of the [[Temecula Massacre]], a conflict between Mexican government forces and the [[Luise\u00f1o people|Luise\u00f1o]] tribe.

For the next five months until their discharge on July 16, 1847 in Los Angeles, the battalion trained and also performed occupation duties in several locations in [[southern California]]. The most significant service the battalion provided in California was as a reliable unit under Cooke to reinforce General Kearny's one company of army troops. The construction of [[Fort Moore]] in Los Angeles was one measure Cooke employed to protect military control under Kearny. Some 22 Mormon men died from disease or other natural causes during their service. About 80 of the men re-enlisted for another six months of service.\n\nAfter being mustered out, Jesse D. Hunter, captain of Company B, was appointed [[Indian Agent]] for southern California by the military governor, [[Richard Barnes Mason|Colonel Richard Mason]]. Hunter was California's third indian agent, the first two being [[Johann Sutter]] and [[Mariano Vallejo]], both appointed by Mason's predecessor, [[Stephen Kearny]].  Hunter's mission was to protect [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] and [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] from [[depredations]], and to generally control the Indian labor force, to the point of requiring Indians to carry passports.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hurtado |first=Albert L. |date=Fall 1979 |title=Controlling California's Indian Labor Force; Federal Administration of California Indian Affairs During the Mexican War |jstor=41170828 |journal=Southern California Quarterly |publisher=University of California Press |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=225\u2013226 |doi= }}</ref>\n\nFifteen men were selected to escort [[John C.
