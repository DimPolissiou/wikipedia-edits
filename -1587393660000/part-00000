Morrie a retired [[sociology]] professor from [[Brandeis University]] comes on the show to describe his final journey.\n\nAs life goes on with work and balancing his relationship with Janine, Mitch feels bothered he never got a chance to visit his old professor. Feeling so moved by the interview, Mitch reaches out for a visit with Morrie after sixteen years of no contact. Morrie has an affinity with food and it becomes a regular endeavor with his visits with Mitch. Office hours during university were on Tuesdays, Morrie would grade papers and critique student\u2019s assignments, Mitch now makes it a habit to visit him every Tuesday. Connie ([[Caroline Aaron]]), Morrie\u2019s home nurse, is his primary care taker.  After leaving Morrie, Mitch continues working and can\u2019t find a groove with Janine.\n\n[[Mitch Albom|Mitch]] returns and witnesses a \u201cliving funeral\u201d where friends and family come to honor [[Morrie Schwartz|Morrie]] while he is still alive, per Morrie\u2019s request.

Morrie divulges on many stories on when he was a young boy and how his relationships unfolded between his mother, stepmother, and father. Back home Mitch continues with his impressive and busy [[journalism]] career, and while out on a story he receives a call from Janine breaking up with him.\n\nAnother visit prompts Mitch to officially bring a recording device to capture all of Morrie\u2019s powerful pieces of advice and all his anecdotes. Morrie and Mitch grow closer and closer with each visit, some significant topics that were explored were death, love, marriage, family, and relationships. The time spent with Morrie starts to affect Mitch\u2019s position at work, he argues with his boss and decides to prioritize his visits with Morrie. Mitch, being so immersed in this new world asks Connie to teach him a few skills to aide Morrie when no one else is around. New tasks Mitch learn include: helping Morrie in and out of his [[wheelchair]], using his oxygen tank, feeding Morrie, and even special [[Massage|massages]].\n\nFinding value and meaning in Morrie\u2019s advice Mitch proposes to Janine via letter, she rejects him and comes along on one of his visits to Morrie\u2019s home. Janine notices a change in Mitch\u2019s personality in the way he knows what to do around Morrie from the oxygen tank assistance to cleaning Morrie\u2019s crying eyes. Janine and Morrie speak without Mitch in the room. Later, on an airplane on their way home Mitch and Janine make up and decide a proper proposal should take place.\n\nOn a rainy visit, Mitch brings Morrie food, but learns he has not been able to eat solid foods for some time. Charlotte ([[Bonnie Bartlett]]), Morrie\u2019s wife advises Mitch that his visits have a great impact on Morrie. Mitch notices how the illness is progressing in a devastating way. They continue to go back and forth on difficult topics, regret, spiritual life, forgiveness, and love. Morrie reiterates that humans must love another or die. He recounts the story of his father\u2019s death. Mitch receives a call from Walter ([[John Carroll Lynch]]), his boss, after the exchange they found middle ground to allow Mitch to write again. Mitch takes Janine to the islands and propose there. Once back home, Mitch requests to have all of his Tuesdays off to continue his visits with Morrie.\n\nOn a snowy visit, Mitch asks Morrie what a perfect day would be like. Morrie answers a simple answer with friends, family, food, dancing, and choosing his burial site. Morrie asks Mitch to visit once he has passed, breaking his heart. Mitch cries and hugs his old friend. Mitch promises to come back next [[Tuesday]]. Morrie died on a Saturday morning, Janine and Mitch received a call.

This family of large and beautiful butterflies is well represented with about 84 species found within Indian borders, the exact number depending on the taxonomy followed.<ref name=\"Evans & Wynter-Blyth estimates\">Evans (1932) states, in a table on pg 23, the number of papilionids in the Indian subcontinent as 90; 15 species being found in [[Ceylon]], 19 in [[South India]], 6 in [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]], 11 in [[Chitral]], 31 in the western [[Himalayas]], 69 in [[Northeast India]], 50 in southern [[Myanmar]] and 13 in the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar islands]]. Wynter-Blyth (1957) gives a modified version of the same table on p. 12, where the overall number of species is 94; with differences being in total number of species for Northeast [[Himalayas]] (62) and [[Myanmar]] (66). The present list is based on the IUCN red data book, with corrections made by subsequent editors especially in the [[Parnassiinae]].</ref><ref name=\"Kunte's estimate\">Kunte (2000) on p. 55 mentions a total of 107 species with 19 in peninsular [[India]].</ref>\n\nTwo of the three papilionid subfamilies are represented in India, namely, the [[Parnassiinae]] or Apollos, with 14 species, and the [[Papilioninae]] or swallowtails, with 70 species.

The Malabar banded peacock (''[[Papilio buddha]]'') and the Malabar banded swallowtail (''[[Papilio liomedon]]'') fly at sea level while the Apollos (''[[Parnassius]]'' species), are to be found only in the highest alpine meadows of the [[Himalayas]]. Some species such as the common Mormon (''[[Papilio polytes]]'') and the blue Mormon (''[[Papilio polymnestor]]'') fly at ground level whereas others, such as the tailed jay (''[[Graphium agamemnon]]'') are normally found flying high in the forest canopy. The lime butterfly (''[[Papilio demoleus]]'') is a creature of arid scrub-land, occasionally being spotted even in the [[Thar Desert]], while the tropical evergreen forests have their own representatives, such as the red Helen (''[[Papilio helenus]]''), the common bluebottle (''[[Graphium cloanthus]]'') and the Malabar raven (''[[Papilio dravidarum]]'').<ref name=\"Kunte Papilionidae\">{{cite book |last=Kunte |first=Krushnamegh |title=Butterflies of Peninsular India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuPPjOMcu_4C |series=India, A Lifescape |location=Hyderabad, India |publisher=Universities Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-8173713545 |pages=55\u201358, chapter 5.1 }}</ref> Indian papilionids such as the common Mormon (''Papilio polytes'') and great Mormon (''[[Papilio memnon]]'') show [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] with many [[mimicry|mimetic]] female forms.<ref>Clarke, C.A.; Sheppard, P.M. & Thornton, I.W.B.

This family of large and beautiful butterflies is well represented with about 84 species found within Indian borders, the exact number depending on the taxonomy followed.<ref name=\"Evans & Wynter-Blyth estimates\">Evans (1932) states, in a table on pg 23, the number of papilionids in the Indian subcontinent as 90; 15 species being found in [[Ceylon]], 19 in [[South India]], 6 in [[Balochistan (region)|Baluchistan]], 11 in [[Chitral]], 31 in the western [[Himalayas]], 69 in [[Northeast India]], 50 in southern [[Myanmar]] and 13 in the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar islands]]. Wynter-Blyth (1957) gives a modified version of the same table on p. 12, where the overall number of species is 94; with differences being in total number of species for Northeast [[Himalayas]] (62) and [[Myanmar]] (66).

The Malabar banded peacock (''[[Papilio buddha]]'') and the Malabar banded swallowtail (''[[Papilio liomedon]]'') fly at sea level while the Apollos (''[[Parnassius]]'' species), are to be found only in the highest alpine meadows of the [[Himalayas]]. Some species such as the common Mormon (''[[Papilio polytes]]'') and the blue Mormon (''[[Papilio polymnestor]]'') fly at ground level whereas others, such as the tailed jay (''[[Graphium agamemnon]]'') are normally found flying high in the forest canopy. The lime butterfly (''[[Papilio demoleus]]'') is a creature of arid scrub-land, occasionally being spotted even in the [[Thar Desert]], while the tropical evergreen forests have their own representatives, such as the red Helen (''[[Papilio helenus]]''), the common bluebottle (''[[Graphium cloanthus]]'') and the Malabar raven (''[[Papilio dravidarum]]'').<ref name=\"Kunte Papilionidae\">{{cite book |last=Kunte |first=Krushnamegh |title=Butterflies of Peninsular India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuPPjOMcu_4C |series=India, A Lifescape |location=Hyderabad, India |publisher=Universities Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-8173713545 |pages=55\u201358, chapter 5.1 }}</ref> Indian papilionids such as the common Mormon (''Papilio polytes'') and great Mormon (''[[Papilio memnon]]'') show [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] with many [[mimicry|mimetic]] female forms.<ref>Clarke, C.A.; Sheppard, P.M. & Thornton, I.W.B.
