This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\nTorres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.\n<br />\n==Main sights==\n* The 11th-century  [[Basilica of San Gavino]], built using only hardstones like marble, porphyry and granite, is the largest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in Sardinia. Instead of the usual western facade and eastern apse, the cathedral sports two apses. The crypt holds several Roman sarcophagi.\n* Neolithic [[necropolis of Su Crucifissu Mannu]] and [[Li Lioni]].\n* [[Nuraghe]] of [[la Camusina]], [[Li Pedriazzi]], [[Margone]] and [[Minciaredda]].\n* Remains of the Roman bridge, the largest in Sardinia with its arches and a span of {{convert|160|to|170|m|ft}} on the Rio Mannu\n* ''Palazzo Re Barbaro''\n* [[Catacombs]] of Tanca Borgona and ''piazzale Amsicora''.\n* Aragonese Towers of the port and of Abbacurrente.\n\n== Free access beaches ==\n[[File:Spiaggia_di_Balai.jpg|alt=|thumb|Balai beach.|left]]\n<br />The town of Porto Torres has several free access beaches and cliffs suitable for bathing activities. Main beach is the one called \"Balai\" (lit.\"Spiaggia di Balai\").\n\n\n\nOther beaches are :[[File:Turritana_costa.JPG|alt=|thumb|199x199px|Cliff near the town.|left]]\n\n* Renaredda's beach (lit. \"Spiaggia della Renaredda\")\n\n* Scogliolungo's beach (lit.\"Spiaggia dello Scogliolungo\")\n\n* Beach of Acque dolci (lit.\"Spiaggia delle acque dolci\")\n\n* Farrizza's beach (lit.\"Spiaggia di Farrizza\")\n\n* Abbacurrente's beach (lit.\"Spiaggia di Abbacurrente\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== Public transport and other connections ==\n[[File:ARST Mercedes-Benz Citaro (9907).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|Intercity bus owned by [[ARST (company)|ARST]]. Note that all public intercity buses are deep-blue colored.]]\n<br />\n\n=== Ferries ===\nThe city is connected by [[Ferry|ferries]] with [[Genoa]], [[Marseille]], [[Toulon]], [[Barcelona]], [[Civitavecchia]].In the north-west of Sardinia, the harbor of Porto Torres is the biggest<ref>{{Citation|title=Porto di Porto Torres|date=2020-03-14|url=https://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Porto_di_Porto_Torres&oldid=111446452|work=Wikipedia|language=it|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>. In front of the harbor quay there is a large Parking site and not so far from it there is the Maritime Terminal (Stazione marittima). In the same area there is built the new passenger terminal (the building is still under construction).   \n\nThe harbor area is very close to the town's center. The entire space is served with several hotels, B&B, restaurants ,museums, shops, and some 24/7 service areas.  \n\n=== Public transport ===\nPorto Torres belongs to the metropolitan network of north Sardinia (lit. \"Rete metropolitana del nord Sardegna\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Rete metropolitana del Nord Sardegna|date=2020-03-17|url=https://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rete_metropolitana_del_Nord_Sardegna&oldid=111515393|work=Wikipedia|language=it|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>). Due to this, the city is well-connected with all nearly towns via intercity autobus thanks to the [[ARST (company)|ARST]]. Local rides are managed by the local public transport agency (A.t.p. Sassari). Main connection with [[Sassari]] is the [[ARST]]'s intercity line 719 (lit. \"Linea 719\"). Also [[ARST (company)|ARST]] offer a connection with [[Alghero\u2013Fertilia Airport|Alghero's airport]].\n\nIt is possible to buy tickets both in the [[Tobacconist|tobacco shops]] and [[Newsagent's shop|newsagent's shops]]. Tickets can be bought directly into the autobus from the bus driver, but due to local policies the price will be higher. Recently it is possible to buy tickets online using a mobile app<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atono.dropticket&hl=it|title=DropTicket - App su Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=it|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.apple.com/it/app/dropticket/id916708542|title=\u200eDropTicket|website=App\u00a0Store|language=it-it|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>. \n\nLines, timetables and prices can be easily find on [[Google Maps|Google maps]] or in the unofficial [[ARST (company)|ARST]] mobile app<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arst.sardegna.it/orari_e_autolinee.html|title=ARST - - Orari e linee|website=arst.sardegna.it|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sardegna.trasporti.arsttrasporti&hl=en_US|title=Orari ARST - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.apple.com/it/app/arst-finder/id1465638702|title=\u200eArst Finder|website=App\u00a0Store|language=it-it|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>.<br />\n[[File:Linea PS.jpg|alt=|thumb|301x301px|Autobus owned by the local public transport agency (A.t.p.).

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\nTorres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.\n<br />\n==Main sights==\n* The 11th-century  [[Basilica of San Gavino]], built using only hardstones like marble, porphyry and granite, is the largest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in Sardinia. Instead of the usual western facade and eastern apse, the cathedral sports two apses. The crypt holds several Roman sarcophagi.\n* Neolithic [[necropolis of Su Crucifissu Mannu]] and [[Li Lioni]].\n* [[Nuraghe]] of [[la Camusina]], [[Li Pedriazzi]], [[Margone]] and [[Minciaredda]].\n* Remains of the Roman bridge, the largest in Sardinia with its arches and a span of {{convert|160|to|170|m|ft}} on the Rio Mannu\n* ''Palazzo Re Barbaro''\n* [[Catacombs]] of Tanca Borgona and ''piazzale Amsicora''.\n* Aragonese Towers of the port and of Abbacurrente.\n\n== Free access beaches ==\n[[File:Spiaggia_di_Balai.jpg|alt=|thumb|Balai beach.|left]]\n<br />The town of Porto Torres has several free access beaches and cliffs suitable for bathing activities.

In front of the harbor quay there is a large Parking site and not so far from it there is the Maritime Terminal (Stazione marittima). In the same area there is built the new passenger terminal (the building is still under construction).   \n\nThe harbor area is very close to the town's center. The entire space is served with several hotels, B&B, restaurants ,museums, shops, and some 24/7 service areas.  \n\n=== Public transport ===\nPorto Torres belongs to the metropolitan network of north Sardinia (lit. \"Rete metropolitana del nord Sardegna\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Rete metropolitana del Nord Sardegna|date=2020-03-17|url=https://it.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rete_metropolitana_del_Nord_Sardegna&oldid=111515393|work=Wikipedia|language=it|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>). Due to this, the city is well-connected with all nearly towns via intercity autobus thanks to the [[ARST (company)|ARST]]. Local rides are managed by the local public transport agency (A.t.p.

Founded in 1985 by Elliot Grassiano, it attained early success with games published through [[Loriciel]] in France and other partners (including [[Activision]] and [[Broderbund]]) in international markets. Through expanding its staff and development teams, Micro\u00efds generated funds to expand from just development to [[Video game publishing|publishing]] and [[Wholesaling|distribution]] and opening international offices. The company merged with MC2 in 2003 to create MC2-Micro\u00efds, whereafter it acquired publishers Wanadoo Edition and [[Cryo Interactive]]. Grassiano left MC2-Micro\u00efds in 2005; under new management, MC2-Micro\u00efds was briefly renamed MC2 before returning to the old Micro\u00efds name. It was then acquired by Anuman Interactive in 2010, which itself was renamed Micro\u00efds (then simplified to Microids) in 2019.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background and early years (1985\u20132003) ===\nMicro\u00efds was founded by Elliot Grassiano, a French [[Video game programmer|programmer]]. He was educated at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]] school from 1972 to 1974 and later studied engineering, electronics, and computers at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'arts et m\u00e9tiers]]. He started working as an engineer for the defence system company [[SAGEM]] in 1979. By the 1980s, Grassiano had become interested in [[telecommunications]], [[consumer electronics]], and video games. He acquired a [[Thomson MO5]]-model [[home computer]], which he used to create his first game, ''Space Shuttle Simulator''. The game was published by [[Loriciel]] and released to both critical and commercial success. Subsequently, Grassiano quit his job to establish his own company. He formally founded Micro\u00efds in 1985, setting it up in [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay]], a suburb of [[Paris]]. He was aided in these efforts by Loriciel's founders, Laurent Weill and Marc Bayle, as well as Patrick Le Nestour, another engineer. The name \"Micro\u00efds\" was a [[portmanteau]] of \"microinformatique\" (\"micro-informatics\") and \"androids\". Within its first year of operation, the company grew to five people, with Grassiano in the managerial role.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\">{{cite magazine |title=From the Archives: Micro\u00efds |first=David |last=Crookes |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=154 |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |date=21 April 2016 |pages=50\u201355}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Micro\u00efds set out to create consumer [[robotics]] projects before shifting its focus solely to video games. The first Micro\u00efds-developed game was ''Air Attack'', released by Loriciel for the Thomson MO5 to moderate commercial success. Early [[adventure game]]s developed by Micro\u00efds include ''Oceania'' (developed by Le Nestour and released in 1985 for the Thomson MO5 and [[Thomson TO7|TO7]]) and ''Les Pyramides D'Atlantys'' (developed by Luc Thibaud and released for the [[Amstrad CPC]] in 1986). ''Air Attack'' provided the groundwork for subsequent Micro\u00efds games, such as ''[[500 cc Grand Prix]]'' for the Amstrad CPC, which debuted in 1986. This game was the company's first breakthrough title, partially driven by the CPC's success in France. By way of a deal between Loriciel and [[Activision]], the game was also released in the UK, it was also released in the US, and it was later [[Porting|ported]] to other systems, such as the [[Atari ST]]. The American market appeared especially viable for Micro\u00efds, who believed that game sales would vastly outnumber the domestic ones. For this reason, it partnered with the American publisher [[Broderbund]] in 1987, which released several Micro\u00efds games in the country, partially under altered names. In return, Micro\u00efds managed sales of Broderbund's games, notably ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' and ''[[Karateka (video game)|Karateka]]'' in France.<ref name=\"Retro Gamer 154\" />\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Micro\u00efds underwent expansion, increasing both staff count and development team sizes. Development operations were accelerated to output more games, leading to increased profits. Through the new-earned funds, the company commenced operations in both [[video game publishing]] and [[Wholesaling|distribution]] in 1995, and between then and 1997 opened three international subsidiaries: Micro\u00efds Italia in [[Milan]], Micro\u00efds UK in [[Milton Keynes]], and Micro\u00efds Canada in [[Montreal]]. By 1997, Micro\u00efds had 20 employees and a turnover of 20&nbsp;million [[French franc]]s.

Raised in [[Rome]], he was drafted into the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]] at an early age, during which he was granted [[Roman citizenship]] and became a [[Equites|Roman knight]]. After serving with distinction in the [[Bellum Batonianum|Great Illyrian Revolt]], he was sent to [[Germania]] to aid the local governor [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] in completing the Roman conquest of the Germanic tribes. While in this capacity, Arminius secretly plotted a Germanic revolt against Roman rule, which culminated in the ambush and destruction of three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Arminius fought retaliatory invasions by the Roman general [[Germanicus]] in the battles of [[Battle at Pontes Longi|Pontes Longi]], [[Battle of Idistaviso|Idistaviso]], and the [[Battle of the Angrivarian Wall|Angrivarian Wall]], and deposed a rival, the [[Marcomanni]] king [[Maroboduus]].

The yellow legend represents the areas controlled by the [[Roman Republic]] in 31 BC, the shades of green represent gradually conquered territories under the reign of [[Augustus]], and pink areas on the map represent tributary tribes.]]\nAround the year AD 4, Arminius assumed command of a Cheruscan detachment of Roman auxiliary forces, probably while fighting in the [[Pannonian]] wars on the [[Balkan peninsula]]. He returned to northern Germania in AD 7 or 8, where the Roman Empire had established secure control of the territories just east of the [[Rhine]], along the [[Lippe]] and [[Main (river)|Main]] rivers, and was now seeking to extend its hegemony eastward to the [[Weser]] and [[Elbe]] rivers, under [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]], a high-ranking administrative official appointed by [[Augustus]] as governor. Arminius began plotting to unite various Germanic tribes in order to thwart Roman efforts to incorporate their lands into the empire. This proved a difficult task, as the tribes were strongly independent and many were traditionally enemies of each other.\n\nBetween AD 6 and 9, the Romans were forced to move eight of the eleven legions present in Germania east of the Rhine to crush a [[Great Illyrian Revolt|rebellion]] in the [[Balkans]],<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.livius.org/le-lh/legio/v_alaudae.html | date = September 2010 | title = Legio V Alaudae | publisher = www.livius.org}}</ref> leaving Varus with only three legions to face the Germans. An additional two legions, under the command of [[Lucius Nonius Asprenas (suffect consul AD 6)|Lucius Nonius Asprenas]], were stationed in [[Moguntiacum]].<ref>Syme, pg. 60</ref> Arminius saw this as the perfect opportunity to defeat Varus.<ref>Velleius Paterculus, ''Compendium of Roman History'' 2, 109, 5; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' 55, 28, 6\u20137</ref>\n\n[[File:Otto Albert Koch Varusschlacht 1909.jpg|left|thumb|''Varusschlacht'', Otto Albert Koch (1909)]]\nIn the autumn of AD 9, the 25-year-old Arminius brought to Varus a false report of rebellion in northern Germany. He persuaded Varus to divert the three legions under his command (composed of the [[Legio XVII|17th]], [[Legio XVIII|18th]], and [[Legio XIX|19th]] [[Roman legion|legions]], plus three [[cavalry]] detachments and six [[cohort (military unit)|cohorts]] of auxiliaries), which were at the time marching to winter quarters, to suppress the rebellion. Varus and his legions marched right into the trap that Arminius had set for them near [[Kalkriese]]. Arminius' tribe, the [[Cherusci]], and their allies the [[Marsi (Germanic)|Marsi]], [[Chatti]], [[Bructeri]], [[Chauci]], and [[Sicambri]] (five out of at least fifty Germanic tribes at the time)<ref name=\"Spiegel\"/> ambushed and annihilated Varus' entire army, totaling over 20,000 men, as it marched along a narrow road through a dense forest. Recent archaeological finds show the long-debated location of the three-day battle was almost certainly near Kalkriese Hill, about 20&nbsp;km north of present-day [[Osnabr\u00fcck]]. When defeat was certain, Varus committed suicide by falling on his sword. The battle was one of the most devastating defeats Rome suffered in its history. Arminius' success in destroying three entire legions and driving the Romans out of Germany marked a high point of Germanic power for centuries. Roman attempts to reconquer Germania failed, although they did eventually manage to break Arminius' carefully coordinated alliance.\n\n===Roman retaliation, inter-tribal conflicts, and death===\n[[File:Blick-\u00fcber-den-Teutoburger-Wald1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View over the [[Teutoburg Forest]]]]\nAfter the battle, the Germans quickly annihilated every trace of Roman presence east of the Rhine. Roman settlements such as the [[Waldgirmes Forum]] were abandoned. The vastly outnumbered Roman garrison of Aliso (present-day [[Haltern am See]]), under the command of the prefect Lucius Cedicius, inflicted heavy losses on the Germans before retreating into [[Gaul]], resisting long enough for Lucius Nonius Asprenas to organize the Roman defense on the Rhine and [[Tiberius]] to arrive with a new army. This prevented Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul.<ref>Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History II, 120, 4; Cassius Dio, Roman History LVI, 22, 2a-2b</ref>\n\nBetween AD 14 and 16, [[Germanicus]] led punitive operations into Germany, fighting Arminius to a draw in the [[Battle at Pontes Longi]] and twice defeating him (according to Tacitus): first in the [[Battle of Idistaviso]] and later at the [[Battle of the Angrivarian Wall]]. In AD 15, Roman troops managed to recapture one of the three [[aquila (Roman)|legionary eagles]] lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In AD 16, a second eagle was retrieved.<ref>Tac. ''Ann''. 1.60.4, 2.25.2</ref> Tiberius denied the request of Germanicus to launch an additional campaign for AD 17, however, having decided the frontier with Germania would stand at the Rhine river. Instead, he offered Germanicus the honor of a triumph for his two victories. The third Roman eagle was recovered in AD 41 by Publius Gabinius, under the emperor [[Claudius]].<ref>Dio 60.8.7.</ref> Arminius also faced opposition from his father-in-law and other pro-Roman Germanic leaders.<ref>Tac. ''Ann''. 1.54\u201359.</ref> His brother [[Flavus (son of Segimerus)|Flavus]], who had been raised alongside him in Rome, remained loyal to the Roman Empire and fought under Germanicus against Arminius at the Battle of Idistaviso. With the end of the Roman threat, a war broke out between Arminius and [[Maroboduus|Marbod]], king of the [[Marcomanni]]. It ended with Marbod fleeing to [[Ravenna]] and Roman protection, but Arminius failed to break into the \"natural fortification\" of [[Bohemia]], and the war ended in stalemate.\n\nIn AD 19, Germanicus died in [[Antioch]] under circumstances which led many to believe he had been poisoned by his opponents. Arminius died two years later, in AD 21, murdered by opponents within his own tribe who felt that he was becoming too powerful.<ref name=\"tacit\">Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#88|2.88]]</ref><ref>[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' 2.22 ff.; [[Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' 1.4; Dio 57.18.1; on Arminius' assassination, Tac.

''Ann''. 2.87\u201388.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nArminius married a princess named [[Thusnelda]], whose name is preserved only by [[Strabo]]. She was captured by the Romans while pregnant, so her son [[Thumelicus]] grew up in Roman captivity. [[Tacitus]] describes him as having an unusual story, which the historian promises to tell, but this part of Tacitus' writings has since been lost.\n\nArminius' victory against the Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest had a far-reaching effect on the subsequent history of both the ancient [[Germanic peoples]] and on the Roman Empire. The Romans made no further concerted efforts to conquer and permanently hold Germania beyond the Rhine and the [[Agri Decumates]]. Numerous modern historians have regarded Arminius' victory as \"Rome's greatest defeat\"<ref name=\"Murdoch\"/> and one of the most decisive battles in history.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/><ref name=\"Cawthorne\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/><ref name=\"Creasy\"/><ref name=\"Spectator\"/><ref name=\"Durschmied\"/>\n\n===Rome===\n[[File:Arminius pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|This Roman sculpture of a young man is sometimes identified as Arminius<ref name=britannica>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arminius|title=Arminius|work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Thusnelda Loggia dei Lanzi 2005 09 13.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Thusnelda statue in [[Loggia dei Lanzi]], Florence]]\nIn the accounts of his Roman enemies, Arminius is highly regarded for his military leadership and as a defender of the liberty of his people. Based on these records, the story of Arminius was revived in the 16th century with the recovery of the histories of [[Tacitus]], who wrote in his ''Annales II, 88'':\n\n{{quote|text=Arminius, without doubt Germania's liberator, who challenged the Roman people not in its beginnings like other kings and leaders, but in the peak of its empire; in battles with changing success, undefeated in the war.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arminius the Liberator: Myth and Ideology|first=Martin M.|last=Winkler|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2016|isbn=9780190252915|page=30}}</ref>}}\n\nArminius was not the only reason for Rome's change of policy towards Germania. Politics also played a factor; emperors found they could rarely trust a large army to a potential rival, though Augustus had enough loyal family members to wage his wars. Also, Augustus, in his 40-year reign, had annexed many territories still at the beginning of the process of Romanization. Tiberius, who succeeded Augustus in AD 14, decided that Germania was a far less developed land, possessing few villages and only a small food surplus, and therefore was not currently important to Rome. Conquering Germania would require a commitment too burdensome for the imperial finances and an excessive expenditure of military force.\n\nModern scholars have pointed out that the [[Rhine]] was a more practical boundary for the Roman Empire than any other river in Germania. Armies on the Rhine could be supplied from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] via the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Sa\u00f4ne]], and [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]], with only a brief area of portage. Armies on the [[Elbe]], however, would had to have been supplied by extensive overland routes or by ships travelling the hazardous Atlantic. Economically, the Rhine already had towns and sizable villages at the time of the Gallic conquest. The Rhine was significantly more accessible from Rome and better equipped to supply sizable garrisons than the regions beyond.<ref>Peter Heather (2006).

Recent archaeological finds show the long-debated location of the three-day battle was almost certainly near Kalkriese Hill, about 20&nbsp;km north of present-day [[Osnabr\u00fcck]]. When defeat was certain, Varus committed suicide by falling on his sword. The battle was one of the most devastating defeats Rome suffered in its history. Arminius' success in destroying three entire legions and driving the Romans out of Germany marked a high point of Germanic power for centuries. Roman attempts to reconquer Germania failed, although they did eventually manage to break Arminius' carefully coordinated alliance.\n\n===Roman retaliation, inter-tribal conflicts, and death===\n[[File:Blick-\u00fcber-den-Teutoburger-Wald1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|View over the [[Teutoburg Forest]]]]\nAfter the battle, the Germans quickly annihilated every trace of Roman presence east of the Rhine. Roman settlements such as the [[Waldgirmes Forum]] were abandoned. The vastly outnumbered Roman garrison of Aliso (present-day [[Haltern am See]]), under the command of the prefect Lucius Cedicius, inflicted heavy losses on the Germans before retreating into [[Gaul]], resisting long enough for Lucius Nonius Asprenas to organize the Roman defense on the Rhine and [[Tiberius]] to arrive with a new army. This prevented Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul.<ref>Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History II, 120, 4; Cassius Dio, Roman History LVI, 22, 2a-2b</ref>\n\nBetween AD 14 and 16, [[Germanicus]] led punitive operations into Germany, fighting Arminius to a draw in the [[Battle at Pontes Longi]] and twice defeating him (according to Tacitus): first in the [[Battle of Idistaviso]] and later at the [[Battle of the Angrivarian Wall]]. In AD 15, Roman troops managed to recapture one of the three [[aquila (Roman)|legionary eagles]] lost in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In AD 16, a second eagle was retrieved.<ref>Tac. ''Ann''. 1.60.4, 2.25.2</ref> Tiberius denied the request of Germanicus to launch an additional campaign for AD 17, however, having decided the frontier with Germania would stand at the Rhine river. Instead, he offered Germanicus the honor of a triumph for his two victories. The third Roman eagle was recovered in AD 41 by Publius Gabinius, under the emperor [[Claudius]].<ref>Dio 60.8.7.</ref> Arminius also faced opposition from his father-in-law and other pro-Roman Germanic leaders.<ref>Tac. ''Ann''. 1.54\u201359.</ref> His brother [[Flavus (son of Segimerus)|Flavus]], who had been raised alongside him in Rome, remained loyal to the Roman Empire and fought under Germanicus against Arminius at the Battle of Idistaviso. With the end of the Roman threat, a war broke out between Arminius and [[Maroboduus|Marbod]], king of the [[Marcomanni]]. It ended with Marbod fleeing to [[Ravenna]] and Roman protection, but Arminius failed to break into the \"natural fortification\" of [[Bohemia]], and the war ended in stalemate.\n\nIn AD 19, Germanicus died in [[Antioch]] under circumstances which led many to believe he had been poisoned by his opponents. Arminius died two years later, in AD 21, murdered by opponents within his own tribe who felt that he was becoming too powerful.<ref name=\"tacit\">Tacitus, The Annals [[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 2#88|2.88]]</ref><ref>[[Tacitus]], ''Annals'' 2.22 ff.; [[Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' 1.4; Dio 57.18.1; on Arminius' assassination, Tac.

''Ann''. 2.87\u201388.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nArminius married a princess named [[Thusnelda]], whose name is preserved only by [[Strabo]]. She was captured by the Romans while pregnant, so her son [[Thumelicus]] grew up in Roman captivity. [[Tacitus]] describes him as having an unusual story, which the historian promises to tell, but this part of Tacitus' writings has since been lost.\n\nArminius' victory against the Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest had a far-reaching effect on the subsequent history of both the ancient [[Germanic peoples]] and on the Roman Empire. The Romans made no further concerted efforts to conquer and permanently hold Germania beyond the Rhine and the [[Agri Decumates]]. Numerous modern historians have regarded Arminius' victory as \"Rome's greatest defeat\"<ref name=\"Murdoch\"/> and one of the most decisive battles in history.<ref name=\"Tucker\"/><ref name=\"Cawthorne\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/><ref name=\"Creasy\"/><ref name=\"Spectator\"/><ref name=\"Durschmied\"/>\n\n===Rome===\n[[File:Arminius pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|This Roman sculpture of a young man is sometimes identified as Arminius<ref name=britannica>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Arminius|title=Arminius|work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Thusnelda Loggia dei Lanzi 2005 09 13.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Thusnelda statue in [[Loggia dei Lanzi]], Florence]]\nIn the accounts of his Roman enemies, Arminius is highly regarded for his military leadership and as a defender of the liberty of his people. Based on these records, the story of Arminius was revived in the 16th century with the recovery of the histories of [[Tacitus]], who wrote in his ''Annales II, 88'':\n\n{{quote|text=Arminius, without doubt Germania's liberator, who challenged the Roman people not in its beginnings like other kings and leaders, but in the peak of its empire; in battles with changing success, undefeated in the war.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arminius the Liberator: Myth and Ideology|first=Martin M.|last=Winkler|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2016|isbn=9780190252915|page=30}}</ref>}}\n\nArminius was not the only reason for Rome's change of policy towards Germania. Politics also played a factor; emperors found they could rarely trust a large army to a potential rival, though Augustus had enough loyal family members to wage his wars. Also, Augustus, in his 40-year reign, had annexed many territories still at the beginning of the process of Romanization. Tiberius, who succeeded Augustus in AD 14, decided that Germania was a far less developed land, possessing few villages and only a small food surplus, and therefore was not currently important to Rome. Conquering Germania would require a commitment too burdensome for the imperial finances and an excessive expenditure of military force.\n\nModern scholars have pointed out that the [[Rhine]] was a more practical boundary for the Roman Empire than any other river in Germania. Armies on the Rhine could be supplied from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] via the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Sa\u00f4ne]], and [[Moselle (river)|Mosel]], with only a brief area of portage. Armies on the [[Elbe]], however, would had to have been supplied by extensive overland routes or by ships travelling the hazardous Atlantic. Economically, the Rhine already had towns and sizable villages at the time of the Gallic conquest. The Rhine was significantly more accessible from Rome and better equipped to supply sizable garrisons than the regions beyond.<ref>Peter Heather (2006). ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians''.</ref>\n\nRome chose no longer to rule directly in Germania east of the [[Rhine]] and north of the [[Danube]], instead preferring to exert indirect influence by appointing [[client king]]s, which was cheaper than military campaigns. [[Italicus]], nephew of Arminius, was appointed king of the Cherusci; [[Vangio and Sido]] became [[vassal]] princes of the powerful [[Suebi]], etc.<ref>[[Annals (Tacitus)|Tacitus]], Book 12 [verse 27 to 31]</ref> When indirect methods proved insufficient to control the Germanic tribes beyond the Rhine, Roman emperors occasionally led devastating punitive campaigns deep into Germania. One of them, led by the Roman emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]], resulted in a Roman victory in AD 235 at the [[Battle at the Harzhorn]] Hill,<ref>Historia Augusta, ''The Two Maximini'' 12:1\u20134; Herodian, ''Roman History'', Book 7:2:3</ref> located in the modern German state of [[Lower Saxony]], east of the [[Weser]] river, between the towns of [[Kalefeld]] and [[Bad Gandersheim]].\n\n===Old Germanic sagas===\nIn the early 19th century, attempts were made to show that the story of Arminius and his victory may have lived on in the [[Old Norse]] [[sagas]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ueber den Ursprung der Siegfriedsage|author=A.

The monument has been a major tourist attraction ever since, as has the [[Hermann Heights Monument]], a similar statue erected in [[New Ulm, Minnesota]] in the United States in 1897. The Hermann Heights monument was erected by the [[Sons of Hermann]], a fraternal organization formed by [[German American]]s in New York City in 1840 that flourished during the 19th century in American cities with large populations of German origin. [[Hermann, Missouri]], a town on the Missouri River founded in the 1830s and incorporated in 1845, was also named for Arminius.\n\nFollowing the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], fueled by aggressive German nationalism, and its subsequent defeat in [[World War II]], Arminius became a lesser-known figure among [[West Germany|West Germans]] and many schools shunned away from teaching his story in any detail due to its previous association with nationalism.<ref name=\"Spiegel\"/> There was, however, a somewhat different perception in [[East Germany]]. In East Germany, Arminius, based on a [[Marxism|Marxist]] reading of history, came to be seen as a revolutionary figure of sorts, leading German tribes in a fight against the Roman slaveholder society (''Sklavenhaltergesellschaft''). In the context of the [[Cold War]], Arminius was interpreted as symbolic of [[socialism]], with Rome being a symbol of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] United States as an oppressive empire.<ref name=zeit> Tillmann Bendikowski: [http://www.zeit.de/2008/45/DOS-varus-schlacht ''Deutsche Geschichte \u2013 Mythos einer Schlacht''].

The company was established in December 1918, and started a catering service in 1919. Originally owned by the [[Hoved Line|Norwegian Trunk Railway]], it was acquired by the state in 1926. Meals served in the restaurant carriages were relatively expensive, although they were available to all passengers. In the 1950s, the company began using serving trolleys on trains.\n\nIn January 1975, NSS [[Mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with the convenience-store chain [[Narvesen|Narvesen Kioskkompani]] into a new company called Narvesen\u2013Spisevognselskapet. This enterprise was partly owned by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) and [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]], before it merged with the [[Reitan Group]] and was delisted from the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Spisevognbergensbanen.jpg|thumb|left|Restaurant carriage on a [[Bergen Line]] train in 1909|alt=restaurant carriage, with tables set for dinner]]\nFrom the 1854 establishment of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers were allowed to bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=13}} He established the restaurant at [[Drammen Station]], and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the [[Bergen Line]], which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]].{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=14}} These were to be paid for by the state, but the [[Parliament of Norway]] delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=15}} In 1910, when [[President of the United States]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited [[Oslo]] to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the [[\u00d8stfold Line]].{{Sfn|Ottersland|2011|p=24}}\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Norsk Spisevognselskap at Oslo \u00d8.jpg|thumb|Norsk Spisevognselskap restaurant carriage at [[Oslo East Station]] in 1935|alt=Outside of restaurant carriage, 1935]]\nIn 1916, the executive board of the state railways wanted to centralise the operation of restaurant carriages and the most important station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining-car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=22}} At that time the [[S\u00f8rland Line]] and [[Dovre Line]] were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=28}} [[Oslo East Station]] and its restaurant were operated by the private [[Hoved Line|Norwegian Trunk Railway]]. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=23}}\n\nThis model was inspired by Sweden, where a separate dining company had been established; this company paid the railway company part of its revenue and a fixed fee per restaurant carriage. The Swedish model involved including the operation of station restaurants at locations where the restaurant carriages would have depots.<!--What does the word \"depots\" mean in this sentence?-->{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=29}} On 21 December 1918, A.S Norsk Spisevognselskap was established with a share capital of 200,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). It had 20 shares; 17 were owned by the Trunk Railway, and one by each of three directors: [[Waldemar Stoud Platou]], Gotfred Furuholmen and [[Christian Emil Stoud Platou]]\u2014the former representing the Trunk Railway and the latter being director-general of the NSB.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=24}} In January 1919, Waldemar Platou was appointed chair and Christiansen managing director.

Management wanted to centralise both a new depot and administrative offices at a single location close to the railway station, preferably co-located with a hotel. In 1936 work began on a hotel at [[Jernbanetorget]], but the project was cancelled.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=91}} The proposed hotel would have had 100 rooms across the street from Oslo \u00d8.

Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended to create a foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties finding a way to transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if it was part of a restructuring.{{Sfn|Skedsmo|1993|p=134}} A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]] was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen\u2013Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.{{Sfn|Skedsmo|1993|p=135}}\n\nBy the late 1980s, the company had sold all its hotel operations.{{Sfn|Thon|1993|p=242}} The merged company retained the obligation to operate dining services on the trains, which throughout the 1980s necessitated considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize the operation of the dining services through [[tendered]] contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary.{{Sfn|Skedsmo|1993|p=136}} The owners had an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other.

The company was established in December 1918, and started a catering service in 1919. Originally owned by the [[Hoved Line|Norwegian Trunk Railway]], it was acquired by the state in 1926. Meals served in the restaurant carriages were relatively expensive, although they were available to all passengers. In the 1950s, the company began using serving trolleys on trains.\n\nIn January 1975, NSS [[Mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with the convenience-store chain [[Narvesen|Narvesen Kioskkompani]] into a new company called Narvesen\u2013Spisevognselskapet. This enterprise was partly owned by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) and [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]], before it merged with the [[Reitan Group]] and was delisted from the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Spisevognbergensbanen.jpg|thumb|left|Restaurant carriage on a [[Bergen Line]] train in 1909|alt=restaurant carriage, with tables set for dinner]]\nFrom the 1854 establishment of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers were allowed to bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=13}} He established the restaurant at [[Drammen Station]], and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the [[Bergen Line]], which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]].{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=14}} These were to be paid for by the state, but the [[Parliament of Norway]] delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=15}} In 1910, when [[President of the United States]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited [[Oslo]] to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the [[\u00d8stfold Line]].{{Sfn|Ottersland|2011|p=24}}\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Norsk Spisevognselskap at Oslo \u00d8.jpg|thumb|Norsk Spisevognselskap restaurant carriage at [[Oslo East Station]] in 1935|alt=Outside of restaurant carriage, 1935]]\nIn 1916, the executive board of the state railways wanted to centralise the operation of restaurant carriages and the most important station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining-car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=22}} At that time the [[S\u00f8rland Line]] and [[Dovre Line]] were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=28}} [[Oslo East Station]] and its restaurant were operated by the private [[Hoved Line|Norwegian Trunk Railway]]. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=23}}\n\nThis model was inspired by Sweden, where a separate dining company had been established; this company paid the railway company part of its revenue and a fixed fee per restaurant carriage. The Swedish model involved including the operation of station restaurants at locations where the restaurant carriages would have depots.<!--What does the word \"depots\" mean in this sentence?-->{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=29}} On 21 December 1918, A.S Norsk Spisevognselskap was established with a share capital of 200,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). It had 20 shares; 17 were owned by the Trunk Railway, and one by each of three directors: [[Waldemar Stoud Platou]], Gotfred Furuholmen and [[Christian Emil Stoud Platou]]\u2014the former representing the Trunk Railway and the latter being director-general of the NSB.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=24}} In January 1919, Waldemar Platou was appointed chair and Christiansen managing director. The company took over Christiansen's four restaurant carriages and the restaurant at Oslo \u00d8 on 1 April 1919.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=27}}\n\nOn 2 February 1926, Parliament voted to [[nationalise]] the Trunk Railway.

NSS also established its first kiosk, at [[Bergen Station]].{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=50}} In 1923, the company was allowed to take over all restaurants in the railway districts of Oslo and Hamar; by 1925, it had taken over operation of the restaurants at [[Lillehammer Station|Lillehammer]], [[H\u00f8nefoss Station|H\u00f8nefoss]], [[Jessheim Station|Jessheim]], [[Kornsj\u00f8 Station|Kornsj\u00f8]], [[Halden Station|Halden]], [[Ski Station|Ski]], [[Eidsvoll Station|Eidsvoll]], [[Otta Station|Otta]], [[Domb\u00e5s Station|Domb\u00e5s]], [[\u00c5ndalsnes Station|\u00c5ndalsnes]], [[Kongsvinger Station|Kongsvinger]], [[Trondheim Central Station|Trondheim]], [[Rena Station|Rena]], [[Roa Station|Roa]], [[Ringebu Station|Ringebu]], [[Bjorli Station|Bjorli]] and [[Finse Station|Finse]].{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=51}}\n\nAfter this NSS decided not to obtain many additional restaurants, as it did not see value in such a strategy.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=54}} From 1930 through 1934 the company took over restaurants at [[\u00c5l Station|\u00c5l]], [[Jaren Station|Jaren]], [[Lillestr\u00f8m Station|Lillestr\u00f8m]] and [[T\u00f8nsberg Station|T\u00f8nsberg]], along with dining service on the steamship ''[[Skibladner]]'', which ran on [[Mj\u00f8sa]].{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=51}} During the first half of the 1940s it again acquired new restaurants, including the one at [[Kristiansand Station]].{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=54}} In 1940 and 1941 the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from 1942 onwards transformed the profit to a loss.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=55}} During the late 1940s NSS also took over the restaurants at [[Drammen Station|Drammen]] and [[Sarpsborg Station|Sarpsborg]], as well as the one at [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]].{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=72}}\n\n==Hotels==\n[[File:Oppdal Turisthotell.jpg|thumb|left|Hotel at [[Oppdal Station]]|alt=Square, three-story hotel in winter]]\nIn 1919 the Norwegian Trunk Railway operated one hotel, which was built as part of [[Eidsvoll Station]]. Operation of the 20-room hotel was taken over by Spisevognselskapet on 14 October 1924.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=76}} NSB was at the time building the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim, and was considering establishing hotels where the line passed through [[Dovrefjell]]. Both [[Hjerkinn Station|Hjerkinn]] and Fokkstua were considered, but these areas were served by other operators.{{Sfnm|Just|1949|1p=73|Adresseavisen|2009|2p=15}} Instead, Spisevognselskapet established the Oppdal Tourist Hotel adjacent to [[Oppdal Station]] and it opened on 28 June 1924.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=76}}{{Sfnm|H\u00f8gslund|1937|1p=55|Adresseavisen|2008|2p=28|Adresseavisen|2006|3p=17}} The 60-bed hotel had a floor area of {{convert|605|m2}}{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=79}} and was marketed as a tourist destination, with [[bobsleigh]] and [[curling]] during the winter and tennis and croquet in summer.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=80}} The hotel was closed for part of 1929, because the municipality would not allow it to serve alcoholic beverages.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=82}}\n\nIn Oslo, the company had its offices and workings spread around town. The main depot was at the East Station; the head office was at Fred. Olsens gate 21 from 1919 to 1921, at Kongens gate 29 until 1932, and at Tollbodgaten 24 until 1938. Management wanted to centralise both a new depot and administrative offices at a single location close to the railway station, preferably co-located with a hotel. In 1936 work began on a hotel at [[Jernbanetorget]], but the project was cancelled.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=91}} The proposed hotel would have had 100 rooms across the street from Oslo \u00d8. However, the plans were blocked by Parliament (which was opposed to the state railway operating hotels).{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=93}} Instead, the administration moved into Nylandsveien 10,{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=91}} in a new building built on a lot owned by NSB.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=93}}\n\nIn Bergen the company established Hotel Terminus Bergen along with other investors, but the hotel failed to make money.{{Sfn|Just|1949|p=74}} In the late 1940s the company bought Grand Hotell Bellevue in [[\u00c5lesund]], and later operated Saltfjellet Tourist Hotel for a short period.{{Sfn|Thon|1993|p=242}} In 1952, Oslo Municipality's [[Hotel Royal Christiania|Viking Hotel]] was completed, and Spisevognselskapet was selected as the operator.{{Sfn|Verdens Gang|1951|p=8}} It remained the hotel's operator until 1976 when the government sold it to Eiendomsinvest, which outbid Spisevognselskapet by several million krone.{{Sfn|Verdens Gang|1976|p=16}}\n\n=={{anchor|Disestablishment}}Dissolution==\n[[File:Spisevogn carriage.jpg|thumb|Restaurant carriage in 1926|alt=Outside view of restaurant carriage]]\n[[Narvesen]] had an exclusive agreement with NSB to operate [[newsagent's shop]]s at all railway stations, except in stations with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagents in Norway, and rented facilities in many public places. The owners of Narvesen intended to create a foundation to obtain the company; when plans for this started in 1972, they had difficulties finding a way to transfer shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if it was part of a restructuring.{{Sfn|Skedsmo|1993|p=134}} A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]] was established to take over Narvesen's owners' share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974; in December it was passed by Parliament, although the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen\u2013Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. Fritt Ord owned 50% of the new company and NSB 41%. It assumed the Narvesen name in 1979.{{Sfn|Skedsmo|1993|p=135}}\n\nBy the late 1980s, the company had sold all its hotel operations.{{Sfn|Thon|1993|p=242}} The merged company retained the obligation to operate dining services on the trains, which throughout the 1980s necessitated considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize the operation of the dining services through [[tendered]] contracts; the first contract (from 1990 through 1995) was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary.{{Sfn|Skedsmo|1993|p=136}} The owners had an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other. In 1995 NSB sold its shares with Fritt Ord's approval, and the company was listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].{{Sfn|Fritt Ord|1997|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nIn 1999, Fritt Ord reduced its stock share in Narvesen from 51% to 34%. In the fall of 2000, Fritt Ord accepted a proposal to merge Narvesen with the [[Reitan Group]]. The merged company was named ReitanNarvesen; Fritt Ord held 16.2% of its shares.{{Sfn|Ottersland|2011|p=27}} In November 2001 Fritt Ord sold its shares of ReitanNarvesen,{{Sfn|Norwegian News Agency|2001}} which was renamed Reitan Handel{{Sfn|Norwegian News Agency|2002b}} and [[List of companies delisted from Oslo Stock Exchange|delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange]].{{Sfn|Norwegian News Agency|2002a}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Norsk Spisevognselskap}}\n;Books and journal articles\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book |author=[[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]] |title=Institusjonen Fritt Ord |year=1997 |location=Oslo  |pages= |oclc=52544757 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Fritt Ord|1997}}}}\n*{{Cite book |last=H\u00f8gslund |first=O. |title=Dovrebanen og Tr\u00f8ndelag |year=1937 |publisher=[[Norwegian State Railways]] |edition=5th |series=Volume 7 of ''Norsk Reisebok'' |oclc=258361682 |language=Norwegian}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Just |first=Carl |title=A/S Norsk Spisevognselskap 1919\u20131949 |location=Oslo |publisher=Norsk Spisevognselskap |year=1949 |authorlink=Carl Just |oclc=40310643 |language=Norwegian |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Ottersland |first=Per Kristian |title=Uten mat og drikke... |journal=Arkivmagasinet |year=2011 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201327 |publisher=[[National Archival Services of Norway]] |issn=0801-5449 |language=Norwegian |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Skedsmo |first=Finn |title=Narvesen: Vindu mot verden i 100 \u00e5r |year=1993 |publisher=Narvesen |location=Bergen |isbn=82-7326-023-2 |language=Norwegian |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Thon |first=Sverre |title=Vertskap i Norge |year=1993 |publisher=Norsk hotell- og restaurantforbund |location=Oslo |isbn=82-992126-2-6 |language=Norwegian |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n;News articles and encyclopaedia entries\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Astrup, Sigurd |year=1935 |encyclopedia=[[Merkantilt biografisk leksikon]] |editor-last=Hoffstad |editor-first=Einar |editor-link=Einar Hoffstad |publisher=Yrkesforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://runeberg.org/merkbio/0116.html |edition=1st |page=42 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Hoffstad (ed.)|1935}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Hotellbygd i s\u00e6rklasse |newspaper=[[Adresseavisen]] |date=8 August 2009 |page=15 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Adresseavisen|2009}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Oppdal har urealiserte hotellplaner nok til en egen hotellkjede |newspaper=[[Adresseavisen]] |date=4 May 2006 |page=17 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Adresseavisen|2006}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Reitan Narvesen bytter navn |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=18 February 2002 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Norwegian News Agency|2002b}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Reitan overtar Narvesen fra Fritt Ord |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=15 November 2001 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Norwegian News Agency|2001}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Reitan tar hele kaka |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=11 January 2002 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Norwegian News Agency|2002a}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Samvirkelaget inn i Viking? |newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=11 September 1976 |page=16 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Verdens Gang|1976}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Slik kom Oppdal p\u00e5 skinner |newspaper=[[Adresseavisen]] |date=19 March 2008 |page=28 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Adresseavisen|2008}}}}\n*{{Cite news |title=Spisevognselskapet fikk Viking Hotell |newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=2 August 1951 |page=8 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Verdens Gang|1951}}}}\n*{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Mossige, Erling |year=1973 |encyclopedia=Hvem er hvem? |editor-last=Steenstrup |editor-first=Bj\u00f8rn |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1973/0393.html |pages=393\u201394 |isbn=82-03-04886-2 |edition=11th |accessdate=30 May 2011 |language=Norwegian |ref={{SfnRef|Steenstrup (ed.)|1973}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Norsk Spisevognselskap}}\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Norway]]\n[[Category:Norwegian State Railways (1883\u20131996)]]\n[[Category:1975 disestablishments in Norway]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies of Norway]]\n[[Category:Hospitality companies established in 1918]]\n[[Category:Defunct hotel chains]]\n[[Category:Restaurant chains in Norway]]\n[[Category:Hotels in Norway]]\n[[Category:Norsk Spisevognselskap| ]]\n", "name_user": "Eisfbnore", "label": "safe", "comment": "brief translation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norsk_Spisevognselskap"}

The last Inca stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nFrom 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, including, besides Peru, large parts of modern Ecuador, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and central Chile, and a small part of southern Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia.\n\nThe official language of the empire was Quechua, although hundreds of local languages and dialects of [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] were spoken..\n\nThe Inca Empire, was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the [[Inca]]. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land. In fact, the Inca Empire was conceived like an ambitious and audacious civilizing project, based on a mythical thought, in which the harmony of the relationships between the human being, nature, and gods was truly essential. The economy was mainly agricultural, though it reached some animal husbandry and mining development. The primary goal of the Incan economy was substinence, with a system based on reciprocity and exchange of products.\n\nThe colonial-era sources are not entirely clear or in agreement about the nature of the structure of the Inca government. However, its basic structure can be spoken of broadly, even if the exact duties and functions of government positions cannot be told. At the top of the chain of administration sat the [[Sapa Inca]]. Next to the Sapa Inca in terms of power may have been the Willaq Umu, literally the \"priest who recounts\", who was the High Priest of the Sun.[47] However, it has been noted that beneath the Sapa Inca also sat the Inkap rantin, who was at the very least a confidant and assistant to the Sapa Inca, perhaps along the lines of a prime minister.[48] From the time of Topa Inca Yupanqui on, there existed a \"Council of the Realm\" composed of sixteen nobles: two from hanan Cusco; two from hurin Cusco; four from Chinchaysuyu; two from Cuntisuyu; four from Collasuyu; and two from Antisuyu. This weighting of representation balanced the hanan and hurin divisions of the empire, both within Cusco and within the Quarters (hanan suyukuna and hurin suyukuna).[49]\n\nWhile there was a great deal of variation in the form that Inca bureaucracy and government took at the provincial level, the basic form of organization was decimal. In this system of organization, taxpayers\u2014male heads of household of a certain age range\u2014were organized into corv\u00e9e labor units (which often doubled as military units) that formed the muscle of the state as part of mit'a service. Each level of jurisdiction above one hundred tax-payers was headed by a kuraka, while those heading smaller units were kamayuq, a lower, non-hereditary status. However, while kuraka status was hereditary, one's actual position within the hierarchy (which was typically served for life) was subject to change based upon the privileges of those above them in the hierarchy; a pachaka kuraka (see below) could be appointed to their position by a waranqa kuraka. Furthermore, it has been suggested that one kuraka in each decimal level also served as the head of one of the nine groups at a lower level, so that one pachaka kuraka might also be a waranqa kuraka, in effect directly responsible for one unit of 100 tax-payers and less directly responsible for nine other such units.[50]\n\nKuraka in Charge\tNumber of Taxpayers\nHunu kuraka\t             10,000\nPichkawaranqa kuraka\t      5,000\nWaranqa kuraka\t              1,000\nPichkapachaka kuraka\t        500\nPachaka kuraka\t                100\nPichkachunka kamayuq\t         50\nChunka kamayuq\t                 10\n\n=== [[Viceroy of Peru]] 1531\u20131821 ===\n\nThe extemporaneous Spanish colonial economy was dominated by mineral wealth, and labor was initially provided through enslavement of the indigenous peoples. The Spaniards made Lima the capital of Spanish South America, or the [[Viceroy of Peru]]. Peru's precious mineral resources and large indigenous population placed it at the core of the South American colonies; according to Palmer, Peru could be ranked second on a scale of colonial penetration (Mahoney, 66). Textiles, minerals, and sugars from the colonies were exported back to Europe.\n\nAfter the war of secession of 1700, Spain began to lose its monopoly over colonial trade. In the mid-18th century, liberal factions began to appear within the colonial elite; these questioned the legitimacy of the crown's rule in the Americas. These \u201cCreole patriots\u201d, which had originally been marginalized to the periphery of the empire (Venezuela, Argentina, etc.), provided the necessary conditions for successful economic development during the late colonial period (Mahoney, 52, 80). The in\nh throughout the empire, with Spain receiving ten times more imports by the end of the 18th century. Despite this overall growth of the colonies, the trend observed in Peru over the course of the century and a half following the war of secession was one of stagnation. The regional socioeconomic hierarchy inverted itself, as core territories where liberals were absent experienced much lower levels of economic development. Their marginalization actually allowed them to benefit from expanded trade opportunities. According to Mahoney, \u201cregional specialists have argued that underdevelopment throughout [areas such as Peru] can be traced to colonial patterns of economic dependence, Hispanic culture, and inefficient markets and economic arrangements\".\n\nAttempting to protect its colonial possessions and reverse its faltering role in colonial trade, the crown implemented liberalizing reforms, hastening the removal of trade restrictions and weakening colonial monopolies. This continued the decay of the core regions, leaving them more exposed to the uncertainties of the free market. By the mid-19th century, the reversal of the socioeconomic hierarchy was complete; Peru would not recover its Viceroyalty-era supremacy (Mahoney, 86).\n\n===Independence and the Industrial Revolution Era 1821\u20131878===\n\nAfter winning independence from [[Spain]] on July 28, 1821, Peru was financially strapped. In addition, the economy suffered from the collapse of the silver mines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref> However the Guano (also spelled Quevo) trade era 1849\u20131879 with [[Europe]] flushed Peru with European investments and money. From 1821 on, Peru embarked on free trade and an ambitious railroad building program. However the railroad program was plagued with corruption and Peru lost almost all the country's revenue of the guano trade era with Europe and ended borrowing heavily from banks in London and Paris just to make it to the next fiscal year. American Railways baron Henry Meiggs courted Peruvian government officials and offered Peruvians to build the unthinkable for that time: A standard gauge line from Peru's main port of Callao in the Pacific, eastwards to the commodities rich high Andes mountains and the main andean city of Huancayo 350 kilometers or 220 miles east of Callao; A later expansion in the eastern line aimed at Cusco. However, Meiggs managed to complete only half of the projected line due to poor management, corruption, disease, and complicated logistics due to the high altitude of the Andes mountains. \nOver the years financial woes worsened and Peru needed money. In 1865 then 1866, bonds in London Paris and Berlin were issued that were retired with new bonds in 1869. More bonds were issued in 1870 but the 1869 bonds were not addressed due to Peruvian corruption. Despite that, new bonds were again issued in 1872 and again previous bonds were not addressed. A major problem, that would take many years to resolve, was that the rich guano deposits were used as security on all the bonds. Peru struggled to make bond interest payments but on December 18, 1875, Peru defaulted. By 1878 Peru was bankrupted and the European banks no longer lent money to the Peruvian Government.\n\n===The War of the Pacific: Chile\u00b4s invasion of Peru and its terrible economic and social consequences 1879\u20131884===\n{{see also|Peruvian Salpeter Monopoly}}\n\nThe War of the Pacific (Spanish: Guerra del Pac\u00edfico) (1879\u20131883) was fought in western South America, between Chile and allies Bolivia and Peru. Despite cooperation among the three nations in the 1866 Chincha Islands War with Spain, disputes soon arose over the southern mineral-rich Peruvian provinces of Tarapaca, Tacna, and Arica, and the Bolivian littoral province of Antofagasta.\n\nWhen Chile gained independence from Spain in 1811, it was a small country lacking important natural resources. Chile's main exports were wheat and wine. Thus many Chilean wheat and wine businessmen, encouraged by the Chilean government decided to diversify and invest abroad in neighboring Bolivia and Peru.\n\nSince the early 1850s the Chilean wheat and wine barons thoroughly invested and developed the massive nitrate and the saltpeter fields located in the Peruvian Tarapaca and Bolivian Antofagasta departments.  \nFor twenty years the Chilean economic outlook was up and things were going according to plan for the Chilean businessmen. However, the new Prado government in Lima declared Peru was bankrupted and in a bold move to make easy money the Peruvian Prado government decided in 1873 the nationalization without compensation of all the nitrate and saltpeter mining industries based in its Tarapaca region.\n\nSuddenly after decades, Chilean businessmen, including well-known magnates of the time such as Toorjo Mishra and Sparsh Nagar{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}, found themselves expelled from Peru.\n\nBolivia's president and the Bolivian congress followed suit and started to argue that Chileans were ripping off Bolivia, therefore by December 1878 the Bolivian congress approved a 10-cent additional tax on the Chilean owned Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta (CSFA). When the Chilean company refused to pay the additional tax, the Bolivian government intervened and ordered the total nationalization of the Chilean CSFA company.\n\nAgain Chilean businessmen were being expelled from overseas, this time from Bolivia.\nHowever this second outcome differed totally. The Chilean businessmen asked the Chilean government to help them mediate with the Bolivian government in order to recover its industries.\nThe Chilean government approved its businessmen request, hence Chile by February 14, 1879 declared war on Bolivia.\n\nThat same day the well-equipped Chilean armed forces occupied Bolivia's main port city of Antofagasta, in order to stop the Bolivian authorities from auctioning the confiscated property of Chilean CSFA. Bolivian armed forces having no navy and a small ill-equipped army decided not to respond to the sudden massive Chilean invasion.\n\nIn Bolivia's capital La Paz top Bolivian authorities were outraged, and so announced that a state of war existed,  thus invoking its 1873 secret military alliance treaty with Peru. Bolivia called on Lima to activate their secret mutual defense pact, while Chile waited for Peru to respond to Bolivia's demand and see if Peru declared its neutrality or not. \nHowever, Peru's Prado president and his top officials were warned by the Peruvian military that if Peru declared its neutrality, Chile will use this statement to convince Bolivia to jointly declare war on Peru, offering Bolivia in retribution the Peruvian territories of Tacna & Arica.  Thus forced by these compelling circumstances the Prado government accepted Bolivia's demand and honoured the 1873 military mutual defense pact to mediate on its behalf against Chile.\n\nBolivia, backed by Peru, hence declared war on Chile at the end of February 1879.\nPeru meanwhile tried to defuse on February and March an imminent war with Santiago, by sending an ambassador to Santiago for peace talks with the Chilean president and Chile's congress.\n\nOn April 5, after refusing further Peruvian talks for peace, Chile conveniently declared war on both nations. On April 6, Peru responded by acknowledging the casus foederis.\nPeru was not ready to fight any war. Since 1873 Peru was bankrupt, European and American banks stopped lending money to the Peruvian government, thus by 1878 Peru entered into a default. Making matters worse, since 1866 many coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempts by several caudillos created nationwide economic political and social havoc, so by 1873 the Prado government practically had the Peruvian army disbanded and decided to let it stagnate, being ill-equipped with obsolete rifles dating from the independence era, while old Peruvian navy ships dating from the 1850s and 1860s remained abandoned, rusting idle at Callao Naval Station.\n\nIn these appalling conditions, the War of the Pacific had begun.\n\nThe cruel and blood-ridden \"Saltpetre War\" took place over five years in a variety of terrains, including the 300&nbsp;mi Atacama Desert and most of the 2000&nbsp;mi Peruvian coastline deserts as well as long battles against Peruvian anti-Chilean guerrillas in the cold mountainous regions of the Peruvian Andes.\n\nThe war's first battle was the Battle of Top\u00e1ter. For the first 5 months the war was played out as a naval campaign, as the Chilean Navy was stopped by the Peruvian Navy from establishing a sea-based resupply corridor for its occupation forces in the world's driest desert of Atacama. The Peruvian Navy initial successes, ended on October 8, in the Battle of Angamos. \nOn that day the Chilean Navy virtually destroyed most of the Peruvian navy and eventually prevailed.\n\nAfterwards, in 1880 Chile's army easily beat the ill-equipped Bolivian and Peruvian armies. Bolivia's army was soon defeated and withdrew after the Battle of Tacna on May 26, 1880. \nThe Peruvian army was defeated after the Battle of Lima on January 18, 1881.\n\nThe land campaign climaxed in 1881, with the Chilean occupation of Lima. Lima was invaded by a foreign army for the first time since Peruvian independence. Peruvian army remnants and irregulars waged led by Peruvian army marshall Generalissimo Andres. A. Caceres led a violent and merciless guerrilla war against Chile. One of the first ever recorded guerrilla war in modern history.\n\nThis guerrilla war better known as the Campaign of the Bre\u00f1a was fought in the cold Peruvian Andes mountains and for two years the Peruvian resistance guerrillas beat the Chilean army many times.\n\nAfter four years of fighting, the Chilean army was logistically overextended and war weary, thus the Chilean army made a final counter-attack, the so-called strategic Battle of Huamachuco. This battle lasted many days and was by far the most cruel of the war. Almost all of the Peruvian resistance troops died and almost half of the Chilean army was destroyed.\n\nSuperior Chilean weaponry such as new German Krupp cannons and new English rifles gave the invading Chileans the upper hand, and successfully eliminated Marshall Caceres\u00b4 guerrillas at Huamachuco.\n\nAfter Huamachuco, Chile and Peru finally signed the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n on October 20, 1883. \nThe final Chilean soldiers left Lima at the end of 1884. Bolivia was forced by Chile to sign a truce in 1884.\n\nThe Ancon Treaty allowed Chile to annex the minerals-rich Peruvian department of [[Tarapac\u00e1 Department (Peru)|Tarapaca]] rich in nitrates and guano, [[Bolivia]] lost its Atacama Department and its 400 kilometers of [[pacific]] ocean coastline. Cutting Bolivia off from the sea.\n\nPlus, the Ancon Treaty also allowed Chile to manage the Peruvian provinces of Tacna and Arica for an initial 10 years until 1883 when citizens of both provinces could decide in a referendum if Tacna & Arica joined Chile or remained in Peru.\n\nIn 1904, Chile and Bolivia signed the \"Treaty of Peace and Friendship\" establishing definite boundaries, thus making Bolivia a land-locked country ever since.\n\nThe situation between Chile and Peru worsened when the former did not held the promised 1893 plebiscite to determine the fate of the provinces of Arica and Tacna. Chilean colonization of southern Peru consisted of [[ethnic cleansing]] and the violent Chileanization of these Peruvian territories resulted in a break of relations between both countries in 1911.\n\nDuring the 1920s the American government mediated in peace talks between Peru and Chile. U.S. Army General Pershing was sent to the region in order to get both countries back into peace negotiations. \nThe final outcome of America's intervention was the 1929 Tacna\u2013Arica compromise that allowed Chile to annex Arica while Chile was forced to return Tacna to Peruvian sovereignty, but this compromise in the end did not resolve the animosity and a cold war evolved between the both southern American countries. \nCurrent political problems and military tensions among these neighbours often have its roots back to this conflict.\n\nThe [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883) made therefore matters far worse for Peru and by 1889 the country had to do something.\n\nAn extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The Peruvian government, though still bankrupt, started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the massive destruction of the war. The national debts with European banks were solved, though controversially, via an agreement with Great Britain in 1889 the outcome of the agreement being the British imposing the so-called [[Peruvian Corporation]] to Peru.\n\nIn January 1890 the British government gathered in London a group of British bankers and business men and formed the Peruvian Corporation to attempt to resolve the issues and recoup invested money in Peru. The objectives of the company were extensive. They included the acquisition of real or personal property in [[Peru]] or elsewhere, dealing in land, produce, and property of all kinds, constructing and managing railways, roads, and telegraphs, and carrying on the business usually carried on by railway companies, canal companies, and telegraph companies. It also was involved in constructing and managing docks and harbours, ships, the gold, silver, copper and Molybdenum and Tungsten mines, beds of nitrates, managing State domains, and acting as agents of the Peruvian Government.<ref name=\"The Law journal reports\">{{cite book|title=The Law journal reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx0yAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA387|accessdate=26 December 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1908|publisher=E.B.

Its board of directors included ten members led by Sir Alfred Dent G A Ollard, of Smiles and Co Solicitors, was manager in London, T E Webb was secretary, with Clinton Dawkins and William Davies (Grace Brothers - Callao) as the first representatives in Peru.\nThe company was formed with the purpose of canceling Peru's external debt and to release its government from loans it had taken out through bondholders at three times (in 1869, 1870, 1872), in order to finance the construction of railways. The main purpose of the incorporation included acquiring the rights and undertaking the liabilities of bondholders.\nPolitical stability was achieved only in the early 20th century.\n\n=== Michael Grace ===\n[[William Russell Grace|Russell]] and [[Michael P. Grace|Michael Grace]] had formed the Grace Brothers & Co. (that became the [[W.R. Grace and Company]]) in 1865 and had a vast business empire with interests in Lima, and Callo, Peru; as well as Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepcion Chile. By 1889 these interests included a large guano trade as well as '''''Grace Line''''' shipping. Moves to address the Peruvian financial crisis included the '''''Elias-Castellon''''' and '''''Irigoyen-Delgado-Donoughmore protocols''''' that were formalized by 1890 and Michael Grace and Lord Donoughmore was able to get the [[Grace Contract]] (originating in 1886) ratified.\n\n==== Contract terms ====\nTerms of the Grace contract were that the Peruvian Corporation took over the depreciated bonds of the Peruvian Government on the condition that the Government-owned railroads and the [[guano]] exportation be under their control for a period of years. The bonds were exchanged for stock in the Peruvian Corporation. The corporation later surrendered the bonds to the Peruvian Government in exchange for the following concessions: the use for 66 years of all the railroad properties of the Peruvian Government, most important of which were the Southern Railway of Peru and the Central Railway of Peru; assignment of the guano existing in Peruvian territory, especially on certain adjacent islands, up to the amount of 2,000,000 tons; certain other claims on guano deposits, especially in the [[Lobos de Tierra Island|Lobos]] and other islands; 33 annual payments by the Peruvian Government, each of $400,000.\n\nIn 1907, this arrangement was modified by an extension of the leases of the railways from 1956 to 1973, by a reduction in the number of annual payments from 33 to 30, and by a further agreement on the part of the Peruvian Corporation to construct certain railroad extensions to [[Cuzco]] and to [[Huancayo]]. The bonds of this corporation were largely held by English, French, and Dutch subjects. Consequently, the diplomatic representatives of these countries in Peru sought proper interest in the welfare of their nationals, the bondholders.<ref name=\"Commission1916\">{{cite book|author=United States.

Odr\u00eda led a successful military coup and became the new president. Thanks to a thriving economy, Odr\u00eda was able to implement expensive, populist social reconstruction, including housing projects, hospitals, and schools. His government was dictatorial, however, and civil rights were severely restricted, and corruption was rampant throughout his r\u00e9gime.\n\nMilitary juntas continued to predominantly rule Peru over the next three decades. The economic policies of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s in particular, were based on the substitution of imports, and had little effect on the size of the economy. General Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez replaced leftist General Juan Velasco Alvarado in 1975, citing Velasco's economic mismanagement, among other factors. Morales Berm\u00fadez brought about a more conservative period, beginning the task of restoring the country's economy.\n\n==The Velasco Military Junta Government 1968\u20131980==\n\nThe economic strategy of General Velasco's government was shaped by a conception frequently advocated in Latin America but rarely put into practice. The idea was to find a \"third way\" between capitalism and socialism, with a corporatist society much more inclusionary than that possible under capitalism but without rejecting private ownership or adopting any of the compulsory methods identified with communism. Under this strategy, land reform was designed to override existing property interests in order to establish cooperative ownership, rejecting both individual private farming and state farms. Promoting worker participation in ownership and management was intended to reshape labor relations. Foreign influences were reduced through tight restrictions on foreign investment and nationalization of some of the largest foreign firms. On a more fundamental plane, the Velasco government saw its mission as one of eliminating class conflict and reconciling differences among interest groups within its own vision of a cooperative society.\n\n===Land reform===\n\nThe most striking and thorough reform imposed by the General Velasco's government was to eliminate all large private landholdings, converting most of them into cooperatives owned by prior workers on the estates. The reform was intended to destroy the basis of power of Peru's traditional elite and to foster a more cooperative society as an alternative to capitalism. Such socialpolitical purposes apparently dominated questions of agricultural production or any planned changes in patterns of land use. It was as if the questions of ownership were what mattered, not the consequences for output or rural incomes. In fact, the government soon created a system of price controls and monopoly food buying by state firms designed to hold down prices to urban consumers, no matter what the cost to rural producers.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the cooperatives had very mixed success; and the majority were converted into individual private holdings during the 1980s. The conversions were authorized in 1980 by changes in the basic land reform legislation and were put into effect after majority votes of the cooperative members in each case. The preferences of the people involved at that point clearly went contrary to the intent of the original reform. But the whole set of changes was not a reversion to the pre-reform agrarian structure. In fact, the conversions left Peru with a far less unequal pattern of landownership than it had prior to the reform and with a much greater role for family farming than ever before in its history.\n\n===Labor and capital in the industrial sector===\n\nIn line with its basic conception of social order, the Peruvian military junta government also created a complex system of \"industrial communities.\" Under this system, firms in the modern sector were required to distribute part of their profits to workers in the form of dividends constituting ownership shares. The intent was to convert workers into property owners and property ownership into a form of sharing for the sake of class reconciliation. But in practice, the system never functioned well. The firms did all they could to avoid reporting profits in order to postpone sharing ownership, sometimes by setting up companies outside the system to which they channeled profits, sometimes by adjusting the books, and in general by keeping one step ahead of intended regulations. A small fraction of the industrial workers gained shares in firms, but as a rule workers were not so much interested in long-term claims of ownership as they were in immediate working conditions and earnings. For organized labor, the whole approach seemed an attempt to subvert any role for union action and to make organization irrelevant. The system was not popular with either side. It was quickly abandoned when the more conservative wing of the military took power away from General Velasco in 1975.\n\nAttempted reform of labor relations in the mid-1970s also included severe restrictions on rights to discharge workers once they passed a brief trial period of employment. A review process set up to examine disputes was implemented in a way that made discharges practically impossible. Businesspeople circumvented the restrictions to some degree by hiring workers on a temporary basis up to the point at which they would have to be kept and then letting them go before the restrictions applied. Businesspeople remained unremittingly hostile to this type of regulation, primarily on the grounds that it took away their main means of exercising discipline over their workers. This form of regulation was also eliminated shortly after Velasco lost power.\n\n===Protection and promotion of industry===\n\nAlong with the intention of resolving internal class conflict, the Velasco government determined to lessen Peru's dependency on the outside world. The two most important components of the strategy were a drive to promote rapid industrialization and an attack on the role of foreign firms. In contrast to the industrialization strategies of most other Latin American countries, the intention of the Velasco regime was to industrialize without welcoming foreign investment.\n\nThe preceding Bela\u00fande administration had started Peru on the path of protection to promote industry, and in this respect the Velasco government reinforced rather than reversed the existing strategy. Beyond the usual recourse to high tariffs, Velasco's government adopted the Industrial Community Law of 1970 that gave any industrialist on the register of manufacturers the right to demand prohibition of any imports competing with his products. No questions of exceptionally high costs of production, poor product quality, or monopolistic positions fostered by excluding import competition were allowed to get in the way. Before the succeeding government of General Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez Cerrutti (1975\u201380) began to clean up the battery of protective exclusions in 1978, the average tariff rate reached 66 percent, accompanied by quantitative restrictions on 2,890 specific tariff positions.\n\nIn addition to the protective measures, the Velasco government promoted industrial investment by granting major tax exemptions, as well as tariff exemptions on imports used by manufacturers in production. The fiscal benefits given industrialists through these measures equaled 92 percent of total internal financing of industrial investment in the years 1971 through 1975.\n\nInvestment rose strongly in response to these measures, as well as to the concurrent rise in aggregate demand. But the tax exemptions also contributed to a rising public-sector deficit and thereby to the beginning of serious inflationary pressure. In addition, the exemptions from tariffs given to industrialists on their own imports of equipment and supplies led to a strong rise in the ratio of imports to production for the industrial sector.\n\n===Nationalizations and state firms===\n<ref>Fitzgerald, E. (1979). The political economy of Peru, 1956-78\u202f: economic development and the restructuring of capital . Cambridge\u202f;: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\nThe industrialization drive was meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors but definitely not welcoming them warmly. In that spirit, the Velasco regime immediately nationalized IPC in October 1968 and, not long after that, the largest copper mining company, while taking over other foreign firms more peacefully through buy-outs. The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru and led the way to a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.\n\nThe decision to nationalize the foreign oil firm was immensely popular in Peru. It was seen as a legitimate response to many years of close collaboration between the company, which performed political favors, and a series of possibly selfinterested Peruvian presidents, who, in exchange, preserved the company's exclusive drilling rights. Nationalization was perhaps less a matter of an economic program than a reaction to a public grievance, a reaction bound to increase public support for the new government.\n\nSubsequent nationalizations and purchases of foreign firms were more explicitly manifestations of the goals of building up state ownership and reducing foreign influence in Peru. The leaders of the military government subscribed firmly to the ideas of dependency analysis, placing much of the blame for problems of development on external influences through trade and foreign investment. Foreign ownership of natural resources in particular was seen as a way of taking away the country's basic wealth on terms that allowed most of the gains to go abroad. Ownership of the resources was expected to bring in revenue to the government, and to the country, that would otherwise have been lost.\n\nIn contrast to its abrupt nationalization of the IPC and then of the largest copper mining company, the government turned mainly to purchases through negotiation to acquire the property of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT) and foreign banks. Partly in response to United States reactions to the earlier nationalizations, and perhaps also partly in response to the realization that foreign investment might play a positive role in the industrialization drive, the government began to take a milder position toward foreign firms. But at the same time, it pursued a policy of creating new state-owned firms, in a sense competing for position against domestic private ownership, as well as against foreign ownership.\n\nState ownership of firms was, of course, consistent with the nationalizations but reflected a different kind of policy objective. Whereas the nationalizations were intended to gain greater Peruvian control over the country's resources and to reduce the scope of foreign influence, the proliferation of state-owned firms was meant to increase direct control by the government over the economy. State firms were seen as a means to implement government economic policies more directly than possible when working through private firms, whether domestic or foreign-owned. The goal was not to eliminate the private sector\u2014it was encouraged at the same time by tax favors and protection\u2014but to create a strong public sector to lead the way toward the kind of economy favored by the state.\n\nThe new state firms created in this period established a significant share of public ownership in the modern sector of the economy. By 1975 they accounted for over half of mining output and a fifth of industrial output. One set of estimates indicates that enterprises under state ownership came to account for a higher share of value added than domestic private capital: 26 percent of GDP for the state firms, compared with 22 percent for domestic private firms. The share produced by foreign-owned firms dropped to 8 percent from 21 percent prior to the Velasco government's reforms.\n\nContrary to the expectation that the earnings of the state firms would provide an important source of public financing for development, these companies became almost immediately a collective drain. In some measure, the drain was a result of decisions by the government to hold down their prices in order to lessen inflation or to subsidize consumers. In addition, deficits of the state-owned firms were aggravated by the spending tendencies of the military officers placed in charge of company management and by inadequate attention to costs of production. The collective deficits of the state enterprises plus the subsidies paid directly to them by the government reached 3 percent of GDP by 1975. State enterprises were not able to finance more than about one-fourth of their investment spending. The government attempted to answer the investment requirements of the state firms by allowing them to borrow abroad for imported equipment and supplies. They did so on a large scale. The external debt rose swiftly, for this and for other reasons discussed below.\n\nNationalizations and the creation of new state firms stopped abruptly after Velasco lost power. In 1980 the Bela\u00fande government announced a program to privatize most of the state firms, but it proved difficult to find private buyers, and few of the firms were actually sold. In the opposite direction, the subsequent Garc\u00eda government, in addition to nationalizing in 1985 the offshore oil production of the Belco Corporation, a United States company, tried in 1987 to extend state ownership over banks remaining in private hands. The attempted banking nationalization created a storm of protest and was eventually ruled to be illegal. The failures under both Bela\u00fande and Garc\u00eda to change the balance left the state-enterprise sector basically intact until Fujimori implemented major changes.\n\n===Macroeconomic imbalance: domestic and external===\n\nWhatever the promises and the costs of the many kinds of reform attempted by the Velasco government, the ship sank because of inadequate attention to balances between spending and productive capacity, and between export incentives and import demand. The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive external balance and productive capacity readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint on spending and deficits for several years but then let things get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 percent of GNP by 1975. Correspondingly, the external current-account balance was positive in the period 1968-70 but showed a deficit equal to 10 percent of GNP by 1975.\n\nThe external deficit was driven up primarily by high rates of growth of domestic demand and production through 1974. But in addition, the government's policy of holding to a fixed nominal exchange rate, in an increasingly inflationary context, allowed the real exchange rate to fall steadily from 1969 to 1975. The government refused to consider devaluation for fear it would worsen inflation and managed to avoid it by borrowing abroad to finance the continuing deficit. By 1975 external creditors had lost confidence in Peru's ability to repay its debts and began to put on the brakes. Whether because of such external pressure or because of growing internal opposition to the increasingly arbitrary decisions of the government, the Peruvian military decided to replace Velasco in 1975. The experiment ended on a note of defeat, not so much of its objectives as of its methods.\n\n==The 1980s==\nIn 1980, after 12 years of military rule, Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry was elected president. After a promising beginning, his popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, economic hardship, and terrorism; his government's lukewarm liberalization attempt failed in the context of the Latin American debt crisis, as per capita income declined, Peru's foreign debt burgeoned, and violence by leftist insurgents (notably Shining Path) rose steadily during the internal conflict in Peru, which was launched the day before Bela\u00fande's election. He continued many of the projects that were planned during his 1963\u20131968 term, including the completion of the Carretera Marginal de la Selva, a roadway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with then-isolated northern regions Amazonas and San Mart\u00edn.\n\nDuring the next years, the economic problems left behind by the junta government persisted, worsened by an occurrence of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon in 1982\u201383, which caused widespread flooding in some parts of the country, severe droughts in others, and decimated the schools of ocean fish that are one of the country's major resources.\n\nBela\u00fande's successor, Alan Garc\u00eda, was elected to office in 1985. His administration applied heterodox policies through the expansion of public expenditure and limitations on external debt payments.[1] With a parliamentary majority for the first time in APRA's history, Garc\u00eda's administration showed economic promise much as Bela\u00fande's had. Despite his initial popularity, Garc\u00eda's term in office was marked by bouts of hyperinflation, which reached 7,649% in 1990 and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% over his five-year term, profoundly destabilizing the Peruvian economy. As a result of this chronic inflation, the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|old sol]], was replaced by the inti in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the nuevo sol in July 1991; the new currency had an equivalent value of one billion old soles. During Garc\u00eda's administration, the per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below 1960 levels) and Peru's GDP dropped by 20%. By the end of his term, national reserves were a negative $900 million.[2]\n\nGarc\u00eda's term was also characterized by heavy increases in poverty. According to studies by the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the United Nations Development Programme, at the start of his presidency, 41.6% of Peruvians lived in poverty. By 1991, this figure had increased to 55%. Garc\u00eda also attempted to nationalize the banking and insurance industries. He incurred the wrath of the International Monetary Fund and the financial community by unilaterally declaring a limit on debt repayment equal to 10% of the gross national product, thereby isolating Peru from the international financial markets. One of his administration's most glaring failures was the ambitious multimillion-dollar [[Lima Metro]] that was completed only at the end of Garcia's second term 2011.\n\n==The Second Fernando Bela\u00fande Government 1980\u20131985==\n\nThe return to democracy allowed Peruvians to choose among strongly left, strongly conservative, or middle-of-the-road parties. They chose Bela\u00fande and his party as the middle road, but it led nowhere. The Bela\u00fande government tried to return the economy to a more open system by reducing barriers to imports, implementing financial reforms intended to foster private markets, and reversing the statist orientation of the Velasco system. But the new approach never had a chance to get very far because of a series of macroeconomic problems. On one side, the government was rightly concerned about continuing inflation but made the mistake of focusing the explanation on monetary growth arising from the export surplus it inherited at the start. That position made it seem undesirable to continue trying to promote exports and desirable to raise domestic spending and imports. On the other side, President Bela\u00fande's personal and political objectives included using public investment actively to develop the interior of the country and to answer evident needs for improved infrastructure. Seeing the export surplus as the key macroeconomic source of imbalance, the government decided to eliminate it by removing import restrictions, slowing nominal devaluation to allow the real exchange rate to appreciate, and increasing government investment spending.\n\nThe real exchange rate appreciated through 1981 and 1982, public sector investment rose 54 percent in real terms from 1979 to 1982, and public sector consumption rose 25 percent during the same three-year period. The combination effectively turned the current-account surplus into a large deficit, as increased spending plus import liberalization practically doubled imports of goods and services between 1979 and 1981. The appreciation also turned manufacturing exports back downward, and a plunge in external prices of primary exports brought them down too. And then the mistake of focusing on the earlier export surplus as the main cause of inflation became clear: the increases in spending led to a leap of inflation despite the return to an external deficit. The rate of inflation went from 59 percent in 1980 to 111 percent by 1983.\n\nNothing improved when the government then tried to go into reverse with contractionary macroeconomic policies and renewed depreciation. Output plunged, but inflation once more went up instead of down, to 163 percent by 1985. By this time, pessimism about the government's capacity to solve anything, inflationary expectations turning into understandable convictions, and the price-increasing effect of devaluation all combined to give Peru a seemingly unstoppable inflation despite the elimination of anything that might be considered excess demand. The government apparently lost its sense of direction, retreated from its attempt to reopen the economy by returning to higher tariff levels, and otherwise did little except wait for its own end in 1985.\n\n==The First Alan Garc\u00eda Government 1985\u20131990==\n\nWith the market-oriented choice of economic strategy discredited by results under Bela\u00fande, Peruvians voted for the dynamic populist-reformist promise of Garc\u00eda and responded enthusiastically to his sweeping changes. Garc\u00eda's program worked wonders for two years, but then everything began to go wrong.\n\nThe main elements of the economic strategy proposed by the Garc\u00eda government were full of promise. They recognized the prior neglect of the agricultural sector and called for redirecting public programs toward promotion of agricultural growth and reduction of rural poverty. Correspondingly, economic activity was to be decentralized to break down its high concentration in Lima, and within the cities resources were to be redirected away from the capital-intensive and import-intensive modern sector to the labor-intensive informal sector. A strategy of concertaci\u00f3n (national understanding) with private business leaders on economic issues was to be used systematically to avoid disruptive conflict. Problems of external balance were to be answered both by restructuring production to lessen dependence on imports and by reorienting toward higher exports over the long-term.\n\nThese goals for structural change could have improved the efficiency of resource allocation while doing a great deal to lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.\n\n===The first 2 years 1985\u20131987===\n\nThe first two years of the Garc\u00eda government gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better after so many years of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic to see the whole process unravel so quickly, once things started going wrong again. The first sign of trouble came, as it often had, from the balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.\n\nBesides higher employment and living standards, the first two years of economic revival seemed to offer a break in the cycle of rising rural violence. The flow of displaced peasants from the Sierra eased, and a good many peasants began to return to the countryside.\n\nTo stop inflation, the government opted for heterodox policies of control within an expansionary program. Prices and wages in the modern sector were to be fixed, after an initial one-shot increase in wage rates. The increase in wages was intended to raise living standards of workers and stimulate production by raising sales to consumers. To offset the effects of higher wages on costs of production, financial costs of the business sector were cut by intervention in order to reduce and control interest rates. After making one adjustment of the exchange rate to minimize negative effects on exports, the government stopped the process of continuing devaluation in order to help hold down inflation. Imports were rightly expected to go up as the economy revived; to help finance them, Garc\u00eda made his controversial decision to stop paying external debt service beyond 10 percent of the value of exports. Unorthodox as they were, all the pieces seemed to fit. At least, they went together well at the start under conditions of widespread idle capacity, with an initially strong balance of payments position.\n\nThe macroeconomic measures worked wonders for production. GDP shot up 9.5 percent in 1986 and a further 7.7 percent in 1987. Manufacturing output and construction both increased by more than one-fourth in these two years. An even greater surprise was that agricultural production per capita went up, running counter to its long downward trend. And the rate of inflation came down from 163 percent in 1985 to 78 percent in 1986, although it edged back up to 86 percent in 1987. In response to stronger market conditions and perhaps also to growing confidence that Peru's economic problems were at last being attacked successfully, private fixed investment went up by 24 percent in 1986, and capital flight went down.\n\nThe government avoided any spending spree of its own: central government spending was actually reduced in real terms each year. But because the government also reduced indirect taxes in order to encourage higher private consumption and to reduce costs for private business, its originally small deficit grew each year. The economic deficit of the nonfinancial public sector as a whole (excluding interest payments) went up from 2.4 percent of GDP in 1985 to 6.5 percent by 1987.\n\nAlthough the government reduced its total spending, it managed to support a new public works program to provide temporary employment and to direct more resources to rural producers as intended in its program for structural change. Three lines of policy helped especially to raise rural incomes. The first was to use generous guaranteed prices for key food products. The second was to provide greatly increased agricultural credit, financed essentially by credit from the Central Bank. The third was to exempt most of the non-guaranteed agricultural prices from controls, allowing their prices to rise sharply relative to those of industrial products from the modern sector. From July 1985 to December 1986, prices of goods and services not under control increased more than three times as much as those under control. Wholesale prices in manufacturing increased 26 percent, but those for agricultural products increased 142 percent.\n\n===From inflation to hyperinflation, 1988\u20131990===\nThe Garc\u00eda government reacted to the growing external deficit in exactly the same way as had the governments of Velasco and of Bela\u00fande\u2014by postponing corrective action while the problem continued to worsen. As ever, a major fear was that devaluation would worsen inflation. Inflationary pressures were, in fact, beginning to worsen behind the fa\u00e7ade of control. To some degree, they were growing in response to the high rate of growth of demand and output, reducing margins of previously underutilized productive capacity. But the more explosive pressures were being built up by relying on price controls that required a dramatic expansion of credit to keep the system in place. Prices of public sector services\u2014gasoline above all, oil products in general, electricity, telephones, and postal services\u2014were frozen at levels that soon became almost ridiculous in real terms. The restrictions on prices charged by state firms drove them ever deeper into deficits that had to be financed by borrowing. The borrowing came from wherever it could, but principally from the Central Bank. At the same time, Central Bank credit rose steadily to keep financing [[agricultural expansion]]. Still another direction of Central Bank credit creation was the financing used to handle the government's new structure of multiple exchange rates. Differential rates were used to hold down the cost of foreign exchange for most imports, again with the dominant goal of holding down inflation, while higher prices of foreign exchange were paid to exporters to protect their incentives to export. The Central Bank thus paid more for the foreign exchange it bought than it received for the exchange it sold.\n\nThe term used for these leakages\u2014for extensions of Central Bank credit that did not count in the government's budget deficit\u2014is the \"quasi-fiscal deficit.\" Its total increased from about 2 percent of GDP in 1985 to about 4 percent in 1987. Meanwhile, the government's tax revenue fell steadily in real terms, partly because of tax reductions implemented to hold down business costs and partly because of the effect of inflation in cutting down the real value of tax payments. Added together, the fiscal deficit plus the quasi-fiscal deficit increased from 5 percent of GDP in 1985 to 11 percent by 1987.\n\nThe two horsemen of this particular apocalypse\u2014the external deficit and the swift rise of Central Bank credit\u2014would have made 1988 a bad year no matter what else happened. But President Garc\u00eda guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No one has yet been able to explain why he decided to do so. It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Garc\u00eda government tried a series of major and minor new policy packages from early 1988 into 1990 to no avail. The new policies never succeeded in shutting off the rapid infusion of Central Bank credit that was feeding inflation, even when they did succeed in driving production down significantly in 1989. Manufacturing production fell 18 percent in that year, agricultural output 3 percent, and total GDP 11 percent. Simultaneously, inflation increased from a record 666 percent in 1988 to a new record of 3,399 percent for 1989. The one positive change was the external current-account deficit: the fall in domestic production and income was so steep that the current account went from a deep deficit to a substantial surplus. The internal cost was perhaps clearest in terms of real wages: the minimum wage in real terms for urban labor fell 61 percent between 1987 and 1989, and average real wages in manufacturing fell 59 percent.\n\nCritics of Garc\u00eda's presidency claim that his many poor decisions while in office created an environment that led to the rise of an authoritarian leader like Alberto Fujimori, who came to power in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. Faced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the auto-golpe of April 5, 1992. He then revised the constitution; called for new congressional elections, and undertook a process of economic liberalization which put an end to price controls, discarded protectionism, eliminated restrictions on foreign direct investment and privatized most state companies.[3] The reforms allowed sustained economic growth, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[4]\n\nHowever, by 1990 the [[neoliberal]] government of [[Alberto Fujimori]] ended abruptly the soviet minded economic policies with the so-called \u00b4Fuji Shock\u00b4of August 7, 1990.\n\n==The Fujimori Government 1990\u20132000==\n\n'''Alberto Fujimori Fujimori'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infogob.com.pe/Politico/ficha.aspx?IdPolitico=3862454&IdTab=1|title=INFOgob|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> ({{IPA-es|al\u02c8\u03b2e\u027eto fuxi\u02c8mo\u027ei|lang}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-es|fu\u029di\u02c8mo\u027ei|}}<small>;</small> {{IPA-ja|\u0278\u026f\u0291i\ua71cmo\u027ei|lang}}; born 28 July 1938) served as [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of Peru]] from 28 July 1990 to 17 November 2000.

He capitalized on profound disenchantment with previous president [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] and his [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] party (APRA). He exploited popular distrust of Vargas Llosa's identification with the existing Peruvian political establishment, and uncertainty about Vargas Llosa's plans for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms. Fujimori won much support from the poor, who had been frightened by Vargas Llosa's austerity proposals.\n\nDuring the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed ''El Chino'', which roughly translates to \"[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]\"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called ''chino'' in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection.<ref>Interview with Fujimori, in Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''</ref> With his election victory, he became the first person of [[East Asia]]n descent to become [[head of government]] of a Latin American nation, and just the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after [[Arthur Chung]] of [[Guyana]] and [[Henk Chin A Sen]] of [[Suriname]] (each of whom had served as [[head of state]], rather than head of government).\n\n==First term: July 28, 1990 \u2013 July 28, 1995==\n\n===Fujishock===\nDuring his first term in office, Fujimori enacted wide-ranging neoliberal reforms, known as ''Fujishock''.

In time, it became absorbed into the group of ideas about economics, that are sometimes referred to as neoliberalism. The economist Jeffrey Sachs coined the expression of shock therapy. The alleged difference between the two shock expressions lies only in the degree of economic liberalisation. Sachs' ideas were based on studying historic periods of monetary and economic crisis and noting that a decisive stroke could end monetary chaos, often in a day.[1] Whereas, Sachs' shock therapy notion views liberalisation as a necessary evil, a fast\u2014as well as nasty\u2014way to achieve economic stabilisation.\n\nThe first instance of shock therapy were the neoliberal pro-market reforms of Chile in 1975, carried out after the military coup by Augusto Pinochet. The reforms, dubbed a shock policy at the time by Milton Friedman, were based on the liberal economic ideas centred around the University of Chicago. Many of the Chilean economists who drafted the reforms came from there and were collectively dubbed the \"Chicago Boys\".\n\nThe term was truly born after Bolivia successfully tackled hyperinflation in 1985 under Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, using Sach's ideas. In particular Sachs and Sanchez de Lozada cited West Germany as inspiration where, during a period over 1947\u201348, price controls and government support were withdrawn over a very short period, kick-starting the German economy and completing its transition from an authoritarian post-War state.\n\nNeoliberalism rose to prominence after the 1970s and neoliberal shock therapy became increasingly used as a response to economic crises, for example by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Neoliberal shock therapy became very controversial, with its proponents arguing that it helped to end economic crises, stabilise economies and pave the way for growth, while its critics (like Joseph Stiglitz) believed that it helped deepen them unnecessarily[2] and created unnecessary social suffering.\n\nSachs' ideas were applied to the post-communist states in their transition to capitalist systems with very mixed results. Some countries that used shock therapy (e.g., Poland, Czech Republic) did better than those that did not. To further cloud understanding, China made its highly successful transition in a gradualist fashion. An opinion [3] is that successful market economies rest on a framework of law, regulation, and established practice[4] that cannot be instantaneously created in a society that was formerly authoritarian, heavily centralised and subject to state ownership of assets.\n\nThe evening of August 7, 1990, is known in Peru as the D-day of the neoliberal shock therapy that the Fujimori administration imposed upon Peru and the beginning neo-liberal economic scheme that governs the Peruvian economy to this day. The term \u00b4Fuji Shock\u00b4 was truly born in Peru after Fujimori's government successfully tackled hyperinflation in 1991, using Sach's ideas. In particular Sachs and Fujimori cited Chile as inspiration where, during a period over 1973\u20131976, price controls and government support were withdrawn over a very short period, kick-starting the Chilean economy and completing its transition from a soviet inspired cold war to a liberal state. Fujimori's shock terapy was a total reversal of practically all the economic policies of the previous 20 years by preceding governments, from Velasco's soviet socialism to Alan Garcia's yugoslav inspired socialism in conditions that clearly required drastic corrective action. \nIts main immediate target was to stop the runaway course of inflation. Beyond that, the goals included repudiating protection and import substitution, returning to full participation in the world trading and financial systems, eliminating domestic price controls and subsidies, raising public revenue and holding government spending strictly to the levels of current revenue, initiating a social emergency program to reduce the shock of adjustment for the poor, and devoting a higher share of the country's resources to rural investment and correction of the causes of rural poverty. In practice, new measures came out in bits and pieces, dominated by immediate concern to stop inflation; actions taken in the first year did not complete the program.\n\nPreoccupation with inflation was natural enough, after the steep rise of 1989 and the months immediately preceding the change of government. The monthly rate of inflation ranged between 25 percent and 32 percent in the second half of 1989, exceeded 40 percent in June 1990, and amounted to 78 percent by July. The deficit of the central government increased from 4 percent of GDP in January 1990 to 9 percent by May. The money supply of the country increased six times over from January to the end of July. The new government had to act quickly, and did.\n\nThe most dramatic immediate action was to eliminate price controls for private-sector products and to raise prices of public-sector products to restore financial balance for public firms. The price of gasoline, previously driven down to the equivalent of twelve United States cents a gallon, was multiplied by thirty times. For the consumer price index (CPI), the shocks caused an increase of 136 percent in one day.\n\nEliminating price controls in the private sector and raising prices charged by state firms had three objectives. First, the price increases for the public-sector firms and government services were meant to restore revenue to a level that would allow the government to stop borrowing from the Central Bank. Second, the rise in prices was intended to reduce aggregate demand by cutting the liquidity of business and the purchasing power of the public. Third, with everything priced far higher relative to public purchasing power, it was expected that market forces would begin to operate to drive some prices back down, reversing the long trend of increases in order to help break the grip of inflationary expectations.\n\nTo back up the impact of the price shocks, the government declared that it would keep its own expenditure within the limit of current revenue and stop the other two large streams of Central Bank credit creation: Central Bank financing for agricultural credit and for the system of subsidies supporting differential exchange rates. The multiple exchange rates in effect under Garc\u00eda were to be unified, and the unified rate was to be determined by market forces. Further, competition from imports to restrain inflation and access to imported supplies for production would both be improved by taking away quantitative restrictions and reducing tariff rates.\n\nThe new policies helped greatly to bring down the rate of inflation, although they fell short of accomplishing full stabilization. Against an inflation rate that had reached approximately 2,300 percent for the twelve months to June 1990, the rate of 139 percent for the twelve months to December 1991 can be seen as a dramatic improvement. But the latter was still more than double the government's intended ceiling for 1991 and still extremely high relative to outside world rates of inflation. The last quarter of 1991 looked more promising, with the monthly rate down to 4 percent, but it had risen to 7 percent by March 1992. Inflationary dangers clearly remained troublesome, especially in view of two factors that should have stopped inflation more decisively: a deeply depressed level of domestic demand and an unintended increase in the real exchange rate, making dollars cheaper.\n\nDomestic demand has been held down by the combination of the price shock at the start of the stabilization program, steeply falling real wages, reduced government deficits, and much tighter restraint of credit. All these were deliberate measures to stop inflation, accepting the likely costs of higher unemployment and restraint of production as necessary to that end. In 1990 GNP fell 3.9 percent, aggravating the plunge of 19 percent between 1988 and 1990. In 1991 production turned up slightly, with a gain of 2.9 percent in GNP. That situation left output per capita essentially unchanged from 1990 and at 29 percent below its level a decade earlier.\n\nThe incomplete success in stopping inflation created an extremely difficult policy conflict. Recovery could in principle be stimulated by more expansionary credit policies and lower interest rates, which would favor increased investment, depreciation of the currency to help producers compete against imports, and improved exports. But continuing inflation and the fear of accelerating its rate of increase argued instead for keeping a very tight rein on credit and thereby blocked the actions needed for recovery. This conflict became particularly acute over the question of what to do about the exchange note: the real exchange rate went in exactly the wrong direction for recovery by appreciating when depreciation was both expected and needed.\n\nThe decision to remove controls on the exchange rate had been expected to lead to a much higher foreign-exchange price, to encourage exports, and to permit import liberalization without a surging external deficit. But when the rate was set free, the price of dollars went down instead of going up. That initial effect could be explained by the tight restraints imposed on liquidity, which drove firms and individuals who held dollar balances to convert them to domestic currency in order to keep operating. This movement should presumably have gone into reverse when holdings of dollars ran out, but fully eighteen months later no reversal had occurred. Dollars remained too cheap to make exports profitable and too cheap for many producers to compete against imports for several reasons, including the continuing influx of dollars from the drug trade into street markets and then into the banking system. A second reason has involved the continuing low level of domestic income and production, and corresponding restraint of demand for imports as compared with what they would be in an expanding economy. But perhaps the most fundamental reasons have been the continuing squeeze on liquidity in terms of domestic currency and the resulting high rates of interest for borrowing domestic currency, which strongly favor borrowing dollars instead or repatriating them from abroad. All this means that the economy has had no foreign-exchange problem, but also that incentives to produce for export have been held down severely, when both near-term recovery and longer-term growth badly need the stimulus of rising exports.\n\nThe government was more successful in the part of its program aimed at trade liberalization. As has been noted, the average tariff rate was cut greatly in two steps, in September 1990 and March 1991. Quantitative restrictions were eliminated, and the tariff structure was greatly simplified. Effective protection was brought down to a lower level than at any point since the mid1960s, with a more coherent structure that left much less room for distorted incentives.\n\nFujimori is credited by many Peruvians for bringing stability to the country after the violence and hyperinflation of the Garc\u00eda years. While it is generally agreed that the \"Fujishock\" brought short/middle-term macroeconomic stability, the long-term social impact of Fujimori's free market economic policies is still hotly debated.\n\nNeoliberal reforms under Fujimori took place in three distinct phases: an initial \"orthodox\" phase (1990\u201392) in which technocrats dominated the reform agenda; a \"pragmatic\" phase (1993\u201398) that saw the growing influence of business elites over government priorities; and a final \"watered-down\" phase (1999\u20132000) dominated by a clique of personal loyalists and their [[Clientelism|clientelist]] policies that aimed to secure Fujimori a third term as president. Business was a big winner of the reforms, with its influence increasing significantly within both the state and society.<ref name = \"Arce 2005\">{{cite book |last= Arce |first= Mois\u00e9s |year= 2005 |title= Market Reform in Society: Post-Crisis Politics and Economic Change in Authoritarian Peru |location= University Park, PA |publisher= [[Penn State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-271-02542-1 }}</ref>\n\n===Constitutional crisis===\n{{Main|Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992}}\n\nDuring Fujimori's first term in office, APRA and Vargas Llosa's party, [[Democratic Front (Peru)|FREDEMO]], remained in control of both chambers of Congress (the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Chamber of Deputies]] and [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Senate]]), hampering the government's ability to enact economic reforms.

He called elections for a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]] that would serve as a legislature and a [[constituent assembly]]. While [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] and [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action]] attempted to boycott this, the Popular Christian Party (PPC, not to be confused with PCP Partido Comunista del Peru) and many left-leaning parties participated in this election. His supporters won a majority in this body, and drafted a [[Constitution of Peru|new constitution]] in 1993. A referendum was scheduled, and the coup and the Constitution of 1993 were approved by a narrow margin of between four and five percent.\n\nLater in the year, on 13 November, there was a failed military coup, led by General [[Jaime Salinas Sed\u00f3]]. Salinas asserted that his efforts were a matter of turning Fujimori over for trial, for violating the Peruvian constitution.<ref>Conaghan, Catherine M. ''Fujimori's Peru: Deception in the Public Sphere''. 2006, page 55.</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Fujimori separated from his wife [[Susana Higuchi]] in a noisy, public divorce. He formally stripped her of the title [[First Lady]] in August 1994, appointing their elder daughter First Lady in her stead. Higuchi publicly denounced Fujimori as a \"tyrant\" and claimed that his administration was corrupt. They formally divorced in 1995.\n\n==Second term: July 28, 1995 \u2013 July 28, 2000==\nThe 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, and in April 1995, at the height of his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His major opponent, former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], won only 22 percent of the vote. Fujimori's supporters won comfortable majorities in the legislature. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the Peruvian military or police accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.\n\nDuring his second term, Fujimori signed a peace agreement with [[Ecuador]] over a [[History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] that had simmered for more than a century. The treaty allowed the two countries to obtain international funds for developing the border region. Fujimori also settled some unresolved issues with Chile, Peru's southern neighbor, outstanding since the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima of 1929]].<ref>Dominguez, Jorge ''et al.''

Peruvians now began to be more concerned about freedom of speech and the press.

A 1998 effort to repeal this law by referendum failed.<ref>David R.

Eventually, Fujimori was credited with 49.89%\u201420,000 votes short of avoiding a runoff. Despite reports of numerous irregularities, the international observers recognized an adjusted victory of Fujimori. His primary opponent, [[Alejandro Toledo]], called for his supporters to spoil their ballots in the runoff by writing \"No to fraud!\" on them (voting is mandatory in Peru). International observers pulled out of the country after Fujimori refused to delay the runoff.\n\nIn the runoff, Fujimori won with 51.1% of the valid votes. While votes for Toledo declined from 40.24% of the valid votes cast in the first round to 25.67% of the valid votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 2.25% of the total votes cast in the first round to 29.93% of total votes in the second round. The large percentage of votes cast as invalid suggested that many Peruvians took Toledo's advice to spoil their ballots.\n\n(The 51.1 and 25 figures are as percentages of valid votes, that is, excluding invalid votes. Thus, there were 29.93% invalid votes and 70.07% valid votes. Of this 70.07%, 51.1% were for Fujimori and 25.67% for Toledo.)\n\nAlthough Fujimori had won the runoff with only a bare majority, rumors of irregularities led most of the international community to shun his third swearing-in on 28 July. For the next seven weeks, there were daily demonstrations in front of the presidential palace.\n\nAs a conciliatory measure, Fujimori appointed former opposition candidate Federico Salas as the new prime minister. However, opposition parties in Parliament refused to support this move while Toledo campaigned vigorously to have the election annulled. At this point, a corruption scandal involving Vladimiro Montesinos broke out, and exploded into full force on the evening of 14 September 2000, when the cable television station [[Canal N]] broadcast footage of Montesinos apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri for his defection to Fujimori's ''Per\u00fa 2000'' party. This video was presented by [[Fernando Olivera]], leader of the FIM (Independent Moralizing Front), who purchased it from one of Montesinos's closest allies (nicknamed by the Peruvian press ''El Patriota'').\n\nFujimori's support virtually collapsed, and a few days later he announced in a nationwide address that he would shut down the SIN and call new elections\u2014in which he would not be a candidate. On 10 November, Fujimori won approval from Congress to hold elections on 8 April 2001. On 13 November, Fujimori left Peru for a visit to [[Brunei]] to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. On 16 November, [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] took over as president of Congress after the pro-Fujimori leadership lost a vote of confidence. On 17 November, Fujimori traveled from Brunei to Tokyo, where he submitted his presidential [[resignation]] via fax. The Peruvian Congress refused to accept his resignation, voting instead 62 yea \u20139 nay to remove Fujimori from the office of the president of Peru on the grounds that he was \"permanently morally disabled.\"\n\nOn November 19, Fujimori's government ministers presented their resignations en masse. Because Fujimori's first vice president, Francisco Tudela, had resigned a few days earlier, his successor Ricardo M\u00e1rquez was called the new president. Congress, however, refused to recognize him, as he was an ardent Fujimori loyalist; M\u00e1rquez resigned two days later. Paniagua was voted by the Peruvian Congress as the next in line, and became interim president to oversee the April elections.\n\n===Criticism===\nDetractors have observed that Fujimori was able to encourage large-scale mining projects with foreign corporations and push through mining-friendly legislation laws because the post auto-coup political picture greatly facilitated the process.\n\nSome analysts state that some of the GDP growth during the Fujimori years reflects a greater rate of extraction of non-renewable resources by transnational companies; these companies were attracted by Fujimori by means of near-zero royalties, and, by the same fact, little of the extracted wealth has stayed in the country.<ref>\"Chile, Peru \u2013 How much do mining companies contribute?

Shortly after coming to office Toledo met with IMF officials and promised that he would raise $700 million in 2002, and almost one billion dollars in 2003, by selling state assets.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_FVIOhdR9n8C&pg=PA535&dq=alejandro+toledo+free+trade#v=onepage&q=alejandro%20toledo%20free%20trade&f=false|title=A History of Latin America|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|isbn=978-0618783182|last1=Keen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Haynes|first2=Keith A.|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n==The Alejandro Toledo Administration 2001\u20132006==\n\nFormer Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo claims he is a living proof of [[The Peruvian Miracle]].<ref name=\"weeklystandard.com\">http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/peruvian-miracle_696104.html | http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/120217/peru-latin-america-economy-growth | http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-04-23/peru-s-stealthy-advance-toward-a-modern-economy | https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/peru-growth-in-a-time-of-recession/</ref> Toledo began shining shoes and selling lottery tickets as a boy in the Andes.

He inherited a national economy which in the previous decade had experienced an unstable GDP with periods of growth and shrinkage, as well as fiscal deficits frequently amounting to over 2% of GDP. Inflation had not dropped below 23% until 1995 and was still feared by many. In response, Toledo developed policies which focused on fighting poverty, generating employment, decentralizing government, and modernizing the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eC7D_m1KTV4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=alejandro+toledo#v=onepage&q=toledo&f=false|title=Peru's Relations with Pacific Asia|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|isbn=9783825888206|last1=Mann|first1=Stefanie|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nAmong Toledo's initiatives designed to generate revenue and transform the economy were plans to privatize national industries. The first major effort of this kind was the $167 million sale of two state-owned electric companies. Protests in the city of Arequipa turned violent as Peruvians reacted with anger to the prospect of layoffs and higher priced electricity. They also recalled that billions of dollars earned from privatization under the Fujimori administration had ended up filling the president's personal bank accounts. Toledo decided not to carry out the sale of electric companies, but promised to continue privatization efforts, which were a key provision of a deal struck with the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Toledo had promised to bring in US$700 million through privatization in 2001 and US$1 billion in 2002.<ref>Forero, Juan \"Peruvians Riot Over the Planned Sale of 2 Regional Power Plants\" ''The New York Times''18, June 2002.

[[Ollanta Humala]] has been its most vocal critic. Humala's [[Union for Peru]] won 45 of 120 seats in Congress in 2006, the largest share by a single party, prompting debate on ratification of the agreement before the new legislature was sworn in.

By planting crops to similar to those subsidized by the U.S., Peru faced a competitive disadvantage in the production of agricultural products because poor farming families with inadequate tools, technology and techniques may not be able to produce crops at low enough prices to export. In response to these concerns, Peruvian lawmakers created a Compensation Fund which directed $34 million per year to cotton, maize/corn, and wheat producers for a five-year period to help them adjust to the new competitive pressures.<ref>[http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?cc=&pushme=1&tmpFBSel=sel&totaldocs=&taggedDocs=Z3%3ACZ1%3A9Z4%3A1Z2%3A&toggleValue=&numDocsChked=5&prefFBSel=0&delformat=XCITE&fpDocs=&fpNodeId=&fpCiteReq=&expNewLead=id%3D%22expandedNewLead%22&brand=ldc&dedupeOption=0&T13=13&T14=14&T21=21&T24=24&T44=44&_m=b25310ca06c95e5101aed43f0564638e&docnum=13&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLzVtz-zSkAb&_md5=8b3fa70e011f0b65909af1841603d9c7&focBudTerms=&focBudSel=sel \"Peruvian Congress Passes U.S. Free-Trade Pact\"]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Retrieved May 2011</ref>\n\nToledo is therefore a market-oriented politician who continued to globalize Peru's economy and is rumored to be getting ready for another run for president. Toledo says bluntly that unless the poorest in the country are better educated, better paid, housed, and fed, the Peruvian economic miracle will stall.\n\n===Acuerdo Nacional===\n\nIn November 2001, Toledo opened talks which concluded in the National Accord of July 22, 2002.

The accord set forth twenty-four policy goals divided into four categories: democracy and the rule of law, [[equity (economics)|equity]] and [[social justice]], economic competitiveness, and an institutional framework of efficiency, transparency, and [[decentralization]].

These critics claim that companies buy land at unreasonable prices, force indigenous people off of land that is historically theirs, and exploit natural resources in ways that are harmful to communities and the environment. Peru is one of the largest producers of gold, silver, and zinc in Latin America, and some critics complain about the priority the Peruvian government gives to mining as opposed to industries like fishing and agriculture, with which indigenous peoples are more familiar.

Tax-collections, at below 12.1% of GDP, are stagnant, with most coming from a handful of large, formal companies.

The Cooperative Fund for Social Development funded projects to construct and improve schools, health clinics, rural roads, water and sanitation systems, and electric grids. Toledo placed food and infrastructure programs under the Ministry for Women and Social Development and urged that municipalities implement decentralization. Social safety-net spending in Peru remained well below the Latin American average under Toledo even as it covered a larger percentage of the population, which means that outlays were insufficient to lift many people up out of poverty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nToledo also attempted to improve access to healthcare in the most remote places. His Juntos program awarded a monthly benefit to poor families who agreed to get vaccinations and screenings, attend school, and obtain birth registration documents. The Toledo administration also provided financial incentives to young doctors who were willing to spend the first few years of their practices in remote areas.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nPeru faced a major housing deficit in 2001, with the majority of its urban population living in slums. Toledo's administration sought to improve access to affordable housing through subsidies, loans, down payments, land titling, and encouraging financial institutions to reach further down-market. Most of these efforts were grouped under the Fondo Mivivienda, which was program started in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nUnder Toledo's predecessor, Fujimori, the governing authority in Peru was condensed and centralized.  A Fujimori-dominated congress passed a new constitution in 1993, which consolidated the [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] into a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with a single national district. Under Fujimori local governments retained minimal legal authority including fees for utilities, basic civil registries, and management of public spaces and markets.\n\nDecentralization was among Toledo's most successful institutional reforms. In addition to announcing regional elections upon his inauguration, he charged a Decentralization and Regionalization Commission with developing proposals. In 2002, a constitutional amendment was approved which established three levels of government: local, regional, and national. Over the next few years, the congress gradually passed on resources and responsibilities to the regional and municipal governments including food programs, social development projects, and health and education programs.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> He divided the single district up, called for regional elections, and eliminated the centralist Ministry of the Presidency that had been instituted under Fujimori.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">J.

In August 2003, Toledo met with President Lula. They committed to increased political and economic cooperation under the Initiative for Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America which invests in large-scale, debt-heavy projects, aimed at developing 10 economic axes or hubs throughout South America. Construction projects, including roads, discussed. President Lula also agreed to allow Peru access to two surveillance systems which Brazil had developed in the Amazon Basin to target legal and illegal activity.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nWhile Peru and Ecuador had been at peace for years, President Toledo worked to solidify and build upon that peace. During a 2001 visit to Ecuador, Toledo expressed support for the Bras\u00edlia Accords, agreed to the demilitarization of the two countries\u2019 common border, advocated reduced military spending, and agreed to greater energy, transportation, and police cooperation. Toledo joined Ecuadorian President Noboa at the International Advisory Committee of the Binational Development Plan, where they called for greater investment in their region, with Toledo putting forth a detailed program for international assistance. Economic activity in the region subsequently improved as the demining of the border continued, construction projects were completed, and military forces were reduced. By 2006, investment in the area had reached $1.2 billion.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nPresident Toledo worked hard throughout his presidency on what became a very productive relationship with the U.S., and what Toledo described as a personal friendship with President Bush. He received lavish praise from the American president for his economic and domestic security policies. During a visit to Peru, Bush announced the establishment of an Andean Center of Excellence for Teacher Training, with a base in Peru, and a fellowship program to give Andean professionals access to education in information technology. In June 2002, the U.S. agreed to forgive $14 million of Peru's debt in exchange for a promise to invest $12 million in conservation projects. In September, Toledo secured a $300 million commitment from Bush to fund alternative-crop development in coca-producing areas.

Thanks to strong foreign investment and the cooperation between the Fujimori government and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, growth was strong in 1994-97 and inflation was brought under control. In 1998, El Ni\u00f1o's impact on agriculture, the financial crisis in Asia, and instability in Brazilian markets undercut growth. 1999 was another lean year for Peru, with the aftermath of El Ni\u00f1o and the Asian financial crisis working its way through the economy. Lima did manage to complete negotiations for an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF in June 1999, although it subsequently had to renegotiate the targets.\n\nPeru's exponential per-capita growth rates has been standard the last quarter century. Peru's GDP per capita is now FY 2013 at US$12,000 PPP. By the end of 2006 the government had enacted measures that allowed the economy to improve by increasing investments, expanding production and exports. Raw materials and agroindustrial products represent half of exports with the other half being non-traditional exports such as clothing, electronics, machinery and services. By the end of the decade of 2014, investment is expected to total US$65 billion for mining activities, US$20 billion in energy and petroleum, US$12 billion for commerce, US$18 billion for agricultural industries, and US$15 billion for tourism. Thanks to the discovery and exploitation of large petroleum and natural gas reserves in southern Peru in the [[Cusco]] and [[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]] regions by Consorcio Camisea, Peru is expected[who?] to become an important exporter of hydrocarbons by 2015, after being a net importer for decades.\n\nPositive results have begun to appear after 15 years, reflecting an expanding global economy; according to figures provided by the INEI, in 2007 the gross national product grew by 8.99%, exports grew by over 35% (reaching US$27.8 billion), private and public investments accounted for 21% of the GDP (24.4% in 2008), net international reserves (including gold) reached US$35.1 billion, state income from taxation increased by 33%, national debt with respect to GNP was reduced from 50% in 2000 to 34% in 2006; finally, the national budget has grown by 50% in the five years before 2007.\n\nIn 2007, the Peruvian economy experienced a growth rate of 9%, the highest in Latin America, and this repeated in 2008 with a 9.8% rate; in 2006 and 2007, the [[Lima Stock Exchange]] grew by 185.24%\n<ref>[http://www.bvl.com.pe/english/estadist/dat_infostat_en.pdf Bolsa de Valores de Lima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808150533/http://www.bvl.com.pe/english/estadist/dat_infostat_en.pdf |date=2007-08-08 }}</ref> and 168.3%,<ref>[http://www.bvl.com.pe/publi_infmensuales.html Bolsa de Valores de Lima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714134300/http://www.bvl.com.pe/publi_infmensuales.html |date=2008-07-14 }}</ref> respectively.

Peru agricultural exports are highly appreciated and include artichokes, grapes, avocados, mangoes, peppers, sugarcane, organic coffee and premium-quality cotton.\n\n===Industry and services===\n\n====Extraction====\nFishing: Peru is an international leader in [[fishing]], producing nearly 10 percent of the world's fish catch.\n\n[[Mining in Peru]]: Peru ranks fifth worldwide in [[gold]] production ( first in [[Latin America]] ), second in [[copper]], and is among the top five producers of [[lead]] and [[zinc]].\n\n==== Manufacturing ====\nPeru has developed a medium manufacturing sector. The sector now represents 23 percent of GDP and is tied heavily to mining, fishing, agriculture, construction and textiles. Manufacturing is mainly devoted to processing to gain a value-added advantage. The most promising sector is textiles, metal mechanics, food industry, agricultural industry, manufactures, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery and services.\n\n==== Services ====\nTourism has represented a new growth industry in Peru since the early 1990s, with the government and private sector dedicating considerable energies to boosting the country's tourist destinations both to Peruvians and foreigners.\n\n===Natural resources===\nPeru's natural resources are copper, silver, gold, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, and natural gas.\n\n==External trade and investment==\n\n===Foreign investment and balance of payments===\n\n====Foreign trade and balance of payments====\n[[File:Peru Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Peru's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\nIn 2001 the current account deficit dropped to about 2.2% of GDP ([[US dollar|US$]]1.17 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]])--from 3.1% in 2000\u2014while the trade balance registered a small deficit. Exports dropped slightly to $7.11 billion, while imports fell 2.1% to $7.20 billion. After being hit hard by El Ni\u00f1o in 1998, fisheries exports have recovered, and minerals and metals exports recorded large gains in 2001 and 2002, mostly as a result of the opening of the Antamina copper-zinc mine. By mid-2002, most sectors of the economy were showing gains. After several years of substantial growth, foreign direct investment not related to privatization fell dramatically in 2000 and 2001, as well as in the first half of 2002. Net international reserves at the end of May 2002 stood at $9.16 billion, up from $8.6 billion (2001), $17 billion at the end of 2006, over $20 billion in 2007, and over $35 billion in May 2008. Peru has signed a number of free trade agreements, including the 2007 [[United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement]], and agreements with [[Chile]], [[Canada]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[China]]. Under President Alan Garcia administration Peru achieved a bilateral trade agreement with U.S. since 2010 to improve exports for its country and reach in August 2011 its pick in exports of more than 4,700 MM.\n\n====Foreign investment====\n[[File:Puerto de Callao.jpg|thumb|right|The Port of Callao is Peru's gateway for exports and imports]]\nThe Peruvian government actively seeks to attract both foreign and domestic investment in all sectors of the economy. International investment was spurred by the significant progress Peru made during the 1990s toward economic, social, and political stability, but it slowed again after the government delayed privatizations and as political uncertainty increased in 2000. President Alejandro Toledo has made investment promotion a priority of his government. While Peru was previously marked by terrorism, hyperinflation, and government intervention in the economy, the Government of Peru under former President Alberto Fujimori took the steps necessary to bring those problems under control. Democratic institutions, however, and especially the judiciary, remain weak.\n\nThe Government of Peru's economic stabilization and liberalization program lowered trade barriers, eliminated restrictions on capital flows, and opened the economy to foreign investment, with the result that Peru now has one of the most open investment regimes in the world. Between 1992 and 2001, Peru attracted almost $17 billion in foreign direct investment in Peru, after negligible investment until 1991, mainly from [[Spain]] (32.35%),<ref>{{cite journal|title = Foreign investment statistics (in Spanish)| url = http://www.proinversion.gob.pe/0/0/modulos/JER/PlantillaStandardsinHijos.aspx?ARE=0&PFL=0&JER=1537}}</ref> the [[United States]] (17.51%), [[Switzerland]] (6.99%), [[Chile]] (6.63%), and [[Mexico]] (5.53%). The basic legal structure for foreign investment in Peru is formed by the 1993 constitution, the [[Private Investment Growth Law]], and the November 1996 [[Investment Promotion Law]]. Although Peru does not have a bilateral investment treaty with the United States, it has signed an agreement (1993) with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation ([[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]]) concerning OPIC-financed loans, guarantees, and investments. Peru also has committed itself to arbitration of investment disputes under the auspices of ICSID (the [[World Bank]]'s[[International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]]) or other international or national arbitration tribunals.\n\n==Currency==\n\nThe [[Peruvian sol|sol]] is the currency of Peru. The exchange rate as of March 23, 2020 is 3.53 soles to the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] and 3.82 soles to the [[Euro]]. It was instated in 1991, when the Peruvian government abandoned the [[Peruvian inti|inti]] due to [[hyperinflation]] of the currency; the nuevo sol has since maintained the lowest inflation rate in Latin America.<ref>San Jos\u00e9 State University Department of Economics, [http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/peru.htm#GARCIA The economic history and the economy of Peru].

The name ''sol'' comes from the Latin ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', and is also the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"[[sun]]\", which the ancient [[Inca]] civilization worshiped as the god [[Inti]].\n\nThe nuevo sol currently enjoys a low inflation rate of 2.5%.<ref name=\"IMF\" /> Since it was put into use, the sol's exchange rate with the [[United States dollar]] has stayed mostly between 2.80 and 3.30 to 1. Out of all the currencies of the Latin American region, the sol is the most stable and reliable, being the least affected by the downturn in the value of the US dollar; during late 2007 and early 2008, the exchange rate fell to 2.69 to 1, which had not been seen since 1997. The exchange rate is set on a daily basis by the ''Banco Central de Reserva del Per\u00fa'' (Central Reserve Bank of Peru).\n\nThe sol is divided into 100 [[c\u00e9ntimo]]s. The highest-denomination banknote is the 200 soles note; the lowest-denomination coin is the rarely used 5 c\u00e9ntimos coin.\n\n==Income and consumption==\n\nPeru divides its population into five socio-economic classes, A-E, with A representing the rich; B, the upper middle class; C, the middle class; D, the working class and low income families; and E, the marginalized poor. In 2018, the segments were described as \"crude\" by Miguel Planas of the Ministry of Finance due to the complicated structure of the society in Peru, where some classes make money off of illegal trade which aren't counted in the GDP, and are thus falsely classified as low income or marginalised poor families.\n\n==Employment==\nUnemployment in Greater Lima is 5.6%, while for the rest of Peru is 7%.

President [[Alejandro Toledo]] implemented a recovery program after taking office, maintained largely orthodox economic policies, and took measures to attract investment, including restarting the privatization program. Nonetheless, political uncertainty led to GDP growth of 0.2% in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Lima Stock Exchange general index fell 34.5% in 2000 and 0.2% in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Inflation remained at record lows, registering 3.7% in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe year 2001 saw [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] of 0.1%.

Peru's stability brought about a substantial reduction in [[underemployment]], from an average of 74% from the late 1980s through 1994 to 43% in the 1995-96 period, but the rates began climbing again in 1997\u20132002 to over half the working population. The poverty rate remained at 54% in 2001, with 24% of Peruvians living in extreme poverty.

Alternative crops, however, are not economically comparable to coca.  2004 prices indicate an annual income per hectare of $600 for coffee and $1000 for cocoa, versus up to $7500 for a hectare of coca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devida.gob.pe|title=DEVIDA - Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Desarrollo y Vida sin Drogas|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Effect on family economies====\nThe anti-coca policies imposed in 1995 have had adverse effects on Peruvian's household economies.  Many families dependent on coca farming have been forced to send their children to work as eradication of crops has decreased their household income.<ref name=\"Dammert\"/>  In states where coca is grown, [[child labour]] increased by 18% in 1997 and 40% in 2000. Work hours and domestic work increased as well, with girls taking on 28% more domestic work with boys doing 13% more.  Wage work for adults also increased since 1995.  As such, it can be inferred that the increase in child labour since eradication policies have come into effect is caused by children filling in for working parents.<ref name=\"Dammert\"/><br />\nHowever, the issue of child labour in coca production is still present in Peru as reported in 2013 in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s report ''Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor'' and in December 2014, in the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''.\n\n===Corruption===\nPeru is the 101st least corrupt country in the world according to [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].\n\nThe Peruvian organization ''\"Ciudadanos al Dia\"'' has started to measure and compare transparency, costs, and efficiency in different government departments in Peru. It annually awards the best practices which has received widespread media attention. This has created competition among government agencies in order to improve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more|title=Private Sector Development|accessdate=11 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920181947/http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more|archive-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA last case of corruption was the [[2008 Peru oil scandal]].\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Poverty Rate in Peru 2004 to 2012.png|350px|thumbnail|right|Peru's poverty rate from 2004 to 2012.]]\n'''Household income or consumption by percentage share:'''\n<br />''lowest 10%:''\n0.8%\n<br />''highest 10%:''\n37.5% (2000)\n\n'''Inflation rate (consumer prices):'''\n2.08% (2010)\n\n'''Budget:'''\n<br />''revenues:''\n$57 billion (2014 est.)\n<br />''expenditures:''\n$50 billion, including long-term capital expenditures of $3.8 billion (2010 est.)\n\n'''Industrial production growth rate:'''\n12% (2013 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - production:'''\n175,500 GWh (2013 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - production by source:'''\n<br />''natural gas:''\n44.53%\n<br />''hydro:''\n54.79%\n<br />''nuclear:''\n0%\n<br />''other:''\n0.68% (2013)\n\n'''Electricity - consumption:'''\n133,000 GWh (2013)\n\n'''Electricity - exports:'''\n32,000 kWh (2013) mainly to Ecuador\n\n'''Electricity - imports:'''\n0 kWh (2013)\n\n'''Agriculture - products:'''\n[[coffee]], [[cotton]], [[sugarcane]], [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[potato]]es, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[coca]]; [[poultry]], [[beef]], [[dairy]] products, [[wool]]; [[fish]]\n\n'''Exports:'''\n63.5 billion f.o.b.

The last Inca stronghold was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nFrom 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, including, besides Peru, large parts of modern Ecuador, western and south central Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and central Chile, and a small part of southern Colombia into a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia.\n\nThe official language of the empire was Quechua, although hundreds of local languages and dialects of [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] were spoken..\n\nThe Inca Empire, was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the [[Inca]]. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land. In fact, the Inca Empire was conceived like an ambitious and audacious civilizing project, based on a mythical thought, in which the harmony of the relationships between the human being, nature, and gods was truly essential. The economy was mainly agricultural, though it reached some animal husbandry and mining development. The primary goal of the Incan economy was substinence, with a system based on reciprocity and exchange of products.\n\nThe colonial-era sources are not entirely clear or in agreement about the nature of the structure of the Inca government. However, its basic structure can be spoken of broadly, even if the exact duties and functions of government positions cannot be told. At the top of the chain of administration sat the [[Sapa Inca]]. Next to the Sapa Inca in terms of power may have been the Willaq Umu, literally the \"priest who recounts\", who was the High Priest of the Sun.[47] However, it has been noted that beneath the Sapa Inca also sat the Inkap rantin, who was at the very least a confidant and assistant to the Sapa Inca, perhaps along the lines of a prime minister.[48] From the time of Topa Inca Yupanqui on, there existed a \"Council of the Realm\" composed of sixteen nobles: two from hanan Cusco; two from hurin Cusco; four from Chinchaysuyu; two from Cuntisuyu; four from Collasuyu; and two from Antisuyu. This weighting of representation balanced the hanan and hurin divisions of the empire, both within Cusco and within the Quarters (hanan suyukuna and hurin suyukuna).[49]\n\nWhile there was a great deal of variation in the form that Inca bureaucracy and government took at the provincial level, the basic form of organization was decimal. In this system of organization, taxpayers\u2014male heads of household of a certain age range\u2014were organized into corv\u00e9e labor units (which often doubled as military units) that formed the muscle of the state as part of mit'a service. Each level of jurisdiction above one hundred tax-payers was headed by a kuraka, while those heading smaller units were kamayuq, a lower, non-hereditary status. However, while kuraka status was hereditary, one's actual position within the hierarchy (which was typically served for life) was subject to change based upon the privileges of those above them in the hierarchy; a pachaka kuraka (see below) could be appointed to their position by a waranqa kuraka. Furthermore, it has been suggested that one kuraka in each decimal level also served as the head of one of the nine groups at a lower level, so that one pachaka kuraka might also be a waranqa kuraka, in effect directly responsible for one unit of 100 tax-payers and less directly responsible for nine other such units.[50]\n\nKuraka in Charge\tNumber of Taxpayers\nHunu kuraka\t             10,000\nPichkawaranqa kuraka\t      5,000\nWaranqa kuraka\t              1,000\nPichkapachaka kuraka\t        500\nPachaka kuraka\t                100\nPichkachunka kamayuq\t         50\nChunka kamayuq\t                 10\n\n=== [[Viceroy of Peru]] 1531\u20131821 ===\n\nThe extemporaneous Spanish colonial economy was dominated by mineral wealth, and labor was initially provided through enslavement of the indigenous peoples. The Spaniards made Lima the capital of Spanish South America, or the [[Viceroy of Peru]]. Peru's precious mineral resources and large indigenous population placed it at the core of the South American colonies; according to Palmer, Peru could be ranked second on a scale of colonial penetration (Mahoney, 66). Textiles, minerals, and sugars from the colonies were exported back to Europe.\n\nAfter the war of secession of 1700, Spain began to lose its monopoly over colonial trade. In the mid-18th century, liberal factions began to appear within the colonial elite; these questioned the legitimacy of the crown's rule in the Americas. These \u201cCreole patriots\u201d, which had originally been marginalized to the periphery of the empire (Venezuela, Argentina, etc.), provided the necessary conditions for successful economic development during the late colonial period (Mahoney, 52, 80). The in\nh throughout the empire, with Spain receiving ten times more imports by the end of the 18th century. Despite this overall growth of the colonies, the trend observed in Peru over the course of the century and a half following the war of secession was one of stagnation. The regional socioeconomic hierarchy inverted itself, as core territories where liberals were absent experienced much lower levels of economic development. Their marginalization actually allowed them to benefit from expanded trade opportunities. According to Mahoney, \u201cregional specialists have argued that underdevelopment throughout [areas such as Peru] can be traced to colonial patterns of economic dependence, Hispanic culture, and inefficient markets and economic arrangements\".\n\nAttempting to protect its colonial possessions and reverse its faltering role in colonial trade, the crown implemented liberalizing reforms, hastening the removal of trade restrictions and weakening colonial monopolies. This continued the decay of the core regions, leaving them more exposed to the uncertainties of the free market. By the mid-19th century, the reversal of the socioeconomic hierarchy was complete; Peru would not recover its Viceroyalty-era supremacy (Mahoney, 86).\n\n===Independence and the Industrial Revolution Era 1821\u20131878===\n\nAfter winning independence from [[Spain]] on July 28, 1821, Peru was financially strapped. In addition, the economy suffered from the collapse of the silver mines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref> However the Guano (also spelled Quevo) trade era 1849-1879 with [[Europe]] flushed Peru with European investments and money. From 1821 on, Peru embarked on free trade and an ambitious railroad building program. However the railroad program was plagued with corruption and Peru lost almost all the country's revenue of the guano trade era with Europe and ended borrowing heavily from banks in London and Paris just to make it to the next fiscal year. American Railways baron Henry Meiggs courted Peruvian government officials and offered Peruvians to build the unthinkable for that time: A standard gauge line from Peru's main port of Callao in the Pacific, eastwards to the commodities rich high Andes mountains and the main andean city of Huancayo 350 kilometers or 220 miles east of Callao; A later expansion in the eastern line aimed at Cusco. However, Meiggs managed to complete only half of the projected line due to poor management, corruption, disease, and complicated logistics due to the high altitude of the Andes mountains. \nOver the years financial woes worsened and Peru needed money. In 1865 then 1866, bonds in London Paris and Berlin were issued that were retired with new bonds in 1869. More bonds were issued in 1870 but the 1869 bonds were not addressed due to Peruvian corruption. Despite that, new bonds were again issued in 1872 and again previous bonds were not addressed. A major problem, that would take many years to resolve, was that the rich guano deposits were used as security on all the bonds. Peru struggled to make bond interest payments but on December 18, 1875, Peru defaulted. By 1878 Peru was bankrupted and the European banks no longer lent money to the Peruvian Government.\n\n===The War of the Pacific: Chile\u00b4s invasion of Peru and its terrible economic and social consequences 1879\u20131884===\n{{see also|Peruvian Salpeter Monopoly}}\n\nThe War of the Pacific (Spanish: Guerra del Pac\u00edfico) (1879\u20131883) was fought in western South America, between Chile and allies Bolivia and Peru. Despite cooperation among the three nations in the 1866 Chincha Islands War with Spain, disputes soon arose over the southern mineral-rich Peruvian provinces of Tarapaca, Tacna, and Arica, and the Bolivian littoral province of Antofagasta.\n\nWhen Chile gained independence from Spain in 1811, it was a small country lacking important natural resources. Chile's main exports were wheat and wine. Thus many Chilean wheat and wine businessmen, encouraged by the Chilean government decided to diversify and invest abroad in neighboring Bolivia and Peru.\n\nSince the early 1850s the Chilean wheat and wine barons thoroughly invested and developed the massive nitrate and the saltpeter fields located in the Peruvian Tarapaca and Bolivian Antofagasta departments.  \nFor twenty years the Chilean economic outlook was up and things were going according to plan for the Chilean businessmen. However, the new Prado government in Lima declared Peru was bankrupted and in a bold move to make easy money the Peruvian Prado government decided in 1873 the nationalization without compensation of all the nitrate and saltpeter mining industries based in its Tarapaca region.\n\nSuddenly after decades, Chilean businessmen, including well-known magnates of the time such as Toorjo Mishra and Sparsh Nagar{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}, found themselves expelled from Peru.\n\nBolivia's president and the Bolivian congress followed suit and started to argue that Chileans were ripping off Bolivia, therefore by December 1878 the Bolivian congress approved a 10-cent additional tax on the Chilean owned Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta (CSFA). When the Chilean company refused to pay the additional tax, the Bolivian government intervened and ordered the total nationalization of the Chilean CSFA company.\n\nAgain Chilean businessmen were being expelled from overseas, this time from Bolivia.\nHowever this second outcome differed totally. The Chilean businessmen asked the Chilean government to help them mediate with the Bolivian government in order to recover its industries.\nThe Chilean government approved its businessmen request, hence Chile by February 14, 1879 declared war on Bolivia.\n\nThat same day the well-equipped Chilean armed forces occupied Bolivia's main port city of Antofagasta, in order to stop the Bolivian authorities from auctioning the confiscated property of Chilean CSFA. Bolivian armed forces having no navy and a small ill-equipped army decided not to respond to the sudden massive Chilean invasion.\n\nIn Bolivia's capital La Paz top Bolivian authorities were outraged, and so announced that a state of war existed,  thus invoking its 1873 secret military alliance treaty with Peru. Bolivia called on Lima to activate their secret mutual defense pact, while Chile waited for Peru to respond to Bolivia's demand and see if Peru declared its neutrality or not. \nHowever, Peru's Prado president and his top officials were warned by the Peruvian military that if Peru declared its neutrality, Chile will use this statement to convince Bolivia to jointly declare war on Peru, offering Bolivia in retribution the Peruvian territories of Tacna & Arica.  Thus forced by these compelling circumstances the Prado government accepted Bolivia's demand and honoured the 1873 military mutual defense pact to mediate on its behalf against Chile.\n\nBolivia, backed by Peru, hence declared war on Chile at the end of February 1879.\nPeru meanwhile tried to defuse on February and March an imminent war with Santiago, by sending an ambassador to Santiago for peace talks with the Chilean president and Chile's congress.\n\nOn April 5, after refusing further Peruvian talks for peace, Chile conveniently declared war on both nations. On April 6, Peru responded by acknowledging the casus foederis.\nPeru was not ready to fight any war. Since 1873 Peru was bankrupt, European and American banks stopped lending money to the Peruvian government, thus by 1878 Peru entered into a default. Making matters worse, since 1866 many coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempts by several caudillos created nationwide economic political and social havoc, so by 1873 the Prado government practically had the Peruvian army disbanded and decided to let it stagnate, being ill-equipped with obsolete rifles dating from the independence era, while old Peruvian navy ships dating from the 1850s and 1860s remained abandoned, rusting idle at Callao Naval Station.\n\nIn these appalling conditions, the War of the Pacific had begun.\n\nThe cruel and blood-ridden \"Saltpetre War\" took place over five years in a variety of terrains, including the 300&nbsp;mi Atacama Desert and most of the 2000&nbsp;mi Peruvian coastline deserts as well as long battles against Peruvian anti-Chilean guerrillas in the cold mountainous regions of the Peruvian Andes.\n\nThe war's first battle was the Battle of Top\u00e1ter. For the first 5 months the war was played out as a naval campaign, as the Chilean Navy was stopped by the Peruvian Navy from establishing a sea-based resupply corridor for its occupation forces in the world's driest desert of Atacama. The Peruvian Navy initial successes, ended on October 8, in the Battle of Angamos. \nOn that day the Chilean Navy virtually destroyed most of the Peruvian navy and eventually prevailed.\n\nAfterwards, in 1880 Chile's army easily beat the ill-equipped Bolivian and Peruvian armies. Bolivia's army was soon defeated and withdrew after the Battle of Tacna on May 26, 1880. \nThe Peruvian army was defeated after the Battle of Lima on January 18, 1881.\n\nThe land campaign climaxed in 1881, with the Chilean occupation of Lima. Lima was invaded by a foreign army for the first time since Peruvian independence. Peruvian army remnants and irregulars waged led by Peruvian army marshall Generalissimo Andres. A. Caceres led a violent and merciless guerrilla war against Chile. One of the first ever recorded guerrilla war in modern history.\n\nThis guerrilla war better known as the Campaign of the Bre\u00f1a was fought in the cold Peruvian Andes mountains and for two years the Peruvian resistance guerrillas beat the Chilean army many times.\n\nAfter four years of fighting, the Chilean army was logistically overextended and war weary, thus the Chilean army made a final counter-attack, the so-called strategic Battle of Huamachuco. This battle lasted many days and was by far the most cruel of the war. Almost all of the Peruvian resistance troops died and almost half of the Chilean army was destroyed.\n\nSuperior Chilean weaponry such as new German Krupp cannons and new English rifles gave the invading Chileans the upper hand, and successfully eliminated Marshall Caceres\u00b4 guerrillas at Huamachuco.\n\nAfter Huamachuco, Chile and Peru finally signed the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n on October 20, 1883. \nThe final Chilean soldiers left Lima at the end of 1884. Bolivia was forced by Chile to sign a truce in 1884.\n\nThe Ancon Treaty allowed Chile to annex the minerals-rich Peruvian department of [[Tarapac\u00e1 Department (Peru)|Tarapaca]] rich in nitrates and guano, [[Bolivia]] lost its Atacama Department and its 400 kilometers of [[pacific]] ocean coastline. Cutting Bolivia off from the sea.\n\nPlus, the Ancon Treaty also allowed Chile to manage the Peruvian provinces of Tacna and Arica for an initial 10 years until 1883 when citizens of both provinces could decide in a referendum if Tacna & Arica joined Chile or remained in Peru.\n\nIn 1904, Chile and Bolivia signed the \"Treaty of Peace and Friendship\" establishing definite boundaries, thus making Bolivia a land-locked country ever since.\n\nThe situation between Chile and Peru worsened when the former did not held the promised 1893 plebiscite to determine the fate of the provinces of Arica and Tacna. Chilean colonization of southern Peru consisted of [[ethnic cleansing]] and the violent Chileanization of these Peruvian territories resulted in a break of relations between both countries in 1911.\n\nDuring the 1920s the American government mediated in peace talks between Peru and Chile. U.S. Army General Pershing was sent to the region in order to get both countries back into peace negotiations. \nThe final outcome of America's intervention was the 1929 Tacna\u2013Arica compromise that allowed Chile to annex Arica while Chile was forced to return Tacna to Peruvian sovereignty, but this compromise in the end did not resolve the animosity and a cold war evolved between the both southern American countries. \nCurrent political problems and military tensions among these neighbours often have its roots back to this conflict.\n\nThe [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883) made therefore matters far worse for Peru and by 1889 the country had to do something.\n\nAn extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The Peruvian government, though still bankrupt, started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the massive destruction of the war. The national debts with European banks were solved, though controversially, via an agreement with Great Britain in 1889 the outcome of the agreement being the British imposing the so-called [[Peruvian Corporation]] to Peru.\n\nIn January 1890 the British government gathered in London a group of British bankers and business men and formed the Peruvian Corporation to attempt to resolve the issues and recoup invested money in Peru. The objectives of the company were extensive. They included the acquisition of real or personal property in [[Peru]] or elsewhere, dealing in land, produce, and property of all kinds, constructing and managing railways, roads, and telegraphs, and carrying on the business usually carried on by railway companies, canal companies, and telegraph companies. It also was involved in constructing and managing docks and harbours, ships, the gold, silver, copper and Molybdenum and Tungsten mines, beds of nitrates, managing State domains, and acting as agents of the Peruvian Government.<ref name=\"The Law journal reports\">{{cite book|title=The Law journal reports|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lx0yAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA387|accessdate=26 December 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1908|publisher=E.B.

Its board of directors included ten members led by Sir Alfred Dent G A Ollard, of Smiles and Co Solicitors, was manager in London, T E Webb was secretary, with Clinton Dawkins and William Davies (Grace Brothers - Callao) as the first representatives in Peru.\nThe company was formed with the purpose of canceling Peru's external debt and to release its government from loans it had taken out through bondholders at three times (in 1869, 1870, 1872), in order to finance the construction of railways. The main purpose of the incorporation included acquiring the rights and undertaking the liabilities of bondholders.\nPolitical stability was achieved only in the early 20th century.\n\n=== Michael Grace ===\n[[William Russell Grace|Russell]] and [[Michael P. Grace|Michael Grace]] had formed the Grace Brothers & Co. (that became the [[W.R. Grace and Company]]) in 1865 and had a vast business empire with interests in Lima, and Callo, Peru; as well as Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepcion Chile. By 1889 these interests included a large guano trade as well as '''''Grace Line''''' shipping. Moves to address the Peruvian financial crisis included the '''''Elias-Castellon''''' and '''''Irigoyen-Delgado-Donoughmore protocols''''' that were formalized by 1890 and Michael Grace and Lord Donoughmore was able to get the [[Grace Contract]] (originating in 1886) ratified.\n\n==== Contract terms ====\nTerms of the Grace contract were that the Peruvian Corporation took over the depreciated bonds of the Peruvian Government on the condition that the Government-owned railroads and the [[guano]] exportation be under their control for a period of years. The bonds were exchanged for stock in the Peruvian Corporation. The corporation later surrendered the bonds to the Peruvian Government in exchange for the following concessions: the use for 66 years of all the railroad properties of the Peruvian Government, most important of which were the Southern Railway of Peru and the Central Railway of Peru; assignment of the guano existing in Peruvian territory, especially on certain adjacent islands, up to the amount of 2,000,000 tons; certain other claims on guano deposits, especially in the [[Lobos de Tierra Island|Lobos]] and other islands; 33 annual payments by the Peruvian Government, each of $400,000.\n\nIn 1907, this arrangement was modified by an extension of the leases of the railways from 1956 to 1973, by a reduction in the number of annual payments from 33 to 30, and by a further agreement on the part of the Peruvian Corporation to construct certain railroad extensions to [[Cuzco]] and to [[Huancayo]]. The bonds of this corporation were largely held by English, French, and Dutch subjects. Consequently, the diplomatic representatives of these countries in Peru sought proper interest in the welfare of their nationals, the bondholders.<ref name=\"Commission1916\">{{cite book|author=United States.

Odr\u00eda led a successful military coup and became the new president. Thanks to a thriving economy, Odr\u00eda was able to implement expensive, populist social reconstruction, including housing projects, hospitals, and schools. His government was dictatorial, however, and civil rights were severely restricted, and corruption was rampant throughout his r\u00e9gime.\n\nMilitary juntas continued to predominantly rule Peru over the next three decades. The economic policies of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s in particular, were based on the substitution of imports, and had little effect on the size of the economy. General Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez replaced leftist General Juan Velasco Alvarado in 1975, citing Velasco's economic mismanagement, among other factors. Morales Berm\u00fadez brought about a more conservative period, beginning the task of restoring the country's economy.\n\n==The Velasco Military Junta Government 1968\u20131980==\n\nThe economic strategy of General Velasco's government was shaped by a conception frequently advocated in Latin America but rarely put into practice. The idea was to find a \"third way\" between capitalism and socialism, with a corporatist society much more inclusionary than that possible under capitalism but without rejecting private ownership or adopting any of the compulsory methods identified with communism. Under this strategy, land reform was designed to override existing property interests in order to establish cooperative ownership, rejecting both individual private farming and state farms. Promoting worker participation in ownership and management was intended to reshape labor relations. Foreign influences were reduced through tight restrictions on foreign investment and nationalization of some of the largest foreign firms. On a more fundamental plane, the Velasco government saw its mission as one of eliminating class conflict and reconciling differences among interest groups within its own vision of a cooperative society.\n\n===Land reform===\n\nThe most striking and thorough reform imposed by the General Velasco's government was to eliminate all large private landholdings, converting most of them into cooperatives owned by prior workers on the estates. The reform was intended to destroy the basis of power of Peru's traditional elite and to foster a more cooperative society as an alternative to capitalism. Such socialpolitical purposes apparently dominated questions of agricultural production or any planned changes in patterns of land use. It was as if the questions of ownership were what mattered, not the consequences for output or rural incomes. In fact, the government soon created a system of price controls and monopoly food buying by state firms designed to hold down prices to urban consumers, no matter what the cost to rural producers.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the cooperatives had very mixed success; and the majority were converted into individual private holdings during the 1980s. The conversions were authorized in 1980 by changes in the basic land reform legislation and were put into effect after majority votes of the cooperative members in each case. The preferences of the people involved at that point clearly went contrary to the intent of the original reform. But the whole set of changes was not a reversion to the pre-reform agrarian structure. In fact, the conversions left Peru with a far less unequal pattern of landownership than it had prior to the reform and with a much greater role for family farming than ever before in its history.\n\n===Labor and capital in the industrial sector===\n\nIn line with its basic conception of social order, the Peruvian military junta government also created a complex system of \"industrial communities.\" Under this system, firms in the modern sector were required to distribute part of their profits to workers in the form of dividends constituting ownership shares. The intent was to convert workers into property owners and property ownership into a form of sharing for the sake of class reconciliation. But in practice, the system never functioned well. The firms did all they could to avoid reporting profits in order to postpone sharing ownership, sometimes by setting up companies outside the system to which they channeled profits, sometimes by adjusting the books, and in general by keeping one step ahead of intended regulations. A small fraction of the industrial workers gained shares in firms, but as a rule workers were not so much interested in long-term claims of ownership as they were in immediate working conditions and earnings. For organized labor, the whole approach seemed an attempt to subvert any role for union action and to make organization irrelevant. The system was not popular with either side. It was quickly abandoned when the more conservative wing of the military took power away from General Velasco in 1975.\n\nAttempted reform of labor relations in the mid-1970s also included severe restrictions on rights to discharge workers once they passed a brief trial period of employment. A review process set up to examine disputes was implemented in a way that made discharges practically impossible. Businesspeople circumvented the restrictions to some degree by hiring workers on a temporary basis up to the point at which they would have to be kept and then letting them go before the restrictions applied. Businesspeople remained unremittingly hostile to this type of regulation, primarily on the grounds that it took away their main means of exercising discipline over their workers. This form of regulation was also eliminated shortly after Velasco lost power.\n\n===Protection and promotion of industry===\n\nAlong with the intention of resolving internal class conflict, the Velasco government determined to lessen Peru's dependency on the outside world. The two most important components of the strategy were a drive to promote rapid industrialization and an attack on the role of foreign firms. In contrast to the industrialization strategies of most other Latin American countries, the intention of the Velasco regime was to industrialize without welcoming foreign investment.\n\nThe preceding Bela\u00fande administration had started Peru on the path of protection to promote industry, and in this respect the Velasco government reinforced rather than reversed the existing strategy. Beyond the usual recourse to high tariffs, Velasco's government adopted the Industrial Community Law of 1970 that gave any industrialist on the register of manufacturers the right to demand prohibition of any imports competing with his products. No questions of exceptionally high costs of production, poor product quality, or monopolistic positions fostered by excluding import competition were allowed to get in the way. Before the succeeding government of General Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez Cerrutti (1975\u201380) began to clean up the battery of protective exclusions in 1978, the average tariff rate reached 66 percent, accompanied by quantitative restrictions on 2,890 specific tariff positions.\n\nIn addition to the protective measures, the Velasco government promoted industrial investment by granting major tax exemptions, as well as tariff exemptions on imports used by manufacturers in production. The fiscal benefits given industrialists through these measures equaled 92 percent of total internal financing of industrial investment in the years 1971 through 1975.\n\nInvestment rose strongly in response to these measures, as well as to the concurrent rise in aggregate demand. But the tax exemptions also contributed to a rising public-sector deficit and thereby to the beginning of serious inflationary pressure. In addition, the exemptions from tariffs given to industrialists on their own imports of equipment and supplies led to a strong rise in the ratio of imports to production for the industrial sector.\n\n===Nationalizations and state firms===\n<ref>Fitzgerald, E. (1979). The political economy of Peru, 1956-78\u202f: economic development and the restructuring of capital . Cambridge\u202f;: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\nThe industrialization drive was meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors but definitely not welcoming them warmly. In that spirit, the Velasco regime immediately nationalized IPC in October 1968 and, not long after that, the largest copper mining company, while taking over other foreign firms more peacefully through buy-outs. The government put into place new restrictions on foreign investment in Peru and led the way to a regional agreement, the Andean Pact, that featured some of the most extensive controls on foreign investment yet attempted in the developing world.\n\nThe decision to nationalize the foreign oil firm was immensely popular in Peru. It was seen as a legitimate response to many years of close collaboration between the company, which performed political favors, and a series of possibly selfinterested Peruvian presidents, who, in exchange, preserved the company's exclusive drilling rights. Nationalization was perhaps less a matter of an economic program than a reaction to a public grievance, a reaction bound to increase public support for the new government.\n\nSubsequent nationalizations and purchases of foreign firms were more explicitly manifestations of the goals of building up state ownership and reducing foreign influence in Peru. The leaders of the military government subscribed firmly to the ideas of dependency analysis, placing much of the blame for problems of development on external influences through trade and foreign investment. Foreign ownership of natural resources in particular was seen as a way of taking away the country's basic wealth on terms that allowed most of the gains to go abroad. Ownership of the resources was expected to bring in revenue to the government, and to the country, that would otherwise have been lost.\n\nIn contrast to its abrupt nationalization of the IPC and then of the largest copper mining company, the government turned mainly to purchases through negotiation to acquire the property of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT) and foreign banks. Partly in response to United States reactions to the earlier nationalizations, and perhaps also partly in response to the realization that foreign investment might play a positive role in the industrialization drive, the government began to take a milder position toward foreign firms. But at the same time, it pursued a policy of creating new state-owned firms, in a sense competing for position against domestic private ownership, as well as against foreign ownership.\n\nState ownership of firms was, of course, consistent with the nationalizations but reflected a different kind of policy objective. Whereas the nationalizations were intended to gain greater Peruvian control over the country's resources and to reduce the scope of foreign influence, the proliferation of state-owned firms was meant to increase direct control by the government over the economy. State firms were seen as a means to implement government economic policies more directly than possible when working through private firms, whether domestic or foreign-owned. The goal was not to eliminate the private sector\u2014it was encouraged at the same time by tax favors and protection\u2014but to create a strong public sector to lead the way toward the kind of economy favored by the state.\n\nThe new state firms created in this period established a significant share of public ownership in the modern sector of the economy. By 1975 they accounted for over half of mining output and a fifth of industrial output. One set of estimates indicates that enterprises under state ownership came to account for a higher share of value added than domestic private capital: 26 percent of GDP for the state firms, compared with 22 percent for domestic private firms. The share produced by foreign-owned firms dropped to 8 percent from 21 percent prior to the Velasco government's reforms.\n\nContrary to the expectation that the earnings of the state firms would provide an important source of public financing for development, these companies became almost immediately a collective drain. In some measure, the drain was a result of decisions by the government to hold down their prices in order to lessen inflation or to subsidize consumers. In addition, deficits of the state-owned firms were aggravated by the spending tendencies of the military officers placed in charge of company management and by inadequate attention to costs of production. The collective deficits of the state enterprises plus the subsidies paid directly to them by the government reached 3 percent of GDP by 1975. State enterprises were not able to finance more than about one-fourth of their investment spending. The government attempted to answer the investment requirements of the state firms by allowing them to borrow abroad for imported equipment and supplies. They did so on a large scale. The external debt rose swiftly, for this and for other reasons discussed below.\n\nNationalizations and the creation of new state firms stopped abruptly after Velasco lost power. In 1980 the Bela\u00fande government announced a program to privatize most of the state firms, but it proved difficult to find private buyers, and few of the firms were actually sold. In the opposite direction, the subsequent Garc\u00eda government, in addition to nationalizing in 1985 the offshore oil production of the Belco Corporation, a United States company, tried in 1987 to extend state ownership over banks remaining in private hands. The attempted banking nationalization created a storm of protest and was eventually ruled to be illegal. The failures under both Bela\u00fande and Garc\u00eda to change the balance left the state-enterprise sector basically intact until Fujimori implemented major changes.\n\n===Macroeconomic imbalance: domestic and external===\n\nWhatever the promises and the costs of the many kinds of reform attempted by the Velasco government, the ship sank because of inadequate attention to balances between spending and productive capacity, and between export incentives and import demand. The Velasco government inherited recessionary conditions in 1968, with a positive external balance and productive capacity readily available for expansion. It maintained effective restraint on spending and deficits for several years but then let things get out of control. The central government's deficit was no more than 1 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 1970, but its own deficit plus that of the greatly expanded group of state firms reached 10 percent of GNP by 1975. Correspondingly, the external current-account balance was positive in the period 1968-70 but showed a deficit equal to 10 percent of GNP by 1975.\n\nThe external deficit was driven up primarily by high rates of growth of domestic demand and production through 1974. But in addition, the government's policy of holding to a fixed nominal exchange rate, in an increasingly inflationary context, allowed the real exchange rate to fall steadily from 1969 to 1975. The government refused to consider devaluation for fear it would worsen inflation and managed to avoid it by borrowing abroad to finance the continuing deficit. By 1975 external creditors had lost confidence in Peru's ability to repay its debts and began to put on the brakes. Whether because of such external pressure or because of growing internal opposition to the increasingly arbitrary decisions of the government, the Peruvian military decided to replace Velasco in 1975. The experiment ended on a note of defeat, not so much of its objectives as of its methods.\n\n==The 1980s==\nIn 1980, after 12 years of military rule, Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry was elected president. After a promising beginning, his popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, economic hardship, and terrorism; his government's lukewarm liberalization attempt failed in the context of the Latin American debt crisis, as per capita income declined, Peru's foreign debt burgeoned, and violence by leftist insurgents (notably Shining Path) rose steadily during the internal conflict in Peru, which was launched the day before Bela\u00fande's election. He continued many of the projects that were planned during his 1963-1968 term, including the completion of the Carretera Marginal de la Selva, a roadway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with then-isolated northern regions Amazonas and San Mart\u00edn.\n\nDuring the next years, the economic problems left behind by the junta government persisted, worsened by an occurrence of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon in 1982\u201383, which caused widespread flooding in some parts of the country, severe droughts in others, and decimated the schools of ocean fish that are one of the country's major resources.\n\nBela\u00fande's successor, Alan Garc\u00eda, was elected to office in 1985. His administration applied heterodox policies through the expansion of public expenditure and limitations on external debt payments.[1] With a parliamentary majority for the first time in APRA's history, Garc\u00eda's administration showed economic promise much as Bela\u00fande's had. Despite his initial popularity, Garc\u00eda's term in office was marked by bouts of hyperinflation, which reached 7,649% in 1990 and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% over his five-year term, profoundly destabilizing the Peruvian economy. As a result of this chronic inflation, the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|old sol]], was replaced by the inti in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the nuevo sol in July 1991; the new currency had an equivalent value of one billion old soles. During Garc\u00eda's administration, the per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below 1960 levels) and Peru's GDP dropped by 20%. By the end of his term, national reserves were a negative $900 million.[2]\n\nGarc\u00eda's term was also characterized by heavy increases in poverty. According to studies by the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics and the United Nations Development Programme, at the start of his presidency, 41.6% of Peruvians lived in poverty. By 1991, this figure had increased to 55%. Garc\u00eda also attempted to nationalize the banking and insurance industries. He incurred the wrath of the International Monetary Fund and the financial community by unilaterally declaring a limit on debt repayment equal to 10% of the gross national product, thereby isolating Peru from the international financial markets. One of his administration's most glaring failures was the ambitious multimillion-dollar [[Lima Metro]] that was completed only at the end of Garcia's second term 2011.\n\n==The Second Fernando Bela\u00fande Government 1980\u20131985==\n\nThe return to democracy allowed Peruvians to choose among strongly left, strongly conservative, or middle-of-the-road parties. They chose Bela\u00fande and his party as the middle road, but it led nowhere. The Bela\u00fande government tried to return the economy to a more open system by reducing barriers to imports, implementing financial reforms intended to foster private markets, and reversing the statist orientation of the Velasco system. But the new approach never had a chance to get very far because of a series of macroeconomic problems. On one side, the government was rightly concerned about continuing inflation but made the mistake of focusing the explanation on monetary growth arising from the export surplus it inherited at the start. That position made it seem undesirable to continue trying to promote exports and desirable to raise domestic spending and imports. On the other side, President Bela\u00fande's personal and political objectives included using public investment actively to develop the interior of the country and to answer evident needs for improved infrastructure. Seeing the export surplus as the key macroeconomic source of imbalance, the government decided to eliminate it by removing import restrictions, slowing nominal devaluation to allow the real exchange rate to appreciate, and increasing government investment spending.\n\nThe real exchange rate appreciated through 1981 and 1982, public sector investment rose 54 percent in real terms from 1979 to 1982, and public sector consumption rose 25 percent during the same three-year period. The combination effectively turned the current-account surplus into a large deficit, as increased spending plus import liberalization practically doubled imports of goods and services between 1979 and 1981. The appreciation also turned manufacturing exports back downward, and a plunge in external prices of primary exports brought them down too. And then the mistake of focusing on the earlier export surplus as the main cause of inflation became clear: the increases in spending led to a leap of inflation despite the return to an external deficit. The rate of inflation went from 59 percent in 1980 to 111 percent by 1983.\n\nNothing improved when the government then tried to go into reverse with contractionary macroeconomic policies and renewed depreciation. Output plunged, but inflation once more went up instead of down, to 163 percent by 1985. By this time, pessimism about the government's capacity to solve anything, inflationary expectations turning into understandable convictions, and the price-increasing effect of devaluation all combined to give Peru a seemingly unstoppable inflation despite the elimination of anything that might be considered excess demand. The government apparently lost its sense of direction, retreated from its attempt to reopen the economy by returning to higher tariff levels, and otherwise did little except wait for its own end in 1985.\n\n==The First Alan Garc\u00eda Government 1985\u20131990==\n\nWith the market-oriented choice of economic strategy discredited by results under Bela\u00fande, Peruvians voted for the dynamic populist-reformist promise of Garc\u00eda and responded enthusiastically to his sweeping changes. Garc\u00eda's program worked wonders for two years, but then everything began to go wrong.\n\nThe main elements of the economic strategy proposed by the Garc\u00eda government were full of promise. They recognized the prior neglect of the agricultural sector and called for redirecting public programs toward promotion of agricultural growth and reduction of rural poverty. Correspondingly, economic activity was to be decentralized to break down its high concentration in Lima, and within the cities resources were to be redirected away from the capital-intensive and import-intensive modern sector to the labor-intensive informal sector. A strategy of concertaci\u00f3n (national understanding) with private business leaders on economic issues was to be used systematically to avoid disruptive conflict. Problems of external balance were to be answered both by restructuring production to lessen dependence on imports and by reorienting toward higher exports over the long-term.\n\nThese goals for structural change could have improved the efficiency of resource allocation while doing a great deal to lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, but to do it without adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.\n\n===The first 2 years 1985\u20131987===\n\nThe first two years of the Garc\u00eda government gave new hope to the people of Peru, with rising employment, production, and wages suggesting a clear turn for the better after so many years of increasing difficulties. It was hence doubly tragic to see the whole process unravel so quickly, once things started going wrong again. The first sign of trouble came, as it often had, from the balance of payments. The economic boom naturally raised imports swiftly, by 76 percent between 1985 and 1987. But the real exchange rate was allowed to fall by 10 percent in 1986 and by a further 9 percent in 1987. The boom pulled potential export supply into the domestic market, and the fall in the real exchange rate reduced incentives to earn foreign exchange. Exports fell slightly in 1985 and remained below that level through 1987. The external current account went from a surplus of US$127 million in 1985 to deficits of nearly US$1.1 billion in 1986 and nearly US$1.5 billion in 1987.\n\nBesides higher employment and living standards, the first two years of economic revival seemed to offer a break in the cycle of rising rural violence. The flow of displaced peasants from the Sierra eased, and a good many peasants began to return to the countryside.\n\nTo stop inflation, the government opted for heterodox policies of control within an expansionary program. Prices and wages in the modern sector were to be fixed, after an initial one-shot increase in wage rates. The increase in wages was intended to raise living standards of workers and stimulate production by raising sales to consumers. To offset the effects of higher wages on costs of production, financial costs of the business sector were cut by intervention in order to reduce and control interest rates. After making one adjustment of the exchange rate to minimize negative effects on exports, the government stopped the process of continuing devaluation in order to help hold down inflation. Imports were rightly expected to go up as the economy revived; to help finance them, Garc\u00eda made his controversial decision to stop paying external debt service beyond 10 percent of the value of exports. Unorthodox as they were, all the pieces seemed to fit. At least, they went together well at the start under conditions of widespread idle capacity, with an initially strong balance of payments position.\n\nThe macroeconomic measures worked wonders for production. GDP shot up 9.5 percent in 1986 and a further 7.7 percent in 1987. Manufacturing output and construction both increased by more than one-fourth in these two years. An even greater surprise was that agricultural production per capita went up, running counter to its long downward trend. And the rate of inflation came down from 163 percent in 1985 to 78 percent in 1986, although it edged back up to 86 percent in 1987. In response to stronger market conditions and perhaps also to growing confidence that Peru's economic problems were at last being attacked successfully, private fixed investment went up by 24 percent in 1986, and capital flight went down.\n\nThe government avoided any spending spree of its own: central government spending was actually reduced in real terms each year. But because the government also reduced indirect taxes in order to encourage higher private consumption and to reduce costs for private business, its originally small deficit grew each year. The economic deficit of the nonfinancial public sector as a whole (excluding interest payments) went up from 2.4 percent of GDP in 1985 to 6.5 percent by 1987.\n\nAlthough the government reduced its total spending, it managed to support a new public works program to provide temporary employment and to direct more resources to rural producers as intended in its program for structural change. Three lines of policy helped especially to raise rural incomes. The first was to use generous guaranteed prices for key food products. The second was to provide greatly increased agricultural credit, financed essentially by credit from the Central Bank. The third was to exempt most of the non-guaranteed agricultural prices from controls, allowing their prices to rise sharply relative to those of industrial products from the modern sector. From July 1985 to December 1986, prices of goods and services not under control increased more than three times as much as those under control. Wholesale prices in manufacturing increased 26 percent, but those for agricultural products increased 142 percent.\n\n===From inflation to hyperinflation, 1988\u20131990===\nThe Garc\u00eda government reacted to the growing external deficit in exactly the same way as had the governments of Velasco and of Bela\u00fande\u2014by postponing corrective action while the problem continued to worsen. As ever, a major fear was that devaluation would worsen inflation. Inflationary pressures were, in fact, beginning to worsen behind the fa\u00e7ade of control. To some degree, they were growing in response to the high rate of growth of demand and output, reducing margins of previously underutilized productive capacity. But the more explosive pressures were being built up by relying on price controls that required a dramatic expansion of credit to keep the system in place. Prices of public sector services\u2014gasoline above all, oil products in general, electricity, telephones, and postal services\u2014were frozen at levels that soon became almost ridiculous in real terms. The restrictions on prices charged by state firms drove them ever deeper into deficits that had to be financed by borrowing. The borrowing came from wherever it could, but principally from the Central Bank. At the same time, Central Bank credit rose steadily to keep financing [[agricultural expansion]]. Still another direction of Central Bank credit creation was the financing used to handle the government's new structure of multiple exchange rates. Differential rates were used to hold down the cost of foreign exchange for most imports, again with the dominant goal of holding down inflation, while higher prices of foreign exchange were paid to exporters to protect their incentives to export. The Central Bank thus paid more for the foreign exchange it bought than it received for the exchange it sold.\n\nThe term used for these leakages\u2014for extensions of Central Bank credit that did not count in the government's budget deficit\u2014is the \"quasi-fiscal deficit.\" Its total increased from about 2 percent of GDP in 1985 to about 4 percent in 1987. Meanwhile, the government's tax revenue fell steadily in real terms, partly because of tax reductions implemented to hold down business costs and partly because of the effect of inflation in cutting down the real value of tax payments. Added together, the fiscal deficit plus the quasi-fiscal deficit increased from 5 percent of GDP in 1985 to 11 percent by 1987.\n\nThe two horsemen of this particular apocalypse\u2014the external deficit and the swift rise of Central Bank credit\u2014would have made 1988 a bad year no matter what else happened. But President Garc\u00eda guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No one has yet been able to explain why he decided to do so. It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Garc\u00eda government tried a series of major and minor new policy packages from early 1988 into 1990 to no avail. The new policies never succeeded in shutting off the rapid infusion of Central Bank credit that was feeding inflation, even when they did succeed in driving production down significantly in 1989. Manufacturing production fell 18 percent in that year, agricultural output 3 percent, and total GDP 11 percent. Simultaneously, inflation increased from a record 666 percent in 1988 to a new record of 3,399 percent for 1989. The one positive change was the external current-account deficit: the fall in domestic production and income was so steep that the current account went from a deep deficit to a substantial surplus. The internal cost was perhaps clearest in terms of real wages: the minimum wage in real terms for urban labor fell 61 percent between 1987 and 1989, and average real wages in manufacturing fell 59 percent.\n\nCritics of Garc\u00eda's presidency claim that his many poor decisions while in office created an environment that led to the rise of an authoritarian leader like Alberto Fujimori, who came to power in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. Faced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the auto-golpe of April 5, 1992. He then revised the constitution; called for new congressional elections, and undertook a process of economic liberalization which put an end to price controls, discarded protectionism, eliminated restrictions on foreign direct investment and privatized most state companies.[3] The reforms allowed sustained economic growth, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[4]\n\nHowever, by 1990 the [[neoliberal]] government of [[Alberto Fujimori]] ended abruptly the soviet minded economic policies with the so-called \u00b4Fuji Shock\u00b4of August 7, 1990.\n\n==The Fujimori Government 1990\u20132000==\n\n'''Alberto Fujimori Fujimori'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infogob.com.pe/Politico/ficha.aspx?IdPolitico=3862454&IdTab=1|title=INFOgob|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> ({{IPA-es|al\u02c8\u03b2e\u027eto fuxi\u02c8mo\u027ei|lang}} <small>or</small> {{IPA-es|fu\u029di\u02c8mo\u027ei|}}<small>;</small> {{IPA-ja|\u0278\u026f\u0291i\ua71cmo\u027ei|lang}}; born 28 July 1938) served as [[List of Presidents of Peru|President of Peru]] from 28 July 1990 to 17 November 2000.

He capitalized on profound disenchantment with previous president [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] and his [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] party (APRA). He exploited popular distrust of Vargas Llosa's identification with the existing Peruvian political establishment, and uncertainty about Vargas Llosa's plans for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms. Fujimori won much support from the poor, who had been frightened by Vargas Llosa's austerity proposals.\n\nDuring the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed ''El Chino'', which roughly translates to \"[[Chinaman (term)|Chinaman]]\"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called ''chino'' in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection.<ref>Interview with Fujimori, in Ellen Perry's ''The Fall of Fujimori''</ref> With his election victory, he became the first person of [[East Asia]]n descent to become [[head of government]] of a Latin American nation, and just the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after [[Arthur Chung]] of [[Guyana]] and [[Henk Chin A Sen]] of [[Suriname]] (each of whom had served as [[head of state]], rather than head of government).\n\n==First term: July 28, 1990 \u2013 July 28, 1995==\n\n===Fujishock===\nDuring his first term in office, Fujimori enacted wide-ranging neoliberal reforms, known as ''Fujishock''.

In time, it became absorbed into the group of ideas about economics, that are sometimes referred to as neoliberalism. The economist Jeffrey Sachs coined the expression of shock therapy. The alleged difference between the two shock expressions lies only in the degree of economic liberalisation. Sachs' ideas were based on studying historic periods of monetary and economic crisis and noting that a decisive stroke could end monetary chaos, often in a day.[1] Whereas, Sachs' shock therapy notion views liberalisation as a necessary evil, a fast\u2014as well as nasty\u2014way to achieve economic stabilisation.\n\nThe first instance of shock therapy were the neoliberal pro-market reforms of Chile in 1975, carried out after the military coup by Augusto Pinochet. The reforms, dubbed a shock policy at the time by Milton Friedman, were based on the liberal economic ideas centred around the University of Chicago. Many of the Chilean economists who drafted the reforms came from there and were collectively dubbed the \"Chicago Boys\".\n\nThe term was truly born after Bolivia successfully tackled hyperinflation in 1985 under Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, using Sach's ideas. In particular Sachs and Sanchez de Lozada cited West Germany as inspiration where, during a period over 1947-48, price controls and government support were withdrawn over a very short period, kick-starting the German economy and completing its transition from an authoritarian post-War state.\n\nNeoliberalism rose to prominence after the 1970s and neoliberal shock therapy became increasingly used as a response to economic crises, for example by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Neoliberal shock therapy became very controversial, with its proponents arguing that it helped to end economic crises, stabilise economies and pave the way for growth, while its critics (like Joseph Stiglitz) believed that it helped deepen them unnecessarily[2] and created unnecessary social suffering.\n\nSachs' ideas were applied to the post-communist states in their transition to capitalist systems with very mixed results. Some countries that used shock therapy (e.g., Poland, Czech Republic) did better than those that did not. To further cloud understanding, China made its highly successful transition in a gradualist fashion. An opinion [3] is that successful market economies rest on a framework of law, regulation, and established practice[4] that cannot be instantaneously created in a society that was formerly authoritarian, heavily centralised and subject to state ownership of assets.\n\nThe evening of August 7, 1990, is known in Peru as the D-day of the neoliberal shock therapy that the Fujimori administration imposed upon Peru and the beginning neo-liberal economic scheme that governs the Peruvian economy to this day. The term \u00b4Fuji Shock\u00b4 was truly born in Peru after Fujimori's government successfully tackled hyperinflation in 1991, using Sach's ideas. In particular Sachs and Fujimori cited Chile as inspiration where, during a period over 1973-1976, price controls and government support were withdrawn over a very short period, kick-starting the Chilean economy and completing its transition from a soviet inspired cold war to a liberal state. Fujimori's shock terapy was a total reversal of practically all the economic policies of the previous 20 years by preceding governments, from Velasco's soviet socialism to Alan Garcia's yugoslav inspired socialism in conditions that clearly required drastic corrective action. \nIts main immediate target was to stop the runaway course of inflation. Beyond that, the goals included repudiating protection and import substitution, returning to full participation in the world trading and financial systems, eliminating domestic price controls and subsidies, raising public revenue and holding government spending strictly to the levels of current revenue, initiating a social emergency program to reduce the shock of adjustment for the poor, and devoting a higher share of the country's resources to rural investment and correction of the causes of rural poverty. In practice, new measures came out in bits and pieces, dominated by immediate concern to stop inflation; actions taken in the first year did not complete the program.\n\nPreoccupation with inflation was natural enough, after the steep rise of 1989 and the months immediately preceding the change of government. The monthly rate of inflation ranged between 25 percent and 32 percent in the second half of 1989, exceeded 40 percent in June 1990, and amounted to 78 percent by July. The deficit of the central government increased from 4 percent of GDP in January 1990 to 9 percent by May. The money supply of the country increased six times over from January to the end of July. The new government had to act quickly, and did.\n\nThe most dramatic immediate action was to eliminate price controls for private-sector products and to raise prices of public-sector products to restore financial balance for public firms. The price of gasoline, previously driven down to the equivalent of twelve United States cents a gallon, was multiplied by thirty times. For the consumer price index (CPI), the shocks caused an increase of 136 percent in one day.\n\nEliminating price controls in the private sector and raising prices charged by state firms had three objectives. First, the price increases for the public-sector firms and government services were meant to restore revenue to a level that would allow the government to stop borrowing from the Central Bank. Second, the rise in prices was intended to reduce aggregate demand by cutting the liquidity of business and the purchasing power of the public. Third, with everything priced far higher relative to public purchasing power, it was expected that market forces would begin to operate to drive some prices back down, reversing the long trend of increases in order to help break the grip of inflationary expectations.\n\nTo back up the impact of the price shocks, the government declared that it would keep its own expenditure within the limit of current revenue and stop the other two large streams of Central Bank credit creation: Central Bank financing for agricultural credit and for the system of subsidies supporting differential exchange rates. The multiple exchange rates in effect under Garc\u00eda were to be unified, and the unified rate was to be determined by market forces. Further, competition from imports to restrain inflation and access to imported supplies for production would both be improved by taking away quantitative restrictions and reducing tariff rates.\n\nThe new policies helped greatly to bring down the rate of inflation, although they fell short of accomplishing full stabilization. Against an inflation rate that had reached approximately 2,300 percent for the twelve months to June 1990, the rate of 139 percent for the twelve months to December 1991 can be seen as a dramatic improvement. But the latter was still more than double the government's intended ceiling for 1991 and still extremely high relative to outside world rates of inflation. The last quarter of 1991 looked more promising, with the monthly rate down to 4 percent, but it had risen to 7 percent by March 1992. Inflationary dangers clearly remained troublesome, especially in view of two factors that should have stopped inflation more decisively: a deeply depressed level of domestic demand and an unintended increase in the real exchange rate, making dollars cheaper.\n\nDomestic demand has been held down by the combination of the price shock at the start of the stabilization program, steeply falling real wages, reduced government deficits, and much tighter restraint of credit. All these were deliberate measures to stop inflation, accepting the likely costs of higher unemployment and restraint of production as necessary to that end. In 1990 GNP fell 3.9 percent, aggravating the plunge of 19 percent between 1988 and 1990. In 1991 production turned up slightly, with a gain of 2.9 percent in GNP. That situation left output per capita essentially unchanged from 1990 and at 29 percent below its level a decade earlier.\n\nThe incomplete success in stopping inflation created an extremely difficult policy conflict. Recovery could in principle be stimulated by more expansionary credit policies and lower interest rates, which would favor increased investment, depreciation of the currency to help producers compete against imports, and improved exports. But continuing inflation and the fear of accelerating its rate of increase argued instead for keeping a very tight rein on credit and thereby blocked the actions needed for recovery. This conflict became particularly acute over the question of what to do about the exchange note: the real exchange rate went in exactly the wrong direction for recovery by appreciating when depreciation was both expected and needed.\n\nThe decision to remove controls on the exchange rate had been expected to lead to a much higher foreign-exchange price, to encourage exports, and to permit import liberalization without a surging external deficit. But when the rate was set free, the price of dollars went down instead of going up. That initial effect could be explained by the tight restraints imposed on liquidity, which drove firms and individuals who held dollar balances to convert them to domestic currency in order to keep operating. This movement should presumably have gone into reverse when holdings of dollars ran out, but fully eighteen months later no reversal had occurred. Dollars remained too cheap to make exports profitable and too cheap for many producers to compete against imports for several reasons, including the continuing influx of dollars from the drug trade into street markets and then into the banking system. A second reason has involved the continuing low level of domestic income and production, and corresponding restraint of demand for imports as compared with what they would be in an expanding economy. But perhaps the most fundamental reasons have been the continuing squeeze on liquidity in terms of domestic currency and the resulting high rates of interest for borrowing domestic currency, which strongly favor borrowing dollars instead or repatriating them from abroad. All this means that the economy has had no foreign-exchange problem, but also that incentives to produce for export have been held down severely, when both near-term recovery and longer-term growth badly need the stimulus of rising exports.\n\nThe government was more successful in the part of its program aimed at trade liberalization. As has been noted, the average tariff rate was cut greatly in two steps, in September 1990 and March 1991. Quantitative restrictions were eliminated, and the tariff structure was greatly simplified. Effective protection was brought down to a lower level than at any point since the mid1960s, with a more coherent structure that left much less room for distorted incentives.\n\nFujimori is credited by many Peruvians for bringing stability to the country after the violence and hyperinflation of the Garc\u00eda years. While it is generally agreed that the \"Fujishock\" brought short/middle-term macroeconomic stability, the long-term social impact of Fujimori's free market economic policies is still hotly debated.\n\nNeoliberal reforms under Fujimori took place in three distinct phases: an initial \"orthodox\" phase (1990\u201392) in which technocrats dominated the reform agenda; a \"pragmatic\" phase (1993\u201398) that saw the growing influence of business elites over government priorities; and a final \"watered-down\" phase (1999\u20132000) dominated by a clique of personal loyalists and their [[Clientelism|clientelist]] policies that aimed to secure Fujimori a third term as president. Business was a big winner of the reforms, with its influence increasing significantly within both the state and society.<ref name = \"Arce 2005\">{{cite book |last= Arce |first= Mois\u00e9s |year= 2005 |title= Market Reform in Society: Post-Crisis Politics and Economic Change in Authoritarian Peru |location= University Park, PA |publisher= [[Penn State University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-271-02542-1 }}</ref>\n\n===Constitutional crisis===\n{{Main|Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992}}\n\nDuring Fujimori's first term in office, APRA and Vargas Llosa's party, [[Democratic Front (Peru)|FREDEMO]], remained in control of both chambers of Congress (the [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Chamber of Deputies]] and [[Congress of the Republic of Peru|Senate]]), hampering the government's ability to enact economic reforms.

He called elections for a [[Democratic Constitutional Congress]] that would serve as a legislature and a [[constituent assembly]]. While [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] and [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action]] attempted to boycott this, the Popular Christian Party (PPC, not to be confused with PCP Partido Comunista del Peru) and many left-leaning parties participated in this election. His supporters won a majority in this body, and drafted a [[Constitution of Peru|new constitution]] in 1993. A referendum was scheduled, and the coup and the Constitution of 1993 were approved by a narrow margin of between four and five percent.\n\nLater in the year, on 13 November, there was a failed military coup, led by General [[Jaime Salinas Sed\u00f3]]. Salinas asserted that his efforts were a matter of turning Fujimori over for trial, for violating the Peruvian constitution.<ref>Conaghan, Catherine M. ''Fujimori's Peru: Deception in the Public Sphere''. 2006, page 55.</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Fujimori separated from his wife [[Susana Higuchi]] in a noisy, public divorce. He formally stripped her of the title [[First Lady]] in August 1994, appointing their elder daughter First Lady in her stead. Higuchi publicly denounced Fujimori as a \"tyrant\" and claimed that his administration was corrupt. They formally divorced in 1995.\n\n==Second term: July 28, 1995 \u2013 July 28, 2000==\nThe 1993 Constitution allowed Fujimori to run for a second term, and in April 1995, at the height of his popularity, Fujimori easily won reelection with almost two-thirds of the vote. His major opponent, former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], won only 22 percent of the vote. Fujimori's supporters won comfortable majorities in the legislature. One of the first acts of the new congress was to declare an amnesty for all members of the Peruvian military or police accused or convicted of human rights abuses between 1980 and 1995.\n\nDuring his second term, Fujimori signed a peace agreement with [[Ecuador]] over a [[History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute|border dispute]] that had simmered for more than a century. The treaty allowed the two countries to obtain international funds for developing the border region. Fujimori also settled some unresolved issues with Chile, Peru's southern neighbor, outstanding since the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima of 1929]].<ref>Dominguez, Jorge ''et al.''

Peruvians now began to be more concerned about freedom of speech and the press.

A 1998 effort to repeal this law by referendum failed.<ref>David R.

Eventually, Fujimori was credited with 49.89%\u201420,000 votes short of avoiding a runoff. Despite reports of numerous irregularities, the international observers recognized an adjusted victory of Fujimori. His primary opponent, [[Alejandro Toledo]], called for his supporters to spoil their ballots in the runoff by writing \"No to fraud!\" on them (voting is mandatory in Peru). International observers pulled out of the country after Fujimori refused to delay the runoff.\n\nIn the runoff, Fujimori won with 51.1% of the valid votes. While votes for Toledo declined from 40.24% of the valid votes cast in the first round to 25.67% of the valid votes in the second round, invalid votes jumped from 2.25% of the total votes cast in the first round to 29.93% of total votes in the second round. The large percentage of votes cast as invalid suggested that many Peruvians took Toledo's advice to spoil their ballots.\n\n(The 51.1 and 25 figures are as percentages of valid votes, that is, excluding invalid votes. Thus, there were 29.93% invalid votes and 70.07% valid votes. Of this 70.07%, 51.1% were for Fujimori and 25.67% for Toledo.)\n\nAlthough Fujimori had won the runoff with only a bare majority, rumors of irregularities led most of the international community to shun his third swearing-in on 28 July. For the next seven weeks, there were daily demonstrations in front of the presidential palace.\n\nAs a conciliatory measure, Fujimori appointed former opposition candidate Federico Salas as the new prime minister. However, opposition parties in Parliament refused to support this move while Toledo campaigned vigorously to have the election annulled. At this point, a corruption scandal involving Vladimiro Montesinos broke out, and exploded into full force on the evening of 14 September 2000, when the cable television station [[Canal N]] broadcast footage of Montesinos apparently bribing opposition congressman Alberto Kouri for his defection to Fujimori's ''Per\u00fa 2000'' party. This video was presented by [[Fernando Olivera]], leader of the FIM (Independent Moralizing Front), who purchased it from one of Montesinos's closest allies (nicknamed by the Peruvian press ''El Patriota'').\n\nFujimori's support virtually collapsed, and a few days later he announced in a nationwide address that he would shut down the SIN and call new elections\u2014in which he would not be a candidate. On 10 November, Fujimori won approval from Congress to hold elections on 8 April 2001. On 13 November, Fujimori left Peru for a visit to [[Brunei]] to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. On 16 November, [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] took over as president of Congress after the pro-Fujimori leadership lost a vote of confidence. On 17 November, Fujimori traveled from Brunei to Tokyo, where he submitted his presidential [[resignation]] via fax. The Peruvian Congress refused to accept his resignation, voting instead 62 yea \u20139 nay to remove Fujimori from the office of the president of Peru on the grounds that he was \"permanently morally disabled.\"\n\nOn November 19, Fujimori's government ministers presented their resignations en masse. Because Fujimori's first vice president, Francisco Tudela, had resigned a few days earlier, his successor Ricardo M\u00e1rquez was called the new president. Congress, however, refused to recognize him, as he was an ardent Fujimori loyalist; M\u00e1rquez resigned two days later. Paniagua was voted by the Peruvian Congress as the next in line, and became interim president to oversee the April elections.\n\n===Criticism===\nDetractors have observed that Fujimori was able to encourage large-scale mining projects with foreign corporations and push through mining-friendly legislation laws because the post auto-coup political picture greatly facilitated the process.\n\nSome analysts state that some of the GDP growth during the Fujimori years reflects a greater rate of extraction of non-renewable resources by transnational companies; these companies were attracted by Fujimori by means of near-zero royalties, and, by the same fact, little of the extracted wealth has stayed in the country.<ref>\"Chile, Peru \u2013 How much do mining companies contribute?

Shortly after coming to office Toledo met with IMF officials and promised that he would raise $700 million in 2002, and almost one billion dollars in 2003, by selling state assets.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_FVIOhdR9n8C&pg=PA535&dq=alejandro+toledo+free+trade#v=onepage&q=alejandro%20toledo%20free%20trade&f=false|title=A History of Latin America|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|isbn=978-0618783182|last1=Keen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Haynes|first2=Keith A.|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n==The Alejandro Toledo Administration 2001\u20132006==\n\nFormer Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo claims he is a living proof of [[The Peruvian Miracle]].<ref name=\"weeklystandard.com\">http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/peruvian-miracle_696104.html | http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/120217/peru-latin-america-economy-growth | http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-04-23/peru-s-stealthy-advance-toward-a-modern-economy | https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/peru-growth-in-a-time-of-recession/</ref> Toledo began shining shoes and selling lottery tickets as a boy in the Andes.

He inherited a national economy which in the previous decade had experienced an unstable GDP with periods of growth and shrinkage, as well as fiscal deficits frequently amounting to over 2% of GDP. Inflation had not dropped below 23% until 1995 and was still feared by many. In response, Toledo developed policies which focused on fighting poverty, generating employment, decentralizing government, and modernizing the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eC7D_m1KTV4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=alejandro+toledo#v=onepage&q=toledo&f=false|title=Peru's Relations with Pacific Asia|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|isbn=9783825888206|last1=Mann|first1=Stefanie|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nAmong Toledo's initiatives designed to generate revenue and transform the economy were plans to privatize national industries. The first major effort of this kind was the $167 million sale of two state-owned electric companies. Protests in the city of Arequipa turned violent as Peruvians reacted with anger to the prospect of layoffs and higher priced electricity. They also recalled that billions of dollars earned from privatization under the Fujimori administration had ended up filling the president's personal bank accounts. Toledo decided not to carry out the sale of electric companies, but promised to continue privatization efforts, which were a key provision of a deal struck with the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Toledo had promised to bring in US$700 million through privatization in 2001 and US$1 billion in 2002.<ref>Forero, Juan \"Peruvians Riot Over the Planned Sale of 2 Regional Power Plants\" ''The New York Times''18, June 2002.

[[Ollanta Humala]] has been its most vocal critic. Humala's [[Union for Peru]] won 45 of 120 seats in Congress in 2006, the largest share by a single party, prompting debate on ratification of the agreement before the new legislature was sworn in.

By planting crops to similar to those subsidized by the U.S., Peru faced a competitive disadvantage in the production of agricultural products because poor farming families with inadequate tools, technology and techniques may not be able to produce crops at low enough prices to export. In response to these concerns, Peruvian lawmakers created a Compensation Fund which directed $34 million per year to cotton, maize/corn, and wheat producers for a five-year period to help them adjust to the new competitive pressures.<ref>[http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?cc=&pushme=1&tmpFBSel=sel&totaldocs=&taggedDocs=Z3%3ACZ1%3A9Z4%3A1Z2%3A&toggleValue=&numDocsChked=5&prefFBSel=0&delformat=XCITE&fpDocs=&fpNodeId=&fpCiteReq=&expNewLead=id%3D%22expandedNewLead%22&brand=ldc&dedupeOption=0&T13=13&T14=14&T21=21&T24=24&T44=44&_m=b25310ca06c95e5101aed43f0564638e&docnum=13&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLzVtz-zSkAb&_md5=8b3fa70e011f0b65909af1841603d9c7&focBudTerms=&focBudSel=sel \"Peruvian Congress Passes U.S. Free-Trade Pact\"]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Retrieved May 2011</ref>\n\nToledo is therefore a market-oriented politician who continued to globalize Peru's economy and is rumored to be getting ready for another run for president. Toledo says bluntly that unless the poorest in the country are better educated, better paid, housed, and fed, the Peruvian economic miracle will stall.\n\n===Acuerdo Nacional===\n\nIn November 2001, Toledo opened talks which concluded in the National Accord of July 22, 2002.

The accord set forth twenty-four policy goals divided into four categories: democracy and the rule of law, [[equity (economics)|equity]] and [[social justice]], economic competitiveness, and an institutional framework of efficiency, transparency, and [[decentralization]].

These critics claim that companies buy land at unreasonable prices, force indigenous people off of land that is historically theirs, and exploit natural resources in ways that are harmful to communities and the environment. Peru is one of the largest producers of gold, silver, and zinc in Latin America, and some critics complain about the priority the Peruvian government gives to mining as opposed to industries like fishing and agriculture, with which indigenous peoples are more familiar.

Tax-collections, at below 12.1% of GDP, are stagnant, with most coming from a handful of large, formal companies.

The Cooperative Fund for Social Development funded projects to construct and improve schools, health clinics, rural roads, water and sanitation systems, and electric grids. Toledo placed food and infrastructure programs under the Ministry for Women and Social Development and urged that municipalities implement decentralization. Social safety-net spending in Peru remained well below the Latin American average under Toledo even as it covered a larger percentage of the population, which means that outlays were insufficient to lift many people up out of poverty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nToledo also attempted to improve access to healthcare in the most remote places. His Juntos program awarded a monthly benefit to poor families who agreed to get vaccinations and screenings, attend school, and obtain birth registration documents. The Toledo administration also provided financial incentives to young doctors who were willing to spend the first few years of their practices in remote areas.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nPeru faced a major housing deficit in 2001, with the majority of its urban population living in slums. Toledo's administration sought to improve access to affordable housing through subsidies, loans, down payments, land titling, and encouraging financial institutions to reach further down-market. Most of these efforts were grouped under the Fondo Mivivienda, which was program started in 1999.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nUnder Toledo's predecessor, Fujimori, the governing authority in Peru was condensed and centralized.  A Fujimori-dominated congress passed a new constitution in 1993, which consolidated the [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] into a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with a single national district. Under Fujimori local governments retained minimal legal authority including fees for utilities, basic civil registries, and management of public spaces and markets.\n\nDecentralization was among Toledo's most successful institutional reforms. In addition to announcing regional elections upon his inauguration, he charged a Decentralization and Regionalization Commission with developing proposals. In 2002, a constitutional amendment was approved which established three levels of government: local, regional, and national. Over the next few years, the congress gradually passed on resources and responsibilities to the regional and municipal governments including food programs, social development projects, and health and education programs.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> He divided the single district up, called for regional elections, and eliminated the centralist Ministry of the Presidency that had been instituted under Fujimori.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">J.

In August 2003, Toledo met with President Lula. They committed to increased political and economic cooperation under the Initiative for Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America which invests in large-scale, debt-heavy projects, aimed at developing 10 economic axes or hubs throughout South America. Construction projects, including roads, discussed. President Lula also agreed to allow Peru access to two surveillance systems which Brazil had developed in the Amazon Basin to target legal and illegal activity.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nWhile Peru and Ecuador had been at peace for years, President Toledo worked to solidify and build upon that peace. During a 2001 visit to Ecuador, Toledo expressed support for the Bras\u00edlia Accords, agreed to the demilitarization of the two countries\u2019 common border, advocated reduced military spending, and agreed to greater energy, transportation, and police cooperation. Toledo joined Ecuadorian President Noboa at the International Advisory Committee of the Binational Development Plan, where they called for greater investment in their region, with Toledo putting forth a detailed program for international assistance. Economic activity in the region subsequently improved as the demining of the border continued, construction projects were completed, and military forces were reduced. By 2006, investment in the area had reached $1.2 billion.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nPresident Toledo worked hard throughout his presidency on what became a very productive relationship with the U.S., and what Toledo described as a personal friendship with President Bush. He received lavish praise from the American president for his economic and domestic security policies. During a visit to Peru, Bush announced the establishment of an Andean Center of Excellence for Teacher Training, with a base in Peru, and a fellowship program to give Andean professionals access to education in information technology. In June 2002, the U.S. agreed to forgive $14 million of Peru's debt in exchange for a promise to invest $12 million in conservation projects. In September, Toledo secured a $300 million commitment from Bush to fund alternative-crop development in coca-producing areas.

Thanks to strong foreign investment and the cooperation between the Fujimori government and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, growth was strong in 1994-97 and inflation was brought under control. In 1998, El Ni\u00f1o's impact on agriculture, the financial crisis in Asia, and instability in Brazilian markets undercut growth. 1999 was another lean year for Peru, with the aftermath of El Ni\u00f1o and the Asian financial crisis working its way through the economy. Lima did manage to complete negotiations for an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF in June 1999, although it subsequently had to renegotiate the targets.\n\nPeru's exponential per-capita growth rates has been standard the last quarter century. Peru's GDP per capita is now FY 2013 at US$12,000 PPP. By the end of 2006 the government had enacted measures that allowed the economy to improve by increasing investments, expanding production and exports. Raw materials and agroindustrial products represent half of exports with the other half being non-traditional exports such as clothing, electronics, machinery and services. By the end of the decade of 2014, investment is expected to total US$65 billion for mining activities, US$20 billion in energy and petroleum, US$12 billion for commerce, US$18 billion for agricultural industries, and US$15 billion for tourism. Thanks to the discovery and exploitation of large petroleum and natural gas reserves in southern Peru in the [[Cusco]] and [[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]] regions by Consorcio Camisea, Peru is expected[who?] to become an important exporter of hydrocarbons by 2015, after being a net importer for decades.\n\nPositive results have begun to appear after 15 years, reflecting an expanding global economy; according to figures provided by the INEI, in 2007 the gross national product grew by 8.99%, exports grew by over 35% (reaching US$27.8 billion), private and public investments accounted for 21% of the GDP (24.4% in 2008), net international reserves (including gold) reached US$35.1 billion, state income from taxation increased by 33%, national debt with respect to GNP was reduced from 50% in 2000 to 34% in 2006; finally, the national budget has grown by 50% in the five years before 2007.\n\nIn 2007, the Peruvian economy experienced a growth rate of 9%, the highest in Latin America, and this repeated in 2008 with a 9.8% rate; in 2006 and 2007, the [[Lima Stock Exchange]] grew by 185.24%\n<ref>[http://www.bvl.com.pe/english/estadist/dat_infostat_en.pdf Bolsa de Valores de Lima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808150533/http://www.bvl.com.pe/english/estadist/dat_infostat_en.pdf |date=2007-08-08 }}</ref> and 168.3%,<ref>[http://www.bvl.com.pe/publi_infmensuales.html Bolsa de Valores de Lima] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714134300/http://www.bvl.com.pe/publi_infmensuales.html |date=2008-07-14 }}</ref> respectively.

Peru agricultural exports are highly appreciated and include artichokes, grapes, avocados, mangoes, peppers, sugarcane, organic coffee and premium-quality cotton.\n\n===Industry and services===\n\n====Extraction====\nFishing: Peru is an international leader in [[fishing]], producing nearly 10 percent of the world's fish catch.\n\n[[Mining in Peru]]: Peru ranks fifth worldwide in [[gold]] production ( first in [[Latin America]] ), second in [[copper]], and is among the top five producers of [[lead]] and [[zinc]].\n\n==== Manufacturing ====\nPeru has developed a medium manufacturing sector. The sector now represents 23 percent of GDP and is tied heavily to mining, fishing, agriculture, construction and textiles. Manufacturing is mainly devoted to processing to gain a value-added advantage. The most promising sector is textiles, metal mechanics, food industry, agricultural industry, manufactures, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery and services.\n\n==== Services ====\nTourism has represented a new growth industry in Peru since the early 1990s, with the government and private sector dedicating considerable energies to boosting the country's tourist destinations both to Peruvians and foreigners.\n\n===Natural resources===\nPeru's natural resources are copper, silver, gold, timber, fish, iron ore, coal, phosphate, potash, and natural gas.\n\n==External trade and investment==\n\n===Foreign investment and balance of payments===\n\n====Foreign trade and balance of payments====\n[[File:Peru Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Peru's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\nIn 2001 the current account deficit dropped to about 2.2% of GDP ([[US dollar|US$]]1.17 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]])--from 3.1% in 2000\u2014while the trade balance registered a small deficit. Exports dropped slightly to $7.11 billion, while imports fell 2.1% to $7.20 billion. After being hit hard by El Ni\u00f1o in 1998, fisheries exports have recovered, and minerals and metals exports recorded large gains in 2001 and 2002, mostly as a result of the opening of the Antamina copper-zinc mine. By mid-2002, most sectors of the economy were showing gains. After several years of substantial growth, foreign direct investment not related to privatization fell dramatically in 2000 and 2001, as well as in the first half of 2002. Net international reserves at the end of May 2002 stood at $9.16 billion, up from $8.6 billion (2001), $17 billion at the end of 2006, over $20 billion in 2007, and over $35 billion in May 2008. Peru has signed a number of free trade agreements, including the 2007 [[United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement]], and agreements with [[Chile]], [[Canada]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[China]]. Under President Alan Garcia administration Peru achieved a bilateral trade agreement with U.S. since 2010 to improve exports for its country and reach in August 2011 its pick in exports of more than 4,700 MM.\n\n====Foreign investment====\n[[File:Puerto de Callao.jpg|thumb|right|The Port of Callao is Peru's gateway for exports and imports]]\nThe Peruvian government actively seeks to attract both foreign and domestic investment in all sectors of the economy. International investment was spurred by the significant progress Peru made during the 1990s toward economic, social, and political stability, but it slowed again after the government delayed privatizations and as political uncertainty increased in 2000. President Alejandro Toledo has made investment promotion a priority of his government. While Peru was previously marked by terrorism, hyperinflation, and government intervention in the economy, the Government of Peru under former President Alberto Fujimori took the steps necessary to bring those problems under control. Democratic institutions, however, and especially the judiciary, remain weak.\n\nThe Government of Peru's economic stabilization and liberalization program lowered trade barriers, eliminated restrictions on capital flows, and opened the economy to foreign investment, with the result that Peru now has one of the most open investment regimes in the world. Between 1992 and 2001, Peru attracted almost $17 billion in foreign direct investment in Peru, after negligible investment until 1991, mainly from [[Spain]] (32.35%),<ref>{{cite journal|title = Foreign investment statistics (in Spanish)| url = http://www.proinversion.gob.pe/0/0/modulos/JER/PlantillaStandardsinHijos.aspx?ARE=0&PFL=0&JER=1537}}</ref> the [[United States]] (17.51%), [[Switzerland]] (6.99%), [[Chile]] (6.63%), and [[Mexico]] (5.53%). The basic legal structure for foreign investment in Peru is formed by the 1993 constitution, the [[Private Investment Growth Law]], and the November 1996 [[Investment Promotion Law]]. Although Peru does not have a bilateral investment treaty with the United States, it has signed an agreement (1993) with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation ([[Overseas Private Investment Corporation|OPIC]]) concerning OPIC-financed loans, guarantees, and investments. Peru also has committed itself to arbitration of investment disputes under the auspices of ICSID (the [[World Bank]]'s[[International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes]]) or other international or national arbitration tribunals.\n\n==Currency==\n\nThe [[Peruvian sol|sol]] is the currency of Peru. The exchange rate as of March 23, 2020 is 3.53 soles to the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] and 3.82 soles to the [[Euro]]. It was instated in 1991, when the Peruvian government abandoned the [[Peruvian inti|inti]] due to [[hyperinflation]] of the currency; the nuevo sol has since maintained the lowest inflation rate in Latin America.<ref>San Jos\u00e9 State University Department of Economics, [http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/peru.htm#GARCIA The economic history and the economy of Peru].

The name ''sol'' comes from the Latin ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', and is also the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"[[sun]]\", which the ancient [[Inca]] civilization worshiped as the god [[Inti]].\n\nThe nuevo sol currently enjoys a low inflation rate of 2.5%.<ref name=\"IMF\" /> Since it was put into use, the sol's exchange rate with the [[United States dollar]] has stayed mostly between 2.80 and 3.30 to 1. Out of all the currencies of the Latin American region, the sol is the most stable and reliable, being the least affected by the downturn in the value of the US dollar; during late 2007 and early 2008, the exchange rate fell to 2.69 to 1, which had not been seen since 1997. The exchange rate is set on a daily basis by the ''Banco Central de Reserva del Per\u00fa'' (Central Reserve Bank of Peru).\n\nThe sol is divided into 100 [[c\u00e9ntimo]]s. The highest-denomination banknote is the 200 soles note; the lowest-denomination coin is the rarely used 5 c\u00e9ntimos coin.\n\n==Income and consumption==\n\nPeru divides its population into five socio-economic classes, A-E, with A representing the rich; B, the upper middle class; C, the middle class; D, the working class and low income families; and E, the marginalized poor. In 2018, the segments were described as \"crude\" by Miguel Planas of the Ministry of Finance due to the complicated structure of the society in Peru, where some classes make money off of illegal trade which aren't counted in the GDP, and are thus falsely classified as low income or marginalised poor families.\n\n==Employment==\nUnemployment in Greater Lima is 5.6%, while for the rest of Peru is 7%.

President [[Alejandro Toledo]] implemented a recovery program after taking office, maintained largely orthodox economic policies, and took measures to attract investment, including restarting the privatization program. Nonetheless, political uncertainty led to GDP growth of 0.2% in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Lima Stock Exchange general index fell 34.5% in 2000 and 0.2% in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Inflation remained at record lows, registering 3.7% in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe year 2001 saw [[Deflation (economics)|deflation]] of 0.1%.

Peru's stability brought about a substantial reduction in [[underemployment]], from an average of 74% from the late 1980s through 1994 to 43% in the 1995-96 period, but the rates began climbing again in 1997-2002 to over half the working population. The poverty rate remained at 54% in 2001, with 24% of Peruvians living in extreme poverty.

Alternative crops, however, are not economically comparable to coca.  2004 prices indicate an annual income per hectare of $600 for coffee and $1000 for cocoa, versus up to $7500 for a hectare of coca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devida.gob.pe|title=DEVIDA - Comisi\u00f3n Nacional para el Desarrollo y Vida sin Drogas|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Effect on family economies====\nThe anti-coca policies imposed in 1995 have had adverse effects on Peruvian's household economies.  Many families dependent on coca farming have been forced to send their children to work as eradication of crops has decreased their household income.<ref name=\"Dammert\"/>  In states where coca is grown, [[child labour]] increased by 18% in 1997 and 40% in 2000. Work hours and domestic work increased as well, with girls taking on 28% more domestic work with boys doing 13% more.  Wage work for adults also increased since 1995.  As such, it can be inferred that the increase in child labour since eradication policies have come into effect is caused by children filling in for working parents.<ref name=\"Dammert\"/><br />\nHowever, the issue of child labour in coca production is still present in Peru as reported in 2013 in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]]'s report ''Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor'' and in December 2014, in the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''.\n\n===Corruption===\nPeru is the 101st least corrupt country in the world according to [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].\n\nThe Peruvian organization ''\"Ciudadanos al Dia\"'' has started to measure and compare transparency, costs, and efficiency in different government departments in Peru. It annually awards the best practices which has received widespread media attention. This has created competition among government agencies in order to improve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more|title=Private Sector Development|accessdate=11 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920181947/http://psdblog.worldbank.org/psdblog/2006/08/why_benchmarkin.html#more|archive-date=2009-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA last case of corruption was the [[2008 Peru oil scandal]].\n\n==Statistics==\n[[File:Poverty Rate in Peru 2004 to 2012.png|350px|thumbnail|right|Peru's poverty rate from 2004 to 2012.]]\n'''Household income or consumption by percentage share:'''\n<br />''lowest 10%:''\n0.8%\n<br />''highest 10%:''\n37.5% (2000)\n\n'''Inflation rate (consumer prices):'''\n2.08% (2010)\n\n'''Budget:'''\n<br />''revenues:''\n$57 billion (2014 est.)\n<br />''expenditures:''\n$50 billion, including long-term capital expenditures of $3.8 billion (2010 est.)\n\n'''Industrial production growth rate:'''\n12% (2013 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - production:'''\n175,500 GWh (2013 est.)\n\n'''Electricity - production by source:'''\n<br />''natural gas:''\n44.53%\n<br />''hydro:''\n54.79%\n<br />''nuclear:''\n0%\n<br />''other:''\n0.68% (2013)\n\n'''Electricity - consumption:'''\n133,000 GWh (2013)\n\n'''Electricity - exports:'''\n32,000 kWh (2013) mainly to Ecuador\n\n'''Electricity - imports:'''\n0 kWh (2013)\n\n'''Agriculture - products:'''\n[[coffee]], [[cotton]], [[sugarcane]], [[rice]], [[wheat]], [[potato]]es, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[coca]]; [[poultry]], [[beef]], [[dairy]] products, [[wool]]; [[fish]]\n\n'''Exports:'''\n63.5 billion f.o.b.

The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue, the 1974 \"Gateshead Games\", was instigated by [[Brendan Foster]], a Gateshead Council employee at that time. By breaking the world record in the [[3000 metres|men's 3,000&nbsp;m]], Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue, which has since hosted the [[British Grand Prix (athletics)|British Grand Prix]] (2003&ndash;10) and the [[European Team Championships]] in 1989, 2000 and 2013. It is the only venue to have hosted the latter event three times. Five world records have been set at the stadium, including two by [[pole vault]]er [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] and a tied [[100 metres]] record by [[Asafa Powell]] in 2006.\n\nAlthough the venue primarily caters for athletics, it is the current or former home to teams in several sports. It has been used by the town's main football club since 1971. Gateshead International Stadium was home to the [[Gateshead Thunder (1999)|Gateshead Thunder]] [[rugby league]] club during their spell in the [[Super League]] and the replacement [[Newcastle Thunder|Gateshead Thunder club]] played home games in the main arena, which was known as the '''Thunderdome''' when used by that team<ref>{{cite web|title=Gateshead Thunder end two-and-a-half-year wait for win|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/19422254|publisher=[[BBC|the BBC]]|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> until the club relocated to Newcastle in 2015.

The inaugural athletics competition at the redeveloped venue, the 1974 \"Gateshead Games\", was instigated by [[Brendan Foster]], a Gateshead Council employee at that time. By breaking the world record in the [[3000 metres|men's 3,000&nbsp;m]], Foster brought international publicity to the new stadium and began a tradition of athletics competitions at the venue, which has since hosted the [[British Grand Prix (athletics)|British Grand Prix]] (2003&ndash;10) and the [[European Team Championships]] in 1989, 2000 and 2013. It is the only venue to have hosted the latter event three times. Five world records have been set at the stadium, including two by [[pole vault]]er [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] and a tied [[100 metres]] record by [[Asafa Powell]] in 2006.\n\nAlthough the venue primarily caters for athletics, it is the current or former home to teams in several sports. It has been used by the town's main football club since 1971. Gateshead International Stadium was home to the [[Gateshead Thunder (1999)|Gateshead Thunder]] [[rugby league]] club during their spell in the [[Super League]] and the replacement [[Newcastle Thunder|Gateshead Thunder club]] played home games in the main arena, which was known as the '''Thunderdome''' when used by that team<ref>{{cite web|title=Gateshead Thunder end two-and-a-half-year wait for win|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/19422254|publisher=[[BBC|the BBC]]|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> until the club relocated to Newcastle in 2015.

He was killed in action at the [[Battle of Fair Oaks]] during the [[Peninsula Campaign]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn L. Riker was born in [[Manhattan]] in New York City. His father, James Riker (Sr.) was a merchant, landowner and, at one stage, a New York City alderman. His mother, Elizabeth Van Arsdale, was the daughter of [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[John Van Arsdale]] of [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]] fame. John Lafayette was the younger brother of [[James Riker]], the New York genealogist who wrote ''A Brief History of the Riker Family, from Their First Emigration to This Country in the Year 1638, to the Present Time'' (1851), ''History of Harlem'' (1881) and ''Evacuation Day, 1783, with Recollections of Capt. John Van Arsdale, of the [[Veteran Corps of Artillery of the State of New York|Veteran Corps of Artillery]]'' (1883).\n\nJohn L. Riker is said to have been given his second name, \"Lafayette\", by his grandfather, John Van Arsdale, in honor of [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Gen. Lafayette]], who had arrived at Staten Island on the day that Riker was born. Van Arsdale had served with Lafayette during the Revolutionary War and had met with him on August 16, 1824, the day after Riker's birth. Van Arsdale and the Veteran Corp of Artillery, of which he was a member, had received Gen. Lafayette at [[Battery Park|the Battery]], on that day. Despite a lapse of forty-four years, Van Arsdale was recognized by Gen. Lafayette, which so pleased him that later that day when he visited his newborn grandson, he named him \"John Lafayette\".<ref>Riker, James, ''\"Evacuation Day\" 1783, Its Many Stirring Events: With recollections of Capt. John Van Arsdale of the Veteran Corp of Artillery, by whose efforts on that day the enemy were circumvented, and the American flag successfully raised on the Battery,'' New York, 1883, p. 49.</ref>\n\nSometime in the 1840s Riker married his first cousin Anna E. Elder. Anna was the eldest daughter of Hannah E. Riker, who was the younger sister of his father, James. About 1848 Anna gave birth to Riker's first child, Anna E. Riker. A year or two later she gave birth to a son, John L. Riker Jr. In 1851 Riker's wife, Anna, died of \"hysteria\". The following year his father James Riker Sr. died and in 1854 his young son, John L. Riker Jr. died of congestion on the brain.\n\nJohn L. Riker studied law and passed the New York state bar exam in 1860. He began the practice of law, but stopped shortly after the Civil War erupted and he answered President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s call to arms to put down the rebellion.<ref>[http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/riker.pdf New York Public Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123021541/http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/riker.pdf |date=2006-11-23 }} Note that researcher John Tierney suggests that while Riker had passed his bar exam in 1860 there is not yet any clear evidence that he practised as an attorney. However, the ''New York Times'', from the same period, often mentions a John Lawrence Riker, also of New York City, who did practice law and was related to John Lafayette Riker. It is possible that the two could be confused.</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\nRiker enlisted in the Union Army April 19, 1861, at [[Saltersville, New Jersey]], where his [[regiment]] was soon to be encamped. He was appointed the [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of a volunteer regiment, initially known as the [[Anderson Zouaves]], that he had raised in New York under the auspices of [[Major Robert Anderson]] \"the hero of [[Fort Sumter]].\" Riker and his regiment left \"Camp Astor\", on his namesake [[Riker's Island]], for Washington, D.C. on August 21, 1861, for service in what became the [[Army of the Potomac]].\n\nIn early 1862 Riker was courtmartialled for creating a false roster, for extorting money from sutlers and for keeping a woman in his headquarters. However, he was found innocent of the charges, this despite the court having established that a woman, posing as soldier of the regiment, had in fact been with the regiment since it started recruiting in Union Square in 1861 and had spent time with Riker's daughter, Annie, in his headquarters at [[Tenleytown|Tennallytown]], DC.\n\nDue to his court martial, Riker was unable to lead his regiment during the advance on Manassas in early March 1862, but was able to lead his men later that same month to [[Fortress Monroe]], with the rest of the Army of the Potomac, as part of [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] [[Peninsula Campaign]]. Riker led his regiment into action at the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] and the [[Battle of Seven Pines|Battle of Fair Oaks]] in May 1862.\n\nRiker was killed in action at the head of his regiment on the right wing of the Federal line at the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862. His last words were \"Remember, when you are out of ammunition, steel will kill the devil!\"<ref>June 11, 1862 <ref></ref>Richmond Dispatch.</ref> Several officers of the regiment, including Lieutenant [[James H. Bradley]], Riker's aide-de-camp, and, it is assumed, the regimental chaplain, John Harvey, accompanied the body back to New York City. At a meeting of the friends of Colonel Riker held on June 7, 1862, at the Everett House, New York, which was attended by, amongst others, [[George W. Morton]], Ex-recorder [[Frederick A. Tallmadge]], Mr. E. B. Wood of [[Brooklyn|Kings County]] and several officers of the Anderson Zouaves, arrangements were made for his funeral. At the meeting Lieut. Bradley gave a long and interesting account of the part played by the regiment in the battle of Fair Oaks from which Riker's coolness under the most trying situations was evident. Bradley incidentally remarked that the Colonel was not struck while waving his sword, as he never drew his sword at all, but spent most of the time quietly smoking his cigar.<ref>''New York Times'', June 8, 1861, p.5.</ref>\n\nWith Riker's death [[David John Nevin]], [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of the regiment, was promoted to colonel, on the field, a position which became effective on June 20 and which he held until he was mustered out on June 29, 1864. The regiment's major [[Oscar Veniah Dayton]], was in turn, promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\nRiker's body lay in state at the Governor's Room of New York's City Hall and on June 10 his body, along with that of Colonel  [[James Miller (Colonel)|James Miller]] of the [[81st Pennsylvania Infantry|81st Pennsylvania]] who had been killed in the same battle, was escorted by the New York State Militia (specifically the Fifth Regiment, a battalion of the Fifty-fifth Regiment, a troop of horse, a troop of Lancers and the Harlem Chasseurs), to [[Green-wood Cemetery]], Brooklyn, where Riker's body was placed in a temporary vault while it awaited permanent interment.\n\nWhile it is not certain, it is possible that prior to the war Riker was a fire fighter and a member of the Mechanics Hook & Ladder Company No 7, which had its headquarters on Third Ave and 126th Street, close to the Riker family home near the corner of Fifth Ave and 125th street, Harlem. It is known that a number of the recruits of the Anderson Zouaves were members of New York fire companies and representatives of the Mechanics Hook & Ladder Company No 7 attended his funeral in June 1862. A newspaper report says that Riker was an honorary member of the company, while another report says that when Riker left New York for the seat of war he wore a scarlet shirt under his Zouave jacket.\n\n==Honors==\nNew York\u2019s [[Grand Army of the Republic]] Post #62 was chartered in May 1873 in his name.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061123021541/http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/riker.pdf New York Public Library]\n* Townsend, Thomas S., ''The Honors of the Empire State in the War of the Rebellion'', New York: A.

However, he was found innocent of the charges, this despite the court having established that a woman, posing as soldier of the regiment, had in fact been with the regiment since it started recruiting in Union Square in 1861 and had spent time with Riker's daughter, Annie, in his headquarters at [[Tenleytown|Tennallytown]], DC.\n\nDue to his court martial, Riker was unable to lead his regiment during the advance on Manassas in early March 1862, but was able to lead his men later that same month to [[Fortress Monroe]], with the rest of the Army of the Potomac, as part of [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] [[Peninsula Campaign]]. Riker led his regiment into action at the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] and the [[Battle of Seven Pines|Battle of Fair Oaks]] in May 1862.\n\nRiker was killed in action at the head of his regiment on the right wing of the Federal line at the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862. His last words were \"Boys, we're surrounded&mdash;give them the cold steel!\"<ref>Townsend, page 312.</ref> Several officers of the regiment, including Lieutenant [[James H. Bradley]], Riker's aide-de-camp, and, it is assumed, the regimental chaplain, John Harvey, accompanied the body back to New York City. At a meeting of the friends of Colonel Riker held on June 7, 1862, at the Everett House, New York, which was attended by, amongst others, [[George W. Morton]], Ex-recorder [[Frederick A. Tallmadge]], Mr. E. B. Wood of [[Brooklyn|Kings County]] and several officers of the Anderson Zouaves, arrangements were made for his funeral. At the meeting Lieut. Bradley gave a long and interesting account of the part played by the regiment in the battle of Fair Oaks from which Riker's coolness under the most trying situations was evident. Bradley incidentally remarked that the Colonel was not struck while waving his sword, as he never drew his sword at all, but spent most of the time quietly smoking his cigar.<ref>''New York Times'', June 8, 1861, p.5.</ref>\n\nWith Riker's death [[David John Nevin]], [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of the regiment, was promoted to colonel, on the field, a position which became effective on June 20 and which he held until he was mustered out on June 29, 1864. The regiment's major [[Oscar Veniah Dayton]], was in turn, promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n\nRiker's body lay in state at the Governor's Room of New York's City Hall and on June 10 his body, along with that of Colonel  [[James Miller (Colonel)|James Miller]] of the [[81st Pennsylvania Infantry|81st Pennsylvania]] who had been killed in the same battle, was escorted by the New York State Militia (specifically the Fifth Regiment, a battalion of the Fifty-fifth Regiment, a troop of horse, a troop of Lancers and the Harlem Chasseurs), to [[Green-wood Cemetery]], Brooklyn, where Riker's body was placed in a temporary vault while it awaited permanent interment.\n\nWhile it is not certain, it is possible that prior to the war Riker was a fire fighter and a member of the Mechanics Hook & Ladder Company No 7, which had its headquarters on Third Ave and 126th Street, close to the Riker family home near the corner of Fifth Ave and 125th street, Harlem. It is known that a number of the recruits of the Anderson Zouaves were members of New York fire companies and representatives of the Mechanics Hook & Ladder Company No 7 attended his funeral in June 1862. A newspaper report says that Riker was an honorary member of the company, while another report says that when Riker left New York for the seat of war he wore a scarlet shirt under his Zouave jacket.\n\n==Honors==\nNew York\u2019s [[Grand Army of the Republic]] Post #62 was chartered in May 1873 in his name.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061123021541/http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/riker.pdf New York Public Library]\n* Townsend, Thomas S., ''The Honors of the Empire State in the War of the Rebellion'', New York: A.
