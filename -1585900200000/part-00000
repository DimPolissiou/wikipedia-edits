In his paper on the subject<ref>{{cite journal | last = Nicholls, MD, FLS | first = H A Alford | title = The Cultivation of Liberian Coffee | journal = Timehri : Being the Journal of the Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana | volume = 3 | pages = 286\u2013307 | publisher = J Thomson | location = Demerara | date = 1884}}</ref> he began by noting that \"Liberian coffee was introduced into the West Indies from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Gardens at Kew]] in the year 1874, when a few plants were sent by [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Sir Joseph Hooker]] to the Botanic Gardens at [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]], and to the late Dr Imray of Dominica.\" He goes on to describe the preferred soils and the need for shelter trees to protect from hurricanes.\n\nIn the early 1880s - during Hooker's last few years as Director of Kew - Nicholls was the Kew correspondent for Dominica. For that reason Nicholls dedicated his ''Text-Book on Tropical Agriculture'' to Sir Joseph.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = H A Alford | title = A Text-Book of Tropical Agriculture | pages = | publisher = Macmillan and Co. Ltd. | location = London | date = 1892}}</ref> The demand for it was such that the book was reprinted seven times at intervals of about five years; it was also translated into several languages along with [[Swiss]]-[[Venezuelan]] [[geographer]] and [[botanist]] [[Henri Fran\u00e7ois Pittier]]. Nicholls wrote many letters to Hooker, [[William Turner Thiselton-Dyer|Sir William Thiselton-Dyer]], [[Daniel Morris (botanist)|Daniel Morris]] and others at Kew.<ref>{{cite web | title = Archive Catalogue | website = Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | publisher =  | date =  | url = http://www.calmview.eu/kew/calmview/Overview.aspx | access-date = 18 February 2020}}</ref> He also contributed plants and seeds to the collection there.<ref>{{cite journal | last =  | first =  | title = A List of the Collectors Whose Plants Are in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to 31st December, 1899 | journal = Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information | volume = 1901 | page = 49 | publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew | location = Kew | date = 1901}}</ref>\n\nSoon after his election as a Corresponding Member of the [[Zoological Society of London]] (CMZS), Nicholls donated two common [[Boidae|boas]] and seven slender-fingered [[frogs]] to the zoo.<ref name = \"ZSL\">Broadhurst, Sarah, Archivist and Records Manager, Zoological Society of London, February 2020</ref>\n\nNicholls' passion for expanding the export of fruit was expressed in his booklet on ''The cultivation of the banana in Dominica''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicholls, MD, FLS | first = H A Alford | title = The cultivation of the banana in Dominica | pages = | publisher = A.T. Righton, Printer to the Govt. | location = | date = 1890}}</ref> He noted that now that [[Dominica]] had become the last port of call by the Quebec Steamship Company on its West Indies to New York line \"there is no reason why the planters of the island should not participate in the profits from the banana trade\", which currently was dominated by Jamaica. With his usual clarity and precision he went on to describe the conditions necessary for successful  propagation of the fruit.\n\nIn 1887, [[James Anthony Froude]] travelled to the West Indies. During his visit to [[Dominica]] he was invited by Nicholls to visit his home, where he saw the very successful cultivation of lime trees:\n{{Quote |text= I do not know the exact extent of the property which was under cultivation; perhaps it was twenty-five or thirty acres. The chief part of it was planted with lime trees, the limes which I saw growing being as large as moderate-sized lemons; most of the rest was covered with Liberian coffee, which does not object to the moist climate, and was growing with profuse luxuriance. Each tree, each plant had been personally attended to, pruned when it needed pruning, supported by bamboos if it was overgrowing its strength, while the ground about the house was consecrated to botanical experiments, and specimens were to be seen there of every tropical flower, shrub, or tree, which was either remarkable for its beauty or valuable for its chemical properties. His limes and coffee went principally to New York, where they had won a reputation, and were in special demand; but ingenuity tries other tracks besides the beaten one. Dr. Nicholls had a manufactory of [[Citric acid|citric acid]] which had been found equally excellent in Europe. Everything which he produced was turning to gold, except donkeys, seven or eight of which were feeding under his windows, and which multiplied so fast that he could not tell what to do with them. |author=James Anthony Froude |title= |source= ''The English in the West Indies'' (1888)<ref>{{cite book | last = Froude | first = James Anthony | title = The English in the West Indies: Or, The Bow of Ulysses | pages = | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co | location = London | date = 1888}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1889 [[The Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana]] sought and received advice on the packing of fruit for export. Nicholls gave precise instructions on when and how to cut [[oranges]] and [[lime (fruit)|lime]]s, wrap them in a special paper, and pack them in specific designs of crate or barrel.

For that reason Nicholls dedicated his ''Text-Book on Tropical Agriculture'' to Sir Joseph.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = H A Alford | title = A Text-Book of Tropical Agriculture | pages = | publisher = Macmillan and Co. Ltd. | location = London | date = 1892}}</ref> The demand for it was such that the book was reprinted seven times at intervals of about five years; it was also translated into several languages along with [[Swiss]]-[[Venezuelan]] [[geographer]] and [[botanist]] [[Henri Fran\u00e7ois Pittier]].

Righton, Printer to the Govt. | location = | date = 1890}}</ref> He noted that now that [[Dominica]] had become the last port of call by the Quebec Steamship Company on its West Indies to New York line \"there is no reason why the planters of the island should not participate in the profits from the banana trade\", which currently was dominated by Jamaica. With his usual clarity and precision he went on to describe the conditions necessary for successful  propagation of the fruit.\n\nIn 1887, [[James Anthony Froude]] travelled to the West Indies. During his visit to [[Dominica]] he was invited by Nicholls to visit his home, where he saw the very successful cultivation of lime trees:\n{{Quote |text= I do not know the exact extent of the property which was under cultivation; perhaps it was twenty-five or thirty acres. The chief part of it was planted with lime trees, the limes which I saw growing being as large as moderate-sized lemons; most of the rest was covered with Liberian coffee, which does not object to the moist climate, and was growing with profuse luxuriance. Each tree, each plant had been personally attended to, pruned when it needed pruning, supported by bamboos if it was overgrowing its strength, while the ground about the house was consecrated to botanical experiments, and specimens were to be seen there of every tropical flower, shrub, or tree, which was either remarkable for its beauty or valuable for its chemical properties. His limes and coffee went principally to New York, where they had won a reputation, and were in special demand; but ingenuity tries other tracks besides the beaten one. Dr. Nicholls had a manufactory of [[Citric acid|citric acid]] which had been found equally excellent in Europe. Everything which he produced was turning to gold, except donkeys, seven or eight of which were feeding under his windows, and which multiplied so fast that he could not tell what to do with them. |author=James Anthony Froude |title= |source= ''The English in the West Indies'' (1888)<ref>{{cite book | last = Froude | first = James Anthony | title = The English in the West Indies: Or, The Bow of Ulysses | pages = | publisher = Longmans, Green, and Co | location = London | date = 1888}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1889 [[The Royal Agricultural and Commercial Society of British Guiana]] sought and received advice on the packing of fruit for export.

It was established in 1932 following a recommendation by a military committee set up under the chairmanship of [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Field Marshal Philip Chetwode]]. From a class of 40 male cadets in 1932, IMA now has a sanctioned capacity of 1,650. Cadets undergo a training course varying between 3 and 16 months depending on entry criteria. On completion of the course at IMA cadets are permanently commissioned into the army as [[Army ranks and insignia of India|Lieutenant]]s.\n\nThe Academy, spread over {{convert|1400|acre|km2}}, houses the [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Chetwode]] Hall, [[Arun Khetarpal|Khetarpal]] Auditorium, [[Somnath Sharma|Somnath]] Stadium, [[Gurbachan Singh Salaria|Salaria]] Aquatic Centre, [[Hoshiar Singh Dahiya|Hoshiar Singh]] Gymnasium and other facilities that facilitate the training of cadets. Cadets in IMA are organized into a [[regiment]] with four [[battalion]]s of four [[company (military unit)|companies]] each. The Academy's mission, to train future military leaders of the Indian Army, goes hand in hand with the character building enshrined in the IMA honour code, warrior code and motto. Cadets take part in a variety of sports, adventure activities, physical training, drills, weapons training and leadership development activities.\n\nThe Academy's alumni include six recipients of India's highest military decoration, the [[Param Vir Chakra]], and India's first Field Marshal [[Sam Manekshaw]]. Other achievements by alumni include 73 [[Military Cross]]es, 17 [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakras]], 84 [[Maha Vir Chakra]]s and 41 [[Kirti Chakra]]s. In 2017, Lieutenant [[Ummer Fayaz Parray]] was the 847th name to be engraved on the IMA War Memorial, which honours alumni of the Academy who have fallen in the course of action.\n\nUp to 1 October 2019, the 87th Raising Day,{{Efn|Founding date|name=|group=}} over 61,000 [[Gentleman Cadet|gentleman cadets]] had graduated and over 3,000 foreign cadets from over 30 other states, including Afghanistan, Singapore, Zambia, and Malaysia, had attended IMA for pre-commission training. Alumni have gone on to become [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief]] and [[Vice Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Vice-Chief of Army Staff]], Olympians and politicians. Foreign alumni have also done well in their countries, going on to becomes chiefs of their respective militaries, prime ministers, presidents and politicians.\n\n==History==\n===Demands for an Indian military training academy===\nDuring the [[Indian independence movement]], Indian leaders recognized the need for a local military institution to meet the needs of an armed force loyal to sovereign India.{{Sfn|Sharma|1996|p=55-59}}{{Sfn|Singh|2007|p=4}} The Indianisation of the officer cadre of the army began in 1901, but it was only for the elite, and after training they were not allowed into the regular army.{{Sfn|Singh|2007|loc=Preface|p=xi \u2013 xv}} The [[British Raj]] was reluctant to commission Indian officers or permit local officer training.{{Sfn|Singh|2007|p=xi}} In 1905, natives could officer only Indian troops and by rank were not equal to commissioned British officers. Up to [[World War I]], the highest rank to which a native soldier of India could rise was [[Subedar]], a rank lower than the lowermost officer rank of [[Subaltern]].{{Sfn|Singh|2007|loc=Preface|p=xi \u2013 xv}}\n\nBut following the Indian military performance in World War I, the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms|Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] facilitated the officer training of 10 Indian commissioned officers at [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]].{{Sfn|Singh|2007|p=xv}} In 1922, the [[Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College]] (now known as the [[Rashtriya Indian Military College]] or just [[RIMC]]) was set up in [[Dehradun]] to prepare young Indians for admission to Sandhurst.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9w-4VTtJ2xkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Where Gallantry is Tradition: Saga of Rashtriya Indian Military College : Plantinum Jubilee Volume, 1997|last=Singh|first=Bikram|last2=Mishra|first2=Sidharth|date=1997|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=9788170236498|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rimc.gov.in/aboutrimc.aspx|title=About Us|website=Rashtriya Indian Military College|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726030832/http://www.rimc.gov.in/aboutrimc.aspx|archive-date=26 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]] of the Army started with the commissioning of 31 Indian officers.

It was established in 1932 following a recommendation by a military committee set up under the chairmanship of [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Field Marshal Philip Chetwode]]. From a class of 40 male cadets in 1932, IMA now has a sanctioned capacity of 1,650. Cadets undergo a training course varying between 3 and 16 months depending on entry criteria. On completion of the course at IMA cadets are permanently commissioned into the army as [[Army ranks and insignia of India|Lieutenant]]s.\n\nThe Academy, spread over {{convert|1400|acre|km2}}, houses the [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Chetwode]] Hall, [[Arun Khetarpal|Khetarpal]] Auditorium, [[Somnath Sharma|Somnath]] Stadium, [[Gurbachan Singh Salaria|Salaria]] Aquatic Centre, [[Hoshiar Singh Dahiya|Hoshiar Singh]] Gymnasium and other facilities that facilitate the training of cadets. Cadets in IMA are organized into a [[regiment]] with four [[battalion]]s of four [[company (military unit)|companies]] each. The Academy's mission, to train future military leaders of the Indian Army, goes hand in hand with the character building enshrined in the IMA honour code, warrior code and motto. Cadets take part in a variety of sports, adventure activities, physical training, drills, weapons training and leadership development activities.\n\nThe Academy's alumni include six recipients of India's highest military decoration, the [[Param Vir Chakra]], and India's first Field Marshal [[Sam Manekshaw]]. Other achievements by alumni include 73 [[Military Cross]]es, 17 [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakras]], 84 [[Maha Vir Chakra]]s and 41 [[Kirti Chakra]]s. In 2017, Lieutenant [[Ummer Fayaz Parray]] was the 847th name to be engraved on the IMA War Memorial, which honours alumni of the Academy who have fallen in the course of action.\n\nUp to 1 October 2019, the 87th Raising Day,{{Efn|Founding date|name=|group=}} over 61,000 [[Gentleman Cadet|gentleman cadets]] had graduated and over 3,000 foreign cadets from over 30 other states, including Afghanistan, Singapore, Zambia, and Malaysia, had attended IMA for pre-commission training. Alumni have gone on to become [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief]] and [[Vice Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Vice-Chief of Army Staff]], Olympians and politicians. Foreign alumni have also done well in their countries, going on to becomes chiefs of their respective militaries, prime ministers, presidents and politicians.\n\n==History==\n===Demands for an Indian military training academy===\nDuring the [[Indian independence movement]], Indian leaders recognized the need for a local military institution to meet the needs of an armed force loyal to sovereign India.{{Sfn|Sharma|1996|p=55-59}}{{Sfn|Singh|2007|p=4}} The Indianisation of the officer cadre of the army began in 1901, but it was only for the elite, and after training they were not allowed into the regular army.{{Sfn|Singh|2007|loc=Preface|p=xi \u2013 xv}} The [[British Raj]] was reluctant to commission Indian officers or permit local officer training.{{Sfn|Singh|2007|p=xi}} In 1905, natives could officer only Indian troops and by rank were not equal to commissioned British officers. Up to [[World War I]], the highest rank to which a native soldier of India could rise was [[Subedar]], a rank lower than the lowermost officer rank of [[Subaltern]].{{Sfn|Singh|2007|loc=Preface|p=xi \u2013 xv}}\n\nBut following the Indian military performance in World War I, the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms|Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]] facilitated the officer training of 10 Indian commissioned officers at [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]].{{Sfn|Singh|2007|p=xv}} In 1922, the [[Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College]] (now known as the [[Rashtriya Indian Military College]] or just [[RIMC]]) was set up in [[Dehradun]] to prepare young Indians for admission to Sandhurst.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9w-4VTtJ2xkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Where Gallantry is Tradition: Saga of Rashtriya Indian Military College : Plantinum Jubilee Volume, 1997|last=Singh|first=Bikram|last2=Mishra|first2=Sidharth|date=1997|publisher=Allied Publishers|isbn=9788170236498|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rimc.gov.in/aboutrimc.aspx|title=About Us|website=Rashtriya Indian Military College|access-date=2019-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190726030832/http://www.rimc.gov.in/aboutrimc.aspx|archive-date=26 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]] of the Army started with the commissioning of 31 Indian officers.

Indian leaders pressed the issue at the first [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference]] in 1930. The establishment of an Indian officer training college was one of the few concessions made at the conference. The Indian Military College Committee, set up under the chairmanship of Field Marshal [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Sir Philip Chetwode]], in 1931 recommended the establishment of an ''Indian Military Academy'' in Dehradun to produce forty commissioned officers twice a year following two and a half years of training.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/state-editions/notes-from-dehra-dun-july-30-1931-how-the-pioneer-reported-about-the-beginnings-of-the-ima.html|title=\"Notes from Dehra Dun, July 30, 1931\": How The Pioneer reported about the beginnings of the IMA|last=Chopra|first=Jaskiran|date=30 July 2018|website=The Pioneer|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728044414/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/state-editions/notes-from-dehra-dun-july-30-1931-how-the-pioneer-reported-about-the-beginnings-of-the-ima.html|archive-date=28 July 2018|url-status=|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>{{Sfn|Sharma|1996|p=135}}[[File:General Sir Philip Chetwode (LOC).jpg|thumb|General Sir [[Philip Chetwode, 1st Baron Chetwode|Philip Chetwode]]|alt=|246x246px|left]]\n\n===Inauguration to Independence===\n\nThe [[Government of India]] transferred the former property of the [[Railway Staff College]] of the [[Indian Railways]], with its 206-acre campus and associated infrastructure, to the Indian Military Academy.

It was the primary exploration route taken by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] as they traveled up the Missouri River in 1804. There are several locations along the US&nbsp;75 corridor that feature former campsite locations of the expedition. Other cities and towns along the corridor were starting points for travelers and freight headed west on the Oregon Trail. US&nbsp;75 was one of the original U.S. highways from the initial 1926 plan, however its route has gone through dramatic changes throughout its lifetime. Prior to 1984, the highway left the state in Omaha as it traveled east through the city along the present-day [[Interstate 480 in Nebraska|I-480]]/[[U.S. Route 6 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;6]] corridor across the [[Missouri River]] into [[Iowa]]. In 1984, with the completion of [[Interstate 29 in Iowa]], a series of transfers between Iowa and Nebraska brought the US&nbsp;75 designation from the I-29 corridor into Nebraska from Omaha north to replace the routing of US&nbsp;73 which was truncated back to [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] at the same time.<ref name=\"aashto1984\">{{cite web|url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/AASHTO_USRN_1984-05-23.pdf |title = Route Numbering Committee Agenda |publisher = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date = May 23, 1984 |access-date = February 5, 2017 |page=5}}</ref>\n\n==Route description==\n===Kansas to Nebraska City===\n[[File:Auburn, Nebraska US75.JPG|thumb|left|US&nbsp;75 through downtown Auburn]]\nUS&nbsp;75 enters Nebraska along the Kansas state line south of [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] in [[Richardson County, Nebraska|Richardson County]]. The highway travels north through agricultural fields the comes to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 8|N-8]]. After crossing the south and north forks of the Big Nemaha River the highway enters [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] a small village founded as Noraville in 1872 along the [[Atchison and Nebraska Railroad]]. The highway continues north out of Dawson and less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later has a junction with the northern terminus of [[U.S. Route 73]]. The highway then makes a sweeping turn to jog {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} west before resuming a northerly course as it approaches an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 4|N-4]]. About {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 62|N-62]]. Continuing due north, US&nbsp;75 travels {{convert|10|mi|km}} through the rolling hills of eastern Nebraska before entering the city of [[Auburn, Nebraska|Auburn]]. Here, the highway has an intersection with [[U.S. Route 136 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;136]], the Heritage Scenic Byway. The highway continues north out of Auburn and travels {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 67|N-67]]. The two routes run concurrently for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} before N-67 diverges to the west towards [[Brock, Nebraska|Brock]]. US&nbsp;75 maintains its northerly heading for the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} before transitioning to a divided highway at an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 128|N-128]]. The highway then travels past the Nebraska City Municipal Airport as it heads towards a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 2|N-2]] on the south side of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]]. Here, a business route of US&nbsp;75 continues north into the city while mainline US&nbsp;75 turns westerly and runs concurrently with N-2 along the [[Julius Sterling Morton]] Beltway as the highway bypasses the city on the southwest side. West of the city, the two highways diverge as N-2 heads west towards [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] and US&nbsp;75 resumes its northerly trek as a standard two-lane highway.<ref name=ndor/><ref name=\"google\">{{google maps |url=https://www.google.com/maps/dir/40,-95.79813/42.44652,-96.38045/@41.2192341,-97.2652045,8z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m21!4m20!1m16!3m4!1m2!1d-95.9109873!2d40.9441498!3s0x87946f91bd46c703:0x7978ae93c7410093!3m4!1m2!1d-96.01853!2d41.43949!3s0x87939585c71ad81b:0x199a6fd577a5496e!3m4!1m2!1d-96.2293454!2d41.8072113!3s0x87923271d5e01dcb:0x12c3c1d6b4c4e152!4e1!1m1!4e1!3e0?hl=en|title=overview of U.S. Route 75 in Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Nebraska City to Bellevue===\n[[File:Offutt AFB at 1000 ft.JPG|thumb|left|Offutt Air Force Base with US&nbsp;75 along right edge of photo]]\nAfter leaving Nebraska City, the highway has a junction with Business Route US&nbsp;75 northwest of the city along G Road. From this point, continuing north, US&nbsp;75 generally runs parallel to, and within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of the [[Missouri River]] for the duration of length. For the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} the highway travels through rural agricultural fields before coming to an intersection with [[U.S. Route 34 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;34]] near [[Union, Nebraska|Union]]. Here, US&nbsp;34 joins up with US&nbsp;75 and the two highways run concurrently to the north for the next {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} before they come to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 1|N-1]] just east of [[Murray, Nebraska|Murray]]. Continuing north, the concurrent highways travel west of Beaver Lake, then come to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 66|N-66]] on the southwest side of [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]]. US&nbsp;34 formerly turned east into Plattsmouth here to cross the Missouri River into Iowa via a tolled bridge, however a new bridge   was opened upstream in October 2014 and US&nbsp;34 was realigned to utilize the new crossing on the north side of the [[Platte River]] near [[La Platte, Nebraska|La Platte]].<ref name=\"newus34bridge\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transportationmatters.iowadot.gov/2014/10/us-34-bridge-over-the-missouri-river-vital-new-transportation-link.html|title=U.S. 34 Bridge Over the Missouri River Vital New Transportation Link|publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation|access-date=February 1, 2017|date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> As such, US&nbsp;34 continues concurrent with US&nbsp;75 along the western side of Plattsmouth, acting as a bypass as the road widens to four lanes. The highway crosses the Platte River then comes to an interchange where US&nbsp;34 departs to the east along the aforementioned new alignment while US&nbsp;75 continues north into [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]. On the south side of Bellevue, US&nbsp;75 becomes a limited access freeway known as the Kennedy Freeway.

As the highway passes Chandler Road and bends to the northwest it crosses over the railroad before becoming a depressed freeway just before its interchange with Q Street. Shortly after another interchange, this time with [[U.S. Route 275 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;275]] and [[Nebraska Highway 92|N-92]]. Just {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a complex interchange with [[Interstate 80 in Nebraska|I-80]] and [[Interstate 480 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-480]] near the [[Hanscom Park]] area in [[Midtown Omaha]]. Here, US&nbsp;75 joins Interstate 480 where it becomes known as the Gerald Ford Freeway. Together, the two freeways run concurrently past the [[Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens]], where [[U.S. President]] [[Gerald R. Ford]] lived for a couple of weeks after his birth in 1913. The freeway continues north towards the newly developed [[Midtown Crossing at Turner Park]]. Opened in 2010, it's a seven building, {{convert|16|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed-use development containing luxury condominiums, apartments, and more than {{convert|225000|sqft}} of dining, entertainment, and shopping. Here, Interstate 480 departs to the east where it heads into [[Downtown Omaha]] before crossing the Missouri River into [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]]. US&nbsp;75 continues as the North Freeway past [[Creighton University]] into [[North Omaha]] where it has an incomplete interchange with [[Nebraska Highway 64|N-64]]. The freeway then has an interchange with the [[Sorensen Parkway]] and the Storz Expressway which heads east to [[Eppley Airfield]]. Shortly after, the freeway becomes a surface four-lane street as it travels through the [[Miller Park (Omaha, Nebraska)|Miller Park]] area and the [[Minne Lusa]] Residential Historic District, a large single-family residential development that was built by a single firm between 1915 and 1941. The highway then continues north through the [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]] neighborhood, one of the oldest cities in Nebraska. Shortly after, the highway turns west just prior to [[Interstate 680 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-680]] and runs alongside it for about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} along McKinley Street before turning north and passing beneath the interstate. Here the highway leaves the city and continues on its path to the north.<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n===Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway===\n====Omaha to Sioux City, Iowa====\n[[File:Winnebago, Nebraska Hwy 75-77 3.JPG|thumb|left|US&nbsp;75/77 through downtown Winnebago]]\nThe portion of US&nbsp;75 north of Omaha to Interstate 129 is designated as the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway begins. Throughout the remainder of the highway's length parallel to the Missouri River, the highway passes near the locations of former campsites of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. As US&nbsp;75 continues north beyond the Omaha City Limits, the highway winds its way through rolling hills before entering the Missouri River plain just south of [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]]. From here, the highway continues its northward travel along the edge of the river plain towards [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]]. Here, in Blair, US&nbsp;75 comes to a junction with US&nbsp;30, The Lincoln Highway, and together the two routes run concurrently along Washington Street for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 91|N-91]]. Here, US&nbsp;30 diverges to the southwest towards [[Fremont, Nebraska|Fremont]] while US&nbsp;75 resumes heading north. About {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway passes through the small village of [[Herman, Nebraska|Herman]] and {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later enters the city of [[Tekamah, Nebraska|Tekamah]] where it has an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 32|N-32]] just after crossing Tekamah Creek. The highway continues north out of Tekamah, still following the edge of the rolling hills and Missouri River plain passing through rich agricultural fields, for {{convert|15|mi|km}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 51|N-51]] on the south edge of [[Decatur, Nebraska|Decatur]] just west of the Onawa Materials Yard and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Areas, both [[enclave]]s of Nebraska that are situated on the eastern side of the [[Missouri River]] and are only accessible via roads in [[Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 and N-51 run concurrently through Decatur for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before N-51 departs to the east to cross the Missouri River into Iowa while US&nbsp;75 continues north out of town. Heading out of Decatur, the highway climbs back into the rolling hills as it turns northwest into the [[Omaha Reservation]] towards the tribal seat of [[Macy, Nebraska|Macy]]. North of Macy, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 94|N-94]] and {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} later intersects [[U.S. Route 77 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;77]] just south of [[Winnebago, Nebraska|Winnebago]]. Here the two highways run concurrently to the north as they emerge from the rolling hills back into the Missouri River plain as they pass through the village of [[Homer, Nebraska|Homer]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the two-lane highway becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches [[Dakota City, Nebraska|Dakota City]]. On the west side of Dakota City, the highways intersect [[Nebraska Highway 35|N-35]] before continuing on to the north. {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway approaches an interchange with [[Interstate 129|I-129]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;20]] on the southwest side of [[South Sioux City, Nebraska|South Sioux City]]. Here, US&nbsp;20 heads west towards [[O'Neill, Nebraska|O'Neill]] while US&nbsp;77 heads north into [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 joins I-129 and US&nbsp;20 to head east across the southern portion of South Sioux City to the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge which crosses the Missouri River and continues into Iowa.<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Lewis and Clark Expedition===\nPrior to the state highway system, travel across Nebraska was accomplished via foot, horseback, and horse-drawn wagons. Many important historical routes passed through or along the present day US&nbsp;75 corridor. After the acquisition of vast territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], President [[Thomas Jefferson]] commissioned an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory. A select group of U.S. Army volunteers led by Captain [[Meriweather Lewis]] and Second Lieutenant [[William Clark]], The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which began on May 14, 1804 near [[St. Louis]], reached southeastern Nebraska in July of that year. As they traveled northwest along the Missouri River the expedition would set up camp at sites on land in present-day Nebraska at several locations. Many of these campsites are recognized by monuments established by the Nebraska Historical Society along the US&nbsp;75 corridor near the towns of [[Rulo, Nebraska|Rulo]], [[Brownville, Nebraska|Brownville]], [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]], [[Omaha]], [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]], [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]], and [[Jackson, Nebraska|Jackson]].<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j13.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 13, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j15.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 15, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j27.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 27, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a2.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 30&ndash;August 2, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a3-4.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 3 and 4, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> US&nbsp;75 parallels the Missouri River for the majority of its length in Nebraska and provides access to many historical sites related to the expedition, as such the highway from Omaha north to Interstate 129 is designated the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway, one of nine scenic byways in the state of Nebraska.<ref name=\"ndorscenic\"/>\n\n===Oregon Trail===\nDiscovery of gold in Colorado and Montana promoted Nebraska City to a central hub for freight between 1858 and 1865 as thousands of wagons transported supplies via the Nebraska City Cutoff of the Oregon Trail west to Fort Kearny.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=Otoe County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> As the shortest distance between Fort Kearny and the Missouri River,<ref name=\"springcreekaudobon\">{{cite web|url = http://springcreekprairie.audubon.org/sites/g/files/amh586/f/fort_kearny_cutoff.pdf|title = The Nebraska City-Fort Kearny Cutoff to the Oregon Trail|last = Murphy|first = David|publisher = Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center|access-date = February 5, 2017}}</ref> this plowed furrow extended over {{convert|180|mi|km}} between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny and during the peak of its use in 1865, over {{convert|44|e6lb}} of supplies were shipped before the construction of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] provided a superior means of transportation.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff2.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=York County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebroadside1\">{{cite book |last=Boye |first=Alan |date=1989 |title=The Complete Roadside Guide to Nebraska |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1ON6kaw0nXIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=7 |access-date=February 4, 2017 |isbn=978-0-8032-5968-3 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===United States Numbered Highway System===\nUS&nbsp;75 has existed since the inception of the US Numbered Highway System in 1926.

It was the primary exploration route taken by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] as they traveled up the Missouri River in 1804. There are several locations along the US&nbsp;75 corridor that feature former campsite locations of the expedition. Other cities and towns along the corridor were starting points for travelers and freight headed west on the Oregon Trail. US&nbsp;75 was one of the original U.S. highways from the initial 1926 plan, however its route has gone through dramatic changes throughout its lifetime. Prior to 1984, the highway left the state in Omaha as it traveled east through the city along the present-day [[Interstate 480 in Nebraska|I-480]]/[[U.S. Route 6 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;6]] corridor across the [[Missouri River]] into [[Iowa]]. In 1984, with the completion of [[Interstate 29 in Iowa]], a series of transfers between Iowa and Nebraska brought the US&nbsp;75 designation from the I-29 corridor into Nebraska from Omaha north to replace the routing of US&nbsp;73 which was truncated back to [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] at the same time.<ref name=\"aashto1984\">{{cite web|url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/AASHTO_USRN_1984-05-23.pdf |title = Route Numbering Committee Agenda |publisher = American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date = May 23, 1984 |access-date = February 5, 2017 |page=5}}</ref>\n\n==Route description==\n===Kansas to Nebraska City===\n[[File:Auburn, Nebraska US75.JPG|thumb|left|US&nbsp;75 through downtown Auburn]]\nUS&nbsp;75 enters Nebraska along the Kansas state line south of [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] in [[Richardson County, Nebraska|Richardson County]]. The highway travels north through agricultural fields the comes to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 8|N-8]]. After crossing the south and north forks of the Big Nemaha River the highway enters [[Dawson, Nebraska|Dawson]] a small village founded as Noraville in 1872 along the [[Atchison and Nebraska Railroad]]. The highway continues north out of Dawson and less than {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later has a junction with the northern terminus of [[U.S. Route 73]]. The highway then makes a sweeping turn to jog {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} west before resuming a northerly course as it approaches an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 4|N-4]]. About {{convert|4|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 62|N-62]]. Continuing due north, US&nbsp;75 travels {{convert|10|mi|km}} through the rolling hills of eastern Nebraska before entering the city of [[Auburn, Nebraska|Auburn]]. Here, the highway has an intersection with [[U.S. Route 136 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;136]], the Heritage Scenic Byway. The highway continues north out of Auburn and travels {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 67|N-67]]. The two routes run concurrently for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} before N-67 diverges to the west towards [[Brock, Nebraska|Brock]]. US&nbsp;75 maintains its northerly heading for the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} before transitioning to a divided highway at an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 128|N-128]]. The highway then travels past the Nebraska City Municipal Airport as it heads towards a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 2|N-2]] on the south side of [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]]. Here, a business route of US&nbsp;75 continues north into the city while mainline US&nbsp;75 turns westerly and runs concurrently with N-2 along the [[Julius Sterling Morton]] Beltway as the highway bypasses the city on the southwest side.

From this point, continuing north, US&nbsp;75 generally runs parallel to, and within {{convert|10|mi|km}} of the [[Missouri River]] for the duration of length. For the next {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} the highway travels through rural agricultural fields before coming to an intersection with [[U.S. Route 34 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;34]] near [[Union, Nebraska|Union]]. Here, US&nbsp;34 joins up with US&nbsp;75 and the two highways run concurrently to the north for the next {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}} before they come to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 1|N-1]] just east of [[Murray, Nebraska|Murray]]. Continuing north, the concurrent highways travel west of Beaver Lake, then come to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 66|N-66]] on the southwest side of [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]]. US&nbsp;34 formerly turned east into Plattsmouth here to cross the Missouri River into Iowa via a tolled bridge, however a new bridge   was opened upstream in October 2014 and US&nbsp;34 was realigned to utilize the new crossing on the north side of the [[Platte River]] near [[La Platte, Nebraska|La Platte]].<ref name=\"newus34bridge\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transportationmatters.iowadot.gov/2014/10/us-34-bridge-over-the-missouri-river-vital-new-transportation-link.html|title=U.S. 34 Bridge Over the Missouri River Vital New Transportation Link|publisher=Iowa Department of Transportation|access-date=February 1, 2017|date=October 29, 2014}}</ref> As such, US&nbsp;34 continues concurrent with US&nbsp;75 along the western side of Plattsmouth, acting as a bypass as the road widens to four lanes. The highway crosses the Platte River then comes to an interchange where US&nbsp;34 departs to the east along the aforementioned new alignment while US&nbsp;75 continues north into [[Bellevue, Nebraska|Bellevue]]. On the south side of Bellevue, US&nbsp;75 becomes a limited access freeway known as the Kennedy Freeway. The freeway passes to the west of [[Offutt Air Force Base]] just before it comes to an interchange with [[Nebraska Highway 370|N-370]].<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n===Freeway through Omaha===\n[[File:Omaha, Nebraska 2876-2874-2872 Redick Ave.JPG|thumb|Houses of the Minne Lusa Residential Historic District in Omaha]]\n[[File:Creighton mall west.JPG|thumb|West mall of Creighton University with US&nbsp;75 in the background]]\nThe freeway continues north through dense residential areas as it enters South [[Omaha]]. As the highway passes Chandler Road and bends to the northwest it crosses over the railroad before becoming a depressed freeway just before its interchange with Q Street. Shortly after another interchange, this time with [[U.S. Route 275 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;275]] and [[Nebraska Highway 92|N-92]]. Just {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the highway comes to a complex interchange with [[Interstate 80 in Nebraska|I-80]] and [[Interstate 480 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-480]] near the [[Hanscom Park]] area in [[Midtown Omaha]]. Here, US&nbsp;75 joins Interstate 480 where it becomes known as the Gerald Ford Freeway. Together, the two freeways run concurrently past the [[Gerald R. Ford Birthsite and Gardens]], where [[U.S. President]] [[Gerald R. Ford]] lived for a couple of weeks after his birth in 1913. The freeway continues north towards the newly developed [[Midtown Crossing at Turner Park]]. Opened in 2010, it's a seven building, {{convert|16|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed-use development containing luxury condominiums, apartments, and more than {{convert|225000|sqft}} of dining, entertainment, and shopping. Here, Interstate 480 departs to the east where it heads into [[Downtown Omaha]] before crossing the Missouri River into [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Council Bluffs]]. US&nbsp;75 continues as the North Freeway past [[Creighton University]] into [[North Omaha]] where it has an incomplete interchange with [[Nebraska Highway 64|N-64]]. The freeway then has an interchange with the [[Sorensen Parkway]] and the Storz Expressway which heads east to [[Eppley Airfield]]. Shortly after, the freeway becomes a surface four-lane street as it travels through the [[Miller Park (Omaha, Nebraska)|Miller Park]] area and the [[Minne Lusa]] Residential Historic District, a large single-family residential development that was built by a single firm between 1915 and 1941. The highway then continues north through the [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]] neighborhood, one of the oldest cities in Nebraska. Shortly after, the highway turns west just prior to [[Interstate 680 (Iowa\u2013Nebraska)|I-680]] and runs alongside it for about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} along McKinley Street before turning north and passing beneath the interstate.

Throughout the remainder of the highway's length parallel to the Missouri River, the highway passes near the locations of former campsites of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. As US&nbsp;75 continues north beyond the Omaha City Limits, the highway winds its way through rolling hills before entering the Missouri River plain just south of [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]]. From here, the highway continues its northward travel along the edge of the river plain towards [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]]. Here, in Blair, US&nbsp;75 comes to a junction with US&nbsp;30, The Lincoln Highway, and together the two routes run concurrently along Washington Street for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 91|N-91]]. Here, US&nbsp;30 diverges to the southwest towards [[Fremont, Nebraska|Fremont]] while US&nbsp;75 resumes heading north. About {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway passes through the small village of [[Herman, Nebraska|Herman]] and {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later enters the city of [[Tekamah, Nebraska|Tekamah]] where it has an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 32|N-32]] just after crossing Tekamah Creek. The highway continues north out of Tekamah, still following the edge of the rolling hills and Missouri River plain passing through rich agricultural fields, for {{convert|15|mi|km}} before coming to an intersection with [[Nebraska Highway 51|N-51]] on the south edge of [[Decatur, Nebraska|Decatur]] just west of the Onawa Materials Yard and Middle Decatur Bend State Wildlife Areas, both [[enclave]]s of Nebraska that are situated on the eastern side of the [[Missouri River]] and are only accessible via roads in [[Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 and N-51 run concurrently through Decatur for {{convert|1/2|mi|m|spell=in}} before N-51 departs to the east to cross the Missouri River into Iowa while US&nbsp;75 continues north out of town. Heading out of Decatur, the highway climbs back into the rolling hills as it turns northwest into the [[Omaha Reservation]] towards the tribal seat of [[Macy, Nebraska|Macy]]. North of Macy, the highway comes to a junction with [[Nebraska Highway 94|N-94]] and {{convert|7.5|mi|km}} later intersects [[U.S. Route 77 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;77]] just south of [[Winnebago, Nebraska|Winnebago]]. Here the two highways run concurrently to the north as they emerge from the rolling hills back into the Missouri River plain as they pass through the village of [[Homer, Nebraska|Homer]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} later, the two-lane highway becomes a four-lane divided highway as it approaches [[Dakota City, Nebraska|Dakota City]]. On the west side of Dakota City, the highways intersect [[Nebraska Highway 35|N-35]] before continuing on to the north. {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} later the highway approaches an interchange with [[Interstate 129|I-129]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in Nebraska|US&nbsp;20]] on the southwest side of [[South Sioux City, Nebraska|South Sioux City]]. Here, US&nbsp;20 heads west towards [[O'Neill, Nebraska|O'Neill]] while US&nbsp;77 heads north into [[Sioux City, Iowa]]. US&nbsp;75 joins I-129 and US&nbsp;20 to head east across the southern portion of South Sioux City to the Sergeant Floyd Memorial Bridge which crosses the Missouri River and continues into Iowa.<ref name=\"ndor\"/><ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Lewis and Clark Expedition===\nPrior to the state highway system, travel across Nebraska was accomplished via foot, horseback, and horse-drawn wagons. Many important historical routes passed through or along the present day US&nbsp;75 corridor. After the acquisition of vast territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], President [[Thomas Jefferson]] commissioned an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory. A select group of U.S. Army volunteers led by Captain [[Meriweather Lewis]] and Second Lieutenant [[William Clark]], The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which began on May 14, 1804 near [[St. Louis]], reached southeastern Nebraska in July of that year. As they traveled northwest along the Missouri River the expedition would set up camp at sites on land in present-day Nebraska at several locations. Many of these campsites are recognized by monuments established by the Nebraska Historical Society along the US&nbsp;75 corridor near the towns of [[Rulo, Nebraska|Rulo]], [[Brownville, Nebraska|Brownville]], [[Plattsmouth, Nebraska|Plattsmouth]], [[Omaha]], [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]], [[Blair, Nebraska|Blair]], and [[Jackson, Nebraska|Jackson]].<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j13.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 13, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j15.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 15, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_j27.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 27, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a2.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; July 30&ndash;August 2, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a3-4.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 3 and 4, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety8\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/lewis_and_clark_a21.htm|title=Lews and Clark Campsite; August 21, 1804|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> US&nbsp;75 parallels the Missouri River for the majority of its length in Nebraska and provides access to many historical sites related to the expedition, as such the highway from Omaha north to Interstate 129 is designated the Lewis and Clark Scenic Byway, one of nine scenic byways in the state of Nebraska.<ref name=\"ndorscenic\"/>\n\n===Oregon Trail===\nDiscovery of gold in Colorado and Montana promoted Nebraska City to a central hub for freight between 1858 and 1865 as thousands of wagons transported supplies via the Nebraska City Cutoff of the Oregon Trail west to Fort Kearny.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=Otoe County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> As the shortest distance between Fort Kearny and the Missouri River,<ref name=\"springcreekaudobon\">{{cite web|url = http://springcreekprairie.audubon.org/sites/g/files/amh586/f/fort_kearny_cutoff.pdf|title = The Nebraska City-Fort Kearny Cutoff to the Oregon Trail|last = Murphy|first = David|publisher = Spring Creek Prairie Audubon Center|access-date = February 5, 2017}}</ref> this plowed furrow extended over {{convert|180|mi|km}} between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny and during the peak of its use in 1865, over {{convert|44|e6lb}} of supplies were shipped before the construction of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] provided a superior means of transportation.<ref name=\"nebhistoricalsociety1b\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/neb_city_ft_kearny_cutoff2.htm|title=Nebraska City&ndash;Fort Kearny Cutoff|date=June 4, 2004|website=Nebraska State Historical Society|location=York County, Nebraska|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nebroadside1\">{{cite book |last=Boye |first=Alan |date=1989 |title=The Complete Roadside Guide to Nebraska |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1ON6kaw0nXIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |page=7 |access-date=February 4, 2017 |isbn=978-0-8032-5968-3 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===United States Numbered Highway System===\nUS&nbsp;75 has existed since the inception of the US Numbered Highway System in 1926.

{"title_page": "Euler spiral", "text_new": "[[File:Euler spiral.svg|300px|thumb|A double-end Euler spiral.  The curve continues to converge to the points marked, as ''t'' tends to positive or negative infinity.]]\n\nAn '''Euler spiral''' is a curve whose [[curvature]] changes linearly with its curve length (the curvature of a circular curve is equal to the reciprocal of the radius). Euler spirals are also commonly referred to as '''spiros''', '''clothoids''', or '''Cornu spirals'''.\n\nEuler spirals have applications to [[diffraction]] computations. They are also widely used as transition curves in [[Railway systems engineering|railroad engineering]]/[[highway engineering]] for connecting and transitioning the geometry between a tangent and a circular curve. A similar application is also found in [[photonic integrated circuit]]s. The principle of linear variation of the curvature of the transition curve between a tangent and a circular curve defines the geometry of the Euler spiral: \n*Its curvature begins with zero at the straight section (the tangent) and increases linearly with its curve length.\n*Where the Euler spiral meets the circular curve, its curvature becomes equal to that of the latter.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Track transition curve===\n{{Main article|Track transition curve}}\n\n[[File:CornuSpiralAnimation.gif|thumb|Animation depicting evolution of a Cornu spiral with the tangential circle with the same radius of curvature as at its tip, also known as an [[osculating circle]] (click on thumbnail to observe).]]\n\nTo travel along a circular path, an object needs to be subject to a [[Uniform circular motion|centripetal acceleration]] (e.g.: the moon circles around the earth because of gravity; a car turns its front wheels inward to generate a centripetal force). If a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a tangential circular path, it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value; this would be difficult to achieve (think of a driver instantly moving the steering wheel from straight line to turning position, and the car actually doing it), putting mechanical stress on the vehicle's parts, and causing much discomfort (causing [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]]).\n\nOn early railroads this instant application of lateral force was not an issue since low speeds and wide-radius curves were employed (lateral forces on the passengers and the lateral sway was small and tolerable). As speeds of rail vehicles increased over the years, it became obvious that an easement is necessary, so that the centripetal acceleration increases linearly with the traveled distance. Given the expression of centripetal acceleration {{math| V\u00b2 / R}}, the obvious solution is to provide an easement curve whose curvature, {{math| 1 / R}}, increases linearly with the traveled distance. This geometry is an Euler spiral.\n\nUnaware of the solution of the geometry by [[Leonhard Euler]], [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] cited the [[Polynomial#Graphs|cubic curve]] (a polynomial curve of degree 3), which is an approximation of the Euler spiral for small angular changes in the same way that a [[parabola]] is an approximation to a circular curve.\n\n[[Marie Alfred Cornu]] (and later some civil engineers) also solved the calculus of the Euler spiral independently. Euler spirals are now widely used in rail and highway engineering for providing a transition or an easement between a tangent and a horizontal circular curve.\n\n===Optics===\n\nThe Cornu <!--In optics the term Cornu Spiral is universal, please don't change to Euler spiral merely for consistency with the rest of the article without making this clear --> spiral can be used to describe a [[diffraction]] pattern.<ref name=Hecht>\n{{cite book\n | title = Optics\n | edition = 3rd\n | author = Eugene Hecht\n | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n | year = 1998\n | isbn = 978-0-201-30425-1\n | page = 491\n  }}</ref>\n\n=== Integrated optics ===\nBends with continuously varying radius of curvature following the Euler spiral are also used to reduce losses in [[photonic integrated circuit]]s, either in singlemode [[waveguide (optics)|waveguides]],<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Kohtoku\n | first = M.\n | display-authors = etal\n | date = 7 July 2005\n | title = New Waveguide Fabrication Techniques for Next-generation PLCs\n | url = https://www.ntt-review.jp/archive/ntttechnical.php?contents=ntr200507037.pdf\n | journal    = NTT Technical Review\n | volume     = 3\n | issue      = 7\n | pages      = 37\u201341\n | access-date = 24 January 2017\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Li\n| first      = G.\n| display-authors      = etal\n| date       = 11 May 2012\n| title      = Ultralow-loss, high-density SOI optical waveguide routing for macrochip interconnects\n| journal    = Optics Express\n| volume     = 20\n| issue      = 11\n| pages      = 12035\u201312039\n| doi        = 10.1364/OE.20.012035\n| pmid      = 22714189\n}}\n</ref> to smoothen the abrupt change of curvature and coupling to radiation modes, or in multimode waveguides,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Cherchi\n| first      = M.\n| display-authors      = etal\n| date       = 18 July 2013\n| title      = Dramatic size reduction of waveguide bends on a micron-scale silicon photonic platform\n| journal    = Optics Express\n| volume     = 21\n| issue      = 15\n| pages      = 17814\u201317823\n| doi        = 10.1364/OE.21.017814\n| pmid      = 23938654\n| arxiv      = 1301.2197\n}}\n</ref> in order to suppress coupling to higher order modes and ensure effective singlemode operation.\nA pioneering and very elegant application of the Euler spiral to waveguides had been made as early as 1957,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Unger\n| first      = H.G.\n| date       = September 1957\n| title      = Normal Mode Bends for Circular Electric Waves\n| journal    = The Bell System Technical Journal\n| volume     = 36\n| issue      = 5\n| pages      = 1292\u20131307\n| doi        = 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01509.x\n}}</ref> with a hollow metal [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] for microwaves.

The curve continues to converge to the points marked, as ''t'' tends to positive or negative infinity.]]\n\nAn '''Euler spiral''' is a curve whose [[curvature]] changes linearly with its curve length (the curvature of a circular curve is equal to the reciprocal of the radius). Euler spirals are also commonly referred to as '''spiros''', '''clothoids''', or '''Cornu spirals'''.\n\nEuler spirals have applications to [[diffraction]] computations. They are also widely used as transition curves in [[Railway systems engineering|railroad engineering]]/[[highway engineering]] for connecting and transitioning the geometry between a tangent and a circular curve. A similar application is also found in [[photonic integrated circuit]]s. The principle of linear variation of the curvature of the transition curve between a tangent and a circular curve defines the geometry of the Euler spiral: \n*Its curvature begins with zero at the straight section (the tangent) and increases linearly with its curve length.\n*Where the Euler spiral meets the circular curve, its curvature becomes equal to that of the latter.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Track transition curve===\n{{Main article|Track transition curve}}\n\n[[File:CornuSprialAnimation.gif|thumb|Animation depicting evolution of a Cornu spiral with the tangential circle with the same radius of curvature as at its tip, also known as an [[osculating circle]] (click on thumbnail to observe).]]\n\nTo travel along a circular path, an object needs to be subject to a [[Uniform circular motion|centripetal acceleration]] (e.g.: the moon circles around the earth because of gravity; a car turns its front wheels inward to generate a centripetal force). If a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a tangential circular path, it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value; this would be difficult to achieve (think of a driver instantly moving the steering wheel from straight line to turning position, and the car actually doing it), putting mechanical stress on the vehicle's parts, and causing much discomfort (causing [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]]).\n\nOn early railroads this instant application of lateral force was not an issue since low speeds and wide-radius curves were employed (lateral forces on the passengers and the lateral sway was small and tolerable). As speeds of rail vehicles increased over the years, it became obvious that an easement is necessary, so that the centripetal acceleration increases linearly with the traveled distance. Given the expression of centripetal acceleration {{math| V\u00b2 / R}}, the obvious solution is to provide an easement curve whose curvature, {{math| 1 / R}}, increases linearly with the traveled distance. This geometry is an Euler spiral.\n\nUnaware of the solution of the geometry by [[Leonhard Euler]], [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] cited the [[Polynomial#Graphs|cubic curve]] (a polynomial curve of degree 3), which is an approximation of the Euler spiral for small angular changes in the same way that a [[parabola]] is an approximation to a circular curve.\n\n[[Marie Alfred Cornu]] (and later some civil engineers) also solved the calculus of the Euler spiral independently. Euler spirals are now widely used in rail and highway engineering for providing a transition or an easement between a tangent and a horizontal circular curve.\n\n===Optics===\n\nThe Cornu <!--In optics the term Cornu Spiral is universal, please don't change to Euler spiral merely for consistency with the rest of the article without making this clear --> spiral can be used to describe a [[diffraction]] pattern.<ref name=Hecht>\n{{cite book\n | title = Optics\n | edition = 3rd\n | author = Eugene Hecht\n | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n | year = 1998\n | isbn = 978-0-201-30425-1\n | page = 491\n  }}</ref>\n\n=== Integrated optics ===\nBends with continuously varying radius of curvature following the Euler spiral are also used to reduce losses in [[photonic integrated circuit]]s, either in singlemode [[waveguide (optics)|waveguides]],<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last = Kohtoku\n | first = M.\n | display-authors = etal\n | date = 7 July 2005\n | title = New Waveguide Fabrication Techniques for Next-generation PLCs\n | url = https://www.ntt-review.jp/archive/ntttechnical.php?contents=ntr200507037.pdf\n | journal    = NTT Technical Review\n | volume     = 3\n | issue      = 7\n | pages      = 37\u201341\n | access-date = 24 January 2017\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Li\n| first      = G.\n| display-authors      = etal\n| date       = 11 May 2012\n| title      = Ultralow-loss, high-density SOI optical waveguide routing for macrochip interconnects\n| journal    = Optics Express\n| volume     = 20\n| issue      = 11\n| pages      = 12035\u201312039\n| doi        = 10.1364/OE.20.012035\n| pmid      = 22714189\n}}\n</ref> to smoothen the abrupt change of curvature and coupling to radiation modes, or in multimode waveguides,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Cherchi\n| first      = M.\n| display-authors      = etal\n| date       = 18 July 2013\n| title      = Dramatic size reduction of waveguide bends on a micron-scale silicon photonic platform\n| journal    = Optics Express\n| volume     = 21\n| issue      = 15\n| pages      = 17814\u201317823\n| doi        = 10.1364/OE.21.017814\n| pmid      = 23938654\n| arxiv      = 1301.2197\n}}\n</ref> in order to suppress coupling to higher order modes and ensure effective singlemode operation.\nA pioneering and very elegant application of the Euler spiral to waveguides had been made as early as 1957,<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Unger\n| first      = H.G.\n| date       = September 1957\n| title      = Normal Mode Bends for Circular Electric Waves\n| journal    = The Bell System Technical Journal\n| volume     = 36\n| issue      = 5\n| pages      = 1292\u20131307\n| doi        = 10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01509.x\n}}</ref> with a hollow metal [[waveguide (electromagnetism)|waveguide]] for microwaves.

A [[parabolic curve]] (''POB'') is used.]]\nA '''track transition curve''', or '''spiral easement''', is a mathematically-calculated curve on a section of highway, or [[track (rail transport)|railroad track]], in which a straight section changes into a curve. It is designed to prevent sudden changes in [[centripetal acceleration|lateral (or centripetal) acceleration]]. In plane (viewed from above), the start of the transition of the horizontal curve is at infinite radius, and at the end of the transition, it has the same radius as the curve itself and so forms a very broad spiral. At the same time, in the vertical plane, the outside of the curve is gradually raised until the correct degree of [[cant (road/rail)|bank]] is reached.\n\nIf such an easement were not applied, the lateral acceleration of a rail vehicle would change abruptly at one point (the [[tangent|tangent point]] where the straight track meets the curve), with undesirable results.

Here grade refers to the tangent of the angle of rise of the track. The design pattern for horizontal geometry is typically a sequence of straight line (i.e., a [[tangent]]) and curve (i.e. a [[circular arc]]) segments connected by transition curves.\n\nThe degree of banking in railroad track is typically expressed as the difference in elevation of the two rails, commonly quantified and referred to as the [[superelevation]]. Such difference in the elevation of the rails is intended to compensate for the [[centripetal acceleration]] needed for an object to move along a curved path, so that the lateral acceleration experienced by passengers/the cargo load will be minimized, which enhances passenger comfort/reduces the chance of load shifting (movement of cargo during transit, causing accidents and damage).\n\nIt is important to note that superelevation is not the same as the roll angle of the rail  which is used to describe the \"tilting\" of the individual rails instead of the banking of the entire track structure as reflected by the elevation difference at the \"top of rail\". Regardless of the horizontal alignment and the superelevation of the track, the individual rails are almost always designed to \"roll\"/\"cant\" towards gage side (the side where the wheel is in contact with the rail) to compensate for the horizontal forces exerted by wheels under normal rail traffic.\n\nThe change of superelevation from zero in a tangent segment to the value selected for the body of a following curve occurs over the length of a transition curve that connects the tangent and the curve proper. Over the length of the transition the curvature of the track will also vary from zero at the end abutting the tangent segment to the value of curvature of the curve body, which is numerically equal to one over the radius of the curve body.\n\nThe simplest and most commonly used form of transition curve is that in which the superelevation and horizontal curvature both vary linearly with distance along the track. [[Cartesian coordinates]] of points along this spiral are given by the [[Fresnel integral]]s. The resulting shape matches a portion of an [[Euler spiral]], which is also commonly referred to as a \"clothoid\", and sometimes \"Cornu spiral\".\n\nA transition curve can connect a track segment of constant non-zero curvature to another segment with constant curvature that is zero or non-zero of either sign. Successive curves in the same direction are sometimes called progressive curves and successive curves in opposite directions are called reverse curves.\n\nThe Euler spiral provides the shortest transition subject to a given limit on the rate of change of the track superelevation (i.e. the twist of the track). However, as has been recognized for a long time, it has undesirable dynamic characteristics due to the large (conceptually infinite) roll acceleration and rate of change of centripetal acceleration at each end. Because of the capabilities of personal computers it is now practical to employ spirals that have dynamics better than those of the Euler spiral.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Degree of curvature]]\n* [[Minimum railway curve radius]]\n* [[Railway systems engineering]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last =Simmons\n  | first =Jack\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=Biddle, Gordon\n   | title =The Oxford Companion to British Railway History\n  | publisher =Oxford University Press\n  | year =1997\n  | location =\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =  0-19-211697-5}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last =Biddle\n  | first =Gordon\n  | authorlink =\n  | title =The Railway Surveyors\n  | publisher =Ian Allan\n  | year =1990\n  | location = Chertsey, UK\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =  0-7110-1954-1}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last =Hickerson\n  | first =Thomas Felix\n  | authorlink =\n  | title =Route Location and Design\n  | publisher =McGraw Hill\n  | year =1967\n  | location =New York\n  | pages =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =  0-07-028680-9}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last =Cole\n  | first =George M\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=and Harbin |author3=Andrew L\n   | title =Surveyor Reference Manual\n  | publisher =Professional Publications Inc\n  | year =2006\n  | location =Belmont, CA\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn =  1-59126-044-2\n  | page =16}}\n*[http://www.arema.org/eseries/scriptcontent/custom/e_arema/Practical_Guide/PGChapter6.pdf ''Railway Track Design'']  pdf from The American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association, accessed 4 December 2006.\n*{{cite book\n | last = Kellogg\n | first = Norman Benjamin\n | title = The Transition Curve or Curve of Adjustment\n | publisher = McGraw\n | location = New York\n | year = 1907\n | edition = 3rd\n | url = https://archive.org/details/transitioncurve01nrgoog}}\n{{refend}}\n{{Rail tracks}}\n\n[[Category:Transportation engineering]]\n[[Category:Spirals]]\n[[Category:Track geometry]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Easement curve.svg|240px|thumb|The red [[Euler spiral]] is an example of an easement curve between a blue straight line and a circular arc, shown in green.]]\n[[File:CornuSprialAnimation.gif|thumb|Animation depicting evolution of a [[Cornu spiral]] with the tangential circle with the same radius of curvature as at its tip, also known as an [[osculating circle]] (click on thumbnail to observe).]]\n[[Image:Parabolic transition curve.JPG|thumb|240px|This sign aside a railroad (between [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]]) indicates the start of the transition curve.

It is designed to prevent sudden changes in [[centripetal acceleration|lateral (or centripetal) acceleration]]. In plane (viewed from above), the start of the transition of the horizontal curve is at infinite radius, and at the end of the transition, it has the same radius as the curve itself and so forms a very broad spiral.
