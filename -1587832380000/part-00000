She makes fast friends with Natalie, a relative newcomer and former fellow \"black sheep of the family,\" but Tina's once-loving relationship with Jessica is now fractious and antagonistic. Stunned by Jessica's cold and rude behavior, Tina is unaware that Jessica is actually \"Tess,\" her dangerous alternate personality, who has secretly emerged from Jessica's psyche to take control and seek revenge on Natalie and her lover [[Jared Banks]], whom Tess blames for the death of [[Nash Brennan]], Jessica's husband and the love of Tess's life. As Tina settles into Llanfair, she takes care to hide the stolen Mendorran Crown Jewels in Viki's wall safe, fearing she will be apprehended by international authorities. Tina grows increasingly suspicious of \"Jessica's\" strange actions when she discovers her niece has ordered construction to be done in the Llanfair basement. \"Jessica\" claims the construction work is a surprise for the family, but when Tina and her beloved [[shih tzu]] \"David Vickers\" go snooping in the basement, they discover the soundproofed secret room Tess has built below the house. Tina reflects on her memories of her father Victor Lord's own secret room, and its significance to Viki and her own alternate personalities, one of whom had imprisoned Dorian Lord below Llanfair. Remembering her own complicated relationship with Viki's alters such as Niki Smith, Tina realizes that Tess has emerged. Before Tina can alert the family, Tess traps her in the secret room.<ref>[http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5128/Enjoy_Your_New_Digs ''One Life to Live'' recap (9/3/08) - Soaps.com]</ref> Tess discovers the jewels in the safe and threatens to not only tell the authorities, but a vengeful Carlo as well. Fearing for herself and especially Sarah, Tina begrudgingly agrees to not only stay quiet, but to help Tess drag a drugged Natalie down into the secret room. A guilty Tina tries to thwart Tess several times, but is always caught; Tina sends Jared down to the basement to find Natalie, but Tess traps him as well. Viki returns to town in time to realize that Tess is on the loose. With a bomb set to go off, Tina leads Viki and Jared's father [[Charlie Banks (One Life to Live)|Charlie Banks]] down to the secret room in time to save Natalie and Jared.

She is shocked to discover that her mother Irene is alive and well, and that the brother who has just died is not Todd, but his secret twin brother, [[Victor Lord, Jr.|Victor Lord, Jr]]. Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts.

She makes fast friends with Natalie, a relative newcomer and former fellow \"black sheep of the family,\" but Tina's once-loving relationship with Jessica is now fractious and antagonistic. Stunned by Jessica's cold and rude behavior, Tina is unaware that Jessica is actually \"Tess,\" her dangerous alternate personality, who has secretly emerged from Jessica's psyche to take control and seek revenge on Natalie and her lover [[Jared Banks]], whom Tess blames for the death of [[Nash Brennan]], Jessica's husband and the love of Tess's life. As Tina settles into Llanfair, she takes care to hide the stolen Mendorran Crown Jewels in Viki's wall safe, fearing she will be apprehended by international authorities. Tina grows increasingly suspicious of \"Jessica's\" strange actions when she discovers her niece has ordered construction to be done in the Llanfair basement. \"Jessica\" claims the construction work is a surprise for the family, but when Tina and her beloved [[shih tzu]] \"David Vickers\" go snooping in the basement, they discover the soundproofed secret room Tess has built below the house. Tina reflects on her memories of her father Victor Lord's own secret room, and its significance to Viki and her own alternate personalities, one of whom had imprisoned Dorian Lord below Llanfair. Remembering her own complicated relationship with Viki's alters such as Niki Smith, Tina realizes that Tess has emerged. Before Tina can alert the family, Tess traps her in the secret room.<ref>[http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5128/Enjoy_Your_New_Digs ''One Life to Live'' recap (9/3/08) - Soaps.com]</ref> Tess discovers the jewels in the safe and threatens to not only tell the authorities, but a vengeful Carlo as well.

Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts.

Anki's implementation of the [[algorithm]] has been modified to allow priorities on cards and to show [[flashcards]] in order of their urgency.

The decks of cards, along with the user's statistics, are stored in the open [[SQLite]] format.\n\n==Features==\n\n===Notes===\nCards are generated from information stored as \"notes\". Notes are analogous to database entries and can have an arbitrary number of fields. For example, with respect to learning a language, a note may have the following fields and example entries:\n* Field 1: Expression in target language \u2013 {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}}\n* Field 2: Pronunciation \u2013 [sound file with the word {{lang|fr|\"g\u00e2teau\"}} pronounced]\n* Field 3: Meaning of expression in familiar language \u2013 \"cake\"\nThis example illustrates what some programs call a [[three-sided flashcard]], but Anki's model is more general and allows any number of fields to be combined in various cards.\n\nThe user can design cards that test the information contained in each note. One card may have a question (expression) and an answer (pronunciation, meaning).\n\nBy keeping the separate cards linked to the same fact, spelling mistakes can be adjusted against all cards at the same time and Anki can ensure that related cards are not shown in too short a spacing.\n\nA special note type allows for generation of [[cloze deletion]] cards (in Anki 1.2.x, those were ordinary cards with cloze markup added using a tool in the fact editor).\n\n===Syncing===\nAnki supports synchronization with a free (but proprietary) online server called AnkiWeb.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ankiweb.net|title=Anki - friendly, intelligent flashcards|work=ankiweb.net}}</ref> This allows users to keep decks synchronized across multiple computers, and to study online or on a cell phone.\n\nThere is a third-party open source ([[Affero General Public License|AGPLv3]]) AnkiServer software which users can run on their own local computers or servers, though it is not compatible with recent Anki versions. It also provides a RESTful API for manipulating Anki collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server|title=dsnopek/anki-sync-server|work=GitHub|date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese and Chinese reading generation===\nAnki can automatically fill in the reading of Japanese and Chinese text.

The same study found a positive relationship between the number of unique Anki cards studied and USMLE Step 1 scores in a multi-variate analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deng|first=Francis|last2=Gluckstein|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Larsen|first3=Douglas P.|date=2015-12-01|title=Student-directed retrieval practice is a predictor of medical licensing examination performance|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40037-015-0220-x|journal=Perspectives on Medical Education|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=308\u2013313|doi=10.1007/s40037-015-0220-x|issn=2212-277X|pmc=PMC4673073|pmid=26498443}}</ref> Some third-party resources, such as Boards and Beyond, have Anki decks based on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/8rdcqz/lightyear_a_boards_and_beyond_based_step_1_anki/|title=r/medicalschoolanki - LIGHTYEAR: A Boards and Beyond based STEP 1 Anki deck (~22.5k cards)|website=reddit|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boardsbeyond.com/how-to-use-boards-and-beyond|title=Boards and Beyond|last=Ryan|first=Jason|date=|website=Boards and Beyond|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=03/25/2020}}</ref>\n\n==Copera Inc.'s Anki for Palm OS==\nAn unrelated flashcard program called Anki for Palm OS<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eichert.com/copera.com/anki.com/index.html|title=About Anki for Palm OS|work=Mirror of old anki.com website}}</ref> was created by Copera, Inc.
