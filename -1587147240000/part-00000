While medieval football is generally believed to have been a men's game some small evidence does exist that women were occasionally involved, with the 16th century [[Sir Philip Sidney]] briefly mentioning it in his poem ''A Dialogue Betweene Two Shepherds''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luminarium.org/editions/sidneydialogue.htm |title=A DIALOGUE BETWEENE TWO SHEPHERDS. |work=luminarium.org |date=July 2006 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> and with a ball formerly in the possession of [[Mary Queen of Scots]] believed to be the oldest football still in existence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-18119054 |title=Get up close and personal with the world's oldest football |work=[[BBC]] |date=19 May 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAs football developed from a disorganised village sport into a codified game with more spectators than players at the end of the 19th century, women's football similarly developed. With women's football in Scotland seemingly more widespread than in England, a team of English women travelled to Edinburgh in May 1881 to play a short series of games against a representative Scottish side led by [[Helen Matthews|Helen Graham Matthews]], who would end up being a pioneer for women's football south of the border.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/real-life/secret-history-womens-football-uncovered-2243257 |title=Secret history of women's football reveals how riots during Auld Enemy clash led to Scotland banning the developing game |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> The matches served as an inauspicious start for women's football, with a riot breaking out among the game's 5,000-odd viewers, [[Pitch invasion|spilling onto the pitch]], ending the game and shortly thereafter resulting in women being banned from playing the sport in Scotland.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/> The ban did, however, result in Graham Matthews moving to England, where she set up a side known as the Lady Footballers, with assistance from her opposite number during the Edinburgh matches, [[Nettie Honeyball]].<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/> Hiding her identity to avoid being linked to the disruption, she went by the name of 'Mrs Graham' until her identity was discovered in 1900.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/>\n\n===Development===\nIn this period, it was not only Helen Graham Matthews leading the way for women in football, however. Honeyball herself would found a team in 1894 called the [[British Ladies' Football Club]], a team which would have as its president Lady [[Florence Dixie]], daughter of the [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry|8th Marquess of Queensberry]].<ref name=\"Spartacus\">{{cite web |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Fwomen.htm |title=Women and Football |work=Spartacus Educational |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> Evidently a number of other teams existed as the Lady Footballers and the British Ladies Football Club were able to tour England, playing teams across the country.<ref name=\"dmu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/news/2013/april/lifting-the-lid-on-the-hidden-history-of-womens-football.aspx |title=Lifting the lid on the hidden history of women's football |work=[[De Montfort University]] |date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://routledge-ny.com/books/details/9780415603133/ |title=The Lady Footballers: Struggling to Play in Victorian Britain |work=James Lee |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2007 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> Women footballers in England were not entirely able to operate without prejudice, however, as evidenced in the way many \u2013 not least Graham Matthews \u2013 elected to play under assumed names to avoid reprisals for their participation.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/>\n\nThe budding interest in football amongst women may initially have been seen as a benefit by football clubs. In 1885, seeking to curb the more boisterous behaviour of male spectators, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] began offering free admission to women in the hope that their presence would restrain the men.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> This was successful, attracting 2,000 women to Preston's next match, and was rapidly adopted by other clubs around England. It became, perhaps, too successful, since by the late 1890s free entry had been entirely discontinued as clubs realised how much revenue they were losing.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> As women's teams continued to grow in reputation, some began to stage games on grounds used by teams of their all-male, and longer-established, counterparts, often reaching respectably high attendances. Notably, a game played in 1895 at the home of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and featuring the British Ladies Football Club managed to draw a crowd higher than the previous highest attendance for the men's team.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/>\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:1921 Dick, Kerr's Ladies.jpg|right|thumb|375px|Dick, Kerr Ladies in 1921]]\nAs the [[First World War]] began in Europe, women's football games began being played for charity,<ref name=\"dmu\"/> their profile helped by the way that, when women started to work in the [[munitions]] factories, they also began to be invited to join the remaining men's kick-arounds outside working hours.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/> Football between men and women at work indeed spawned one famous team in Preston, Lancashire; observing some of the women staff having regular competitions with men over who could hit cloakroom windows more accurately during their lunch breaks, an Alfred Frankland suggested that the women form a team to play charity games. The team took the factory's name and became well-known as [[Dick, Kerr's Ladies F.C.]]. This team would end up playing 828 games between 1917 and 1965 and raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity in its first few years,<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/><ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> a sum equivalent to tens of millions in the 2010s.<ref name=\"trailblazers\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4603149.stm |title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football |work=[[BBC]] |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> One of these matches, played at [[Goodison Park]], Liverpool on Boxing Day 1920, attracted a crowd of 53,000 with another 10,000\u201315,000 reportedly turned away because the ground was full.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-opinion/6534412/women-soccer-kicks-england |title=Women's soccer kicks up in England - espnW |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Buckley |first=Will |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/09/england-women-football |title=The forgotten story of ... the Dick, Kerr's Ladies football team &#124; Will Buckley &#124; Football &#124; guardian.co.uk |newspaper=Guardian |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Kit |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/when-ladies-of-preston-ruled-the-world-1280916.html |title=When Ladies of Preston ruled the world - Sport |newspaper=The Independent |date=1997-02-27 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref> In north east England, the [[Munitionette]]s Cup contest in 1917\u201318 was another very popular event, including star goal-scorer [[Bella Raey]].\n\nAfter the War, the idea of women's international games emerged. In 1920, Alfred Frankland arranged for a women's team organised by a French sporting governing body to tour England which was scheduled to play Dick, Kerr's Ladies at four venues in Preston, Stockport, Manchester and London. Playing to crowds in the tens of thousands, the first ever international matches between women's clubs resulted in two wins for the English side, one for the French and one draw. The series was popular enough to result in Dick, Kerr's being invited over to France for a corresponding away tour.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> Going unbeaten in France, the team returned home to cheering crowds lining the streets, the equal of any accolade a men's team had received.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.womenssoccerscene.co.uk/womens-football-history/womens-football-history.htm |title=Women's Football History |work=womenssoccerscene.co.uk |date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Banning, decline and reappearance===\nIn 1921, however, as war faded into the background, there was renewed concern about the presence of women in football.

The founding of the WSL did not run without problems, however, with the league having to be delayed a year until March 2011, due to the financial instability lingering following the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2007 global recession]].<ref name=\"WSL\"/> Nevertheless, the WSL did launch at its anticipated 2011 start date, and was successful enough to expand to a two-division, 20-team set-up in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/News/2012/dec/fa-wsl-applications-2014.aspx |title=FA WSL 2014: Applications|publisher=thefa.com|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nToday, the FA directly runs the top women's competitions. The most significant national competition is the national cup, the [[FA Women's Cup]], followed by the top national league, the [[FA WSL]] (Women's Super League). Before the formation of the WSL in 2011, the top flight was the [[FA Women's Premier League National Division]], which later become the second-level league and has now been reorganised into the third and fourth levels of the pyramid. Originally, the Premier League champion was the only English representative allowed in Europe. When the UEFA Women's Cup was relaunched as the [[UEFA Women's Champions League]] for the 2009\u201310 season, England became one of eight nations with two Champions League places, a status it has retained ever since. In the first two seasons of the new Champions League, England's two places were filled by the Premier League champion and the FA Women's Cup winner. For 2011\u201312, the two finalists in the 2010\u201311 FA Women's Cup earned the Champions League places. Starting with the 2012\u201313 Champions League, the two berths were initially planned to go to the WSL and FA Women's Cup champions, but the FA chose instead to send the top two teams from the WSL. Women's football also has two significant secondary cup competitions. The [[FA WSL Cup]], contested by the WSL teams, is held after the league season. The [[FA Women's Premier League Cup|Premier League Cup]], limited to the teams in the Premier League and its regional subdivisions, is held during the league season.\n\nThe WSL and Premier League have operated on different season structures \u2013 the WSL conducted a summer season contained entirely within a calendar year, whilst the Premier League continues to operate on the traditional winter season spanning two calendar years. Following an abbreviated spring season in 2017, women's football is moving to a parallel calendar to the premier league starting in the fall of 2017.\n\nThe women's football pyramid was significantly reorganised in 2014. The WSL added a second division known as WSL 2, with the original WSL becoming WSL 1. The Premier League's regional North and South Divisions became the third level of the pyramid, with the [[Combination Women's Football Leagues]] becoming the fourth level. Further changes came in 2015; the FA announced that both divisions of the WSL would expand by one team in 2016, and WSL 2 would also add a team in 2017. Significantly, the new WSL 2 entries will come via promotion from the Premier League, connecting the WSL to the rest of the pyramid for the first time.\n\nTo promote women's football, the FA allows cup finals to be held at various men's Premier League/Football League stadiums throughout the country (as opposed to men's finals which are usually held at the national stadiums). In the 2013\u201314 season, the FA Cup final was held at [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]]'s [[Stadium mk]], the WSL Cup final at [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]' [[Adams Park]], and the League Cup final at [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]]'s [[Pirelli Stadium]].\n\nThe Women's FA Cup secured its first sponsorship deal with [[SSE plc|SSE]] as a sign of the huge resurrection women's football has seen since [[London 2012]]. Despite sponsorship, entering the tournament actually costs clubs more than they get in prize money. In 2015, it was reported that even if [[Notts County Ladies F.C.|Notts County]] had won the tournament outright the paltry \u00a38,600 winnings would leave them out of pocket.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33726417 BBC article on the sponsorship situation]</ref> The winners of the men's [[FA Cup]] in the same year received \u00a31.8 million, with teams not even reaching the first round proper getting more than the women's winners.<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/thefacup/more/prize-fund Prize money list on the FA website]</ref>\n\n===Towards the top===\n[[File:England Women's Vs USA (16365773538).jpg|right|thumb|England women's team in February 2015]]\n\nThe women's game in England took a hit following the 2012 Olympics after England was unable to advance from the group stages at [[2013 UEFA Women's Championship|Women's EURO 2013]] in Sweden, which led to [[Hope Powell]]'s departure as manager and the appointment of Welshman [[Mark Sampson]]. However, England then gave the women's game a boost that may be even bigger than the Olympic boost when they stunned many both at home and abroad by finishing third at the [[2015 Women's World Cup]] in Canada. Along the way, they beat Norway for their first knockout stage win and then host nation Canada in front of a capacity partisan crowd in Vancouver. Following a devastating loss in the semis against defending champion Japan after a [[Laura Bassett]] own goal, the team rebounded to beat Germany for the very first time in women's football after a 1\u20130 extra-time win in the third-place game. It meant that England had finished as the top European team at the World Cup and had recorded the second-best World Cup showing by any England senior team behind only [[Sir Alf Ramsey]], [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Bobby Moore]]'s England men's squad famously winning the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] as hosts.\nIt was announced that the 2015 Women's FA Cup final between [[Chelsea Ladies]] and [[Notts County Ladies]] would be held at [[Wembley Stadium]] for the very first time.\n\n==League system==\n{{Main|FA Women's Super League|FA Women's Championship|FA Women's National League}}\nThe national league system in women's football in England is currently operated by The FA, with the WSL at the top. For its first three seasons (2011\u20132013), the Women's Super League was operated on a licence system with no promotion or relegation, similar to the system used in rugby's [[Super League]]. The WSL replaced the FA Women's Premier League at the top of the system.<ref name=\"go\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news/article/6534412/women-soccer-kicks-england|title=Women's soccer kicks up in England|publisher=espn.go.com|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> Teams in both the Women's Super League and the Women's Championship compete for the [[FA WSL Continental Cup|Continental Cup]].\n\nThe Premier League was divided into six leagues over two divisions: the [[FA Women's Premier League Northern Division]] and the [[FA Women's Premier League Southern Division]]. Teams in these two divisions competed in the [[FA Women's Premier League Cup|Premier League Cup]].\n\nBelow the Premier League were eight regional leagues. Below the regional leagues are the county leagues.<ref>[http://makingwebsites.co.uk/swcombo/history.html History of the South West Combination] from southwestcombination.co.uk.

The most successful are [[Cardiff City L.F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the now defunct [[Barry Town L.F.C.|Barry Town]], both of which have played in the Women's Premiership.\n\nWith the introduction of the WSL the top five levels looked like this over the past years:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

uncertain. While medieval football is generally believed to have been a men's game some small evidence does exist that women were occasionally involved, with the 16th century [[Sir Philip Sidney]] briefly mentioning it in his poem ''A Dialogue Betweene Two Shepherds''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luminarium.org/editions/sidneydialogue.htm |title=A DIALOGUE BETWEENE TWO SHEPHERDS. |work=luminarium.org |date=July 2006 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> and with a ball formerly in the possession of [[Mary Queen of Scots]] believed to be the oldest football still in existence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-18119054 |title=Get up close and personal with the world's oldest football |work=[[BBC]] |date=19 May 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAs football developed from a disorganised village sport into a codified game with more spectators than players at the end of the 19th century, women's football similarly developed. With women's football in Scotland seemingly more widespread than in England, a team of English women travelled to Edinburgh in May 1881 to play a short series of games against a representative Scottish side led by [[Helen Matthews|Helen Graham Matthews]], who would end up being a pioneer for women's football south of the border.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/real-life/secret-history-womens-football-uncovered-2243257 |title=Secret history of women's football reveals how riots during Auld Enemy clash led to Scotland banning the developing game |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=1 September 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> The matches served as an inauspicious start for women's football, with a riot breaking out among the game's 5,000-odd viewers, [[Pitch invasion|spilling onto the pitch]], ending the game and shortly thereafter resulting in women being banned from playing the sport in Scotland.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/> The ban did, however, result in Graham Matthews moving to England, where she set up a side known as the Lady Footballers, with assistance from her opposite number during the Edinburgh matches, [[Nettie Honeyball]].<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/> Hiding her identity to avoid being linked to the disruption, she went by the name of 'Mrs Graham' until her identity was discovered in 1900.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/>\n\n===Development===\nIn this period, it was not only Helen Graham Matthews leading the way for women in football, however. Honeyball herself would found a team in 1894 called the [[British Ladies' Football Club]], a team which would have as its president Lady [[Florence Dixie]], daughter of the [[Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry|8th Marquess of Queensberry]].<ref name=\"Spartacus\">{{cite web |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Fwomen.htm |title=Women and Football |work=Spartacus Educational |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> Evidently a number of other teams existed as the Lady Footballers and the British Ladies Football Club were able to tour England, playing teams across the country.<ref name=\"dmu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/news/2013/april/lifting-the-lid-on-the-hidden-history-of-womens-football.aspx |title=Lifting the lid on the hidden history of women's football |work=[[De Montfort University]] |date=12 April 2013 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://routledge-ny.com/books/details/9780415603133/ |title=The Lady Footballers: Struggling to Play in Victorian Britain |work=James Lee |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2007 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> Women footballers in England were not entirely able to operate without prejudice, however, as evidenced in the way many \u2013 not least Graham Matthews \u2013 elected to play under assumed names to avoid reprisals for their participation.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/>\n\nThe budding interest in football amongst women may initially have been seen as a benefit by football clubs. In 1885, seeking to curb the more boisterous behaviour of male spectators, [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] began offering free admission to women in the hope that their presence would restrain the men.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> This was successful, attracting 2,000 women to Preston's next match, and was rapidly adopted by other clubs around England. It became, perhaps, too successful, since by the late 1890s free entry had been entirely discontinued as clubs realised how much revenue they were losing.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> As women's teams continued to grow in reputation, some began to stage games on grounds used by teams of their all-male, and longer-established, counterparts, often reaching respectably high attendances. Notably, a game played in 1895 at the home of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and featuring the British Ladies Football Club managed to draw a crowd higher than the previous highest attendance for the men's team.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/>\n\n===First World War===\n[[File:1921 Dick, Kerr's Ladies.jpg|right|thumb|375px|Dick, Kerr Ladies in 1921]]\nAs the [[First World War]] began in Europe, women's football games began being played for charity,<ref name=\"dmu\"/> their profile helped by the way that, when women started to work in the [[munitions]] factories, they also began to be invited to join the remaining men's kick-arounds outside working hours.<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/> Football between men and women at work indeed spawned one famous team in Preston, Lancashire; observing some of the women staff having regular competitions with men over who could hit cloakroom windows more accurately during their lunch breaks, an Alfred Frankland suggested that the women form a team to play charity games. The team took the factory's name and became well-known as [[Dick, Kerr's Ladies F.C.]]. This team would end up playing 828 games between 1917 and 1965 and raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity in its first few years,<ref name=\"GrahamMatthews\"/><ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> a sum equivalent to tens of millions in the 2010s.<ref name=\"trailblazers\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4603149.stm |title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football |work=[[BBC]] |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> One of these matches, played at [[Goodison Park]], Liverpool on Boxing Day 1920, attracted a crowd of 53,000 with another 10,000\u201315,000 reportedly turned away because the ground was full.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-opinion/6534412/women-soccer-kicks-england |title=Women's soccer kicks up in England - espnW |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Buckley |first=Will |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/09/england-women-football |title=The forgotten story of ... the Dick, Kerr's Ladies football team &#124; Will Buckley &#124; Football &#124; guardian.co.uk |newspaper=Guardian |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Kit |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/when-ladies-of-preston-ruled-the-world-1280916.html |title=When Ladies of Preston ruled the world - Sport |newspaper=The Independent |date=1997-02-27 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref> In north east England, the [[Munitionette]]s Cup contest in 1917\u201318 was another very popular event, including star goal-scorer [[Bella Raey]].\n\nAfter the War, the idea of women's international games emerged. In 1920, Alfred Frankland arranged for a women's team organised by a French sporting governing body to tour England which was scheduled to play Dick, Kerr's Ladies at four venues in Preston, Stockport, Manchester and London. Playing to crowds in the tens of thousands, the first ever international matches between women's clubs resulted in two wins for the English side, one for the French and one draw. The series was popular enough to result in Dick, Kerr's being invited over to France for a corresponding away tour.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/> Going unbeaten in France, the team returned home to cheering crowds lining the streets, the equal of any accolade a men's team had received.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.womenssoccerscene.co.uk/womens-football-history/womens-football-history.htm |title=Women's Football History |work=womenssoccerscene.co.uk |date=11 March 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Banning, decline and reappearance===\nIn 1921, however, as war faded into the background, there was renewed concern about the presence of women in football. Rumours \u2013 true or not \u2013 circulated that not all the charity money raised by their teams was reaching the intended destinations.<ref name=\"dmu\"/> However, in a move that was widely seen as caused by jealousy of the crowds and interest in women's games which frequently exceeded that of the top men's teams, or simply fear of the renewed [[feminist movement|gender liberation]] campaigns,<ref name=\"trailblazers\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://churnalism.sunlightfoundation.com/sidebyside/generic/2446bdd9fb235719a2bbc1e3c0f05d65/11/191466/ |title=The ladies football team so good the men at the FA banned them |work=sunlightfoundation.com (transcribed from a work by The Sun) |date=3 September 2010 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> the [[Football Association]] banned all women's teams from playing on grounds affiliated to the FA because football damaged women's bodies.<ref name=Brennan>{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Patrick|title=Women's Football|url=http://www.donmouth.co.uk/womens_football/womens_football.html|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/sport/2014/10/rebirth-women-s-football-more-century-it-s-game-worth-watching |title=The rebirth of women's football: more than a century on, it's a game worth watching |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=17 October 2014 |accessdate=18 October 2014 }}</ref> While a handful of teams, such as Dick, Kerr's, were able to find alternative venues, this made most teams disband and reduced spectator numbers for the few who remained.<ref name=\"Spartacus\"/><ref name=\"dmu\"/>\n\nFor several decades this decision meant that women's football virtually ceased to exist.

The founding of the WSL did not run without problems, however, with the league having to be delayed a year until March 2011, due to the financial instability lingering following the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2007 global recession]].<ref name=\"WSL\"/> Nevertheless, the WSL did launch at its anticipated 2011 start date, and was successful enough to expand to a two-division, 20-team set-up in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/News/2012/dec/fa-wsl-applications-2014.aspx |title=FA WSL 2014: Applications|publisher=thefa.com|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nToday, the FA directly runs the top women's competitions. The most significant national competition is the national cup, the [[FA Women's Cup]], followed by the top national league, the [[FA WSL]] (Women's Super League). Before the formation of the WSL in 2011, the top flight was the [[FA Women's Premier League National Division]], which later become the second-level league and has now been reorganised into the third and fourth levels of the pyramid. Originally, the Premier League champion was the only English representative allowed in Europe. When the UEFA Women's Cup was relaunched as the [[UEFA Women's Champions League]] for the 2009\u201310 season, England became one of eight nations with two Champions League places, a status it has retained ever since. In the first two seasons of the new Champions League, England's two places were filled by the Premier League champion and the FA Women's Cup winner. For 2011\u201312, the two finalists in the 2010\u201311 FA Women's Cup earned the Champions League places. Starting with the 2012\u201313 Champions League, the two berths were initially planned to go to the WSL and FA Women's Cup champions, but the FA chose instead to send the top two teams from the WSL. Women's football also has two significant secondary cup competitions. The [[FA WSL Cup]], contested by the WSL teams, is held after the league season. The [[FA Women's Premier League Cup|Premier League Cup]], limited to the teams in the Premier League and its regional subdivisions, is held during the league season.\n\nThe WSL and Premier League have operated on different season structures \u2013 the WSL conducted a summer season contained entirely within a calendar year, whilst the Premier League continues to operate on the traditional winter season spanning two calendar years. Following an abbreviated spring season in 2017, women's football is moving to a parallel calendar to the premier league starting in the fall of 2017.\n\nThe women's football pyramid was significantly reorganised in 2014. The WSL added a second division known as WSL 2, with the original WSL becoming WSL 1. The Premier League's regional North and South Divisions became the third level of the pyramid, with the [[Combination Women's Football Leagues]] becoming the fourth level. Further changes came in 2015; the FA announced that both divisions of the WSL would expand by one team in 2016, and WSL 2 would also add a team in 2017. Significantly, the new WSL 2 entries will come via promotion from the Premier League, connecting the WSL to the rest of the pyramid for the first time.\n\nTo promote women's football, the FA allows cup finals to be held at various men's Premier League/Football League stadiums throughout the country (as opposed to men's finals which are usually held at the national stadiums). In the 2013\u201314 season, the FA Cup final was held at [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|MK Dons]]'s [[Stadium mk]], the WSL Cup final at [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]]' [[Adams Park]], and the League Cup final at [[Burton Albion F.C.|Burton Albion]]'s [[Pirelli Stadium]].\n\nThe Women's FA Cup secured its first sponsorship deal with [[SSE plc|SSE]] as a sign of the huge resurrection women's football has seen since [[London 2012]]. Despite sponsorship, entering the tournament actually costs clubs more than they get in prize money. In 2015, it was reported that even if [[Notts County Ladies F.C.|Notts County]] had won the tournament outright the paltry \u00a38,600 winnings would leave them out of pocket.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33726417 BBC article on the sponsorship situation]</ref> The winners of the men's [[FA Cup]] in the same year received \u00a31.8 million, with teams not even reaching the first round proper getting more than the women's winners.<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/thefacup/more/prize-fund Prize money list on the FA website]</ref>\n\n===Towards the top===\n[[File:England Women's Vs USA (16365773538).jpg|right|thumb|England women's team in February 2015]]\n\nThe women's game in England took a hit following the 2012 Olympics after England was unable to advance from the group stages at [[2013 UEFA Women's Championship|Women's EURO 2013]] in Sweden, which led to [[Hope Powell]]'s departure as manager and the appointment of Welshman [[Mark Sampson]]. However, England then gave the women's game a boost that may be even bigger than the Olympic boost when they stunned many both at home and abroad by finishing third at the [[2015 Women's World Cup]] in Canada. Along the way, they beat Norway for their first knockout stage win and then host nation Canada in front of a capacity partisan crowd in Vancouver. Following a devastating loss in the semis against defending champion Japan after a [[Laura Bassett]] own goal, the team rebounded to beat Germany for the very first time in women's football after a 1\u20130 extra-time win in the third-place game. It meant that England had finished as the top European team at the World Cup and had recorded the second-best World Cup showing by any England senior team behind only [[Sir Alf Ramsey]], [[Bobby Charlton]] and [[Bobby Moore]]'s England men's squad famously winning the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] as hosts.\nIt was announced that the 2015 Women's FA Cup final between [[Chelsea Ladies]] and [[Notts County Ladies]] would be held at [[Wembley Stadium]] for the very first time.\n\n==League system==\n{{Main|FA Women's Super League|FA Women's Championship|FA Women's National League}}\nThe national league system in women's football in England is currently operated by The FA, with the WSL at the top. For its first three seasons (2011\u20132013), the WSL was operated on a licence system with no promotion or relegation, similar to the system used in rugby league's [[Super League]]. The WSL replaced the FA Women's Premier League at the top of the system.<ref name=\"go\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espnw/news/article/6534412/women-soccer-kicks-england|title=Women's soccer kicks up in England|publisher=espn.go.com|accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref> Its teams also compete for the [[FA WSL Continental Cup|Continental Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Tony Leighton |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/30/rod-wilson-women-football-norway |title=Trip to Norway is a real eye-opener for Lincoln Ladies' Rod Wilson &#124; Football |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 2011-01-30|accessdate=2 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe Premier League is divided into six leagues over two divisions: the [[FA Women's Premier League Northern Division]] and the [[FA Women's Premier League Southern Division]] sits above four Division One leagues. Teams in these two divisions compete in the [[FA Women's Premier League Cup|Premier League Cup]].\n\nBelow the Premier League are eight regional leagues. Below the regional leagues are the county leagues.<ref>[http://makingwebsites.co.uk/swcombo/history.html History of the South West Combination] from southwestcombination.co.uk. Retrieved 20 November 2006.</ref>\n\nAs in the men's game, some [[Wales|Welsh]] women's football clubs compete in the English pyramid. The most successful are [[Cardiff City L.F.C.|Cardiff City]] and the now defunct [[Barry Town L.F.C.|Barry Town]], both of which have played in the Women's Premiership.\n\nWith the introduction of the WSL the top five levels looked like this over the past years:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It served as the southernmost segment of the Atlantic Coast Line's main line.  The line remains in service today and is now part of the [[SunRail|Central Florida Rail Corridor]] in the Orlando metro area.  The rest of the line remains under the ownership of CSX Transportation as part of their A Line.\n\n==History==\nThe '''Lake Monroe and Orlando Railroad''' was organized in 1875 with a charter to build from the [[St. Johns River]] port of [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] south to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. The '''South Florida Railroad''' was incorporated on October 16, 1878, but was unable to obtain a charter until December 9, 1879, when it took over the charter of the Lake Monroe and Orlando, which was in danger of losing its [[land grant]]s. The South Florida first ran on November 11, 1880, running the short distance between Sanford and Orlando. However the company had plans to continue to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], reaching it at [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].\n\n[[File:Henry Bradley Plant.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Henry B. Plant]]\nOn May 4, 1883, [[Henry B. Plant]] and his [[Plant System]] (headed by the [[Savannah, Florida and Western Railway]]) bought 3/5 of the stock of the South Florida after an unsuccessful attempt to buy the [[Florida Southern Railway]]. Plant had made an agreement with the Florida Southern not to build the SF&W south of [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] or [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]], the northern ends of the Florida Southern, but the existing South Florida was immune from this. Plant then made agreements with all the railroads building towards Tampa except for the [[Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad]]. Specifically, the Florida Southern would not build any lines south of [[Pemberton's Ferry, Florida|Pemberton's Ferry]] and [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]] or north of [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]], and the South Florida would build its Pemberton Ferry Branch between the two and assign [[trackage rights]] to the Florida Southern. The agreement with the [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]] specified that that company would only build north of [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]; in both cases the South Florida would give up their rights to the territories given to the other companies. The JT&KW had already done some grading at [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and sold them to the South Florida.\n\n[[File:SunRail Church Street.jpg|thumb|250px|South Florida Railroad's historic Church Street Station in 2014.  It now serves SunRail trains.]]\nThus two railroads remained in a race towards Tampa - the South Florida and the [[Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad]]. The South Florida managed to get there first, and obtained the best ports (now known as [[Port Tampa]]). The Tampa end opened on December 10, 1883, and on January 25, 1884 service began over the full line, built to {{track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]]. On February 20, 1886 the {{track gauge|4ft8.5in|allk=on}} [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]] opened to Sanford, and the South Florida was converted to standard gauge on September 22.\n\nIn 1893 the [[Savannah, Florida and Western Railway]] ([[Plant System]]) directly acquired the South Florida. Henry Plant died in 1899, which led his heirs to sell the Plant System to the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902.  The Atlantic Coast Line would then designate the South Florida Railroad main line (along with the main line of the [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]] and other railroads to the north) as their nearly 900-mile main line from [[Richmond, Virginia]] to Tampa.<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Gregg|title=A Short History of Florida Railroads|date=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-2421-4}}</ref>  \n\nIn 1967 the Atlantic Coast Line merged with the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] (who operated the former [[Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad]], the South Florida's former competitor), becoming the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]].  Seaboard Coast Line eventually became [[CSX]] in the 1980s, and the South Florida/Atlantic Coast Line main line now operates as part of one of its two main lines in the area, known as the \"A\" Line.\n\nIn 2011, CSX sold the line from Poinciana north (as well as part of the former [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]]) to the [[Florida Department of Transportation]].  This state-owned segment is now known as the Central Florida Rail Corridor, which makes up a vast majority of the track that the [[SunRail]] commuter rail service operates on.  SunRail began operation on May 1, 2014 from [[Sand Lake Road station|Sand Lake Road]] north to [[DeBary station|DeBary]] and extended service south to [[Poinciana station|Poinciana]] on July 30, 2018.  SunRail also revived passenger service to the South Florida Railroad's historic [[Church Street Station (Orlando)|Church Street Station]] in Downtown Orlando.\n\n==Lines==\n===Main Line===\n{{South Florida Railroad}}\nWhen completed in 1884, the South Florida Railroad's main line ran from Sanford southwest through Orlando and Lakeland to Tampa, terminating at Port Tampa.  The main line today runs south of and roughly parallel to [[Interstate 4]].  Some of the towns along the line were named for railroad officials.  [[Plant City, Florida|Plant City]] was named for Henry Plant, and [[Haines City, Florida|Haines City]] was named for Colonel [[Henry Haines]], who organized the construction of the line and was considered to be Plant's most trusted employee.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgPWo-qn5AkC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=%2522colonel+henry+haines%2522+civil+war&source=bl&ots=XLA8d011Zg&sig=w1BVtuXRos7TXEjuobqL0n0MFXA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GRPwUbLvGpCm9gS1s4DACA&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%2522colonel%2520henry%2520haines%2522%2520civil%2520war&f=false|title=The Two Henrys: Henry Plant and Henry Flagler and Their Railroads|last=Sammons|first=Sandra Wallus|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Pineapple Press Inc|isbn=9781561644612|page=13|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19600814&id=W38wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PPoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6912,1492998&hl=en | title=First Polk Settlers Had to Build Towns, Then Name Them | work=[[Lakeland Ledger]] | date=14 August 1960 | accessdate=22 April 2015 | author=Whitehead, Bill | pages=7-A}}</ref>\n\nThe main line remains in service and is today the southernmost segment of CSX's A Line and the Central Florida Rail Corridor.  The line now operates in the following segments:\n* [[SunRail|Central Florida Rail Corridor]] (Sanford to Poinciana)\n* CSX (Poinciana to Port Tampa)\n** [[Carters Subdivision]] (Poinciana to South Lakeland)\n** [[Lakeland Subdivision]] (South Lakeland to [[Mango, Florida|Mango]])\n** [[Tampa Terminal Subdivision]] (Mango to Port Tampa)\n\n[[Amtrak]] continues to operate passenger service on the line and uses it to reach [[Tampa Union Station]].  Amtrak's Miami-bound trains also travel the line to [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]] and turn south on to the [[Florida Western and Northern Railroad|Auburndale Subdivision]].\n\nPrior to the sale of the north end of the line to FDOT, the line was part of CSX's [[Sanford Subdivision]] from Auburndale north.  Since the sale, CSX only operates local freight on the Central Florida Rail Corridor.  Freight service on the CFRC is based out of Taft Yard in Pine Castle, which CSX still owns.  All of CSX's through freight traffic to northern Florida now uses the adjacent [[Wildwood Subdivision|S Line]].  The [[Florida Central Railroad (current)|Florida Central Railroad]], which connects to the Central Florida Rail Corridor in Downtown Orlando, also has freight trackage rights from its connection south to Taft Yard.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harmon |first1=Danny |title=How CSX Numbers Its Trains |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGW3MERGFKE |website=YouTube |accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Pemberton Ferry Branch===\n{{SFR Pemberton Ferry Branch}}\nPart of the agreement worked out by Henry Plant between the South Florida and the [[Florida Southern Railway]] specified that the South Florida would build the north-south Pemberton Ferry Branch. This branch began at a junction with the Florida Southern at [[Pemberton Ferry, Florida|Pemberton Ferry]] (known today as Croom), running south-southeast across the mainline at [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]] to [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]]. South of Bartow, the Florida Southern continued to [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]], using trackage rights over the branch. The branch was completed in September 1884. Once the [[Bone Valley]] [[phosphate]] district was discovered near Lakeland, pressure increased to [[standard-gauge]] the line, and that was done on August 7, 1891.<ref name=\"Turner\"/>\n\nAfter the Plant System bought the South Florida, an extension was built north from Pemberton Ferry to [[Inverness, Florida|Inverness]], where the Plant System's [[Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad]] continued north, which was completed in 1891.<ref name=\"Turner\"/>\n\nThe branch's north leg is still in service from Lakeland to Lacoochee and the south leg is still in service from the main line to Eaton Park.  The abandoned segment north of Lacoochee is now part of the [[Withlacoochee State Trail]] (which also continues up the abandoned extension to Inverness).<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Withlacoochee State Trail|url=https://www.floridastateparks.org/trail/Withlacoochee|website=Florida State Parks|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>  The [[Fort Fraser Trail]] today runs along the former right-of way from Eaton Park south to Bartow.\n\nThe former Pemberton Ferry branch's north leg is still in service as far north as [[Lacoochee, Florida|Lacoochee]], just north of [[Dade City, Florida|Dade City]].  The south leg is still in service as far south as [[Eaton Park, Florida|Eaton Park]] and is now an industrial spur.  The branch is operated by CSX in the following segments:\n* [[Wildwood Subdivision]] (Lacoochee to Vitis Junction)\n* [[Vitis Subdivision]] (Vitis Junction to Lakeland)\n* '''CH Spur''' (Lakeland to Eaton Park)\n\n===Bartow Branch===\n{{SFR Bartow Branch}}\nThe charter specified that the railroad must pass through [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]]; thus the Bartow Branch was built from the mainline at [[Lake Alfred, Florida|Lake Alfred]] (Bartow Junction) southwest to Bartow. It opened in 1884 and was standard gauged on September 23, 1886.\n\nPart of the Bartow branch remains today from [[Winter Haven, Florida|Winter Haven]] south to Gordonville (just northeast of Bartow).  This segment is operated by the [[Florida Midland Railroad (current)|Florida Midland Railroad]].  The abandoned segment between Lake Alfred and Winter Haven is now the route of the [[Chain of Lakes Trail]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Construction Begins on Chain of Lakes Trail Pedestrian Bridge|url=http://www.theledger.com/news/20130730/construction-begins-on-chain-of-lakes-trail-pedestrian-bridge|accessdate=30 March 2017|agency=The Ledger}}</ref>\n\n===Other Branches===\n;Lake Charm\nThe '''Sanford and Indian River Railroad''' was chartered in 1881 to run from [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] southeast to [[Oviedo, Florida|Oviedo]] and [[Lake Charm]]. The South Florida leased it in 1883, and it was standard gauged on September 21, 1886.  Today, the route is still in service as CSX's Aloma Spur from Sanford to [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs]].  The [[Cross Seminole Trail]] runs along the former right of way from Winter Springs to Oviedo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cross Seminole Trail... Seminole County Biking Trail|url=http://www.bikeorlando.net/cross-seminole-trail.htm|website=Bike Orlando|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n;Apopka\nThe Apopka Branch was part of the original charter, running from [[Mayo, Florida|Mayo]] on the mainline west to the [[Withlacoochee River (South)|Withlacoochee River]] via [[Apopka, Florida|Apopka]]. The line was never opened by the South Florida, instead partially opening as the '''Apopka and Atlantic Railroad'''.  It was never a success.\n\n;Narcoossee\nThe '''St. Cloud and Sugar Belt Railway''' was incorporated in 1888 to connect [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]] to [[St. Cloud, Florida|St. Cloud]] and [[Narcoossee, Florida|Narcoossee]]. It was immediately operated by the South Florida, and was merged into it in 1893.  Neptune Road runs along some of the former right of way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kissimmee to Narcoossee|url=http://www.abandonedrails.com/Kissimmee_to_Narcoossee|website=Abandoned Rails|accessdate=7

Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902.  It served as the southernmost segment of the Atlantic Coast Line's main line.  The line remains in service today and is now part of the [[SunRail|Central Florida Rail Corridor]] in the Orlando metro area.  The rest of the line remains under the ownership of CSX Transportation as part of their A Line.\n\n==History==\nThe '''Lake Monroe and Orlando Railroad''' was organized in 1875 with a charter to build from the [[St. Johns River]] port of [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] south to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. The '''South Florida Railroad''' was incorporated on October 16, 1878, but was unable to obtain a charter until December 9, 1879, when it took over the charter of the Lake Monroe and Orlando, which was in danger of losing its [[land grant]]s. The South Florida first ran on November 11, 1880, running the short distance between Sanford and Orlando. However the company had plans to continue to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], reaching it at [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].\n\n[[File:Henry Bradley Plant.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Henry B. Plant]]\nOn May 4, 1883, [[Henry B. Plant]] and his [[Plant System]] (headed by the [[Savannah, Florida and Western Railway]]) bought 3/5 of the stock of the South Florida after an unsuccessful attempt to buy the [[Florida Southern Railway]]. Plant had made an agreement with the Florida Southern not to build the SF&W south of [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] or [[Palatka, Florida|Palatka]], the northern ends of the Florida Southern, but the existing South Florida was immune from this. Plant then made agreements with all the railroads building towards Tampa except for the [[Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad]]. Specifically, the Florida Southern would not build any lines south of [[Pemberton's Ferry, Florida|Pemberton's Ferry]] and [[Brooksville, Florida|Brooksville]] or north of [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]], and the South Florida would build its Pemberton Ferry Branch between the two and assign [[trackage rights]] to the Florida Southern. The agreement with the [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]] specified that that company would only build north of [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]]; in both cases the South Florida would give up their rights to the territories given to the other companies. The JT&KW had already done some grading at [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], and sold them to the South Florida.\n\n[[File:SunRail Church Street.jpg|thumb|250px|South Florida Railroad's historic Church Street Station in 2014.  It now serves SunRail trains.]]\nThus two railroads remained in a race towards Tampa - the South Florida and the [[Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad]]. The South Florida managed to get there first, and obtained the best ports (now known as [[Port Tampa]]). The Tampa end opened on December 10, 1883, and on January 25, 1884 service began over the full line, built to {{track gauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]]. On February 20, 1886 the {{track gauge|4ft8.5in|allk=on}} [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]] opened to Sanford, and the South Florida was converted to standard gauge on September 22.\n\nIn 1893 the [[Savannah, Florida and Western Railway]] ([[Plant System]]) directly acquired the South Florida. Henry Plant died in 1899, which led his heirs to sell the Plant System to the [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1902.  The Atlantic Coast Line would then designate the South Florida Railroad main line (along with the main line of the [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]] and other railroads to the north) as their nearly 900-mile main line from [[Richmond, Virginia]] to Tampa.<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Gregg|title=A Short History of Florida Railroads|date=2003|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-2421-4}}</ref>  \n\nIn 1967 the Atlantic Coast Line merged with the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] (who operated the former [[Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad]], the South Florida's former competitor), becoming the [[Seaboard Coast Line Railroad]].  Seaboard Coast Line eventually became [[CSX]] in the 1980s, and the South Florida/Atlantic Coast Line main line now operates as part of one of its two main lines in the area, known as the \"A\" Line.\n\nIn 2011, CSX sold the line from Poinciana north (as well as part of the former [[Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway]]) to the [[Florida Department of Transportation]].  This state-owned segment is now known as the Central Florida Rail Corridor, which makes up a vast majority of the track that the [[SunRail]] commuter rail service operates on.  SunRail began operation on May 1, 2014 from [[Sand Lake Road station|Sand Lake Road]] north to [[DeBary station|DeBary]] and extended service south to [[Poinciana station|Poinciana]] on July 30, 2018.  SunRail also revived passenger service to the South Florida Railroad's historic [[Church Street Station (Orlando)|Church Street Station]] in Downtown Orlando.\n\n==Lines==\n===Main Line===\n{{South Florida Railroad}}\nWhen completed in 1884, the South Florida Railroad's main line ran from Sanford southwest through Orlando and Lakeland to Tampa, terminating at Port Tampa.  The main line today runs south of and roughly parallel to [[Interstate 4]].  Some of the towns along the line were named for railroad officials.  [[Plant City, Florida|Plant City]] was named for Henry Plant, and [[Haines City, Florida|Haines City]] was named for Colonel [[Henry Haines]], who organized the construction of the line and was considered to be Plant's most trusted employee.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgPWo-qn5AkC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=%2522colonel+henry+haines%2522+civil+war&source=bl&ots=XLA8d011Zg&sig=w1BVtuXRos7TXEjuobqL0n0MFXA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GRPwUbLvGpCm9gS1s4DACA&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%2522colonel%2520henry%2520haines%2522%2520civil%2520war&f=false|title=The Two Henrys: Henry Plant and Henry Flagler and Their Railroads|last=Sammons|first=Sandra Wallus|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Pineapple Press Inc|isbn=9781561644612|page=13|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19600814&id=W38wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PPoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6912,1492998&hl=en | title=First Polk Settlers Had to Build Towns, Then Name Them | work=[[Lakeland Ledger]] | date=14 August 1960 | accessdate=22 April 2015 | author=Whitehead, Bill | pages=7-A}}</ref>\n\nThe main line remains in service and is today the southernmost segment of CSX's A Line and the Central Florida Rail Corridor.  The line now operates in the following segments:\n* [[SunRail|Central Florida Rail Corridor]] (Sanford to Poinciana)\n* CSX (Poinciana to Port Tampa)\n** [[Carters Subdivision]] (Poinciana to South Lakeland)\n** [[Lakeland Subdivision]] (South Lakeland to [[Mango, Florida|Mango]])\n** [[Tampa Terminal Subdivision]] (Mango to Port Tampa)\n\n[[Amtrak]] continues to operate passenger service on the line and uses it to reach [[Tampa Union Station]].  Amtrak's Miami-bound trains also travel the line to [[Auburndale, Florida|Auburndale]] and turn south on to the [[Florida Western and Northern Railroad|Auburndale Subdivsion]].\n\nPrior to the sale of the north end of the line to FDOT, the line was part of CSX's [[Sanford Subdivision]] from Auburndale north.  Since the sale, CSX only operates local freight on the Central Florida Rail Corridor.  Freight service on the CFRC is based out of Taft Yard in Pine Castle, which CSX still owns.  All of CSX's through freight traffic to northern Florida now uses the adjacent [[Wildwood Subdivision|S Line]].  The [[Florida Central Railroad (current)|Florida Central Railroad]], which connects to the Central Florida Rail Corridor in Downtown Orlando, also has freight trackage rights from its connection south to Taft Yard.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harmon |first1=Danny |title=How CSX Numbers Its Trains |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGW3MERGFKE |website=YouTube |accessdate=23 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Pemberton Ferry Branch===\n{{SFR Pemberton Ferry Branch}}\nPart of the agreement worked out by Henry Plant between the South Florida and the [[Florida Southern Railway]] specified that the South Florida would build the north-south Pemberton Ferry Branch. This branch began at a junction with the Florida Southern at [[Pemberton Ferry, Florida|Pemberton Ferry]] (known today as Croom), running south-southeast across the mainline at [[Lakeland, Florida|Lakeland]] to [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]]. South of Bartow, the Florida Southern continued to [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]], using trackage rights over the branch. The branch was completed in September 1884. Once the [[Bone Valley]] [[phosphate]] district was discovered near Lakeland, pressure increased to [[standard-gauge]] the line, and that was done on August 7, 1891.<ref name=\"Turner\"/>\n\nAfter the Plant System bought the South Florida, an extension was built north from Pemberton Ferry to [[Inverness, Florida|Inverness]], where the Plant System's [[Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad]] continued north, which was completed in 1891.<ref name=\"Turner\"/>\n\nThe branch's north leg is still in service from Lakeland to Lacoochee and the south leg is still in service from the main line to Eaton Park.  The abandoned segment north of Lacoochee is now part of the [[Withlacoochee State Trail]] (which also continues up the abandoned extension to Inverness).<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to Withlacoochee State Trail|url=https://www.floridastateparks.org/trail/Withlacoochee|website=Florida State Parks|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>  The [[Fort Fraser Trail]] today runs along the former right-of way from Eaton Park south to Bartow.\n\nThe former Pemberton Ferry branch's north leg is still in service as far north as [[Lacoochee, Florida|Lacoochee]], just north of [[Dade City, Florida|Dade City]].  The south leg is still in service as far south as [[Eaton Park, Florida|Eaton Park]] and is now an industrial spur.  The branch is operated by CSX in the following segments:\n* [[Wildwood Subdivision]] (Lacoochee to Vitis Junction)\n* [[Vitis Subdivision]] (Vitis Junction to Lakeland)\n* '''CH Spur''' (Lakeland to Eaton Park)\n\n===Bartow Branch===\n{{SFR Bartow Branch}}\nThe charter specified that the railroad must pass through [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]]; thus the Bartow Branch was built from the mainline at [[Lake Alfred, Florida|Lake Alfred]] (Bartow Junction) southwest to Bartow. It opened in 1884 and was standard gauged on September 23, 1886.\n\nPart of the Bartow branch remains today from [[Winter Haven, Florida|Winter Haven]] south to Gordonville (just northeast of Bartow).  This segment is operated by the [[Florida Midland Railroad (current)|Florida Midland Railroad]].  The abandoned segment between Lake Alfred and Winter Haven is now the route of the [[Chain of Lakes Trail]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Construction Begins on Chain of Lakes Trail Pedestrian Bridge|url=http://www.theledger.com/news/20130730/construction-begins-on-chain-of-lakes-trail-pedestrian-bridge|accessdate=30 March 2017|agency=The Ledger}}</ref>\n\n===Other Branches===\n;Lake Charm\nThe '''Sanford and Indian River Railroad''' was chartered in 1881 to run from [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] southeast to [[Oviedo, Florida|Oviedo]] and [[Lake Charm]]. The South Florida leased it in 1883, and it was standard gauged on September 21, 1886.  Today, the route is still in service as CSX's Aloma Spur from Sanford to [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs]].  The [[Cross Seminole Trail]] runs along the former right of way from Winter Springs to Oviedo.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cross Seminole Trail... Seminole County Biking Trail|url=http://www.bikeorlando.net/cross-seminole-trail.htm|website=Bike Orlando|accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n;Apopka\nThe Apopka Branch was part of the original charter, running from [[Mayo, Florida|Mayo]] on the mainline west to the [[Withlacoochee River (South)|Withlacoochee River]] via [[Apopka, Florida|Apopka]]. The line was never opened by the South Florida, instead partially opening as the '''Apopka and Atlantic Railroad'''.  It was never a success.\n\n;Narcoossee\nThe '''St. Cloud and Sugar Belt Railway''' was incorporated in 1888 to connect [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]] to [[St. Cloud, Florida|St. Cloud]] and [[Narcoossee, Florida|Narcoossee]]. It was immediately operated by the South Florida, and was merged into it in 1893.  Neptune Road runs along some of the former right of way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kissimmee to Narcoossee|url=http://www.abandonedrails.com/Kissimmee_to_Narcoossee|website=Abandoned Rails|accessdate=7

For example, in 1984, inspired by its previous work on the Political Community, it drafted the \"draft Treaty establishing the European Union\" (also known as the 'Spinelli Plan' after its rapporteur [[Altiero Spinelli]] MEP).

In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the [[European Council]] in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels.

In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a \"common position\". That position may either be approved by Parliament,  or it may reject the text by an [[absolute majority]], causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority.

Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the \"retour\" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (\"relay\" interpreting){{snd}} for example, when interpreting out of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/> Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question).

The provisional arrangements placed Parliament in [[Strasbourg]], while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing to be closer to these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the [[European Council]] in 1992.

In [[European Community|Community matters]], this is a power uniquely reserved for the [[European Commission]] (the executive).

The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the \"[[ordinary legislative procedure]]\" (previously named \"codecision procedure\"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a \"common position\". That position may either be approved by Parliament,  or it may reject the text by an [[absolute majority]], causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a \"Conciliation Committee\" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority.<ref name=\"Parliament's powers\">{{cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate =12 June 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"decision making\">{{cite web|title=Decision-making in the European Union|website=|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=18 September 2007|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040316/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the [[Bolkestein directive]] in 2006.<ref name=\"FT CIO\"/>\n\nThe few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice and home affairs, budget and taxation, and certain aspects of other policy areas, such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy.

The chairs of the Committees co-ordinate their work through the \"[[Committees of the European Parliament#Conference of Committee Chairs|Conference of Committee Chairmen]]\".<ref name=\"Organised\"/> When co-decision was introduced it increased the Parliament's powers in a number of areas, but most notably those covered by the [[Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety]]. Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a \"[[Cinderella]] committee\"; however, as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous, attracting increasing attention to its work.<ref name=\"Hoskyns\"/>\n\nThe nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the [[United States Congressional committee|United States Congress]], the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.<ref name=\"Kreppel\"/>\n\n[[European Parliament Delegations|Delegations of the Parliament]] are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the EU. There are 34 delegations made up of around 15 MEPs, chairpersons of the delegations also cooperate in a conference like the committee chairs do. They include \"Interparliamentary delegations\" (maintain relations with Parliament outside the EU), \"joint parliamentary committees\" (maintaining relations with parliaments of states which are candidates or associates of the EU), the  delegation to the [[ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly]] and the delegation to the [[Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly]].<ref name=\"Organised\"/> MEPs also participate in other international activities such as the [[Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly]], the [[Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue]] and through [[Election monitoring|election observation]] in third countries.<ref>{{cite web|title =European Parliament: In Detail|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert.do?language=EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate =9 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Intergroups===\n[[File:Dvorana Jo\u017eeta Pu\u010dnika Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik]] conference room]]\n\nThe [[Intergroups in the European Parliament]] are informal fora which gather MEPs from various political groups around any topic. They do not express the view of the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-politique-europeenne-2003-1-page-123.htm Dutoit Laurent, \u00ab L'influence au sein du Parlement europ\u00e9en : les intergroupes \u00bb, Politique europ\u00e9enne 1/2003 (n\u00b0 9), p. 123-142].</ref> They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/intergroupes/legislature_8/DecisionofCoPof16Dec1999-Rules_governing_the_establishment_of_integroupes.pdf|title=Article 6, Rules governing the establishment of intergroups, decision of the Conference of Presidents, 16 december 1999 (last updated 11 September 2014)}}</ref> Also Intergroups are established or renewed at the beginning of each legislature through a specific process.

Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the \"retour\" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (\"relay\" interpreting){{snd}} for example, when interpreting out of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/> Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/>\n\nWhile some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some.

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2020 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 15 April 2020. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.

The bill must then be edited by a committee to ensure that the bill contains correct and systematic language. It can then be approved or rejected by the Assembly.<ref>Park 2010, p. 27.</ref>\n\n=== Committees===\nThere are 17 standing committees which examine bills and petitions falling under their respective jurisdictions, and perform other duties as prescribed by relevant laws.\n\n* House Steering Committee\n* Legislation and Judiciary Committee\n* National Policy Committee\n* Strategy and Finance Committee\n* Science, ICT, Future Planning, Broadcasting and Communications Committee\n* Education Committee\n* Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee\n* Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee\n* National Defense Committee\n* Security and Public Administration Committee\n* Agriculture, Food, Rural Affairs, Oceans and Fisheries Committee\n* Trade, Industry and Energy Committee\n* Health and Welfare Committee\n* Environment and Labor Committee\n* Land, Infrastructure and Transport Committee\n* Intelligence Committee\n* Gender Equality and Family Committee\n\n===Election===\n{{see also|Legislative elections in South Korea}}\nSince the promulgation of the March 1988 electoral law, the assembly has been elected every four years through a [[parallel voting|Supplementary Member]] system, meaning that some of the members are elected from constituencies according to the system of [[first past the post]], while others are elected at a national level through [[proportional representation]].<ref>[[Aurel S.

[[Legislative elections in South Korea|Elections to the National Assembly]] are held every four years. The latest [[2020 South Korean legislative election|legislative elections]] were held on 15 April 2020. Single-member constituencies comprise 253 of the assembly's seats, while the remaining 47 are allocated by [[proportional representation]], 30 of which are used to compensate for the Single-member constituencies. Members serve four-year terms.\n\nThe unicameral assembly consists of at least 200 members according to the [[Constitution of South Korea|South Korean constitution]]. In 1990 the assembly had 299 seats, 224 of which were directly elected from single-member districts in the [[1988 South Korean legislative election|general elections of April 1988]]. Under applicable laws, the remaining seventy-five representatives were elected from party lists. By law, candidates for election to the assembly must be at least thirty years of age. As part of a political compromise in 1987, an earlier requirement that candidates have at least five years' continuous residency in the country was dropped to allow [[Kim Dae-Jung]], who had spent several years in exile in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] during the 1980s, to return to political life. The National Assembly's term is four years. In a change from the more authoritarian [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Fourth Republic]] and [[Fifth Republic of South Korea|Fifth Republic]] (1972\u201380 and 1980\u201387, respectively), under the [[History of South Korea#Sixth Republic 1987\u2013present|Sixth Republic]], the assembly cannot be dissolved by the president.\n\n==Current composition==\n[[File:Graph of South Korean Political Parties (2005-2018).png|thumb|right|This graph traces the recent origins of all six main political parties currently in the Republic of Korea.

He is central to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] denomination of [[Ayyavazhi]], as per holy scripture.\n\n== Early Avatars ==\n{{Ayyavazhi}}\n[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, whenever the yuga ages and major injustice happens, [[God]] appears as incarnations to establish dharma by destroying adharma.\n\nAt the beginning of Universe, devas gathered in Kailasa and had Amrutham. After having, devas asked [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], do we have any enemies. To answer this, [[Shiva|Lord Siva]] lits an agni kunda and went himself into it and sang vedakandam with dance. After completion when he returned from agni kunda, a deadly monster called Kroni (Asura or evil force) was also born inside an agni kunda. After few days, the evil force kroni was trying to destroy Kailasa in order to kill devas. To save devas, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] took a penance to get grace of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to destroy Kroni. Lord Shiva appeared and said to [[Vishnu|Narayana]], \"Kroni should be cut in six pieces\u201d. In doing so, every piece of him will be born as a monster on the earth, and you will have to incarnate to destroy the other demons.\n\n[[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] consents and chops Kroni into six pieces in [[Neetiya Yuga|Neetiya yuga]]. Accordingly, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnated by the Yuga-Yugas in order to protect the Dharma. So, he appeared in the [[Chathura Yukam|Chathur Yuga]] and the [[Netu Yukam|Netu Yuga]] by destroying the asuras such as Gundomasali, Thillai Mallalan, and Mallossy Vaughan that emerged from Kroni's chunk. Later in the [[Kretha Yukam|Kretha Yuga]], Lord incarnated as [[Kartikeya|Muruga]], [[Narasimha]] and [[Rama|Sri Rama]] in the [[Thretha Yukam|Thretha Yuga]] to destroy the Asuras such as Singamukha Suran, Surapathman, Iranian, and [[Ravana]]. In the [[Dwapara yuga|Dwapara Yuga]] Lord incarnated as [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]] to destroy the Asuras such as [[Duryodhana]], Takkan and helped the [[Pandava]]s to establish the Dharma by establishing the [[Pandava]]s Kingdom again. Kroni was refused to listen [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]\u2019s council, whenever he was born and destroyed. [[Vishnu|Lord narayana]] was angry on this and last said to kroni \"You will die because of yourself\u201d. Then, at the end of [[Dwapara yuga]], Lord was known that Kailyan will come, that is the reason he had led the route of forest, while on the way he had taken back the powers of [[pandava]]s and left his body on top of the hill and left this world.\n\n== Legend ==\n{{Main|Vishnu}}\nWhenever [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnates, he gives the details in scriptures about his incarnation. The [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] is the divine scripture, which gives the details of tenth incarnation of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] in form of Vaikundar.\n\nYes, to understand [[Rama|Rama Avatara]], [[Ramayana]] was provided to the world. For [[Krishna|Krishna Avatara]], [[Mahabharata|Mahabharatha]] was written. To know about Vaikunta Avatara, [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] was provided to mankind. [[Vedas]], [[puranas]], [[Itihasa]]s, and also according to the predictions in other religions, to end the cruelties of Kali Yuga and to protect the world, [[Vishnu|Narayana]] appeared as Vaikuntar.\n\n[[Ayyavazhi]] scripture [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] gives the world's historical and mythological events. It also gives prophecy of the avatars of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] and his coming along with extensive quantity of historical facts. This holy book focus on the \u201csupreme oneness\u201d and narrates the events starting from the creation of the Universe. It also explains us what has happened so far and what is going to happen next. This holy book was compiled by his fifth citar - [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan]] on Kollam Year 1016 at 27th day of Tamil Month Karthikai (10th December 1841 CE, Friday). [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Goplan]] received holy Apostle from Lord in his dream, which commissioned him to write the [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] by giving him the first syllable - \u201cThe Kappu\u201d.\n\n== Ayyavazhi beliefs ==\n\n===Lord Ayya Vaikundar Avatar===\nAyyavazhi followers believe that [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] itself incarnated as Lord Ayya Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity [[Lakshmi|Goddess Lakshmi]].\n\nAs per [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]], by the words of the devas, the [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] gave birth to the [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan (Asura)]], that emerged from last and sixth piece of Kroni's chunk. The [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] begun, when the Kaliyan was born. Kroni\u2019s fifth chunk [[Duryodhana]] in the previous yuga was transmigrated as [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] in [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]]. After his birth, he got lots of boon from [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], which had more powers compared to the powers of the [[Asura]] of previous yuga\u2019s. His Powers included reign of the King, various tricks, long life tricks and the Lord\u2019s Chakrayuta. When [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was on the way to earth, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] in the form of Pantaram (Monk) stopped him and challenged him for fight. [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] ignored by saying, \u201cI have lot of powers, If I fight with you, my wife will laugh!\u201d. In response, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] asked him to promise - \"Going forward he won't fight or disrupt any Pantaram\u201d. [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] agreed and gave the promise \u2013 \u201cI will never fight or distrupt any Pantaram, If I will do so, will lose everything and will go to hell\". [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, this is the reason behind [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]\u2019s tenth avatar in [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] as Narayana Pantaram.\n\nIt is said that this [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] became the king of earth in various places and tortured the lives of the good people. He created various caste system in order to divide and rule. Collected heavy taxes from public, That is to say, from feather to Mangalasutra, he put heavy taxes and tortured the people lives. Due to this, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] got angry and advised [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] to stop torturing the people who are innocent by mind and heart. However, he did not agree and preferred death rather than giving up. As per the [[vedas]] of [[Vyasa|sage Vyasa]], In order to stop the rule of [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] and to bring an end to this [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]], [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] planned to make Vaikundar incarnate as Pantaram.\n\nWhen the day came, In [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]], the [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity [[Lakshmi|Goddess Lakshmi]], he was beget inside the sea and arose from the sea of [[Thiruchendur|Tiruchendur]] on Kollam Year 1008 at 20th day of Tamil Month Masi (1st March 1833 CE, Friday). He took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore, this is considered a unique avatar in ayyavazhi mythology. Then he started walking towards [[Detchanam]]. This place became a holy place for the devotees of [[Ayyavazhi Mythology|Ayyavazhi]] and they erected a temple there named [[Avatharappathi]]. This event is celebrated during the festival of [[Ayya vaikundar avataram|Ayya Vaikundar Avataram]]. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] and the evil in [[Kali Yuga]]. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as [[Dharma Yukam|Dharma yuga]].\n\nLord Ayya Vaikundar, who arose from the sea at [[Thiruchendur]] ''(per [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]])'' on 20th of the [[Tamil Calendar|Tamil Month of Masi]] (1_March_1833 CE, Friday) is considered a unique [[avatar]] by the followers of Ayyavazhi. [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]], speaks about it in great detail, as summarized below:\n\nI (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]] with the grace of God!\n\n\u201c \u2018O\u2019 Lord you took avatar for [[Pandava]]s and eliminated their enemies.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]].\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Came again to the world to protect santror (good people) and dharma\u201d\n\n\u201cOn Masi 1008, I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) myself appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea, have taken residence in Theksanapuri as Vaikundar\u201d \u2013 [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]]\n\n[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named [[Avathara Pathi|Avathara pathi]].\n\nGod says this prophecy,\n\n\"I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" \u2013 [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]]\n\nIn each of the five [[yuga]]s prior to the avatar of Lord Ayya Vaikundar, as each fragment of [[Kroni]] (evil or Devil) came into physical form, the Lord [[Vishnu]] incarnated as well, destroying them. However, in this the sixth yuga, the evil was called [[Kalineesan|Kali (\u0915\u0932\u093f)]] (n''ot the Hindu deity''),{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=206}} and having no physical form (see [[Pre-Incarnational Events]] for this account) he occupied the mind of people of earth as the Mayai (illusion), causing them to behave discourteously.  [[Kalineesan|Kaliyan]] claimed, it was impossible to destroy him by the use of weapons in this [[yuga]] as in the previous ones as he held the [[Wiktionary:boon|boon]] from Supreme god Shiva, that is the reason [[Vishnu|Lord Narayan,]] to incarnate as \"pandaram\" in the world to destroy him.\n\nIn the name of Vaikundar, Lord came towards [[Swamithope|Swamithopu]] as Pantaram. [[Lord Vaikundar]] as a Pantaram, had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on forehead, tied a turban on his head and carried a cane. Upon reaching [[Swamithope|Swamithopu]], he undertook a penance for 6 years to get grace and power of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. He got the power to abolish the rule of the evil force [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] from the world and for the subsequent end of [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]]. Lord did many mighty miracles. These incude, curing all the diseases for those people who came to get blessing from him. He baught eighteen-caste people together for peace and equality. [[Lord Vaikundar]] had five disciples (Citars). According to [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]], the [[Pandava]]s of previous [[Dwapara yuga]] were made to take birth in this [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] as [[Seedars|Citars]] of Vaikundar. The holy book [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] was compiled by his fifth citar - [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan]] alias [[Sahadeva]].\n\nAccording to Akilam, Vaikundar is 10th avatar of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]], also popularly called as \u201cNarayana Pantaram\u201d or \u201c[[Kalki]]\u201d alias \u201cAyya\u201d. Lord's avatar happens to be next to his [[Krishna]] avatar. In this avatar, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnated as \u201cTrimurti\u201d alias \u201c[[Harihara|Siva Narayana]]\u201d. He had supreme power for the responsibility to destroy the evil of [[Kali|Kali (\u0915\u0932\u093f)]].\n\nAnother view is that [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] did not take a human body and showed only a bodily appearance{{sfn|Thuvarakapathi||p=37}} to mankind based upon quotes in Akilam.{{sfn|Pathippakam|2004|p=112}}\n\n===Tavam===\n{{Main|Tavam of Vaikundar}}\n\nUpon reaching Poovantanthoppe, (present-day [[Swamithope]]), he undertook a penance. The penance consisted of three stages, each spanning two years. A tradition describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: during the first two years, he stood inside a six feet deep pit; during the next two years, he squatted on the ground; and during the last two years, he sat on a raised platform. His appearance was squalid, \"long and entangled plait of hair\" and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.<ref>{{harvnb|Patrick|2003|p=79}} ''He seems to have spoken less and subsisted on frugal meals.''</ref>\n\n===Supernatural Abilities===\n[[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] speaks of his incineration of evil spirits as an important event in Lord Ayya Vaikundar's incarnation. It took place when he was performing his penance, which he had announced to be the means of destroying the [[kalimayai]] - the illusory evil force. He gathered the people and caused some of them, both male and female, to be possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam).{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=80}} The possessed ones danced in front of the crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and incinerate themselves. When he had finished his orders, the dancers fell flat on the ground and burned.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=254-260}}\n\nSimilarly, Vaikundar performed another action to 'seize the esoteric evil powers'. [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says that he took away the powers of those who knew to perform witchcraft, sorcery  and other magical rituals. People living in the hills, called as Kanikkarar, were believed to be powerful [[shaman]]s, having powers to contain or to provoke the demons. Vaikundar, in a trance, made some of them testify that they had surrendered their powers. People grew appreciative of Ayya's actions. They began addressing him as Vaikuntasami. This implied an attribution of divinity to Vaikundar.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=80}} [[Vaikundar]] exhorted the people as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nThere are no demons, no devils.'' No ill effects of magical practices,<br />\nNo disease, no pain  and no extortion of taxes,<br />\nAnd, therefore, live courageously.''\n</blockquote>\n\n===Five Citars===\nLord Vaikundar has five disciples (citars). According to holy scripture [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu Ammanai]] the [[Pandavas]] of previous [[Dwapara Yukam]] was made to take birth in this [[Kali Yukam]] as [[Seedars|Citars]] of Vaikundar. They are [[Dharma Citar]], [[Bhima Citar]], [[Arjunan Citar]], [[Nakulan Citar]] and [[Sakatevan Citar]].\n\n==Vaikundar as Narayana Pandaram==\n[[File:Ayya Vaikundar Avatar.jpg|thumb|Vaikundar as Narayana Pantaram]]\nThe fame of Vaikundar began to spread in the countries of [[Travancore]] and [[Tirunelveli]]  and he was gradually recognised as a religious person with extraordinary powers.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}} He was addressed as a [[Pantaram]], a religious person hailing from  and serving the ordinary folk. [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] addresses him as Narayana Pantaram.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=253}}\n\nPeople came to listen to his teachings and instructions, to be cured by him of different diseases, to witness, worship and serve a religious person. Vaikundar encouraged the people to come together around a well to take a ritual bath, irrespective of caste. He encouraged them to dine together in his presence.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=251}}[[File:Ayya's Holy Perambu and Surai koodu.jpg|thumb|right|The things used by Vaikundar; 'Surai Koodu', 'Pirambu' and 'Thandayam'.]]He stressed that he had come to abolish [[Kali Yukam]]  and to usher in an age of [[Dharma Yukam]], when the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam\u2019{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p= 212}} was a constant refrain in his teachings.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}} People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of [[Kaliyan|Kali]] by transforming themselves to be 'people of [[Dharma Yukam]]' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they learned to live with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said,  \u2018if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself\u2019 .   He said when people grew out of kalimayai, [[Dharma Yukam]] would unfold and in that age, he would rule over the people as [[Dharma Raja]], the king of [[Dharma Yukam]].\n\nAccording to the legend as per holy akilam, when [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was born, he got the boon from Supreme god [[Shiva]], which has more powers than compare to which he got on previous yuga's. When he was on the way to earth, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] was in the form of Pantaram stopped him and asked him to fight with. When [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was ignored, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] asked him to promise, \"going forward i won't fight or distrupt any Pantaram. If i will do so, will lose everything  and will go to hell\".\n\nThat is the reason [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] has taken his tenth avatar on this [[Kali Yuga|kali yuga]] as Narayana Pantaram. \n{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}}\n\n==Arrest and imprisonment==\n{{See also|Ayyavazhi mythology#Vaikundar.27s trial|l1=Vaikundar's Trial}}\nHe made some controversial statements like mentioning the [[travancore]] king as \u2018Devil in Ananthapuri\u2019 and the British rule as \u2018Rule of White Devils\u2019. Against the background of the growing popularity of Vaikundar  and the convergence of people around him in multitudes, a complaint was lodged against him with the [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|king of Travancore]]. The [[Travancore]] king Swathi thirunal arrested Vaikundar in 1838 and imprisoned him at Singarathoppu jail in Travancore. After 110 days of imprisonment, on March 26, 1839 he was released by Swathithirunal on the advise of Thycaud Ayya who was the Guru of Swathi thirunal Maharaj and a disciple of Vaikundar as well.\n\n==Post-imprisonment ==\nAfter returning from the prison, Vaikundar inspired a group of his devotees to undertake a religious exercise called [[Thuvayal Thavasu]].{{sfn|Nadar|1989|pp= 290-298}}{{sfn|LMS Report|1838|p=71}} He also performed miracles. He married [[Saptha Kanniyar]] as [[Narayana]]r (see: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Seven Virgins|Marriage with the Seven Virgins]]), the [[Seven deities]] in the form of [[Ekam]] (see:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Deities|Marriage with the Deities]]). He initiated festivities (see: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Festivals and celebrations|Festivals and Celebrations]]).\" The deities were made to 'come upon' some of the female devotees who became their human media  and a marriage ceremony was performed.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p= 336-338}} Ceremonial processions were held amidst singing, incantations and shouts of joy by the followers. Several rites and rituals were instituted during these occasions.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=83}}\n\n==Lord Ayya Vaikundar at Vaikundam==\n{{Further|Ayyavazhi mythology#Ascending to Vaikundam.}}\n\nLater [[Lord Vaikundar]] was invited by his devotees to their homes and treated in a grand manner. By way of soliciting his blessings, his devotees carried him to different places. During these occasions, he laid foundations in various places for small shrine-like centres, called [[Nizhal Thangal]]s. [[Lord Vaikundar]] came to recognize five individuals as his closest disciples. Through one of his disciples, [[Hari Gopalan Citar]], he wrote the holy book, called [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|''Akilam'']].{{sfn|Pathippakam|2004|p=4}}\n\n[[Lord Vaikundar]] returned to Vaikundam on 3 June 1851. According to Ayyavazhi followers, he has returned to Vaikundam.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=}} However, this date is disputed, as Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848.{{sfn|Mateer|1871|p=222}} As he returned to Vaikundam, his body was interned in a tomb and, around that, a pati (temple) was later built. His devotees continued to visit this site  and performed the rituals as they used to do when Vaikundar was bodily present. His life and works remain the foundation of the Ayyavazhi. The head temple of the Ayyavazhi religion is the [[Swamithoppepathi]] and is located in the Village of [[Swamithope]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe film ''[[Ayyavazhi (film)|Ayyavazhi]]'' released in 2008 was based on the life of Lord Vaikundar.

He is central to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] denomination of [[Ayyavazhi]], as per holy scripture.\n\n== Early Avatars ==\n{{Ayyavazhi}}\n[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, whenever the yuga ages and major injustice happens, [[God]] appears as incarnations to establish dharma by destroying adharma. \n\nAt the beginning of Universe, devas gathered in Kailasa and had Amrutham. After having, devas asked [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], do we have any enemies. To answer this, [[Shiva|Lord Siva]] lits an agni kunda and went himself into it and sang vedakandam with dance. After completion when he returned from agni kunda, a deadly monster called Kroni (Asura or evil force) was also born inside an agni kunda. After few days, the evil force kroni was trying to destroy Kailasa in order to kill devas. To save devas, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] took a penance to get grace of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] to destroy Kroni. Lord Shiva appeared and said to [[Vishnu|Narayana]], \"Kroni should be cut in six pieces\u201d. In doing so, every piece of him will be born as a monster on the earth, and you will have to incarnate to destroy the other demons. \n\n[[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] consents and chops Kroni into six pieces in [[Neetiya Yuga|Neetiya yuga]]. Accordingly, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnated by the Yuga-Yugas in order to protect the Dharma. So, he appeared in the [[Chathura Yukam|Chathur Yuga]] and the [[Netu Yukam|Netu Yuga]] by destroying the asuras such as Gundomasali, Thillai Mallalan, and Mallossy Vaughan that emerged from Kroni's chunk. Later in the [[Kretha Yukam|Kretha Yuga]], Lord incarnated as [[Kartikeya|Muruga]], [[Narasimha]] and [[Rama|Sri Rama]] in the [[Thretha Yukam|Thretha Yuga]] to destroy the Asuras such as Singamukha Suran, Surapathman, Iranian, and [[Ravana]]. In the [[Dwapara yuga|Dwapara Yuga]] Lord incarnated as [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]] to destroy the Asuras such as [[Duryodhana]], Takkan and helped the [[Pandava|Pandavas]] to establish the Dharma by establishing the [[Pandava|Pandavas]] Kingdom again. Kroni was refused to listen [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]\u2019s council, whenever he was born and destroyed. [[Vishnu|Lord narayana]] was angry on this and last said to kroni \"You will die because of yourself\u201d. Then, at the end of [[Dwapara yuga]], Lord was known that Kailyan will come, that is the reason he had led the route of forest, while on the way he had taken back the powers of [[Pandava|pandavas]] and left his body on top of the hill and left this world.\n\n== Legend ==\n{{Main|Vishnu}}\nWhenever [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnates, he gives the details in scriptures about his incarnation. The [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] is the divine scripture, which gives the details of tenth incarnation of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] in form of Vaikundar. \n\nYes, to understand [[Rama|Rama Avatara]], [[Ramayana]] was provided to the world. For [[Krishna|Krishna Avatara]], [[Mahabharata|Mahabharatha]] was written. To know about Vaikunta Avatara, [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] was provided to mankind. [[Vedas]], [[puranas]], [[Itihasa|Itihasas]], and also according to the predictions in other religions, to end the cruelties of Kali Yuga and to protect the world, [[Vishnu|Narayana]] appeared as Vaikuntar.\n\n[[Ayyavazhi]] scripture [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] gives the world's historical and mythological events. It also gives prophecy of the avatars of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] and his coming along with extensive quantity of historical facts. This holy book focus on the \u201csupreme oneness\u201d and narrates the events starting from the creation of the Universe. It also explains us what has happened so far and what is going to happen next. This holy book was compiled by his fifth citar - [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan]] on Kollam Year 1016 at 27th day of Tamil Month Karthikai (10th December 1841 CE, Friday). [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Goplan]] received holy Apostle from Lord in his dream, which commissioned him to write the [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilattirattu]] by giving him the first syllable - \u201cThe Kappu\u201d.\n\n== Ayyavazhi beliefs ==\n\n===Lord Ayya Vaikundar Avatar===\nAyyavazhi followers believe that [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] itself incarnated as Lord Ayya Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity [[Lakshmi|Goddess Lakshmi]].\n\nAs per [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]], by the words of the devas, the [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] gave birth to the [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan (Asura)]], that emerged from last and sixth piece of Kroni's chunk. The [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] begun, when the Kaliyan was born. Kroni\u2019s fifth chunk [[Duryodhana]] in the previous yuga was transmigrated as [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] in [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]]. After his birth, he got lots of boon from [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]], which had more powers compared to the powers of the [[Asura]] of previous yuga\u2019s. His Powers included reign of the King, various tricks, long life tricks and the Lord\u2019s Chakrayuta. When [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was on the way to earth, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] in the form of Pantaram (Monk) stopped him and challenged him for fight. [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] ignored by saying, \u201cI have lot of powers, If I fight with you, my wife will laugh!\u201d. In response, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] asked him to promise - \"Going forward he won't fight or disrupt any Pantaram\u201d. [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] agreed and gave the promise \u2013 \u201cI will never fight or distrupt any Pantaram, If I will do so, will lose everything and will go to hell\". [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, this is the reason behind [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]\u2019s tenth avatar in [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] as Narayana Pantaram.\n\nIt is said that this [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] became the king of earth in various places and tortured the lives of the good people. He created various caste system in order to divide and rule. Collected heavy taxes from public, That is to say, from feather to Mangalasutra, he put heavy taxes and tortured the people lives. Due to this, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] got angry and advised [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] to stop torturing the people who are innocent by mind and heart. However, he did not agree and preferred death rather than giving up. As per the [[vedas]] of [[Vyasa|sage Vyasa]], In order to stop the rule of [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] and to bring an end to this [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]], [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] planned to make Vaikundar incarnate as Pantaram.\n\nWhen the day came, In [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]], the [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar during an encounter with a deity [[Lakshmi|Goddess Lakshmi]], he was beget inside the sea and arose from the sea of [[Thiruchendur|Tiruchendur]] on Kollam Year 1008 at 20th day of Tamil Month Masi (1st March 1833 CE, Friday). He took the human form as Pantaram at Tharuvaiyur near seashore, this is considered a unique avatar in ayyavazhi mythology. Then he started walking towards [[Detchanam]]. This place became a holy place for the devotees of [[Ayyavazhi Mythology|Ayyavazhi]] and they erected a temple there named [[Avatharappathi]]. This event is celebrated during the festival of [[Ayya vaikundar avataram|Ayya Vaikundar Avataram]]. From the point of incarnation of Vaikundar, it is said that he will destroy [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] and the evil in [[Kali Yuga]]. It is also said that he will take all righteous people along with him in the succeeding eighth yuga called as [[Dharma Yukam|Dharma yuga]]. \n\nLord Ayya Vaikundar, who arose from the sea at [[Thiruchendur]] ''(per [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]])'' on 20th of the [[Tamil Calendar|Tamil Month of Masi]] (1_March_1833 CE, Friday) is considered a unique [[avatar]] by the followers of Ayyavazhi. [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilam]], speaks about it in great detail, as summarized below:\n\nI (Hari Gopalan) am writing these words of [[Akilathirattu Ammanai]] with the grace of God!\n\n\u201c \u2018O\u2019 Lord you took avatar for [[Pandava|Pandavas]] and eliminated their enemies. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 You attained the abode of Kailasa with anger due to birth of [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]]. \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Came again to the world to protect santror (good people) and dharma\u201d \n\n\u201cOn Masi 1008, I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) myself appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea, have taken residence in Theksanapuri as Vaikundar\u201d \u2013 [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]]\n\n[[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] himself incarnated as Vaikundar and appeared as Pantaram on the banks of sea. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayya vazhi and they erected a temple there named [[Avathara Pathi|Avathara pathi]].\n\nGod says this prophecy, \n\n\"I ([[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]]) took the avatar for yuga trail and became the praise child for Sita.\n\nAs a king of Dharma yuga, I am going to rule the world with single command\" \u2013 [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]]\n\nIn each of the five [[yuga]]s prior to the avatar of Lord Ayya Vaikundar, as each fragment of [[Kroni]] (evil or Devil) came into physical form, the Lord [[Vishnu]] incarnated as well, destroying them. However, in this the sixth yuga, the evil was called [[Kalineesan|Kali (\u0915\u0932\u093f)]] (n''ot the Hindu deity''){{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=206}}, and having no physical form (see [[Pre-Incarnational Events]] for this account) he occupied the mind of people of earth as the Mayai (illusion), causing them to behave discourteously.  [[Kalineesan|Kaliyan]] claimed, it was impossible to destroy him by the use of weapons in this [[yuga]] as in the previous ones as he held the [[Wiktionary:boon|boon]] from Supreme god Shiva, that is the reason [[Vishnu|Lord Narayan,]] to incarnate as \"pandaram\" in the world to destroy him.\n\nIn the name of Vaikundar, Lord came towards [[Swamithope|Swamithopu]] as Pantaram. [[Lord Vaikundar]] as a Pantaram, had donned himself in squalid rags, smeared the white mark on forehead, tied a turban on his head and carried a cane. Upon reaching [[Swamithope|Swamithopu]], he undertook a penance for 6 years to get grace and power of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. He got the power to abolish the rule of the evil force [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] from the world and for the subsequent end of [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]]. Lord did many mighty miracles. These incude, curing all the diseases for those people who came to get blessing from him. He baught eighteen-caste people together for peace and equality. [[Lord Vaikundar]] had five disciples (Citars). According to [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]], the [[Pandava|Pandavas]] of previous [[Dwapara yuga]] were made to take birth in this [[Kali Yuga|Kali yuga]] as [[Seedars|Citars]] of Vaikundar. The holy book [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] was compiled by his fifth citar - [[Hari Gopalan Citar|Hari Gopalan]] alias [[Sahadeva]].\n\nAccording to Akilam, Vaikundar is 10th avatar of [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]], also popularly called as \u201cNarayana Pantaram\u201d or \u201c[[Kalki]]\u201d alias \u201cAyya\u201d. Lord's avatar happens to be next to his [[Krishna]] avatar. In this avatar, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] incarnated as \u201cTrimurti\u201d alias \u201c[[Harihara|Siva Narayana]]\u201d. He had supreme power for the responsibility to destroy the evil of [[Kali|Kali (\u0915\u0932\u093f)]].\n\nAnother view is that [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]] did not take a human body and showed only a bodily appearance{{sfn|Thuvarakapathi||p=37}} to mankind based upon quotes in Akilam.{{sfn|Pathippakam|2004|p=112}}\n\n===Tavam===\n{{Main|Tavam of Vaikundar}}\n\nUpon reaching Poovantanthoppe, (present-day [[Swamithope]]), he undertook a penance. The penance consisted of three stages, each spanning two years. A tradition describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: during the first two years, he stood inside a six feet deep pit; during the next two years, he squatted on the ground; and during the last two years, he sat on a raised platform. His appearance was squalid, \"long and entangled plait of hair\" and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.<ref>{{harvnb|Patrick|2003|p=79}} ''He seems to have spoken less and subsisted on frugal meals.''</ref>\n\n===Supernatural Abilities===\n[[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] speaks of his incineration of evil spirits as an important event in Lord Ayya Vaikundar's incarnation. It took place when he was performing his penance, which he had announced to be the means of destroying the [[kalimayai]] - the illusory evil force. He gathered the people and caused some of them, both male and female, to be possessed of the evil spirits (peyattam).{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=80}} The possessed ones danced in front of the crowd as if the evil spirits had come upon them. Vaikundar, then, ordered these evil spirits to make an oath, in front of the people, to surrender their powers and incinerate themselves. When he had finished his orders, the dancers fell flat on the ground and burned.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=254-260}}\n\nSimilarly, Vaikundar performed another action to 'seize the esoteric evil powers'. [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] says that he took away the powers of those who knew to perform witchcraft, sorcery  and other magical rituals. People living in the hills, called as Kanikkarar, were believed to be powerful [[shaman]]s, having powers to contain or to provoke the demons. Vaikundar, in a trance, made some of them testify that they had surrendered their powers. People grew appreciative of Ayya's actions. They began addressing him as Vaikuntasami. This implied an attribution of divinity to Vaikundar.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=80}} [[Vaikundar]] exhorted the people as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\nThere are no demons, no devils.'' No ill effects of magical practices,<br />\nNo disease, no pain  and no extortion of taxes,<br />\nAnd, therefore, live courageously.''\n</blockquote>\n\n===Five Citars===\nLord Vaikundar has five disciples (citars). According to holy scripture [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu Ammanai]] the [[Pandavas]] of previous [[Dwapara Yukam]] was made to take birth in this [[Kali Yukam]] as [[Seedars|Citars]] of Vaikundar. They are [[Dharma Citar]], [[Bhima Citar]], [[Arjunan Citar]], [[Nakulan Citar]] and [[Sakatevan Citar]].\n\n==Vaikundar as Narayana Pandaram==\n[[File:Ayya Vaikundar Avatar.jpg|thumb|Vaikundar as Narayana Pantaram]]\nThe fame of Vaikundar began to spread in the countries of [[Travancore]] and [[Tirunelveli]]  and he was gradually recognised as a religious person with extraordinary powers.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}} He was addressed as a [[Pantaram]], a religious person hailing from  and serving the ordinary folk. [[Akilathirattu Ammanai|Akilathirattu]] addresses him as Narayana Pantaram.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=253}}\n\nPeople came to listen to his teachings and instructions, to be cured by him of different diseases, to witness, worship and serve a religious person. Vaikundar encouraged the people to come together around a well to take a ritual bath, irrespective of caste. He encouraged them to dine together in his presence.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=251}}[[File:Ayya's Holy Perambu and Surai koodu.jpg|thumb|right|The things used by Vaikundar; 'Surai Koodu', 'Pirambu' and 'Thandayam'.]]He stressed that he had come to abolish [[Kali Yukam]]  and to usher in an age of [[Dharma Yukam]], when the now-oppressed and suffering people would be liberated and rule the land under his leadership. 'Uplift of the lowly is dharmam\u2019{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p= 212}} was a constant refrain in his teachings.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}} People were encouraged to serve as catalysts for the destruction of [[Kaliyan|Kali]] by transforming themselves to be 'people of [[Dharma Yukam]]' and to acquire a new character. The new character would come upon them, he said, if they learned to live with self-respect, social dignity and fearlessness. Underscoring the importance of self-respect and social dignity, he said,  \u2018if one lives with dignity and self-respect, the kali would destroy itself\u2019 .   He said when people grew out of kalimayai, [[Dharma Yukam]] would unfold and in that age, he would rule over the people as [[Dharma Raja]], the king of [[Dharma Yukam]].\n\nAccording to the legend as per holy akilam, when [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was born, he got the boon from Supreme god [[Shiva]], which has more powers than compare to which he got on previous yuga's. When he was on the way to earth, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] was in the form of Pantaram stopped him and asked him to fight with. When [[Kali (demon)|Kaliyan]] was ignored, [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] asked him to promise, \"going forward i won't fight or distrupt any Pantaram. If i will do so, will lose everything  and will go to hell\".\n\nThat is the reason [[Vishnu|Lord Narayana]] has taken his tenth avatar on this [[Kali Yuga|kali yuga]] as Narayana Pantaram. \n{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=81}}\n\n==Arrest and imprisonment==\n{{See also|Ayyavazhi mythology#Vaikundar.27s trial|l1=Vaikundar's Trial}}\nHe made some controversial statements like mentioning the [[travancore]] king as \u2018Devil in Ananthapuri\u2019 and the British rule as \u2018Rule of White Devils\u2019. Against the background of the growing popularity of Vaikundar  and the convergence of people around him in multitudes, a complaint was lodged against him with the [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|king of Travancore]]. The [[Travancore]] king Swathi thirunal arrested Vaikundar in 1838 and imprisoned him at Singarathoppu jail in Travancore. After 110 days of imprisonment, on March 26, 1839 he was released by Swathithirunal on the advise of Thycaud Ayya who was the Guru of Swathi thirunal Maharaj and a disciple of Vaikundar as well.\n\n==Post-imprisonment ==\nAfter returning from the prison, Vaikundar inspired a group of his devotees to undertake a religious exercise called [[Thuvayal Thavasu]].{{sfn|Nadar|1989|pp= 290-298}}{{sfn|LMS Report|1838|p=71}} He also performed miracles. He married [[Saptha Kanniyar]] as [[Narayana]]r (see: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Seven Virgins|Marriage with the Seven Virgins]]), the [[Seven deities]] in the form of [[Ekam]] (see:[[Ayyavazhi mythology#Marriage with the Deities|Marriage with the Deities]]). He initiated festivities (see: [[Ayyavazhi mythology#Festivals and celebrations|Festivals and Celebrations]]).\" The deities were made to 'come upon' some of the female devotees who became their human media  and a marriage ceremony was performed.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p= 336-338}} Ceremonial processions were held amidst singing, incantations and shouts of joy by the followers. Several rites and rituals were instituted during these occasions.{{sfn|Patrick|2003|p=83}}\n\n==Lord Ayya Vaikundar at Vaikundam==\n{{Further|Ayyavazhi mythology#Ascending to Vaikundam.}}\n\nLater [[Lord Vaikundar]] was invited by his devotees to their homes and treated in a grand manner. By way of soliciting his blessings, his devotees carried him to different places. During these occasions, he laid foundations in various places for small shrine-like centres, called [[Nizhal Thangal]]s. [[Lord Vaikundar]] came to recognize five individuals as his closest disciples. Through one of his disciples, [[Hari Gopalan Citar]], he wrote the holy book, called [[Akilattirattu Ammanai|''Akilam'']].{{sfn|Pathippakam|2004|p=4}}\n\n[[Lord Vaikundar]] returned to Vaikundam on 3 June 1851. According to Ayyavazhi followers, he has returned to Vaikundam.{{sfn|Nadar|1989|p=}} However, this date is disputed, as Samuel Mateer mentions the year as 1848.{{sfn|Mateer|1871|p=222}} As he returned to Vaikundam, his body was interned in a tomb and, around that, a pati (temple) was later built. His devotees continued to visit this site  and performed the rituals as they used to do when Vaikundar was bodily present. His life and works remain the foundation of the Ayyavazhi. The head temple of the Ayyavazhi religion is the [[Swamithoppepathi]] and is located in the Village of [[Swamithope]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe film ''[[Ayyavazhi (film)|Ayyavazhi]]'' released in 2008 was based on the life of Lord Vaikundar.

It has its own elementary school which comes under [[Rondout School District 72]]. [[Illinois Route 176]] passes east\u2013west through Rondout, serving as the \"[[main street]]\" of the community, where it is also called \"Rockland Road\".<ref>{{cite news\n   |last=Carlstone|first=Linda Mae\n   |title=Since The Big Robbery, It's Been A Long Slide Into Oblivion\n   |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-05-12/features/9102110905_1_illinois-department-lake-forest-lake-county-museum\n   |accessdate=30 March 2017\n   |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]\n   |date=12 May 1991}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Rondout Community===\nBetween 1870 and 1872, the Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad (later the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]]; since 1985 the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] - CPR) completed a railroad line between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. In 1880, a branch line was built to [[Libertyville, Illinois]], and the new junction was known as '''Libertyville Junction'''. People referred to the community around the junction as '''Sulfur Glen''', due to the high amounts of [[sulphur]] in the water nearby. In 1888, the community was renamed '''Rondout''', after [[Rondout, New York]]. One account has the community renaming itself in an unsuccessful attempt to attract a business from the aforementioned town in New York. Another has a Sulfur Glen resident asking the railroad to rename the community after his former hometown.\n\nIn 1951, Peter Baker & Son Co. moved their [[asphalt]] plant from Lake Forest to Rondout, contributing to the development of the area.\n\n===History of Rondout and Railroads===\nAs noted above, the initial north-south and northwest three-way railroad junction was built in 1880 by a predecessor of the CPR, which still operates it.\n\nIn 1889, another railroad line was built that crossed the Milwaukee & St. Paul/CPR northeast-southwest at grade, just south of the first Rondout junction point. This new 1889 line was built by the [[Waukegan and Southwestern Railway]], then acquired shortly thereafter by the [[Elgin, Joliet & Eastern Railway]], which was in turn acquired in 2009 by the [[Canadian National Railway]] (CNR). The crossing and the freight interchange connecting the CNR newer line to what is now the CPR still exist as of 2017.  This new 1889 crossing necessitated the construction of an [[interlocking tower]] southeast of the expanded junction.\n\nThen, in 1902, the [[Chicago & Milwaukee Electric Railway]]'s branch to [[Mundelein, Illinois|Mundelein]] was built, parallel to Rockland Road and passing over the EJ&E and Milwaukee Road above grade, almost directly above the existing Rondout junction. In 1916, [[Samuel Insull]] purchased and reorganized the Chicago & Milwaukee as the [[Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee]], often called the North Shore Line. The North Shore Line's freight interchange with the Milwaukee Road, and its above-grade Rondout Station passenger platforms and shelters, survived until the entire North Shore Line went out of business in January, 1963.<ref name=CNSMRinColor1>{{cite book\n   |last=Doughty|first=Geoffrey H.\n   |title=Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway In Color - Volume 1: Streetcars & Electroburgers\n   |date=2006\n   |publisher=[[Morning Sun Books]]\n   |location=[[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]]\n   |isbn=978-1-58248-173-9\n   |pages=118\u2013119\n}}</ref><ref name=CNSMRinColor2>{{cite book\n   |last=Doughty|first=Geoffrey H.\n   |title=Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway In Color - Volume 2: Point of No Return\n   |date=2007\n   |publisher=Morning Sun Books\n   |location=Scotch Plains, New Jersey\n   |isbn=978-1-58248-197-5\n   |pages=70\u201371, 85, 90, 112\u2013113, 123\u2013124\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |url=http://library.lakeforest.edu/collections/railroad/nsl/bul107/177.html \n |title=[Map No.] 5 [excerpted from 1st edition of ''Routes of the Electroliners, Bulletin 107''] \n |pages=177 \n |publisher=Central Electric Railfans' Association \n |location=[[Chicago]] \n |date=1963 \n |accessdate=31 March 2017 \n |url-status=bot: unknown \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607175139/http://library.lakeforest.edu/collections/railroad/nsl/bul107/177.html \n |archivedate=7 June 2010 \n}}</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, Rondout junction's original grade-level interlocking tower was replaced by a brick structure.

In 1916, [[Samuel Insull]] purchased and reorganized the Chicago & Milwaukee as the [[Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee]], often called the North Shore Line. The North Shore Line's freight interchange with the Milwaukee Road, and its above-grade Rondout Station passenger platforms and shelters, survived until the entire North Shore Line went out of business in January, 1963.<ref name=CNSMRinColor1>{{cite book\n   |last=Doughty|first=Geoffrey H.\n   |title=Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway In Color - Volume 1: Streetcars & Electroburgers\n   |date=2006\n   |publisher=[[Morning Sun Books]]\n   |location=[[Scotch Plains, New Jersey]]\n   |isbn=978-1-58248-173-9\n   |pages=118\u2013119\n}}</ref><ref name=CNSMRinColor2>{{cite book\n   |last=Doughty|first=Geoffrey H.\n   |title=Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway In Color - Volume 2: Point of No Return\n   |date=2007\n   |publisher=Morning Sun Books\n   |location=Scotch Plains, New Jersey\n   |isbn=978-1-58248-197-5\n   |pages=70\u201371, 85, 90, 112\u2013113, 123\u2013124\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |url=http://library.lakeforest.edu/collections/railroad/nsl/bul107/177.html \n |title=[Map No.] 5 [excerpted from 1st edition of ''Routes of the Electroliners, Bulletin 107''] \n |pages=177 \n |publisher=Central Electric Railfans' Association \n |location=[[Chicago]] \n |date=1963 \n |accessdate=31 March 2017 \n |url-status=bot: unknown \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607175139/http://library.lakeforest.edu/collections/railroad/nsl/bul107/177.html \n |archivedate=7 June 2010 \n}}</ref>\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, Rondout junction's original grade-level interlocking tower was replaced by a brick structure.
