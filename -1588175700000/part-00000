His seven-volume ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'', published between 1955 and 1966 and consisting entirely of reproductions of his manuscript, has become the standard reference work to 214 of the [[fell]]s of the English [[Lake District]]. Among his 40-odd other books is the first guide to the [[Coast to Coast Walk]], a 192-mile [[long-distance footpath]] devised by Wainwright which remains popular today.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:AW's Memorial Window Tablet in St James' Church, Buttermere. - geograph.org.uk - 1307454.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque to Alfred Wainwright in [[Buttermere, Cumbria|Buttermere]] parish church]]\nAlfred Wainwright was born in [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]] into a family which was relatively poor, mostly because of his stonemason father's alcoholism.<ref>''Wainwright: The Man Who Loved the Lakes'', Martin Wainwright, BBC Books, {{ISBN|1448140714}}</ref> He did very well at school (first in nearly every subject)<ref>BBC 4 documentary, February 2007</ref> although he left at the age of 13. While most of his classmates were obliged to find employment in the local mills, Wainwright started work as an office boy in Blackburn Borough Engineer's Department. He spent several years studying at night school, gaining qualifications in accountancy which enabled him to further his career at Blackburn Borough Council. Even when a child Wainwright walked a great deal, up to 20&nbsp;miles at a time; he showed a great interest in drawing and [[cartography]], producing his own maps of England and his local area.\n\nIn 1930, at the age of 23, Wainwright saved up for a week's walking holiday in the [[Lake District]] with his cousin Eric Beardsall. They arrived in [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] and climbed the nearby [[Orrest Head]], where Wainwright saw his first view of the Lakeland [[fell]]s. This moment marked the start of what he later described as his love affair with the Lake District. In 1931 he married his first wife, Ruth Holden, a mill worker, with whom he had a son Peter. In 1941 Wainwright moved closer to the fells when he took a job (and a pay cut) at the Borough Treasurer's office in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]]. He lived and worked in the town for the rest of his life, serving as Borough Treasurer from 1948 until he retired in 1967. His first marriage ended when Ruth left three weeks before he retired (suspecting him of infidelity) and they divorced. In 1970 he married Betty McNally (1922\u20132008), a divorcee, who became his walking companion and who carried his ashes to [[Innominate Tarn]] at the top of [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]].<ref>A.

According to his biographer, [[Hunter Davies]], he left everything, including his house and royalty income, to Betty. His son Peter received nothing.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Hunter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mwtCXNiDAkMC&vq=Peter |title=Wainwright: The Biography |date=2013 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=9781409139669 |access-date=20 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Pictorial Guides==\n[[File:Eastern Fells cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Book One of the ''Pictorial Guide'']]\nWainwright started work on the first page of his ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'' on 9 November 1952.<ref>W.R. Mitchell, \"Solo walks and evening work: Wainwright remembered\" in Dave Hewitt (ed.), ''A Bit of Grit on Haystacks'' (Disley: Millrace, 2004), p. 23</ref> He planned the precise scope and content of the seven volumes and worked conscientiously and meticulously on the series for the next 13 years at an average rate of one page per evening.\n\nAccording to Wainwright, in his autobiography ''Fellwanderer'', he initially planned the series for his own interest rather than for publication. When he published his first book it was privately, as he could not face the prospect of finding a publisher. His friend Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, took charge of publicity and administration, and his name appears as publisher on the early impressions. Another friend, Sandy Hewitson (of Bateman and Hewitson Ltd) agreed to print the books using Wainwright's original manuscript, although the printing was done by the ''[[Westmorland Gazette]]'' in Kendal, who had taken over Bateman and Hewitson Ltd. From 1963, the Westmorland Gazette became his publisher, and its name appears on the first impressions of Books Six and Seven. Wainwright's books were in turn taken over by [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]] in the 1990s. When they ceased publication in 2003,<ref name=\"Wainwright guides are shelved\" /> the rights were bought by [[Frances Lincoln]].<ref name=BBC20030214 />\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, all the ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells|Pictorial Guides]]'' were updated for the first time, to take account of changed conditions on the fells. The revisions were made by [[Chris Jesty]], and the publishers used an imitation font of Wainwright's hand lettering to make the alterations look as unobtrusive as possible. The most notable changes were the inclusion of photographs of the Lake District by Derry Brabbs on the front covers, rather than the drawings that were on the covers of the originals, and footpaths shown in red on the maps. These revised versions are titled 'Second Editions'. Revised editions of Wainwright's other Pictorial Guides, ''[[Coast to Coast Walk|A Coast to Coast Walk]]'', ''[[The Outlying Fells of Lakeland]]'', ''Pennine Way Companion'', ''Walks in Limestone Country'' and ''Walks on the Howgill Fells'' were published by Frances Lincoln between 2010 and 2014, with the amendments again being made by Chris Jesty.\n\nThe publishers announced in 2014 that Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion, was working on the third edition of the ''Pictorial Guide'', with the first volume, ''The Eastern Fells'' published on 26 March 2015 followed by \"The Far Eastern Fells\" on 8 October 2015.

This was for many years a leading guide to the [[Pennine Way]], rivalling the official guide book by [[Tom Stephenson (activist)|Tom Stephenson]]. Wainwright's book consists of a continuous strip map of the route with accompanying commentary, with an unusual quirk: because the route goes from south to north (bottom to top on a map), contrary to normal reading order, the map and commentary start at the bottom of the last page and work upwards and backwards towards the front of the book. The guide was prepared with the aid of four helpers (Harry Appleyard, Len Chadwick, Cyril Moore and Lawrence Smith) and its preparation was affected by the major outbreaks of [[foot and mouth disease]] in 1966 and 1967, which closed access to many of the moors.\n\nIn 1972 Wainwright devised the west\u2013east [[Coast to Coast Walk]], as an alternative to the north-south Pennine Way. The Coast to Coast, he declares in his guidebook, which follows the same format as the ''Pennine Way Companion'', \"puts the Pennine Way to shame\" for scenic beauty, variety and interest.<ref>A. Wainwright, ''A Coast to Coast Walk'' (London: Frances Lincoln, [1973] 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-7112-2236-6}}</ref> The 190-mile route traverses the north of England from [[St. Bees]] to [[Robin Hood's Bay]], passing through the Lake District, the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and the [[North York Moors]] [[National parks of England and Wales|national parks]].\n\n''[[The Outlying Fells of Lakeland]]'' (an idea he had previously rejected), published in 1974, was his last major guidebook. Thereafter he concentrated on sketchbooks of larger-size line drawings until his eyesight began to fail in the mid-1980s.  His ''Ex-Fellwanderer'', an autobiographical work published in 1987, was intended to be his last written work, but he continued to lend his name and some written commentary to a series of \"[[coffee table books]]\" featuring the photography of Derry Brabbs.\n\n==Television and radio==\nBy the mid-1980s Wainwright was a TV personality; he featured in three television series for the [[BBC]], presented by farmer and broadcaster [[Eric Robson]] and devised, directed and produced by Richard Else.\n\nA BBC documentary about Wainwright's life was broadcast on Sunday 25 February 2007 on [[BBC Four]], before a four-part series of walks.  This first series covered [[Blencathra]] by Sharp Edge, [[Castle Crag]], [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]] and [[Scafell Pike]] from [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006yl97/episodes/guide |title=BBC Four - Wainwright Walks - Episode guide |website=BBC |access-date=3 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe second series, broadcast in 2007, included [[Catbells]], [[Crinkle Crags]], [[Helm Crag]], [[Helvellyn]] from Patterdale, [[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]] from Mardale and [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]].

His seven-volume ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'', published between 1955 and 1966 and consisting entirely of reproductions of his manuscript, has become the standard reference work to 214 of the [[fell]]s of the English [[Lake District]]. Among his 40-odd other books is the first guide to the [[Coast to Coast Walk]], a 192-mile [[long-distance footpath]] devised by Wainwright which remains popular today.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:AW's Memorial Window Tablet in St James' Church, Buttermere. - geograph.org.uk - 1307454.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque to Alfred Wainwright in [[Buttermere, Cumbria|Buttermere]] parish church]]\nAlfred Wainwright was born in [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]] into a family which was relatively poor, mostly because of his stonemason father's alcoholism.<ref>''Wainwright: The Man Who Loved the Lakes'', Martin Wainwright, BBC Books, {{ISBN|1448140714}}</ref> He did very well at school (first in nearly every subject)<ref>BBC 4 documentary, February 2007</ref> although he left at the age of 13. While most of his classmates were obliged to find employment in the local mills, Wainwright started work as an office boy in Blackburn Borough Engineer's Department. He spent several years studying at night school, gaining qualifications in accountancy which enabled him to further his career at Blackburn Borough Council. Even when a child Wainwright walked a great deal, up to 20&nbsp;miles at a time; he showed a great interest in drawing and [[cartography]], producing his own maps of England and his local area.\n\nIn 1930, at the age of 23, Wainwright saved up for a week's walking holiday in the [[Lake District]] with his cousin Eric Beardsall. They arrived in [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]] and climbed the nearby [[Orrest Head]], where Wainwright saw his first view of the Lakeland [[fell]]s. This moment marked the start of what he later described as his love affair with the Lake District. In 1931 he married his first wife, Ruth Holden, a mill worker, with whom he had a son Peter. In 1941 Wainwright moved closer to the fells when he took a job (and a pay cut) at the Borough Treasurer's office in [[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]]. He lived and worked in the town for the rest of his life, serving as Borough Treasurer from 1948 until he retired in 1967. His first marriage ended when Ruth left three weeks before he retired (suspecting him of infidelity) and they divorced. In 1970 he married Betty McNally (1922\u20132008), a divorcee, who became his walking companion and who carried his ashes to [[Innominate Tarn]] at the top of [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]].<ref>A.

According to his biographer, [[Hunter Davies]], he left everything, including his house and royalty income, to Betty. His son Peter received nothing.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Hunter |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mwtCXNiDAkMC&vq=Peter |title=Wainwright: The Biography |date=2013 |publisher=Hachette |isbn=9781409139669 |access-date=20 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Pictorial Guides==\n[[File:Eastern Fells cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Book One of the ''Pictorial Guide'']]\nWainwright started work on the first page of his ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells]]'' on 9 November 1952.<ref>W.R. Mitchell, \"Solo walks and evening work: Wainwright remembered\" in Dave Hewitt (ed.), ''A Bit of Grit on Haystacks'' (Disley: Millrace, 2004), p. 23</ref> He planned the precise scope and content of the seven volumes and worked conscientiously and meticulously on the series for the next 13 years at an average rate of one page per evening.\n\nAccording to Wainwright, in his autobiography ''Fellwanderer'', he initially planned the series for his own interest rather than for publication. When he published his first book it was privately, as he could not face the prospect of finding a publisher. His friend Henry Marshall, Chief Librarian of Kendal and Westmorland, took charge of publicity and administration, and his name appears as publisher on the early impressions. Another friend, Sandy Hewitson (of Bateman and Hewitson Ltd) agreed to print the books using Wainwright's original manuscript, although the printing was done by the ''[[Westmorland Gazette]]'' in Kendal, who had taken over Bateman and Hewitson Ltd. From 1963, the Westmorland Gazette became his publisher, and its name appears on the first impressions of Books Six and Seven. Wainwright's books were in turn taken over by [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]] in the 1990s. When they ceased publication in 2003,<ref name=\"Wainwright guides are shelved\" /> the rights were bought by [[Frances Lincoln]].<ref name=BBC20030214 />\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, all the ''[[Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells|Pictorial Guides]]'' were updated for the first time, to take account of changed conditions on the fells. The revisions were made by [[Chris Jesty]], and the publishers used an imitation font of Wainwright's hand lettering to make the alterations look as unobtrusive as possible. The most notable changes were the inclusion of photographs of the Lake District by Derry Brabbs on the front covers, rather than the drawings that were on the covers of the originals, and footpaths shown in red on the maps. These revised versions are titled 'Second Editions'. Revised editions of Wainwright's other Pictorial Guides, ''[[Coast to Coast Walk|A Coast to Coast Walk]]'', ''[[The Outlying Fells of Lakeland]]'', ''Pennine Way Companion'', ''Walks in Limestone Country'' and ''Walks on the Howgill Fells'' were published by Frances Lincoln between 2010 and 2014, with the amendments again being made by Chris Jesty.\n\nThe publishers announced in 2014 that Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion, was working on the third edition of the ''Pictorial Guide'', with the first volume, ''The Eastern Fells'' published on 26 March 2015 followed by \"The Far Eastern Fells\" on 8 October 2015.

This was for many years a leading guide to the [[Pennine Way]], rivalling the official guide book by [[Tom Stephenson (activist)|Tom Stephenson]]. Wainwright's book consists of a continuous strip map of the route with accompanying commentary, with an unusual quirk: because the route goes from south to north (bottom to top on a map), contrary to normal reading order, the map and commentary start at the bottom of the last page and work upwards and backwards towards the front of the book. The guide was prepared with the aid of four helpers (Harry Appleyard, Len Chadwick, Cyril Moore and Lawrence Smith) and its preparation was affected by the major outbreaks of [[foot and mouth disease]] in 1966 and 1967, which closed access to many of the moors.\n\nIn 1972 Wainwright devised the west-east [[Coast to Coast Walk]], as an alternative to the north-south Pennine Way. The Coast to Coast, he declares in his guidebook, which follows the same format as the ''Pennine Way Companion'', \"puts the Pennine Way to shame\" for scenic beauty, variety and interest.<ref>A. Wainwright, ''A Coast to Coast Walk'' (London: Frances Lincoln, [1973] 2003). {{ISBN|978-0-7112-2236-6}}</ref> The 190-mile route traverses the north of England from [[St. Bees]] to [[Robin Hood's Bay]], passing through the Lake District, the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and the [[North York Moors]] [[National parks of England and Wales|national parks]].\n\n''[[The Outlying Fells of Lakeland]]'' (an idea he had previously rejected), published in 1974, was his last major guidebook. Thereafter he concentrated on sketchbooks of larger-size line drawings until his eyesight began to fail in the mid-1980s.  His ''Ex-Fellwanderer'', an autobiographical work published in 1987, was intended to be his last written work, but he continued to lend his name and some written commentary to a series of \"[[coffee table books]]\" featuring the photography of Derry Brabbs.\n\n==Television and radio==\nBy the mid-1980s Wainwright was a TV personality; he featured in three television series for the [[BBC]], presented by farmer and broadcaster [[Eric Robson]] and devised, directed and produced by Richard Else.\n\nA BBC documentary about Wainwright's life was broadcast on Sunday 25 February 2007 on [[BBC Four]], before a four-part series of walks.  This first series covered [[Blencathra]] by Sharp Edge, [[Castle Crag]], [[Haystacks (Lake District)|Haystacks]] and [[Scafell Pike]] from [[Seathwaite, Allerdale|Seathwaite]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006yl97/episodes/guide |title=BBC Four - Wainwright Walks - Episode guide |website=BBC |access-date=3 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe second series, broadcast in 2007, included [[Catbells]], [[Crinkle Crags]], [[Helm Crag]], [[Helvellyn]] from Patterdale, [[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]] from Mardale and [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]].
