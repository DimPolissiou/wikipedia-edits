Finding himself ethically opposed to bioengineering, he began to travel and research the politics of food, and work as an artist in London, Ontario.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1979, he worked as a brakeman and conductor on the Norfolk and Western (Wabash) Railway, and was a member of the United Transportation Union. In 1973 he began to travel frequently in Mexico, Central & South America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In March 1980, he attended the World Conference of Indigenous Peoples, in Ollantaytambo, Peru, as an official artist/observer.\n\nFrom 1975 through 1981, Ron was a member of the Forest City Artists' Association, and was manager of the [[Forest City Gallery]] in 1980\u201381. In 1983 he co-founded the Embassy Cultural House and served on the board until 1990. Co-organized the M\u00e9rida/London exchange (1980/81), as well as the Havana/London exchange (1988). In 1989 he was an artist/observer of the 3rd [[Havana Biennial]].\n\nIn 2000 he was awarded the Canada Council Studio in Paris.\n\nIn 2010 he was appointed Adjunct Research Professor in the Visual Arts Department, [[University of Western Ontario|Western University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vac.ca/ronbenner.html|title=Ron Benner - Trans/mission: Barley-Corn-Maize|website=Visual Arts Centre of Clarington|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis mixed media photographic installations are in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] (The University of Toronto), [[Museum London]] (London, Ontario), McIntosh Gallery (The University of Western Ontario), The Canada Council Art Bank and the [[Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas|Casa de Las Americas]] (Havana, Cuba).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cacnart.com/ron-benner|title=Ron Benner|website=cacnart|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\n== Selected solo exhibitions ==\n\n* 2019 \u00a0''Trans/mission: Barley \u2013 Corn \u2013 Maize'', Visual Arts Centre of Clarington, Bowmanville, ON, a year-long site-specific installation responding to the architecture and history of the former barley mill, curator Sandy Saad<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vac.ca/ronbenner.html|title=Ron Benner - Trans/mission: Barley-Corn-Maize|website=Visual Arts Centre of Clarington|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2017-  ''Trans/mission: Native to the Americas,'' permanent photographic/garden installation, sunken garden of the Wilfrid Laurier Library, organized by the Robert Langen Art Gallery, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, ON<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.wlu.ca/events/exhibition-transend-meeting-room|title=Exhibition: Transend: Meeting Room|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* 2017 \u00a0''Transend: Meeting Room'', Robert Langen Art Gallery, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Waterloo, ON, curator Suzanne Luke<ref name=\":2\" />\n* 2016/17 ''Trans/mission: 101,'' photographic/garden installation, [https://kwag.ca/ Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery], Kitchener, ON, curator Crystal Mowry presented in concert with CAFKA 16 (Contemporary Art Forum Kitchener Area)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kwag.ca/content/ron-benner-transmission-101|title=Ron Benner // Trans/mission: 101|last=smitchell|date=2017-05-17|website=kwag.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2015\u00a0''Ron Benner: 3 Questions'', McIntosh Gallery, Western University, London, ON, curator Julian Haladyn<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcintoshgallery.ca/exhibitions/past/2015.html|title=2015|website=mcintoshgallery.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2015  ''All That Has Value'', 3 guerrilla garden installations, in collaboration with CUPE, London, ON\n* 2015 \u00a0''In Digestion'', [[Museum London]], London, ON<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://museumlondon.ca/exhibitions/in-digestion|title=Exhibitions - Museum London|website=museumlondon.ca|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2013\u00a0 ''Insubstantial Equivalence'', photographic/garden installation, curator Peter Dykhuis, on the university campus in partnership with the agricultural faculty and the Dalhousie Art Gallery, Halifax, NS<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/news/2013/10/03/food-for-thought.html|title=Food for thought|website=Dalhousie News|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n* 2012-15 \u00a0''Cuitlacoche \u2013 Your\u00a0 Disease Our Delicacy'',\u00a0 photographic/garden installation, curator Su Ying\u00a0 Lee, Hart House and Justina M.

All major television stations in the Czech Republic featured breaking news announcements and commemorative programs in their schedules, and Czech Radio and Radio Impuls also adapted their scheduled broadcasts. At an extraordinary meeting on 2 October, the government approved a state funeral and declared the day of the funeral a national day of mourning. A day later, [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Andrej Babi\u0161]] withdrew the proposal for a state funeral, saying that it should only be a funeral with state honours, as in the case of [[Otakar Motejl]] in 2010. At the presidential chateau in L\u00e1ny, the Presidential flags were flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning, but according to the former proto-logger Jind\u0159ich Forejt, this violated the law on the use of state symbols of the Czech Republic. The public commemorative ceremony was held on Friday, 11 October 2019 at 8am in Prague's [[\u017dof\u00edn Palace]]. Gott's fans travelled from various places in the Czech Republic and Germany and waited for several hours in the five-kilometer queue to the palace. The ceremony ended at midnight, by which time around 49,000 mourners had paid respects at his coffin. The funeral mass with state honours was held at [[Saint Vitus Cathedral]] on Saturday, 12 October, presided over by the [[Archbishop of Prague]], Cardinal [[Dominik Duka]]. A day of national mourning was declared on the same day.

At the presidential chateau in L\u00e1ny, the Presidential flags were flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning, but according to the former proto-logger Jind\u0159ich Forejt, this violated the law on the use of state symbols of the Czech Republic.

The funeral mass with state honours was held at [[Saint Vitus Cathedral]] on Saturday, 12 October, presided over by the [[Archbishop of Prague]], Cardinal [[Dominik Duka]].

The episode aired on April 5, 2020. It was written by Jordan Goldberg and [[Lisa Joy]], and directed by [[Paul Cameron (cinematographer)|Paul Cameron]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:TVPLOT, plot summaries for episode articles should have no more than 400 words. -->\nWilliam is tormented by nightmares of killing his daughter Emily in Westworld, thinking she was a host. Charlotte wakes William up, needing him to be present at a Delos board meeting to protect the company from Serac. William cleans himself up, and wards off another vision of Emily by telling her it was a conscious decision to kill her. As he leaves, Charlotte comments on his visions of Emily, shocking him.\n\nBelieving Dolores has swapped Liam with a host, Bernard and Ashley prepare to infiltrate a private charity event in Los Angeles to abduct Liam. Dolores and Caleb make similar plans after transferring all of Liam's funds out of his account. At the event, Bernard and Ashley grab Liam after he discovers his funds have been lost, but quickly learn Liam is not a host. Bernard runs off with Liam as Caleb chases them down, while Dolores fights with Ashley. Bernard is approached by Martin and Liam's bodyguards, and Bernard realizes Martin is the host when Martin kills the guards. Liam flees, followed by Caleb.\n\nSerac again urges Maeve to help find Dolores, as not only does she hold the encryption key to the Delos data, but also to the Sublime to reunite Maeve with her daughter. He claims that Delos' secret project of mapping of the human mind can improve Rehoboam and prevent humanity from destroying itself after his native [[Paris]] was destroyed in a nuclear blast. He knows Dolores had brought five host control modules, \"pearls\", and coerces an [[Information broker|identity broker]] to reveal a lead to a Singapore [[organ trade]] doctor named the Mortician with ties to the [[Yakuza]]. The Mortician directs her to the Yakuza's headquarters, and after quickly dispatching the guards, Maeve meets the Yakuza leader, Sato, recognizing him as the Musashi host from Shogun World.\n\nWilliam, Bernard, and Maeve all recognize that Charlotte, Martin, and Sato are all hosts with copies of Dolores' pearl. Dolores, via Sato, tells Maeve that she needs to duplicate herself to prevent Serac from stopping her before critically wounding Maeve. William lashes out at Charlotte on his discovery, and Charlotte has him committed to a mental institution, where he has visions of Dolores as he remembered her from the park. Martin takes Bernard to meet up with Caleb who has cornered Liam, and are soon joined by Dolores, whom Liam recognizes as Lara, the girlfriend he had thought dead.\n\n==Production==\nThis episode reveals that there are at least three additional copies of the Dolores host in addition to the one played by [[Evan Rachel Wood]], with these residing in the hosts of Charlotte Hale (played by [[Tessa Thompson]]), Martin Conells ([[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]) and Sato ([[Hiroyuki Sanada]]). Showrunner [[Jonathan Nolan]] said that they had purposely avoided the idea of digital clones in the first two seasons of ''Westworld'', as they felt it would be too early to introduce how such copies would reflect on the nature of hosts while they were still exploring the nature of sentience. With the third season, they were ready to explore this more, and consider concepts such as the nature of how identity would develop and change based on the situation and environment around the host.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-3-episode-4-mother-exiles-explained-1288618 |title='Westworld' Creators on That Game-Changing Season 3 Twist: \"It's a Very Dangerous Idea\" |first=Josh |last=Wigler |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> Wood said that this was partially clued to the audience by the use of blue in the costuming for Charlotte, Martin, and Sato.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/westworld-evan-rachel-wood-interview-season-3-episode-4-spoilers-pearls-halores-dolores-1202900676/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019: Who\u2019s Inside Those Pearls?

In the second season, Thompson had only been told the evening before her first scenes in the Charlotte-as-Dolores part, so did not have as much time to prepare.

The episode aired on April 5, 2020. It was written by Jordan Goldberg and [[Lisa Joy]], and directed by [[Paul Cameron (cinematographer)|Paul Cameron]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:TVPLOT, plot summaries for episode articles should have no more than 400 words. -->\nWilliam is tormented by nightmares of killing his daughter Emily in Westworld, thinking she was a host. Charlotte wakes William up, needing him to be present at a Delos board meeting to protect the company from Serac. William cleans himself up, and wards off another vision of Emily by telling her it was a conscious decision to kill her. As he leaves, Charlotte comments on his visions of Emily, shocking him.\n\nBelieving Dolores has swapped Liam with a host, Bernard and Ashley prepare to infiltrate a private charity event in Los Angeles to abduct Liam. Dolores and Caleb make similar plans after transferring all of Liam's funds out of his account. At the event, Bernard and Ashley grab Liam after he discovers his funds have been lost, but quickly learn Liam is not a host. Bernard runs off with Liam as Caleb chases them down, while Dolores fights with Ashley. Bernard is approached by Martin and Liam's bodyguards, and Bernard realizes Martin is the host when Martin kills the guards. Liam flees, followed by Caleb.\n\nSerac again urges Maeve to help find Dolores, as not only does she hold the encryption key to the Delos data, but also to the Sublime to reunite Maeve with her daughter. He claims that Delos' secret project of mapping of the human mind can improve Rehoboam and prevent humanity from destroying itself after his native [[Paris]] was destroyed in a nuclear blast. He knows Dolores had brought five host control modules, \"pearls\", and coerces an [[Information broker|identity broker]] to reveal a lead to a Singapore [[organ trade]] doctor named the Mortician with ties to the [[Yakuza]]. The Mortician directs her to the Yakuza's headquarters, and after quickly dispatching the guards, Maeve meets the Yakuza leader, Sato, recognizing him as the Musashi host from Shogun World.\n\nWilliam, Bernard, and Maeve all recognize that Charlotte, Martin, and Sato are all hosts with copies of Dolores' pearl. Dolores, via Sato, tells Maeve that she needs to duplicate herself to prevent Serac from stopping her before critically wounding Maeve. William lashes out at Charlotte on his discovery, and Charlotte has him committed to a mental institution, where he has visions of Dolores as he remembered her from the park. Martin takes Bernard to meet up with Caleb who has cornered Liam, and are soon joined by Dolores, whom Liam recognizes as Lara, the girlfriend he had thought dead.\n\n==Production==\nThis episode reveals that there are at least three additional copies of the Dolores host in addition to the one played by [[Evan Rachel Wood]], with these residing in the hosts of Charlotte Hale (played by [[Tessa Thompson]]), Martin Conells ([[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]) and Sato ([[Hiroyuki Sanada]]). Showrunner [[Jonathan Nolan]] said that they had purposely avoided the idea of digital clones in the first two seasons of ''Westworld'', as they felt it would be too early to introduce how such copies would reflect on the nature of hosts while they were still exploring the nature of sentience. With the third season, they were ready to explore this more, and consider concepts such as the nature of how identity would develop and change based on the situation and environment around the host.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-3-episode-4-mother-exiles-explained-1288618 |title='Westworld' Creators on That Game-Changing Season 3 Twist: \"It's a Very Dangerous Idea\" |first=Josh |last=Wigler |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> Wood said that this was partially clued to the audience by the use of blue in the costuming for Charlotte, Martin, and Sato.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/04/westworld-evan-rachel-wood-interview-season-3-episode-4-spoilers-pearls-halores-dolores-1202900676/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019: Who\u2019s Inside Those Pearls?
