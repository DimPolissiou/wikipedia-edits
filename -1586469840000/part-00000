His parents were Filippo Pacelli (1837\u20131916) and Virginia (n\u00e9e Graziosi) Pacelli (1844\u20131920). His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli, had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances<ref>Pollard, 2005, p. 70</ref> and then Secretary of the Interior under [[Pope Pius IX]] from 1851 to 1870 and helped found the Vatican's newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' in 1861.<ref>Marchione, 2004, p. 1</ref><ref>Gerard Noel, Pius XII:The Hound of Hitler, p. 5</ref> His cousin, [[Ernesto Pacelli]], was a key financial advisor to [[Pope Leo XIII]]; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a [[Franciscan]] [[Third order|tertiary]],<ref>O'Brien, p. 1</ref> was the dean of the [[Roman Rota]]; and his brother, [[Francesco Pacelli]], became a [[Laity|lay]] [[canon law]]yer and the legal advisor to [[Pope Pius XI]], in which role he negotiated the [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929 with [[Benito Mussolini]], bringing an end to the [[Roman Question]].\n\nTogether with his brother Francesco and his two sisters, Giuseppina and Elisabetta, he grew up in the [[Parione]] district in the centre of Rome. Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880 he began school at the convent of the French [[Sisters of Divine Providence]] in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]]. Eugenio and the other children made their [[First Communion]] at this church and Eugenio served there as an [[altar boy]] from 1886. In 1886 too he was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the [[Piazza Venezia]].<ref>Paul O'Shea, A Cross Too Heavy, 2011, p. 79</ref> In 1891 Pacelli's father sent Eugenio to the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute, a state school situated in what had been the [[Collegio Romano]], the premier Jesuit university in Rome.\n\nIn 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome's oldest seminary, the [[Almo Collegio Capranica]],<ref>O'Shea, p. 81</ref> and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] and theology at the [[Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare]]. He was also enrolled at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|State University, La Sapienza]] where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame.<ref>Cornwell, p. 22</ref> Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899 he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in [[Latin]].<ref>Cornwell, p. 23</ref>\n\n==Church career==\n\n===Priest and Monsignor===\n[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Pacelli on the day of his ordination: 2 April 1899]]\nWhile all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]],<ref name=\"Gerard Noel, p.9\">Noel, p. 9</ref> Pacelli was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest on [[Easter Sunday]], 2 April 1899 alone in the private chapel of a family friend the [[Vicegerent]] of Rome, [[Francesco di Paola Cassetta|Mgr Paolo Cassetta]]. Shortly after ordination he began postgraduate studies in canon law at Sant'Apollinaire. He received his first assignment as a [[curate]] at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].<ref name=\"marchione193\">Marchione, 2000, p. 193</ref> In 1901 he entered the [[Section for Relations with States (Roman Curia)|Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], a sub-office of the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Vatican Secretariat of State]].<ref>O'Shea, p. 82</ref>\n\nMonsignor [[Pietro Gasparri]], the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs, had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to work in the \"Vatican's equivalent of the Foreign office\" by highlighting the \"necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe\".<ref name=\"Gerard Noel, p. 10\">Noel, p. 10</ref> Pacelli became an ''apprendista'', an apprentice, in Gasparri's department. In January 1901 he was also chosen, by Pope Leo XIII himself, according to an official account, to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to King [[Edward VII]] of the UK after the death of [[Queen Victoria]].<ref name=\"marchione9\">Marchione, 2004, p. 9</ref>\n[[File:MarrydelValpacelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|The Serbian Concordat, 24 June 1914.

The theme of his thesis was the nature of [[concordats]] and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of ''minutante'', he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a [[papal chamberlain]]. In 1905 he received the title [[Domestic Prelate|domestic prelate]].<ref name=\"marchione193\"/> From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal Pietro Gasparri in his codification of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs.<ref name=\"marchione10\">Marchione, 2004, p. 10</ref> According to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] \"the text, together with the [[Anti-Modernist Oath]], became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church\".<ref>Cornwell, ''Hitler's Pope'', p. 42</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the [[International Eucharistic Congress]], accompanying [[Rafael Merry del Val]]<ref>Cornwell, p. 32</ref> to London,<ref name=\"marchione9\"/> where he met [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>Dalin, 2005, p. 47</ref> In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of King [[George V]].<ref name=\"marchione10\"/>\nPacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under [[Pope Pius X]] and retained under [[Pope Benedict XV]]), and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in February 1914.<ref name=\"marchione10\"/> On 24 June 1914, just four days before [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was assassinated in [[Sarajevo]], Pacelli, together with [[Cardinal Merry del Val]], represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed. [[Serbia]]'s success in the [[First Balkan War]] against [[Turkey]] in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging [[Austria-Hungary]]'s sphere of influence throughout the [[Balkans]]. Pius X died on 20 August 1914. His successor Benedict XV named Gasparri as secretary of state and Gasparri took Pacelli with him into the Secretariat of State, making him undersecretary.<ref>O'Shea, pp. 86, 88</ref> During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and worked to implement papal relief initiatives. In 1915, he travelled to [[Vienna]] to assist Monsignor [[Raffaele Scapinelli di L\u00e9guigno|Raffaele Scapinelli]], [[nuncio]] to Vienna, in his negotiations with Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] regarding Italy.<ref>Levillain, 2002, p. 1211</ref>\n\n===Archbishop and Papal nuncio===\n{{Main article|Nunciature of Eugenio Pacelli}}\n[[File:PioXIIgernamia1917.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Pacelli at the Headquarters of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]]]\nPope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria|nuncio to Bavaria]] on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as [[titular bishop|titular]] [[See of Sardis|Archbishop of Sardis]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 13 May 1917. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for [[Bavaria]]. As there was no nuncio to [[Prussia]] or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the [[German Empire]].\n\nOnce in [[Munich]], he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities.<ref>Fatoni, 1992, pp. 45\u201385</ref> He met with [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III]] on 29 May, and later with [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]<ref name=\"marchione11\">Marchione, 2004, p. 11</ref> and Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann-Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September.\n\nSister Pascalina later recalled that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned a \"deaf ear to all his proposals\". She later wrote, \"Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the [[Rhine]] with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well'. I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right.\"<ref>Lehnert (2014), pages 5-6.</ref>\n\nFor the remainder of the Great War, Pacelli concentrated on Benedict's humanitarian efforts<ref>Rychlak, 2000, p. 6</ref> especially among Allied POWs in German custody.<ref>Lehnert (2014), 6-7.</ref> In the upheaval following the Armistice, a disconcerted Pacelli sought Benedict XV's permission to leave Munich, where [[Kurt Eisner]] had formed the [[Free State of Bavaria]], and he left for a while to [[Rorschach, St. Gallen|Rorschach]], and a tranquil Swiss sanatorium run by nuns. Monsignor Schioppa, the ''uditore'', was left in Munich.<ref>Cornwell, p. 73</ref>\n\n\"His recovery began with a 'rapport{{'\"}} with the 24-year-old Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]]\u2014she would soon be transferred to Munich when Pacelli \"pulled strings at the highest level\".<ref>Noel, p. 34</ref>\n\nWhen he returned to Munich, following Eisner's assassination by an anti-Semitic extreme nationalist, [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley|Count Anton von Arco auf Valley]], he informed Gasparri-using Schioppa's eye-witness testimony of the chaotic scene at the former royal palace as the trio of [[Max Levien]], [[Eugen Levine]], and [[Towia Axelrod]] sought power: \"the scene was indescribable [-] the confusion totally chaotic [-] in the midst of all this, a gang of young women, of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them hanging around [-] the boss of this female rabble was Levien's mistress, a young Russian woman, a Jew and a divorc\u00e9e [-] and it was to her that the nunciature was obliged to pay homage in order to proceed [-] Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, vulgar, repulsive ...\" John Cornwell alleges that a worrying impression of anti-Semitism is discernible in the \"catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness\" and Pacelli's \"constant harping on the Jewishness of this party of power usurpers\" chimed with the \"growing and widespread belief among Germans that the Jews were the instigators of the Bolshevik revolution, their principal aim being the destruction of Christian civilization\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 75</ref> Also according to Cornwell, Pacelli informed Gasparri that \"the capital of Bavaria, is suffering under a harsh Jewish-Russian revolutionary tyranny\".<ref>{{cite book|author=John Cornwell|title=Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFHKrYwv87sC&pg=PA78|year=2000|publisher=Penguin|page=78|isbn=9780140296273}}</ref>\n[[File:PacelliBavaria1922a.JPG|thumb|right|145px|Pacelli in Bavaria, 1922]]\n\nAccording to Sister Pascalina Lehnert, the Nuncio was repeatedly threatened by emissaries of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Once, in a violation of international law, the Bavarian Revolutionary Government attempted to confiscate the Nunciature's car at gunpoint. Despite their demands, however, Pacelli refused to leave his post.<ref>Lehnert (2014), pages 7-8.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Munich Soviet Republic]] was defeated and toppled by [[Freikorps]] and [[Reichswehr]] troops, the Nuncio focused on, according to Lehnert, \"alleviating the distress of the postwar period, consoling, supporting all in word and deed\".<ref>Lehnert (2014), page 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00535, Bamberg, 900 Jahr-Feier der Stadt.jpg|thumb|left|Nuncio Pacelli in July 1924 at the 900th anniversary of the City of [[Bamberg]]]]\nPacelli was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Germany]] on 23 June 1920, and\u2014after the completion of a Bavarian concordat\u2014his nunciature was moved to Berlin in August 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff stayed with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor [[Robert Leiber]] and Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]]\u2014housekeeper, cook, friend, and adviser for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. He was aided by the German priest [[Ludwig Kaas]], who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was a full-time politician, politically active in the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], a party he led following [[Wilhelm Marx]]'s resignation in October 1928.<ref>Volk, 1972; Cornwell, p. 96</ref> While in Germany, he travelled to all regions, attended [[Katholikentag]] (national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people.<ref>Kaas, 1930.</ref> In Berlin he lived in the [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Tiergarten]] quarter and threw parties for the official and diplomatic elite. [[Paul von Hindenburg]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], and other members of the Cabinet were regular guests.\n\n[[File:Future Pope Pius XII visits Dorstfeld Mines in 1927 Germany.jpg|thumb|Nuncio Pacelli visits the coal mine Dorstfeld on the occasion of the ''[[Katholikentag]]'' in [[Dortmund]] in 1927 Germany]]\n\nIn post-war Germany, in the absence of a nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister [[Georgi Chicherin]], who rejected any kind of religious education, the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.<ref>Stehle, 1975, pp. 139\u201341</ref>\n\nDespite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until [[Pius XI]] ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar region]], supported the appointment of a papal administrator for [[Danzig]] and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland.<ref>Morsey, p. 121</ref> A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929.

In 1935, Pacelli was named [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]].\n\nAs Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a [[Baden]] Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, [[Conrad Gr\u00f6ber]], the new [[Archbishop of Freiburg]], and the treaty was signed in August\n1932.<ref>Kent, 2002, p. 24</ref> Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1935) and Portugal (1940). The [[Lateran treaties]] with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Catholic Popular Party]], in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged [[Catholic Action]], \"an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing\". It was permitted only so long as it developed \"its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 115</ref> Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services.

The state concordats were necessary because the German [[federalism|federalist]] Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk, Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', p. 539</ref><ref>Donald J.

However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the Church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933.<ref>Volk, pp. 539\u2013544</ref> A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922\u20131932.<ref>They included: Latvia 1922, Bavaria 1925, Poland 1925, France I., 1926, France II. 1926, Lithuania 1927, Czechoslovakia 1928, Portugal I 1928, Italy I 1929, Italy II 1929, Portugal II 1929, Romania I 1927, Prussia 1929, Romania II 1932, Baden 1932, Germany 1933, Austria 1933.

It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the Church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (\u00a731), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.<ref>Ludwig Volk, \"Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern\" in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', pp. 546\u2013547</ref>\n\nAs [[nuncio]] during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.<ref>Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20.

Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]''. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual [[Latin]] of official Catholic Church documents.

Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It exposed the fallacy and denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil; it decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the F\u00fchrer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance'.

After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.\n\nHis [[Papal Coronation|coronation]] took place on 12 March 1939.

Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later [[Pope Paul VI]]) and [[Domenico Tardini]]. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.<ref>Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and Congregation of Ordinary Affairs</ref> Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals,<ref>Pio XII, ''La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953'' in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita Vatican City, 1953, p. 455</ref> an honor which both turned down.<ref>Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 157</ref> They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.<ref>Giulio Nicolini, Il Cardinale Domenico Tardini, Padova, 1980; {{ISBN|88-7026-340-1}}; p. 313</ref> Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of [[Milan]], after the death of [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]].\n\nPius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the [[Roman Curia]]; he employed German and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Jesuit]] advisors, Robert Leiber, [[Augustin Bea]], and [[Sebastian Tromp]].

Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]] of [[Philadelphia]] being the only living U.S. cardinal. The first occasion on 18 February 1946\u2014which has become known as the \"Grand Consistory\"\u2014yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost 50 percent of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals.<ref>(previously [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]'s elevation of 31 cardinals in 1517 had held this title).

[[Mediator Dei]] clarified membership and participation in the Church. The encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints, [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Mary]], the [[Mother of God]], things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.<ref>''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950) and ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' (1943), p. 305</ref>\n\n===Theological orientation===\n====Biblical research====\n{{Main article|Divino afflante Spiritu}}\nThe encyclical ''Divino afflante Spiritu'', published in 1943,<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 297</ref> emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 305</ref>\n\n====The role of theology====\nThis theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the Church generously supports, but in matters of [[morality]] and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the [[Magisterium]]. \"The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.\"<ref>Pius XII, Enc.

He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in [[terminally ill]] persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.<ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYCH.HTM Pope Pius XII, The Moral Limits of Medical Research and Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821200244/http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYCH.HTM |date=21 August 2010 }}.</ref>\n\n====Family and sexuality====\nPope Pius XII developed an extensive theology of the family, taking issue with family roles, sharing of household duties, education of children, conflict resolution, financial dilemmas, psychological problems, illness, taking care of older generations, unemployment, marital holiness and virtue, common prayer, religious discussions and more.

Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God. Since the soul is a spiritual substance, it is not brought into being through transformation of matter, but directly by God, whence the special uniqueness of each person.<ref>Pius XII, Enc. ''Humani generis'', 36</ref> Fifty years later, [[Pope John Paul II]], stating that scientific evidence now seemed to favour the evolutionary theory, upheld the distinction of Pius XII regarding the human soul. \"Even if the human body originates from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is spontaneously created by God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blessed-sacrament.org/evolution.doc|title=Finding God in human evolution|accessdate=17 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224184314/http://www.blessed-sacrament.org/evolution.doc|archivedate=24 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Capital punishment====\nIn an address given on 14 September 1952, Pope Pius XII said that the Church does not regard the execution of criminals as a violation by the State of the universal right to life:\n\n<blockquote>When it is a question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual's right to life.

The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history that published papal speeches and addresses in [[vernacular]] language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in [[Latin]] in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared [[military occupation|occupation]] of the Vatican by the German [[Wehrmacht]], not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or \"walled in\",<ref>Communication, Father Robert Graham, SJ, 10 November 1992</ref> to avoid detection by the advancing German army. Insisting that all publications must be reviewed by him on a prior basis to avoid any misunderstanding, several speeches by Pius XII, who did not find sufficient time, were never published or appeared only once issued in the Vatican daily, ''[[Osservatore Romano]]''.\n\nSeveral encyclicals addressed the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. ''[[Orientalis Ecclesiae]]'' was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], a saint common to [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Latin]] Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]], threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. ''[[Sempiternus Rex]]'' was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]]. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to [[Miaphysite]] theology to return to the Catholic Church. ''Orientales Ecclesias'' was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued [[Stalinist]] persecution of the Church. Several [[Apostolic Letter]]s were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.<ref>''Orientalis Ecclesiae'', AAS, 1944, p. 129</ref><ref>''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', AAS, 1946, pp. 33\u201363.</ref><ref>''Sempiternus Rex'', AAS, 1951, pp. 625\u201344.</ref><ref>''Orientales Ecclesias''.

Pius avoided explicit denunciations of [[Hitlerism]] or [[Stalinism]], establishing the \"impartial\" public tone which would become controversial in later assessment of his pontificate: \"A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |title=\"SUMMI PONTIFICATUS\" \u2013 Section 28 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=11 December 1925 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015921/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |archivedate=3 July 2013  }}</ref>\n\n====Invasion of Poland====\nIn ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'', Pius expressed dismay at the killing of non-combatants in the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland and expressed hope for the \"resurrection\" of that country. The Nazis and Soviets commenced a [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland]]. In April 1940, the Vatican advised the US government that its efforts to provide humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans and that the Holy See had been forced to seek indirect channels through which to direct its aid.<ref>[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box51/a464o10.html Franklin D.

This, Phayer wrote, was regarded as a \"betrayal\" by many Polish Catholics and clergy, who saw his appointment of [[Hilarius Breitinger]] as the apostolic administrator for the [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]] in May 1942, an \"implicit recognition\" of the breakup of Poland; the opinions of the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'', mostly German Catholic minorities living in occupied Poland, were more mixed.<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. 6</ref> Phayer argues that Pius XII\u2014both before and during his papacy\u2014consistently \"deferred to Germany at the expense of Poland\", and saw Germany\u2014not Poland\u2014as critical to \"rebuilding a large Catholic presence in Central Europe\".<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. 18</ref> In May 1942, [[Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e]], Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, Pap\u00e9e declared, \"when something becomes notorious, proof is not required\".<ref>Report by the Polish Ambassador to the Holy See on the Situation in German-occupied Poland, Memorandum No. 79, 29 May 1942, Myron Taylor's papers, NARA.</ref> Although Pius XII received frequent reports about atrocities committed by and/or against Catholics, his knowledge was incomplete; for example, he wept after the war on learning that [[Cardinal Hlond]] had banned German liturgical services in Poland.<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. 8</ref>\n\nThere was a well-known case of Jewish Rabbis who, seeking support against the Nazi persecution of Polish Jews in the [[General Government]] (Nazi-occupied Polish zone), complained to the representatives of the Catholic Church. The Church's attempted intervention caused the Nazis to retaliate by arresting rabbis and deporting them to the death camp. Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See. The Pope was informed about [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II|Nazi atrocities committed in Poland]] by both officials of the Polish Church and the [[Polish Underground]]. Those intelligence materials were used by Pius XII on 11 March 1940 during a formal audience with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (Hitler's foreign affairs adviser) when Pope was \"listing the date, place, and precise details of each crime\" as described by [[Joseph L.

His encyclicals, ''[[Evangelii praecones]]'' and ''[[Fidei donum]]'', issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.<ref>Audience for the directors of mission activities in 1944 A.A.S., 1944, p. 208</ref><ref>''[[Evangelii praecones]]''. p. 56</ref> Though his language retained old conceptions&nbsp;\u2013 Africa, for example, merited special attention since the church there worked 'to forward her work among the heathen multitudes' \u2013 in 1956 he expressed solidarity with the 'non-Europeans who aspire to full political independence'. <ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.282-283</ref> Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius XII supported the establishment of local administration in Church affairs: in 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent; in 1951, Southern Africa; and in 1953, [[British East Africa]]. Finland, [[Burma]] and [[French Africa]] became independent dioceses in 1955.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|elevated a number]] of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops [[Joseph Frings]] of Cologne, [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Clemens von Galen]] of M\u00fcnster and [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated [[Greater Germanic Reich|Nazi Empire]] Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop [[Johannes de Jong]]; Hungarian Bishop [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]; Polish Archbishop [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]]; and French Archbishop [[Jules-G\u00e9raud Sali\u00e8ge]]. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin|Thomas Tien]] of China and [[Valerian Gracias]] of India&nbsp;\u2013 the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Ventresca, p.284</ref> Italian Papal diplomat [[Angelo Roncalli]] (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] were others among those [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1953|elevated in 1953]].\n\nA German contingent dominated his inner circle at this period&nbsp;\u2013 the German Jesuits [[Robert Leiber]], Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop [[Aloisius Muench]] wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was 'more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church' and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority \u2013 'its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany's uncertain political future'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.240</ref>\n\nHe was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's [[Catholic Action]] movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.242</ref> The Communists and Socialists seemed headed for victory and Pius XII wanted Catholic Action, an organization of Catholic laity, to mobilise the Catholic vote against parties of the Left. In July 1949 he approved a controversial move by the Holy Office to threaten with [[excommunication]] anyone with known Communist affiliations. A group of Jesuits around the journal ''[[La Civilta Cattolica]]'', active in Vatican circles, further spread alarm that ''fifth columns'' of Soviet Communism were active in Western Europe poised to exploit popular discontent to aid Soviet expansionism. He was responsible for giving the appellative title, The Catholic University of the Philippines to the then [[Pontifical]] and Royal [[University of Santo Tomas]].\n\nPius XII was rather distrustful of [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Italy's Christian Democrats]], considering the party indecisive and fractious&nbsp;\u2013 reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left&nbsp;\u2013 represented by the Sicilian priest [[Luigi Sturzo]] for example&nbsp;\u2013 he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance&nbsp;\u2013 an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the [[Italian Social Movement]]. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if \"the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.246</ref> de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.\n\n==Later life, illness and death==\n===Late years of Pope Pius XII===\n{{Main article|Late years of Pope Pius XII}}\nThe last years of the [[pontificate]] of Pius XII began in late 1954 with a long illness, during which he considered [[abdication]]. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines.<ref>Schneider, p. 80</ref> Pius underwent three courses of [[Rejuvenation (aging)|cellular rejuvenation]] treatment administered by [[Paul Niehans]], the most important in 1954 when Pacelli was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. \"These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments.\"<ref>Gerard Noel, ''Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler'', p. 3</ref>\n\nPius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as [[Julius D\u00f6pfner]] (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (later [[Pope John Paul II]], 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as \"[[worker-priest]]s\", who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of [[Thomism]] as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[existentialism]].<ref>See ''[[Humani generis]]''.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:Tumulo pio xii.jpg|thumb|''The Pope of Mary'': A [[Madonna and Child]], added by John Paul II in 1982, hangs over the tomb of Pius XII.]]\nPope Pius XII had been seriously ill with gastritis intermittently since 1953, when he had offered to resign the papacy. He also underwent cellular rejuvenation treatment, whose side-effects caused hallucinations and nightmares. With frequent absences from work, he had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide [[Domenico Tardini]], his speechwriter [[Robert Leiber]], and his long-serving housekeeper [[Pascalina Lehnert]]. Pope Pius XII still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ]] was his personal confessor. [[Pascalina Lehnert|Sister Pasqualina]] was for forty years his \"housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion\".<ref>Noel, p. 4</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1958, at his summer residence [[Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope suffered painful complications, but tried to continue his duties between intervals of rest. Next morning, the doctors came to pump his stomach, apparently with success, but he lost consciousness and was given the last rites. Presently he awoke, and the nuns opened the door to the Papal Chapel so he could see and hear them praying the rosary. The next day, he appeared to improve and received visitors. When they opened the window in the evening, he looked out at the stars and said quietly \"Look, how beautiful, how great is our Lord\u201d. On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3.52 a.m. on 9 October, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute [[heart failure]]. Monsignor Domenico Tardini prayed the ''Magnificat Anima mea dominum'', the Virgin Mary's praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: \"The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit.

From this we learn that, although Pius's defenders still say that he paid a golden ransom in a vain effort to save Rome's Jews from transportation to the death camps, the most he did was indicate a willingness to chip in if the Jews could not raise the sum demanded. He also shows that no individual Jews were spared, as is often claimed, after Pius personally intervened with the Nazis. Moreover, Katz reveals that those who did escape the Nazi round-up and found sanctuary in church buildings in Rome did so in the face of explicit opposition from the Vatican. The real heroes and heroines were the priests and nuns who refused to bow to Pius's officials and hand over the desperate people whom they were hiding. The main problem with writing about Pius's wartime is that in effect, he did nothing. Facing the murders of six million people, he remained silent. As Jews were taken away from the ghetto that sat right alongside St Peter's, he may have agonised, but he did not intervene. When he did raise his voice with the German occupiers, it was either to ensure that the Vatican City state would not be compromised\u2014that is to say, he would be safe\u2014or to emphasise his own neutrality in a conflict which, for many, became a battle between good and evil. His unrealistic hope was that the Catholic Church could emerge as the peacemaker across Europe. Instead, both the American and British leaderships, as Katz shows, regarded the papacy as tainted by its association with Nazism and irrelevant in the post-1945 reshaping of the continent. Both had urged Pius to speak up against the Holocaust and so drew their own conclusions about him. Far from being a saint, then, he was at best a fool, perhaps an anti-Semite and probably a coward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045|title=Catholic guilt|last=Stanford|first=Peter J.|date=13 October 2003|accessdate=8 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904222456/http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045|archivedate=4 September 2008}} in review of ''Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome'', written by Robert Katz; {{ISBN|0-297-84661-2}}.

How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina'' (2002), the Argentine journalist [[Uki Go\u00f1i]] described how the Argentinean government dealt with war criminals that entered Argentina. However, during his research Go\u00f1i accidentally stumbled on documents of the British Foreign Office about the involvement of Vatican personnel in the smuggling of war criminals, the so-called [[Ratlines (history)|post-war \"ratlines\"]]. Go\u00f1i found out that the British Envoy [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|D'Arcy Osborne]] had intervened with Pope Pius XII to put an end to these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered \"that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators\".<ref>Go\u00f1i, afterword to the revised 2003 edition, pp. 327\u2013348.</ref> Suzanne Brown-Fleming's ''The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience. Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany'' (2006) underlines Go\u00f1i's findings. In her remarkable study, Brown-Fleming clearly demonstrated how Pius XII intervened on behalf of rather vicious German war criminals (e.g. [[Otto Ohlendorf]]). Brown-Fleming's main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII's representative in post-war Germany, [[Aloisius Joseph Muench|Cardinal Aloisius Muench]].<ref>Brown-Fleming, 2006, Chapter 4: ''Granting Absolution. Muench and the Catholic Clemency Campaign''.</ref> Then, Phayer's ''[[Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War]]'' (2008) makes use of many documents that have recently come to light thanks to [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the [[US National Archives]] and [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the [[Argentine government]] and the British Foreign Office and other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop [[Joseph Patrick Hurley|Hurley]]. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the [[Usta\u0161e]] regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe.<ref>Phayer, 2008, pp. xi\u2013xvi</ref> According to Phayer, \"the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions\".<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. xi</ref>\n\nOn 19 September 2008, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] held a reception for conference participants during which he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080918_pave-the-way_en.html|title=Address at the conclusion of the symposium organized by the \"Pave the Way Foundation\"|publisher=Vatican.va|date=19 September 2008|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref> A second conference was held from 6\u20138 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12968|title=Vatican recalls life and teachings of Pius XII 50 years after his death|publisher=Catholicnewsagency.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII's death, Benedict XVI celebrated pontifical Mass in his memory.

His parents were Filippo Pacelli (1837\u20131916) and Virginia (n\u00e9e Graziosi) Pacelli (1844\u20131920). His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli, had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances<ref>Pollard, 2005, p. 70</ref> and then Secretary of the Interior under [[Pope Pius IX]] from 1851 to 1870 and helped found the Vatican's newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' in 1861.<ref>Marchione, 2004, p. 1</ref><ref>Gerard Noel, Pius XII:The Hound of Hitler, p. 5</ref> His cousin, [[Ernesto Pacelli]], was a key financial advisor to [[Pope Leo XIII]]; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a [[Franciscan]] [[Third order|tertiary]],<ref>O'Brien, p. 1</ref> was the dean of the [[Roman Rota]]; and his brother, [[Francesco Pacelli]], became a [[Laity|lay]] [[canon law]]yer and the legal advisor to [[Pope Pius XI]], in which role he negotiated the [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929 with [[Benito Mussolini]], bringing an end to the [[Roman Question]].\n\nTogether with his brother Francesco and his two sisters, Giuseppina and Elisabetta, he grew up in the [[Parione]] district in the centre of Rome. Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880 he began school at the convent of the French [[Sisters of Divine Providence]] in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]]. Eugenio and the other children made their [[First Communion]] at this church and Eugenio served there as an [[altar boy]] from 1886. In 1886 too he was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the [[Piazza Venezia]].<ref>Paul O'Shea, A Cross Too Heavy, 2011, p. 79</ref> In 1891 Pacelli's father sent Eugenio to the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute, a state school situated in what had been the [[Collegio Romano]], the premier Jesuit university in Rome.\n\nIn 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome's oldest seminary, the [[Almo Collegio Capranica]],<ref>O'Shea, p. 81</ref> and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] and theology at the [[Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare]]. He was also enrolled at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|State University, La Sapienza]] where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame.<ref>Cornwell, p. 22</ref> Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899 he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in [[Latin]].<ref>Cornwell, p. 23</ref>\n\n==Church career==\n\n===Priest and Monsignor===\n[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Pacelli on the day of his ordination: 2 April 1899]]\nWhile all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]],<ref name=\"Gerard Noel, p.9\">Noel, p. 9</ref> Pacelli was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest on [[Easter Sunday]], 2 April 1899 alone in the private chapel of a family friend the [[Vicegerent]] of Rome, [[Francesco di Paola Cassetta|Mgr Paolo Cassetta]]. Shortly after ordination he began postgraduate studies in canon law at Sant'Apollinaire. He received his first assignment as a [[curate]] at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].<ref name=\"marchione193\">Marchione, 2000, p. 193</ref> In 1901 he entered the [[Section for Relations with States (Roman Curia)|Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], a sub-office of the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Vatican Secretariat of State]].<ref>O'Shea, p. 82</ref>\n\nMonsignor [[Pietro Gasparri]], the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs, had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to work in the \"Vatican's equivalent of the Foreign office\" by highlighting the \"necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe\".<ref name=\"Gerard Noel, p. 10\">Noel, p. 10</ref> Pacelli became an ''apprendista'', an apprentice, in Gasparri's department. In January 1901 he was also chosen, by Pope Leo XIII himself, according to an official account, to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to King [[Edward VII]] of the UK after the death of [[Queen Victoria]].<ref name=\"marchione9\">Marchione, 2004, p. 9</ref>\n[[File:MarrydelValpacelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|The Serbian Concordat, 24 June 1914. Present for the Vatican were [[Cardinal Merry del Val]] and next to him, Pacelli.]]\nBy 1904 Pacelli received his doctorate. The theme of his thesis was the nature of [[concordats]] and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of ''minutante'', he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a [[papal chamberlain]]. In 1905 he received the title [[Domestic Prelate|domestic prelate]].<ref name=\"marchione193\"/> From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal Pietro Gasparri in his codification of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs.<ref name=\"marchione10\">Marchione, 2004, p. 10</ref> According to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] \"the text, together with the [[Anti-Modernist Oath]], became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church\".<ref>Cornwell, ''Hitler's Pope'', p. 42</ref>\n\nIn 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the [[International Eucharistic Congress]], accompanying [[Rafael Merry del Val]]<ref>Cornwell, p. 32</ref> to London,<ref name=\"marchione9\"/> where he met [[Winston Churchill]].<ref>Dalin, 2005, p. 47</ref> In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of King [[George V]].<ref name=\"marchione10\"/>\nPacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under [[Pope Pius X]] and retained under [[Pope Benedict XV]]), and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in February 1914.<ref name=\"marchione10\"/> On 24 June 1914, just four days before [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was assassinated in [[Sarajevo]], Pacelli, together with [[Cardinal Merry del Val]], represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed. [[Serbia]]'s success in the [[First Balkan War]] against [[Turkey]] in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging [[Austria-Hungary]]'s sphere of influence throughout the [[Balkans]]. Pius X died on 20 August 1914. His successor Benedict XV named Gasparri as secretary of state and Gasparri took Pacelli with him into the Secretariat of State, making him undersecretary.<ref>O'Shea, pp. 86, 88</ref> During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and worked to implement papal relief initiatives. In 1915, he travelled to [[Vienna]] to assist Monsignor [[Raffaele Scapinelli di L\u00e9guigno|Raffaele Scapinelli]], [[nuncio]] to Vienna, in his negotiations with Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] regarding Italy.<ref>Levillain, 2002, p. 1211</ref>\n\n===Archbishop and Papal nuncio===\n{{Main article|Nunciature of Eugenio Pacelli}}\n[[File:PioXIIgernamia1917.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Pacelli at the Headquarters of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]]]\nPope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria|nuncio to Bavaria]] on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as [[titular bishop|titular]] [[See of Sardis|Archbishop of Sardis]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 13 May 1917. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for [[Bavaria]]. As there was no nuncio to [[Prussia]] or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the [[German Empire]].\n\nOnce in [[Munich]], he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities.<ref>Fatoni, 1992, pp. 45\u201385</ref> He met with [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III]] on 29 May, and later with [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]<ref name=\"marchione11\">Marchione, 2004, p. 11</ref> and Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann-Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September.\n\nSister Pascalina later recalled that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned a \"deaf ear to all his proposals\". She later wrote, \"Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come.

Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies.

In 1935, Pacelli was named [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]].\n\nAs Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a [[Baden]] Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, [[Conrad Gr\u00f6ber]], the new [[Archbishop of Freiburg]], and the treaty was signed in August\n1932.<ref>Kent, 2002, p. 24</ref> Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1935) and Portugal (1940). The [[Lateran treaties]] with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Catholic Popular Party]], in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged [[Catholic Action]], \"an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing\". It was permitted only so long as it developed \"its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 115</ref> Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of [[Nullity (conflict)|nullity]] in the area of marriage).<ref>Fahlbusch, Erwin (ed.). Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (trans.) (2005). ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''; {{ISBN|0-8028-2416-1}}</ref>\n\nAs the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic chancellor [[Heinrich Bruning]], who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he \"misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 121</ref> Following Bruning's resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, \"that would correspond to their principles\".<ref>Cornwell, p. 128. Pacelli, quoted in Scholder's ''The Churches and the Third Reich'', p. 157</ref> He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an [[Eugenio Pacelli's 1936 visit to the United States|extensive visit to the United States in 1936]] where he met President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who appointed a personal envoy\u2014who did not require Senate confirmation\u2014to the [[Holy See]] in December 1939, re-establishing a diplomatic tradition that had been broken since 1870 when the pope lost [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]].<ref>Dalin, 2005, pp. 58\u201359</ref>\n\n[[File:Pacelli in Argentina 01.jpg|thumb|right|280px|A smiling Pacelli with Argentine president [[Agust\u00edn P.

The state concordats were necessary because the German [[federalism|federalist]] Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk, Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', p. 539</ref><ref>Donald J.

However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the Church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933.<ref>Volk, pp. 539\u2013544</ref> A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922\u20131932.<ref>They included: Latvia 1922, Bavaria 1925, Poland 1925, France I., 1926, France II. 1926, Lithuania 1927, Czechoslovakia 1928, Portugal I 1928, Italy I 1929, Italy II 1929, Portugal II 1929, Romania I 1927, Prussia 1929, Romania II 1932, Baden 1932, Germany 1933, Austria 1933.

It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the Church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (\u00a731), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.<ref>Ludwig Volk, \"Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen L\u00e4ndern\" in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', pp. 546\u2013547</ref>\n\nAs [[nuncio]] during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.<ref>Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20.

Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]''. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual [[Latin]] of official Catholic Church documents.

Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It exposed the fallacy and denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil; it decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the F\u00fchrer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance'.

After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.\n\nHis [[Papal Coronation|coronation]] took place on 12 March 1939.

Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later [[Pope Paul VI]]) and [[Domenico Tardini]]. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.<ref>Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and Congregation of Ordinary Affairs</ref> Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals,<ref>Pio XII, ''La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953'' in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita Vatican City, 1953, p. 455</ref> an honor which both turned down.<ref>Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 157</ref> They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.<ref>Giulio Nicolini, Il Cardinale Domenico Tardini, Padova, 1980; {{ISBN|88-7026-340-1}}; p. 313</ref> Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of [[Milan]], after the death of [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]].\n\nPius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the [[Roman Curia]]; he employed German and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Jesuit]] advisors, Robert Leiber, [[Augustin Bea]], and [[Sebastian Tromp]].

Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]] of [[Philadelphia]] being the only living U.S. cardinal. The first occasion on 18 February 1946\u2014which has become known as the \"Grand Consistory\"\u2014yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost 50 percent of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals.<ref>(previously [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]'s elevation of 31 cardinals in 1517 had held this title). [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] surpassed this number on 21 February 2001, elevating 44 cardinals. By that time, the limit had been suspended and over 120 Cardinals existed.</ref> In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from [[China]], [[India]], the [[Middle East]] and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.<ref>Oscar Halecki, James Murray, Jr. ''Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, Pope of Peace'', p. 371</ref>\n\nIn his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs. [[Domenico Tardini]] and Giovanni Montini would be elevated<ref>Levillain, 2002, p. 1136</ref> and Pius XII informed the assembled cardinals that both of them were originally on the top of his list,<ref>Pio XII, La Allocuzione nel concistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953 in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessaggi di Sua Santit\u00e0, Vatican City, 1953, p. 455</ref> but they had turned down the offer, and were rewarded instead with other promotions.<ref>Tardini later thanked him for not appointing him. The Pope replied with a smile. \"Monsignore mio, you thank me, for not letting me do what I wanted to do\". I replied \"Yes Holy Father, I thank you for everything you have done for me, but even more, what you have not done for me\". The Pope smiled. In Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960 157</ref> Both Montini and Tardini would become Cardinals shortly after Pius' death; Montini later became [[Pope Paul VI]].

In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the [[encyclical]] ''[[Mystici corporis]]''.\n\n===Priests and religious===\nWith the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''Sedis Sapientiae'', Pius XII added [[social sciences]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]] and [[social psychology]], to the pastoral training of future priests. Pius XII emphasised the need to systematically analyze the [[psychological]] condition of candidates to the [[priesthood]] to ensure that they are capable of a life of celibacy and service.<ref>AAS, 1956, p. 354 ff</ref> Pius XII added one year to the theological formation of future priests.

[[Mediator Dei]] clarified membership and participation in the Church. The encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints, [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Mary]], the [[Mother of God]], things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.<ref>''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950) and ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' (1943), p. 305</ref>\n\n===Theological orientation===\n====Biblical research====\n{{Main article|Divino afflante Spiritu}}\nThe encyclical ''Divino afflante Spiritu'', published in 1943,<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 297</ref> emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.<ref>AAS, 1943, p. 305</ref>\n\n====The role of theology====\nThis theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the Church generously supports, but in matters of [[morality]] and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the [[Magisterium]]. \"The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.\"<ref>Pius XII, Enc.

He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in [[terminally ill]] persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice.

Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God.

''Humani generis'', 36</ref> Fifty years later, [[Pope John Paul II]], stating that scientific evidence now seemed to favour the evolutionary theory, upheld the distinction of Pius XII regarding the human soul. \"Even if the human body originates from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is spontaneously created by God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blessed-sacrament.org/evolution.doc|title=Finding God in human evolution|accessdate=17 December 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224184314/http://www.blessed-sacrament.org/evolution.doc|archivedate=24 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Capital punishment====\nIn an address given on 14 September 1952, Pope Pius XII said that the Church does not regard the execution of criminals as a violation by the State of the universal right to life:\n\n<blockquote>When it is a question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual's right to life.

Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in [[Latin]] in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared [[military occupation|occupation]] of the Vatican by the German [[Wehrmacht]], not all documents exist today.

''[[Orientalis Ecclesiae]]'' was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], a saint common to [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Latin]] Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church]], threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. ''[[Sempiternus Rex]]'' was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]]. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to [[Miaphysite]] theology to return to the Catholic Church. ''Orientales Ecclesias'' was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued [[Stalinist]] persecution of the Church. Several [[Apostolic Letter]]s were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite.

The Nazis and Soviets commenced a [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland]]. In April 1940, the Vatican advised the US government that its efforts to provide humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans and that the Holy See had been forced to seek indirect channels through which to direct its aid.<ref>[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box51/a464o10.html Franklin D.

This, Phayer wrote, was regarded as a \"betrayal\" by many Polish Catholics and clergy, who saw his appointment of [[Hilarius Breitinger]] as the apostolic administrator for the [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]] in May 1942, an \"implicit recognition\" of the breakup of Poland; the opinions of the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'', mostly German Catholic minorities living in occupied Poland, were more mixed.<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. 6</ref> Phayer argues that Pius XII\u2014both before and during his papacy\u2014consistently \"deferred to Germany at the expense of Poland\", and saw Germany\u2014not Poland\u2014as critical to \"rebuilding a large Catholic presence in Central Europe\".<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. 18</ref> In May 1942, [[Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e]], Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, Pap\u00e9e declared, \"when something becomes notorious, proof is not required\".<ref>Report by the Polish Ambassador to the Holy See on the Situation in German-occupied Poland, Memorandum No. 79, 29 May 1942, Myron Taylor's papers, NARA.</ref> Although Pius XII received frequent reports about atrocities committed by and/or against Catholics, his knowledge was incomplete; for example, he wept after the war on learning that [[Cardinal Hlond]] had banned German liturgical services in Poland.<ref>Phayer, 2008, p. 8</ref>\n\nThere was a well-known case of Jewish Rabbis who, seeking support against the Nazi persecution of Polish Jews in the [[General Government]] (Nazi-occupied Polish zone), complained to the representatives of the Catholic Church. The Church's attempted intervention caused the Nazis to retaliate by arresting rabbis and deporting them to the death camp. Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See. The Pope was informed about [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II|Nazi atrocities committed in Poland]] by both officials of the Polish Church and the [[Polish Underground]]. Those intelligence materials were used by Pius XII on 11 March 1940 during a formal audience with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (Hitler's foreign affairs adviser) when Pope was \"listing the date, place, and precise details of each crime\" as described by [[Joseph L.

Finland, [[Burma]] and [[French Africa]] became independent dioceses in 1955.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|elevated a number]] of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops [[Joseph Frings]] of Cologne, [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Clemens von Galen]] of M\u00fcnster and [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated [[Greater Germanic Reich|Nazi Empire]] Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop [[Johannes de Jong]]; Hungarian Bishop [[J\u00f3zsef Mindszenty]]; Polish Archbishop [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]]; and French Archbishop [[Jules-G\u00e9raud Sali\u00e8ge]]. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin|Thomas Tien]] of China and [[Valerian Gracias]] of India&nbsp;\u2013 the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Ventresca, p.284</ref> Italian Papal diplomat [[Angelo Roncalli]] (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop [[Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski]] were others among those [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1953|elevated in 1953]].\n\nA German contingent dominated his inner circle at this period&nbsp;\u2013 the German Jesuits [[Robert Leiber]], Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop [[Aloisius Muench]] wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was 'more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church' and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority \u2013 'its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany's uncertain political future'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.240</ref>\n\nHe was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's [[Catholic Action]] movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.242</ref> The Communists and Socialists seemed headed for victory and Pius XII wanted Catholic Action, an organization of Catholic laity, to mobilise the Catholic vote against parties of the Left. In July 1949 he approved a controversial move by the Holy Office to threaten with [[excommunication]] anyone with known Communist affiliations. A group of Jesuits around the journal ''[[La Civilta Cattolica]]'', active in Vatican circles, further spread alarm that ''fifth columns'' of Soviet Communism were active in Western Europe poised to exploit popular discontent to aid Soviet expansionism. He was responsible for giving the appellative title, The Catholic University of the Philippines to the then [[Pontifical]] and Royal [[University of Santo Tomas]].\n\nPius XII was rather distrustful of [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Italy's Christian Democrats]], considering the party indecisive and fractious&nbsp;\u2013 reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left&nbsp;\u2013 represented by the Sicilian priest [[Luigi Sturzo]] for example&nbsp;\u2013 he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance&nbsp;\u2013 an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the [[Italian Social Movement]]. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if \"the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'.<ref>Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.246</ref> de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.\n\n==Later life, illness and death==\n===Late years of Pope Pius XII===\n{{Main article|Late years of Pope Pius XII}}\nThe last years of the [[pontificate]] of Pius XII began in late 1954 with a long illness, during which he considered [[abdication]]. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines.<ref>Schneider, p. 80</ref> Pius underwent three courses of [[Rejuvenation (aging)|cellular rejuvenation]] treatment administered by [[Paul Niehans]], the most important in 1954 when Pacelli was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. \"These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments.\"<ref>Gerard Noel, ''Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler'', p. 3</ref>\n\nPius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as [[Julius D\u00f6pfner]] (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (later [[Pope John Paul II]], 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as \"[[worker-priest]]s\", who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of [[Thomism]] as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[existentialism]].<ref>See ''[[Humani generis]]''.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:Tumulo pio xii.jpg|thumb|''The Pope of Mary'': A [[Madonna and Child]], added by John Paul II in 1982, hangs over the tomb of Pius XII.]]\nPope Pius XII had been seriously ill with gastritis intermittently since 1953, when he had offered to resign the papacy. He also underwent cellular rejuvenation treatment, whose side-effects caused hallucinations and nightmares. With frequent absences from work, he had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide [[Domenico Tardini]], his speechwriter [[Robert Leiber]], and his long-serving housekeeper [[Pascalina Lehnert]]. Pope Pius XII still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ]] was his personal confessor. [[Pascalina Lehnert|Sister Pasqualina]] was for forty years his \"housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion\".<ref>Noel, p. 4</ref>\n\nOn 5 October 1958, at his summer residence [[Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope suffered painful complications, but tried to continue his duties between intervals of rest. Next morning, the doctors came to pump his stomach, apparently with success, but he lost consciousness and was given the last rites. Presently he awoke, and the nuns opened the door to the Papal Chapel so he could see and hear them praying the rosary. The next day, he appeared to improve and received visitors. When they opened the window in the evening, he looked out at the stars and said quietly \"Look, how beautiful, how great is our Lord\u201d. On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3.52 a.m. on 9 October, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute [[heart failure]]. Monsignor Domenico Tardini prayed the ''Magnificat Anima mea dominum'', the Virgin Mary's praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: \"The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit. His heart was healthy, his lungs were good. He could have lived another 20 years, had he spared himself.\"<ref>Lehnert, Pascalina, p. 191</ref>\n\n===Botched embalming===\nPius XII's physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], reported that the pontiff's body was embalmed in the room where he died using a novel process invented by Oreste Nuzzi.<ref name=ModernMummies>{{cite book|title=Modern Mummies|first=Christine|last=Quigley|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOqU-9BTZO4C&pg=PA204 |publisher=McFarland & Co.|isbn=978-0-7864-0492-6}}</ref>\n\nPope Pius XII did not want the vital organs removed from his body, demanding instead that it be kept in the same condition \"in which God created it\".<ref name=\"AP 11Oct58\"/> According to Galeazzi-Lisi, this was the reason why he and Nuzzi, an embalmer from [[Naples]], used an atypical approach with the embalming procedure.<ref name=\"AP 11Oct58\"/> In a controversial press conference, Galeazzi-Lisi described in great detail the embalming of the body of the late pontiff. He claimed to have used the same system of oils and resins with which the body of Jesus Christ was preserved.<ref name=\"AP 11Oct58\">\"Pope's Body Embalmed with Special Process\", ''[[Associated Press]]'' (AP), Rome, 11 October 1958</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2017}}\n\nGaleazzi-Lisi asserted that the new process would \"preserve the body indefinitely in its natural state\".<ref name=ModernMummies/> However, whatever chance the new embalming process had of efficaciously preserving the body was obliterated by intense heat in Castel Gandolfo during the embalming process. As a result, the body decomposed rapidly and the viewing of the faithful had to be terminated abruptly.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nGaleazzi-Lisi reported that heat in the halls, where the body of the late Pope lay in state, caused chemical reactions which required it to be treated twice after the original preparation.<ref name=\"AP 11Oct58\"/> Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII's body were reported to have become ill during their vigil.<ref name=ModernMummies/>\n\n===Funeral===\nHis funeral procession into Rome was the largest congregation of Romans as of that date. Romans mourned \"their\" pope, who was born in their own city, especially as a hero in the time of war.<ref>Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte ihm dienen'', p. 197</ref> Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (later to be [[Pope John XXIII]]) wrote in his diary on 11 October 1958 that probably no Roman emperor had enjoyed such a triumph, which he viewed as a reflection of the spiritual majesty and religious dignity of the late Pius XII.<ref>[[Peter Hebblethwaite|Hebblethwaite, Peter]]. ''John XXIII, Pope of the Council'' (revised edition), Harper Collins: Glasgow. 1994</ref>\n\nThe late pope lay in state on a bier surrounded by four Swiss Guards, and was then placed in the coffin for burial. Pius XII was buried in the grottos beneath St. Peter's Basilica in a simple tomb in a small chapel.\n\n==Cause for canonisation==\n{{Main article|Canonization of Pope Pius XII}}\nThe [[Testament of Pope Pius XII]] was published immediately after his death. Pope Pius XII's [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|cause of canonization]] was opened on 18 November 1965 by Pope Paul VI during the final session of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In May 2007, the congregation recommended that Pius XII should be declared [[Venerable]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702592.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070612181832/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702592.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 June 2007|title=CNS STORY: Sainthood congregation recommends Pope Pius XII be named venerable|publisher=Catholicnews.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref> [[Pope Benedict XVI]] did so on 19 December 2009, simultaneously making the same declaration in regard to Pope John Paul II.<ref name=\"Pitel\"/>\n\nFor Venerable status The Congregation for the Causes of Saints certifies the \"heroic virtues\" of the candidate. Making Pius XII Venerable met with various responses, most centred on the papal words and actions during World War II. Benedict's signature on the Decree of Heroic Virtue was regarded by some as a public relations blunder, though acceptance of Pius XII as a saviour of Europe's Jews is regarded as 'proof of fidelity to the Church, the ''pope'' and the Tradition' by neoconservative Catholic groups.<ref>Paul O'Shea, A Cross too Heavy, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p. 2</ref> On the other hand, Rabbi [[Marvin Hier]], founder and dean at the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] said, \"...there would be a great distortion of history\" if Pius XII were canonized.<ref name=\"afp\">AFP. 22 December 2009. \"[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hkzlifIdlOmb9wKRtm48d4OADI4g Wiesenthal Center shocked at pope Pius sainthood moves] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122135058/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hkzlifIdlOmb9wKRtm48d4OADI4g |date=22 November 2011 }}\".</ref> Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence, the head of [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Sydney's Great Synagogue]], said: \"How can one venerate a man who ... seemed to give his passive permission to the Nazis as the Jews were prised from his doorstep in Rome?\"<ref name=\"maley\">Jacqueline Maley. 24 December 2009. \"[http://www.smh.com.au/national/rabbi-hits-out-at-popes-veneration-of-pius-xii-20091222-lbsy.html Rabbi hits out at Pope's Veneration of Pius XII]\".

From this we learn that, although Pius's defenders still say that he paid a golden ransom in a vain effort to save Rome's Jews from transportation to the death camps, the most he did was indicate a willingness to chip in if the Jews could not raise the sum demanded. He also shows that no individual Jews were spared, as is often claimed, after Pius personally intervened with the Nazis. Moreover, Katz reveals that those who did escape the Nazi round-up and found sanctuary in church buildings in Rome did so in the face of explicit opposition from the Vatican. The real heroes and heroines were the priests and nuns who refused to bow to Pius's officials and hand over the desperate people whom they were hiding. The main problem with writing about Pius's wartime is that in effect, he did nothing. Facing the murders of six million people, he remained silent. As Jews were taken away from the ghetto that sat right alongside St Peter's, he may have agonised, but he did not intervene. When he did raise his voice with the German occupiers, it was either to ensure that the Vatican City state would not be compromised\u2014that is to say, he would be safe\u2014or to emphasise his own neutrality in a conflict which, for many, became a battle between good and evil. His unrealistic hope was that the Catholic Church could emerge as the peacemaker across Europe. Instead, both the American and British leaderships, as Katz shows, regarded the papacy as tainted by its association with Nazism and irrelevant in the post-1945 reshaping of the continent. Both had urged Pius to speak up against the Holocaust and so drew their own conclusions about him. Far from being a saint, then, he was at best a fool, perhaps an anti-Semite and probably a coward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045|title=Catholic guilt|last=Stanford|first=Peter J.|date=13 October 2003|accessdate=8 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904222456/http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045|archivedate=4 September 2008}} in review of ''Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome'', written by Robert Katz; {{ISBN|0-297-84661-2}}.
