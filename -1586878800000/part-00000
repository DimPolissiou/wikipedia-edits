Typically, asparagine is converted to [[aspartic acid]] or [[isoaspartate|isoaspartic acid]]. Glutamine is converted to [[glutamic acid]] or [[pyroglutamic acid]] (5-oxoproline). In a [[protein]] or [[peptide]], these reactions are important because they may alter its structure, stability or function and may lead to protein degradation. The net chemical change is the addition of a water group and removal of an ammonia group, which corresponds to a +1 (0.98402) Da mass increase. Although deamidation occurs on glutamine, glycosylated asparagine and other amides, these are negligible under typical proteolysis conditions.<ref name=\"Clarke S 2003\">{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = S | year = 2003 | title = Aging as war between chemical and biochemical processes: protein methylation and the recognition of age-damaged proteins for repair | url = | journal = Ageing Res Rev | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 263\u2013285 | doi = 10.1016/S1568-1637(03)00011-4 }}</ref>\n\nIn the deamidation of an asparagine residue under physiological conditions, the side chain is attacked by the nitrogen atom of the following peptide group (in black at top right of Figure), forming an asymmetric [[succinimide]] intermediate (in red).

It initially accommodated about 300 prisoners, and $250,000 was allocated in 1835 to build it, but various cost overruns occurred prior to completion of the project.\n\nThe building site had been created by filling in the [[Collect Pond]] that was the principal water source for Colonial New York City. Industrialization and population density by the late 18th century resulted in the severe pollution of the Collect, so it was condemned, drained, and filled in by 1817. The landfill job was poorly done, however, and the ground began to subside in less than 10 years. The resulting swampy, foul-smelling conditions transformed the neighborhood into a slum known as [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] by the time that prison construction started in 1838. The heavy masonry of Haviland's design was built atop vertical piles of lashed hemlock tree trunks in a bid for stability, but the entire structure began to sink soon after it was opened. This damp foundation was primarily responsible for its unsanitary conditions in the decades that followed.

It was a notable example of [[Egyptian Revival architecture]], although opinion varied greatly concerning its actual merit. As Dickens wrote: \"What is this dismal fronted pile of bastard Egyptian, like an enchanter's palace in a melodrama?\"\n\nThe prison was well known for its corruption and was the scene of numerous scandals and escapes during its early history. A fire destroyed part of the building on November 18, 1842, the same day that a notorious killer named [[John C. Colt]] was due to be hanged.

This was their final major commission. In September 1900, the architects complained that construction would be delayed for a year and cost an additional $250,000 due to the unnecessary insertion of corrupt [[Tammany Hall]] architects Horgan and Slattery into the project.<ref>\"City Prison Alterations\", ''The New York Times'', September 7, 1900</ref>\n\nThe building was connected to the 1892 Manhattan Criminal Courts Building with a \"Bridge of Sighs\", crossing four stories above Franklin Street.

The three southern towers are wings of a single integrated structure sharing a five-story \"crown\"<ref>http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=30093</ref> which house the city's Criminal and Supreme Courts, city offices, and various departments, including the headquarters of the Department of Corrections. The northern tower is freestanding, with the separate address of 125 White Street. It was officially named the Manhattan House of Detention for Men (MHD), although it was still referred to popularly as The Tombs.\n\nBy 1969, the Tombs ranked as the worst of the city's jails, both in overall conditions and in overcrowding. It held an average of 2,000 inmates in spaces designed for 925.<ref>Courts, Corrections, and the Constitution: The Impact of Judicial ... edited by John J. DiIulio, page 140</ref> Inmates rioted on August 10, 1970, after multiple warnings about falling budgets, aging facilities, and rising populations, and after an informational picket of City Hall by union correctional officers drawing attention to the pressures.

The city decided to close the Tombs on December 20, 1974, after years of litigation and after federal judge [[Morris E.

It initially accommodated about 300 prisoners, and $250,000 was allocated in 1835 to build it, but various cost overruns occurred prior to completion of the project.\n\nThe building site had been created by filling in the [[Collect Pond]] that was the principal water source for Colonial New York City. Industrialization and population density by the late 18th century resulted in the severe pollution of the Collect, so it was condemned, drained, and filled in by 1817. The landfill job was poorly done, however, and the ground began to subside in less than 10 years. The resulting swampy, foul-smelling conditions transformed the neighborhood into a slum known as [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] by the time that prison construction started in 1838. The heavy masonry of Haviland's design was built atop vertical piles of lashed hemlock tree trunks in a bid for stability, but the entire structure began to sink soon after it was opened. This damp foundation was primarily responsible for its unsanitary conditions in the decades that followed.

It was a notable example of [[Egyptian Revival architecture]], although opinion varied greatly concerning its actual merit. As Dickens wrote: \"What is this dismal fronted pile of bastard Egyptian, like an enchanter's palace in a melodrama?\"\n\nThe prison was well known for its corruption and was the scene of numerous scandals and escapes during its early history. A fire destroyed part of the building on November 18, 1842, the same day that a notorious killer named [[John C. Colt]] was due to be hanged. Apparently it was an escape attempt on Colt's part that failed, and he fatally stabbed himself in his cell.<ref>Kernan, J. Frank.

This was their final major commission. In September 1900, the architects complained that construction would be delayed for a year and cost an additional $250,000 due to the unnecessary insertion of corrupt [[Tammany Hall]] architects Horgan and Slattery into the project.<ref>\"City Prison Alterations\", ''The New York Times'', September 7, 1900</ref>\n\nThe building was connected to the 1892 Manhattan Criminal Courts Building with a \"Bridge of Sighs\", crossing four stories above Franklin Street.

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\".

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]]\u2014the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy\u2014sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck. Realizing that Sid's rocket is still strapped to Buzz's back, Woody ignites it, hurtling them towards the truck. Woody throws RC into the truck before he and Buzz soar into the air; Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket just before it explodes, and he glides with Woody to safety inside a box in the Davis's van, right next to Andy, who concludes they were in the car all along.\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] at their new home, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals; one of the toys is [[Mrs. Potato Head]], to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], a [[pull-string]] [[cowboy]] doll who is Andy's favourite toy.\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]], a space ranger [[action figure]] and Woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend.\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog]], a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green [[Tyrannosaurus]] figurine.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], Woody and Buzz's owner.\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Sid Phillips|Sid Phillips]], Andy's next door neighbor, who tortures toys for his own amusement.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]], Andy's mother.\n* [[R.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

Pixar impressed Disney with their technical innovation, but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each of Pixar's presentations, Katzenberg tore much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg wanted primarily to add \"more edginess\" to the two main characters.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references to be added to the film.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=129}} Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993\u2014an event they later dubbed the \"Black Friday Incident\".<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\">{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|title=Toy' Wonder|date=December 8, 1995|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205204251/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|archive-date=December 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The results were disastrous.

Schumacher replied bluntly: \"Because it's not their movie any more; it's completely not the movie that John set out to make.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nLasseter was embarrassed by what was on the screen, later recalling, \"It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean characters that I've ever seen.\" He asked Disney for two weeks to rework the script, and Katzenberg was supportive.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy.

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]]\u2014the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy\u2014sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

However, character designer [[Bud Luckey]] suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy.

The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy. Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film and insisted that Disney was liable for the cost overruns.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either created out of [[Modelling clay|clay]] or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer-animated design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\">{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Burr|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|title=The Toy Story Story|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|pages=1\u20136|date=December 1995|accessdate=March 13, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131017031124/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|archive-date=October 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Once the animators had a model, its articulation and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /> Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\">{{cite journal|last=Henne |first=Mark |last2=Hickel |first2=Hal |last3=Johnson |first3=Ewan |last4=Konishi |first4=Sonoks |title=The Making of Toy Story |journal=CompCon '96.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:El Capitan Theatre, Hollywood, California (2997200450).jpg|thumb|The [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, where ''Toy Story''{{'}}s Los Angeles, California's premiere took place on November 19, 1995.|alt=Exterior shot of the El Capitan Theatre.]]\n\nThere were two premieres of ''Toy Story'' in November 1995.

Brogden then suggested that a formal contract should be entered into between them for longer term coal supply. Each side's agents met together and negotiated. Metropolitan's agents drew up some terms of agreement and sent them to Brogden. Brogden wrote in some parts which had been left blank and inserted an arbitrator who would decide upon differences which might arise. He wrote \"approved\" at the end and sent back the agreement documents. Metropolitan's agent filed the documents and did nothing more. For a while, both acted according to the agreement document's terms. But then some more serious disagreements arose, and Brogden argued that there had been no formal contract actually established.\n\n==Judgment==\nThe House of Lords ([[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns]], [[William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley|Lord Hatherley]], [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]], [[Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn|Lord Blackburn]], and [[Edward Gordon, Baron Gordon of Drumearn|Lord Gordon]]) held that a contract had arisen by conduct and Brogden had been in clear breach, so he must be liable. The word \"approved\" on the document with Brogden's name was binding on all the partners, since Brogden was the chief partner, even though the standard signature of \u201cB. & Sons\u201d was not used. A mere mental assent to the agreement's terms would not have been enough, but having acted on the terms made it so. Lord Blackburn also held that the onus of showing that both parties had acted on the terms of an agreement which written agreement had not been, in due format, executed by either, lies upon person alleging such facts. A key extract from Lord Blackburn's judgment [Lord Blackburn was one of the most distinguished judges of his time]:\n\n<blockquote>\nI have always believed the law to be this, that when an offer is made to another party, and in that offer there is a request express or implied that he must signify his acceptance by doing some particular thing, then as soon as he does that thing, he is bound. If a man sent an offer abroad saying: I wish to know whether you will supply me with goods at such and such a price, and, if you agree to that, you must ship the first cargo as soon as you get this letter, there can be no doubt that as soon as the cargo was shipped the contract would be complete, and if the cargo went to the bottom of the sea, it would go to the bottom of the sea at the risk of the orderer. So again, where, as in the case of'' [[Ex parte Harris]]'',<ref>''[[In re Imperial Land Company of Marseilles]]'', Law Rep. 7 Ch. Ap. 587</ref> a person writes a letter and says, I offer to take an allotment of shares, and he expressly or impliedly says, If you agree with me send an answer by the post, there, as soon as he has sent that answer by the post, and put it out of his control, and done an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound, I agree the contract is perfectly plain and clear.\n\nBut when you come to the general proposition which [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|Mr. Justice Brett]] seems to have laid down, that a simple acceptance in your own mind, without any intimation to the other party, and expressed by a mere private act, such as putting a letter into a drawer, completes a contract, I must say I differ from that. It appears from the Year Books that as long ago as the time of [[Edward IV]],<ref>17 Edw. IV., T. Pasch case, 2</ref> [[Chief Justice Brian]]<ref>[[Sir Thomas Bryan]], Chief Justice of Common Pleas 1471-1500</ref> decided this very point. The plea of the Defendant in that case justified the seizing of some growing crops because he said the Plaintiff had offered him to go and look at them, and if he liked them, and would give 2s. 6d. for them, he might take them; that was the justification. That case is referred to in a book which I published a good many years ago, ''Blackburn on Contracts of Sale'',<ref>Page 190 et seq.</ref> and is there translated. Brian gives a very elaborate judgment, explaining the law of the unpaid vendor's lien, as early as that time, exactly as the law now stands, and he consequently says: \u201cThis plea is clearly bad, as you have not shewn the payment or the tender of the money;\u201d but he goes farther, and says (I am quoting from memory, but I think I am quoting correctly), moreover, your plea is utterly naught, for it does not shew that when you had made up your mind to take them you signified it to the Plaintiff, and your having it in your own mind is nothing, for it is [[trite law]] that the thought of man is not triable, for even the [[devil]] does not know what the thought of man is; but I grant you this, that if in his offer to you he had said, Go and look at them, and if you are pleased with them signify it to such and such a man, and if you had signified it to such and such a man, your plea would have been good, because that was a matter of fact.\n<ref>''Anonymous'' (1477) YB Pasch 17 Edw IV, f 1, pl 2.</ref>\n\nI take it, my Lords, that that, which was said 300 years ago and more, is the law to this day, and it is quite what [[Lord Justice Mellish]] in ''[[Ex parte Harris]]''<ref>Law Rep. 7 Ch. Ap. 593</ref> accurately says, that where it is expressly or impliedly stated in the offer that you may accept the offer by posting a letter, the moment you post the letter the offer is accepted. You are bound from the moment you post the letter, not, as it is put here, from the moment you make up your mind on the subject.\n\nBut my Lords, while, as I say, this is so upon the question of law, it is still necessary to consider this case farther upon the question of fact. I agree, and I think every Judge who has considered the case does agree, certainly [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Lord Chief Justice Cockburn]] does, that though the parties may have gone no farther than an offer on the one side, saying, Here is the draft,\u2014(for that I think is really what this case comes to,)\u2014and the draft so offered by the one side is approved by the other, everything being agreed to except the name of the arbitrator, which the one side has filled in and the other has not yet assented to, if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it. When they had come so near as I have said, still it remained to execute formal agreements, and the parties evidently contemplated that they were to exchange agreements, so that each side should be perfectly safe and secure, knowing that the other side was bound. But, although that was what each party contemplated, still I agree (I think the [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Lord Chief Justice Cockburn]] states it clearly enough), that if a draft having been prepared and agreed upon as the basis of a deed or contract to be executed between two parties, the parties, without waiting for the execution of the more formal instrument, proceed to act upon the draft, and treat it as binding upon them, both parties will be bound by it.

Brogden then suggested that a formal contract should be entered into between them for longer term coal supply. Each side's agents met together and negotiated. Metropolitan's agents drew up some terms of agreement and sent them to Brogden. Brogden wrote in some parts which had been left blank and inserted an arbitrator who would decide upon differences which might arise. He wrote \"approved\" at the end and sent back the agreement documents. Metropolitan's agent filed the documents and did nothing more. For a while, both acted according to the agreement document's terms. But then some more serious disagreements arose, and Brogden argued that there had been no formal contract actually established.\n\n==Judgment==\nThe House of Lords ([[Hugh Cairns, 1st Earl Cairns|The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns]], [[William Wood, 1st Baron Hatherley|Lord Hatherley]], [[Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne|Lord Selborne]], [[Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn|Lord Blackburn]], and [[Edward Gordon, Baron Gordon of Drumearn|Lord Gordon]]) held that a contract had arisen by conduct and Brogden had been in clear breach, so he must be liable. The word \"approved\" on the document with Brogden's name was binding on all the partners, since Brogden was the chief partner, even though the standard signature of \u201cB. & Sons\u201d was not used. A mere mental assent to the agreement's terms would not have been enough, but having acted on the terms made it so. Lord Blackburn also held that the onus of showing that both parties had acted on the terms of an agreement which written agreement had not been, in due format, executed by either, lies upon person alleging such facts. A key extract from Lord Blackburn's judgment [Lord Blackburn was one of the most distinguished judges of his time]:\n\n<blockquote>\nI have always believed the law to be this, that when an offer is made to another party, and in that offer there is a request express or implied that he must signify his acceptance by doing some particular thing, then as soon as he does that thing, he is bound. If a man sent an offer abroad saying: I wish to know whether you will supply me with goods at such and such a price, and, if you agree to that, you must ship the first cargo as soon as you get this letter, there can be no doubt that as soon as the cargo was shipped the contract would be complete, and if the cargo went to the bottom of the sea, it would go to the bottom of the sea at the risk of the orderer. So again, where, as in the case of'' [[Ex parte Harris]]'',<ref>''[[In re Imperial Land Company of Marseilles]]'', Law Rep. 7 Ch. Ap. 587</ref> a person writes a letter and says, I offer to take an allotment of shares, and he expressly or impliedly says, If you agree with me send an answer by the post, there, as soon as he has sent that answer by the post, and put it out of his control, and done an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound, I agree the contract is perfectly plain and clear.\n\nBut when you come to the general proposition which [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|Mr. Justice Brett]] seems to have laid down, that a simple acceptance in your own mind, without any intimation to the other party, and expressed by a mere private act, such as putting a letter into a drawer, completes a contract, I must say I differ from that. It appears from the Year Books that as long ago as the time of [[Edward IV]],<ref>17 Edw. IV., T. Pasch case, 2</ref> [[Chief Justice Brian]]<ref>[[Sir Thomas Bryan]], Chief Justice of Common Pleas 1471-1500</ref> decided this very point. The plea of the Defendant in that case justified the seizing of some growing crops because he said the Plaintiff had offered him to go and look at them, and if he liked them, and would give 2s. 6d. for them, he might take them; that was the justification. That case is referred to in a book which I published a good many years ago, ''Blackburn on Contracts of Sale'',<ref>Page 190 et seq.</ref> and is there translated. Brian gives a very elaborate judgment, explaining the law of the unpaid vendor's lien, as early as that time, exactly as the law now stands, and he consequently says: \u201cThis plea is clearly bad, as you have not shewn the payment or the tender of the money;\u201d but he goes farther, and says (I am quoting from memory, but I think I am quoting correctly), moreover, your plea is utterly naught, for it does not shew that when you had made up your mind to take them you signified it to the Plaintiff, and your having it in your own mind is nothing, for it is [[trite law]] that the thought of man is not triable, for even the [[devil]] does not know what the thought of man is; but I grant you this, that if in his offer to you he had said, Go and look at them, and if you are pleased with them signify it to such and such a man, and if you had signified it to such and such a man, your plea would have been good, because that was a matter of fact.\n<ref>''Anonymous'' (1477) YB Pasch 17 Edw IV, f 1, pl 2.</ref>\n\nI take it, my Lords, that that, which was said 300 years ago and more, is the law to this day, and it is quite what [[Lord Justice Mellish]] in ''[[Ex parte Harris]]''<ref>Law Rep. 7 Ch. Ap. 593</ref> accurately says, that where it is expressly or impliedly stated in the offer that you may accept the offer by posting a letter, the moment you post the letter the offer is accepted. You are bound from the moment you post the letter, not, as it is put here, from the moment you make up your mind on the subject.\n\nBut my Lords, while, as I say, this is so upon the question of law, it is still necessary to consider this case farther upon the question of fact. I agree, and I think every Judge who has considered the case does agree, certainly [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Lord Chief Justice Cockburn]] does, that though the parties may have gone no farther than an offer on the one side, saying, Here is the draft,\u2014(for that I think is really what this case comes to,)\u2014and the draft so offered by the one side is approved by the other, everything being agreed to except the name of the arbitrator, which the one side has filled in and the other has not yet assented to, if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it. When they had come so near as I have said, still it remained to execute formal agreements, and the parties evidently contemplated that they were to exchange agreements, so that each side should be perfectly safe and secure, knowing that the other side was bound. But, although that was what each party contemplated, still I agree (I think the [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Lord Chief Justice Cockburn]] states it clearly enough), that if a draft having been prepared and agreed upon as the basis of a deed or contract to be executed between two parties, the parties, without waiting for the execution of the more formal instrument, proceed to act upon the draft, and treat it as binding upon them, both parties will be bound by it. But it must be clear that the parties have both waived the execution of the formal instrument and have agreed expressly, or as shewn by their conduct, to act on the informal one. I think that is quite right, and I agree with the way in which [[Farrer Herschell, 1st Baron Herschell|Mr. Herschell]] in his argument stated it, very truly and fairly. If the parties have by their conduct said, that they act upon the draft which has been approved of by Mr. Brogden, and which if not quite approved of by the railway company, has been exceedingly near it, if they indicate by their conduct that they accept it, the contract is binding.<ref>(1877) 2 AC 666, 691-3</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{Caselist agreement}}\n*''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' (1892)\n* [[Agreement in English law]]\n\n===Considered by===\n*''[[Gibson v Manchester City Council]]'' [1978] 1 WLR 520; [1978] 2 All ER 583; 76 LGR 365, CA<ref name=iclr>https://www.iclr.co.uk/ic/1891000048</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}<nowiki><ref>{{cite web|last=Teacher |first=Law |url=https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/brogden-v-metropolitan.php?vref=1 |title=Brogden v Metropolitan Rly Co |publisher=LawTeacher.net |date=November 2013 |accessdate=10 April 2019 |location=Nottingham, UK}}</ref></nowiki>\n[[Category:English contract case law]]\n[[Category:Lord Blackburn cases]]\n[[Category:English agreement case law]]\n[[Category:1877 in case law]]\n[[Category:1877 in British law]]\n[[Category:House of Lords cases]]\n[[Category:Railway litigation in 1877]]\n", "name_user": "Grimes2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes:format cite template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogden_v_Metropolitan_Rly_Co"}

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

[[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.<ref name=Donald1996/>{{rp|471\u2013472}}\n\n[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''.

In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln appointed Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P.

Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill]], in 1864, which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.<ref name=Donald1996/>{{rp|485\u2013486}}\n\nLincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

[[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.<ref name=Donald1996/>{{rp|471\u2013472}}\n\n[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''.

In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln appointed Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P.

Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill]], in 1864, which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.<ref name=Donald1996/>{{rp|485\u2013486}}\n\nLincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals.
