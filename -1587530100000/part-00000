''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed most the revenue to sales of supplements, including \"Super Male Vitality\" and \"Brain Force Plus\", which ''InfoWars'' purported would increase [[testosterone]] and mental agility, respectively.<ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/> Court documents in 2014 indicate that ''InfoWars'' was successful enough for Jones and his then-wife to be planning to \"build a swimming pool complex ... featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace\".

''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed most the revenue to sales of supplements, including \"Super Male Vitality\" and \"Brain Force Plus\", which ''InfoWars'' purported would increase [[testosterone]] and mental agility, respectively.<ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/> Court documents in 2014 indicate that ''InfoWars'' was successful enough for Jones and his then-wife to be planning to \"build a swimming pool complex ... featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace\".
