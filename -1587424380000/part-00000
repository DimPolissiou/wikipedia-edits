Furie]] and starring [[Michael Caine]]. The screenplay, by [[Bill Canaway]] and James Doran, was based on [[Len Deighton]]'s novel ''[[The IPCRESS File]]'' (1962). It received a [[BAFTA]] award for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Best British film]] released in 1965. In 1999, it was included at number 59 on the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] list of the [[BFI Top 100 British films|100 best British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nThis film and its sequels were a deliberately downbeat alternative to the hugely successful [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]], even though one of the Bond producers, [[Harry Saltzman]], was involved with the [[Harry Palmer]] series, along with other personnel who had been contracted to work on one or more of the 007 movies.\n\n==Plot==\nA scientist called Radcliffe is kidnapped from a train and his security escort killed. [[Harry Palmer]], a British Army sergeant with a criminal past, now working for a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] organisation, is summoned by his superior, [[Colonel Ross]], and transferred to a section headed by Major Dalby. Ross suspects that Radcliffe's disappearance is connected to the fact that sixteen other top British scientists have inexplicably left their jobs at the peak of their careers. He threatens Dalby that his group will go if Radcliffe cannot be recovered. Palmer is then introduced as a replacement for the dead security escort.\n\nAfterwards, Dalby briefs his agents that the main suspect is Eric Grantby and his chief of staff, codenamed \"Housemartin\", and tells the team to find out where they are at present. Palmer is also introduced and befriends Jock Carswell. Using a [[Scotland Yard]] contact, Palmer locates Grantby but, when Palmer tries to stop Grantby getting away, he is attacked by Housemartin. \n\nHousemartin is arrested later but, before he can be questioned, he is killed by men impersonating Palmer and Carswell. Suspecting that Radcliffe is being held in a certain disused factory, Palmer orders a search, but nothing is found except a piece of audiotape marked \"IPCRESS\" that produces meaningless noise when played. Dalby then points out that the paper on which Grantby had written a false phone number is the programme for an upcoming military band concert. There they encounter Grantby and a deal is struck for Radcliffe's return. \n\nThe exchange goes as planned but, as they are leaving, Palmer shoots a man in the shadows who turns out to be a [[CIA]] agent. Subsequently, another CIA operative threatens to kill Palmer if he discovers that the death was not a mistake. Some days later, it becomes clear that while Radcliffe is physically unharmed, his mind has been affected and he can no longer function as a scientist. Carswell has discovered a book titled \"'''I'''nduction of '''P'''sychoneuroses by '''C'''onditioned '''R'''eflex under Str'''ess'''\" \u2013 '''IPCRESS''' \u2013 which he believes explains what has happened to Radcliffe and the other scientists. Carswell borrows Palmer's car to test his theory on Radcliffe, but is shot before reaching him.\n\nBelieving that he himself must have been the intended target, Palmer goes home to collect his belongings and there discovers the body of the second CIA agent. When he returns to the office, the IPCRESS file is missing from his desk. Ross had previously asked him to [[microfilm]] the file and Palmer now believes that he is being set up. When he informs Dalby what has happened and that he suspects Ross, Dalby tells him to leave town for a while.\n\nOn the train to Paris, Palmer is kidnapped and wakes up imprisoned in a cell in [[Albania]]. After several days without sleep, food and warmth, Grantby reveals himself as his kidnapper. Having previously read the file, Palmer realises that they are preparing to [[brainwash]] him. He uses pain to distract himself, but after many sessions under stress from disorientating images and loud electronic sounds, he succumbs. Grantby then instills a trigger phrase that will make Palmer follow any commands given to him.\n\nPalmer eventually manages to escape and discovers that he is really still in London. He phones Dalby, who is in Grantby's company at the time. Dalby uses the trigger phrase and gets Palmer to call Ross to the warehouse where he had been held. As Dalby and Ross arrive, Palmer holds them both at gunpoint. Dalby accuses Ross of killing Carswell; Ross tells Palmer that he had been suspicious of Dalby and was investigating him. \n\nDalby now uses the trigger phrase again and tells Palmer to \"Shoot the traitor now\".

Furie]] and starring [[Michael Caine]]. The screenplay, by [[Bill Canaway]] and James Doran, was based on [[Len Deighton]]'s novel ''[[The IPCRESS File]]'' (1962). It received a [[BAFTA]] award for the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Best British film]] released in 1965. In 1999, it was included at number 59 on the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] list of the [[BFI Top 100 British films|100 best British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nThis film and its sequels were a deliberately downbeat alternative to the hugely successful [[James Bond in film|James Bond films]], even though one of the Bond producers, [[Harry Saltzman]], was involved with the [[Harry Palmer]] series, along with other personnel who had been contracted to work on one or more of the 007 movies.\n\n==Plot==\nA scientist called Radcliffe is kidnapped from a train and his security escort killed. [[Harry Palmer]], a British Army sergeant with a criminal past, now working for a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] organisation, is summoned by his superior, [[Colonel Ross]], and transferred to a section headed by Major Dalby. Ross suspects that Radcliffe's disappearance is connected to the fact that sixteen other top British scientists have inexplicably left their jobs at the peak of their careers. He threatens Dalby that his group will go if Radcliffe cannot be recovered. Palmer is then introduced as a replacement for the dead security escort.\n\nAfterwards, Dalby briefs his agents that the main suspect is Eric Grantby and his chief of staff, codenamed \"Housemartin\", and tells the team to find out where they are at present. Palmer is also introduced and befriends Jock Carswell. Using a [[Scotland Yard]] contact, Palmer locates Grantby but, when Palmer tries to stop Grantby getting away, he is attacked by Housemartin. \n\nHousemartin is arrested later but, before he can be questioned, he is killed by men impersonating Palmer and Carswell. Suspecting that Radcliffe is being held in a certain disused factory, Palmer orders a search, but nothing is found except a piece of audiotape marked \"IPCRESS\" that produces meaningless noise when played. Dalby then points out that the paper on which Grantby had written a false phone number is the programme for an upcoming military band concert. There they encounter Grantby and a deal is struck for Radcliffe's return. \n\nThe exchange goes as planned but, as they are leaving, Palmer shoots a man in the shadows who turns out to be a [[CIA]] agent. Subsequently, another CIA operative threatens to kill Palmer if he discovers that the death was not a mistake. Some days later, it becomes clear that while Radcliffe is physically unharmed, his mind has been affected and he can no longer function as a scientist. Carswell has discovered a book titled \"'''I'''nduction of '''P'''sychoneuroses by '''C'''onditioned '''R'''eflex under Str'''ess'''\" - '''IPCRESS''' - which he believes explains what has happened to Radcliffe and the other scientists. Carswell borrows Palmer's car to test his theory on Radcliffe, but is shot before reaching him.\n\nBelieving that he himself must have been the intended target, Palmer goes home to collect his belongings and there discovers the body of the second CIA agent. When he returns to the office, the IPCRESS file is missing from his desk. Ross had previously asked him to [[microfilm]] the file and Palmer now believes that he is being set up. When he informs Dalby what has happened and that he suspects Ross, Dalby tells him to leave town for a while.\n\nOn the train to Paris, Palmer is kidnapped and wakes up imprisoned in a cell in [[Albania]]. After several days without sleep, food and warmth, Grantby reveals himself as his kidnapper. Having previously read the file, Palmer realises that they are preparing to [[brainwash]] him. He uses pain to distract himself, but after many sessions under stress from disorientating images and loud electronic sounds, he succumbs. Grantby then instills a trigger phrase that will make Palmer follow any commands given to him.\n\nPalmer eventually manages to escape and discovers that he is really still in London. He phones Dalby, who is in Grantby's company at the time. Dalby uses the trigger phrase and gets Palmer to call Ross to the warehouse where he had been held. As Dalby and Ross arrive, Palmer holds them both at gunpoint. Dalby accuses Ross of killing Carswell; Ross tells Palmer that he had been suspicious of Dalby and was investigating him. \n\nDalby now uses the trigger phrase again and tells Palmer to \"Shoot the traitor now\". As Palmer wavers, his hand strikes against a piece of equipment and the pain reminds him of his conditioning. Dalby goes for his gun and Palmer shoots him.\nRoss then remarks that, in choosing Palmer for the assignment, he had hoped that Palmer's tendency to insubordination would be useful. When Palmer reproaches Ross for endangering him, he is told that this is what he is paid for.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Michael Caine]] as [[Harry Palmer]]\n*[[Guy Doleman]] as [[Colonel Ross]]\n*[[Nigel Green]] as Major Dalby\n*[[Sue Lloyd]] as Jean Courtney\n*[[Gordon Jackson (actor)|Gordon Jackson]] as Carswell\n*[[Aubrey Richards]] as Dr. Radcliffe\n*[[Frank Gatliff]] as Eric Grantby (Bluejay)\n*[[Thomas Baptiste]] as Barney\n*[[Oliver MacGreevy]] as Housemartin\n*Freda Bamford as Alice\n*Pauline Winter as Charlady\n*Anthony Blackshaw as Edwards\n*Barry Raymond as Gray\n*[[David Glover (actor)|David Glover]] as Chilcott-Oakes\n*[[Stanley Meadows]] as Inspector Keightley\n*Peter Ashmore as Sir Robert \n*Michael Murray as Raid Inspector\n*Anthony Baird as Raid Sergeant \n*[[Tony Caunter]] as O.N.I. man\n*[[Douglas Blackwell]] as Murray\n*[[Glynn Edwards]] as Police Station Sergeant\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Harry Saltzman]] wanted ''The Ipcress File'' to be an ironic and downbeat alternative to the portrayal of espionage in [[Ian Fleming]]'s novels about the spy [[James Bond]] and the [[James Bond in film|film series]] which followed from them.<ref>{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=John|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/28/harry-saltzman-more-than-just-bond|title=The name's Saltzman, Harry Saltzman|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|date=28 September 2012|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Angelini\">{{cite news|last=Angelini|first=Sergio|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/459866/|title=Ipcress File, The (1965)|work=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=20 May 2018|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]}}</ref> Saltzman, who produced this film, was one of the producers of the early Bond films.

The city rests on a small [[karst]] plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including [[Mount Lov\u0107en]], the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography.\n\nCetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a center of Montenegrin life and both a cradle of [[Culture of Montenegro|Montenegrin culture]] and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious center. Its status as the honorary capital of Montenegro is due to its heritage as a long-serving former capital of Montenegro.\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], the town is known as  \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435 / ''Cetinje'' (archaically \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0463 / ''Cetin\u011b''); in [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''Cettigne''; in [[Greek language|Greek]] as \u039a\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7 (''Ket\u00edgni''); in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''\u00c7etince''; and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''Cetina''.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Founding===\nCetinje was founded in 1482, when [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] moved his capital from Obod above the [[Crnojevi\u0107 River]] to deeper into the hills to a more easily defended location in a field at the foot of [[Mount Lov\u0107en]]. He had his court built at the new location that year and also founded [[Old Cetinje Monastery|a monastery]] (dedicated to the Mother of Christ) as a personal endowment in 1484. His court and the monastery are the first recorded [[renaissance]] buildings in Montenegro.<ref name=\"DomljanKrle\u017ea.\">{{cite book|author1=\u017darko Domljan|author2=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea.\"|author3=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea\".|title=Likovna enciklopedija Jugoslavije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYufAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1984|publisher=Zavod|page=245|quote=Ivan Crnojevi\u0107 podigao dvorac, kasnije i crkvu zetske mitropolije... to su prvi datirani spomenici renesanse u Crnoj Gori}}</ref> Crnojevi\u0107 was forced to move the seat of the Eparchy of Zeta from [[Vranjina]] to Cetinje due to the Ottoman invasions, in 1485.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49>{{cite book|title=Glasnik Srpskog istorijsko-kulturnog dru\u0161tva \"Njego\u0161\"|volume=61\u201362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNjlAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Njego\u0161|page=49|quote=\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0432\u043e \u0412\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0408\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0443. \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 1485. \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u045b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0443\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435.}}</ref> The town was named after the Cetina river.\n\nThe bishopric of Zeta was elevated to a metropolitanate in Cetinje.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> It was later to play an important part in both the religious and national life.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> The [[Crnojevi\u0107 printing house]], the first printing house in southeastern Europe, was active between 1493 and 1496 in Cetinje.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frederick Bernard Singleton|title=A short history of the Yugoslav peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC&pg=PA30|accessdate=24 July 2011|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27485-2|pages=30\u2013}}</ref> Zeta was first put under Ottoman rule in 1499, then annexed by the Ottomans in 1514, organized into the [[Sanjak of Montenegro]].<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0106orovi\u0107|first=Vladimir|title=Istorija Jugoslavije|authorlink=Vladimir \u0106orovi\u0107|year=1933|publisher=Narodno Delo|location=Beograd|url=http://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_(%D0%92._%D0%8B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B)_3.11|accessdate=27 April 2011|language=Serbian|quote=\u0413\u043e\u0434. 1499. \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443. \u0410\u043b\u0438, \u0433\u043e\u0434. 1514. \u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043e \u0458\u043e\u0458 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0443, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0421\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430.}}</ref>\n\n===Early modern period===\n\nIn the next two centuries, the development of Cetinje stagnated. It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events.

The city rests on a small [[karst]] plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including [[Mount Lov\u0107en]], the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography.\n\nCetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a center of Montenegrin life and both a cradle of [[Culture of Montenegro|Montenegrin culture]] and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious center.

It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events. So the second half of the nineteenth century in the development of Cetinje marked period of state power and its pursuit of the European culture and international recognition. Recognition of Montenegro as an independent state, at the Berlin Congress in 1878., on the basis of which greatly expanded, he began a period of rapid creation of a national, economic, social, cultural, societal and spatial superstructure which caused increasing of economic power and the reorganization and improvement of the state apparatus and the authorities.

Designed by [[Douglas Ellington]], construction of the original building began in 1927 and was completed two years later. The modern addition was built in 1970 and a new cafeteria was finished in 2006. There is a second school located at the same address; the School of Inquiry and Life Sciences at Asheville (SILSA).\n\n==History==\nAfter the railroad system reached Asheville in 1881, the population of the city grew from 2,000 to 10,000. In response to this population influx, Asheville began a public School System in 1888, which originally consisted of a high school and three elementary schools. The elementary schools were the Orange Street School (currently occupied by NC DOT offices), Queen Carson Elementary School (currently occupied by a bus garage) and Montford Avenue School (replaced by the current William Randolph Elementary in the early 1950s).  The high school was located at the corner of Broadway and Woodfin Street, in what had been the private home of Nicholas Woodfin.  After use for educational purposes ceased about 1923 this structure was the downtown YMCA until a new structure was built further east on Woodfin about 1970, and the old building torn down.  The former high school campus is currently occupied by a bank.  The City of Asheville built two structures in the early 1920s, Hall Fletcher in West Asheville and David Millard, on Oak Street, adjacent to First Baptist Church, which, together, were known as Asheville High School.  The David Millard Campus occupied a portion of the grounds of a former girls' school, with the balance of the former school grounds covered by the Church.  Athletic teams and extracurricular clubs were drawn from both campuses.  The former site of David Millard is currently covered by One Oak Plaza and the extension of Charlotte Street, and the West Asheville campus is currently occupied by a new Hall Fletcher Elementary School.  The current University of North Carolina - Asheville began in 1927 as a two-year college, known as Asheville-Biltmore College, using classrooms on the ground floor of David Millard.\n\nThe population of Asheville continued to grow in the late 1920s. By 1926 the school board agreed that \"a large, central high school plant\" was needed.  A committee formed to locate a suitable location reported that it found \"only one site within the City of sufficient size, and of reasonable price \u2026 this tract of land lies between Victoria Road and the new McDowell Street.\"  Out of seven architects submitting proposals for the new high school, [[Douglas Ellington|Douglas D. Ellington]] was selected by majority vote.  In addition Dr. Nickolaus Louis Englehardt of [[Columbia University]] was hired as an advisor to the architect.  Dr. Englehardt had worked a great deal in school planning and design on a national level.  Ellington and Englehardt's collaboration made the new Asheville High a model facility in terms of architecture and educational offerings.  The former Asheville High School was renamed David Millard Junior High School and, together with Hall Fletcher, served as the city's junior high schools for a time.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nWith a cost of $1.3 million ($18.8 million in 2016 dollars) Asheville High School opened on February 5, 1929,<ref name=Ball/> with a dedication ceremony in the auditorium including as speakers the Mayor of Asheville, the superintendent of Asheville City Schools, [[Douglas Ellington]], Lee H. Edwards, the president of the PTA, the Headmaster of the [[Asheville School]] and the president of [[Duke University]].  When first opened, Asheville High had a wide variety of vocational programs including automotive mechanics, full print shops (all yearbooks, newspapers, and magazines were printed on-campus), mechanical drawing, and photography, including a darkroom.\n\nWhen the stock market crashed in September 1929, it took Asheville by surprise. This forced the programming for the schools, and indeed the city's economic well-being, to hit rock bottom.  For a time, Asheville High was closed, and students were removed to David Millard and Hall Fletcher. All extras were cut for a time, including much of the school's technical curriculum.  In 1935 the school was renamed Lee H.

In the early 1970s, a media center addition was added to the main building.
