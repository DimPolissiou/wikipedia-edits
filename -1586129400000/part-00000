As of August 2019, he has accumulated over 10 million followers across all social platforms (YouTube, Twitter and Instagram), over 1.4&nbsp;billion views<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/miniladdd|title=miniladdd YouTube Stats, Channel Statistics |website=socialblade.com|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>, and averages roughly 50,000 concurrent viewers during his live-streams. In September 2019, Thompson was named No. 3 out of the Top 100 Influencers in the UK by the ''Sunday Times''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-sunday-times-influencer-list-2019-meet-the-uks-top-100-hsmhv8dlp|title=The Sunday Times Influencer List 2019: meet the UK's top 100|last=Times|first=The Sunday|date=8 September 2019|access-date=18 September 2019|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n{{Advert section|date=September 2019}}\nCraig launched his first YouTube channel, \"Mini Ladd\", in May 2011, posting gaming-related content that has since evolved into more of a comedic angle. Craig's content is witty, relatable and on-trend with the always-evolving online culture. In 2018, he launched his second channel, \"Craig Thompson\", which focuses on vlog and personal content, along with occasional videos on his [[Reddit]] subpage. In 2019, he launched his third YouTube channel, \"Mini Ladd Vault\" (which was first registered in 2015), where he uploads old videos from his Mini Ladd channel that had previously been demonetised.  \n\nCraig is committed to philanthropic work, having raised over $150,000 for the Thirst Project<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shortyawards.com/4th-socialgood/craig-mini-ladd-thompson-and-the-thirst-project|title=Craig 'Mini Ladd' Thompson and Thirst Project \u2013 The Shorty Awards|website=shortyawards.com|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>, a non-profit that builds water wells in the poorest countries around the world. In addition to raising money, he also spent 2 weeks in Swaziland in November 2018 building the water wells his community raised money for. Due to his ongoing efforts for the organisation, in 2019, the Thirst Project named Craig as one of their Board Members<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thirstproject.org/about/our-board/|title=Our Board|website=Thirst Project|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> and awarded him with the \"Cameron Boyce Pioneering Spirit Award\" in October 2019. He has also donated large sums of money to organisations such as St. Jude, Macmillan Cancer Support and Northwest Counselling Ltd. Northwest Counseling's treasurer, Sean O'Kane, described Thompson's donation as a \"lifeline\" for the organisation.\n\nDue to his philanthropic efforts and growing celebrity, the [[City of Derry R.F.C.]] and his local rugby team renamed their stadium the \"[[Craig Thompson Stadium]]\" in his honour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.derryjournal.com/sport/other-sport/youtube-sensation-takes-city-of-derry-global-1-8251383|title=YouTube sensation takes City of Derry Global!|website=derryjournal.com|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.derrynow.com/sport/mini-ladd-becomes-mega-city-derry-rugby-club-sponsor/194412|title='Mini Ladd' becomes Mega City of Derry Rugby Club sponsor|last=Now|first=Derry|website=Derry Now|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n \nIn 2017, Thompson moved to Los Angeles to continue expanding his career, before moving to [[Portland, Oregon]] in 2019 (he would return to Los Angeles a year later). In June of the same year, Craig and fellow YouTuber Anthony \"BigJigglyPanda\" Brown announced a tour called \"The Demonetized Tour\", which would take place across North America (mainly the United States and Canada) from September until December.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/06/25/mini-ladd-bigjigglypanda-27-city-demonetized-tour/|title=Popular Gamers Mini Ladd And BigJigglyPanda To Embark On 27-City \u2018Demonetized\u2019 Tour|last=Weiss|first=Geoff|date=25 June 2019|website=Tubefilter|access-date=13 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://miniladd.net/|title=Mini Ladd|website=miniladd.net|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> In early 2020, Thompson confirmed that the tour could come to both Europe and Australia, although dates and cities are yet to be announced.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG36pYrujIo</ref>\n\nIn September 2019 Craig was named by the Sunday Times as one of Britain's top 100 influencers, behind [[KSI (entertainer)|KSI]] and [[PewDiePie]].<ref name=\"thet_TheS\">{{Cite web |title=The Sunday Times Influencer List 2019: meet the UK's top 100 |work=The Times |date=8 September 2019 |access-date=16 January 2020 |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-sunday-times-influencer-list-2019-meet-the-uks-top-100-hsmhv8dlp}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2019, Thompson won the eSports Content Creator of the Year award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esportznetwork.com/the-2019-esports-awards-winners/|title=The 2019 Esports Awards winners|date=17 November 2019|website=Esportz Network|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nThompson was born in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]] to an English father and a Northern Irish mother. He and his family moved to Northern Ireland, [[Eglinton, County Londonderry|Eglinton]],<!-- Please do not change Londonderry to Derry, as consistent with [[WP:LDERRY]] --> [[County Londonderry]], when he was ten years old. Before starting his online career, he was a student at [[Foyle College]], where he also played for the [[Rugby union|football]] team.\n\nIn February 2017, Thompson, alongside his friend and fellow YouTuber Jay, a.k.a. \"QwertyJaayy\", were hit by a [[Toyota Tacoma]] that had sped through a red light.

As of August 2019, he has accumulated over 10 million followers across all social platforms (YouTube, Twitter and Instagram), over 1.4&nbsp;billion views<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/miniladdd|title=miniladdd YouTube Stats, Channel Statistics |website=socialblade.com|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>, and averages roughly 50,000 concurrent viewers during his live-streams. In September 2019, Thompson was named No. 3 out of the Top 100 Influencers in the UK by the ''Sunday Times''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-sunday-times-influencer-list-2019-meet-the-uks-top-100-hsmhv8dlp|title=The Sunday Times Influencer List 2019: meet the UK's top 100|last=Times|first=The Sunday|date=8 September 2019|access-date=18 September 2019|issn=0140-0460}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n{{Advert section|date=September 2019}}\nCraig launched his first YouTube channel, \"Mini Ladd\", in May 2011, posting gaming-related content that has since evolved into more of a comedic angle. Craig's content is witty, relatable and on-trend with the always-evolving online culture. In 2018, he launched his second channel, \"Craig Thompson\", which focuses on vlog and personal content, along with occasional videos on his [[Reddit]] subpage. In 2019, he launched his third YouTube channel, \"Mini Ladd Vault\" (which was first registered in 2015), where he uploads old videos from his Mini Ladd channel that had previously been demonetised.  \n\nCraig is committed to philanthropic work, having raised over $150,000 for the Thirst Project<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shortyawards.com/4th-socialgood/craig-mini-ladd-thompson-and-the-thirst-project|title=Craig 'Mini Ladd' Thompson and Thirst Project \u2013 The Shorty Awards|website=shortyawards.com|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>, a non-profit that builds water wells in the poorest countries around the world. In addition to raising money, he also spent 2 weeks in Swaziland in November 2018 building the water wells his community raised money for. Due to his ongoing efforts for the organisation, in 2019, the Thirst Project named Craig as one of their Board Members<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thirstproject.org/about/our-board/|title=Our Board|website=Thirst Project|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> and awarded him with the \"Cameron Boyce Pioneering Spirit Award\" in October 2019. He has also donated large sums of money to organisations such as St. Jude, Macmillan Cancer Support and Northwest Counselling Ltd. Northwest Counseling's treasurer, Sean O'Kane, described Thompson's donation as a \"lifeline\" for the organisation.\n\nDue to his philanthropic efforts and growing celebrity, the [[City of Derry R.F.C.]] and his local rugby team renamed their stadium the \"[[Craig Thompson Stadium]]\" in his honour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.derryjournal.com/sport/other-sport/youtube-sensation-takes-city-of-derry-global-1-8251383|title=YouTube sensation takes City of Derry Global!|website=derryjournal.com|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.derrynow.com/sport/mini-ladd-becomes-mega-city-derry-rugby-club-sponsor/194412|title='Mini Ladd' becomes Mega City of Derry Rugby Club sponsor|last=Now|first=Derry|website=Derry Now|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref>\n \nIn 2017, Thompson moved to Los Angeles to continue expanding his career, before moving to [[Portland, Oregon]] in 2019 (he would return to Los Angeles a year later).

He and his family moved to Northern Ireland, [[Eglinton, County Londonderry|Eglinton]],<!-- Please do not change Londonderry to Derry, as consistent with [[WP:LDERRY]] --> [[County Londonderry]], when he was ten years old. Before starting his online career, he was a student at [[Foyle College]], where he also played for the [[Rugby union|football]] team.\n\nIn February 2017, Thompson, alongside his friend and fellow YouTuber Jay, a.k.a. \"QwertyJaayy\", were hit by a [[Toyota Tacoma]] that had sped through a red light. Thompson suffered severe bruising and a cracked spleen, and was sent to the hospital for four days.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "{{cleanup|date=April 2020|reason=Doubled-up reference section - should be refactored into short form citation (see [[WP:CITESHORT]] for details)}}\n\n'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the license of men in [[Islam]] to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit.
