The original French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein. Its English-language adaptation by producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] has been running in London since October 1985, making it the [[List of the longest-running West End shows|longest-running musical]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original Off-Broadway run of ''[[The Fantasticks]]''.\n\nSet in early [[France in the nineteenth century|19th-century France]], ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' is the story of [[Jean Valjean]], a French peasant, and his desire for redemption after serving nineteen years in jail for having stolen a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child. Valjean decides to break his parole and start his life anew after a bishop inspires him by a tremendous act of mercy, but he is relentlessly tracked down by a police inspector named [[Javert]]. Along the way, Valjean and a slew of characters are swept into a [[June Rebellion|revolutionary period]] in France, where a group of [[Friends of the ABC|young idealists]] attempt to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.\n\n==Background==\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was originally released as a French-language [[concept album]], and the first musical-stage adaptation of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was presented at the [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]] in 1980.<ref name=\"Behr1993\">{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of Les Miserables |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&pg=PA51 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |year=1993 |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-1-55970-156-3 |page=51}}</ref> However, the production closed after three months due to the expiry of the booking contract.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn 1983, about six months after producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] had opened ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], he received a copy of the French concept album from director Peter Farago. Farago had been impressed by the work and asked Mackintosh to produce an English-language version of the show. Initially reluctant, Mackintosh eventually agreed. Mackintosh, in conjunction with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], assembled a production team to adapt the French musical for a British audience. After two years in development, the English-language version opened in London on 8 October 1985, by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the [[Barbican Centre]], then the London home of the RSC. The success of the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical led to a Broadway production.\n\n==Critical reception and milestones==\n{{See also|Long-running musical theatre productions}}\nCritical reviews for ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' were initially negative.

It is usually cropped to a head-and-shoulders portrait, superimposed on the French flag. The image is based on an etching by [[Gustave Brion]], which in turn was based on the drawing by [[\u00c9mile Bayard]]. Bayard's drawing appeared in several of the novel's<!-- Novel or musical? --> earliest French-language editions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!--PLOT SHOULD BE OF THE MUSICAL ITSELF. DO NOT ADD DETAILS OF THE NOVEL AND ITS FILM ADAPTATIONS.-->\n\n===Act I===\nIn 1815 France, prisoners work at hard labor (\"Work Song\"). After 19 years in prison (five for stealing bread for his sister's starving son and her family, and the rest for trying to escape), [[Jean Valjean]], \"prisoner 24601\", is released on [[parole]] by the prison guard [[Javert]]. By law, Valjean must display a yellow [[ticket of leave]], which identifies him as an ex-convict (\"On Parole\"). As a convict, Valjean is shunned wherever he goes and cannot find regular work with decent wages or lodging, but the Bishop of [[Digne-les-Bains|Digne]] offers him food and shelter. Desperate and embittered, Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, angering a farmer and other merchants as he flees. He is captured by the police, but rather than turn him in, the Bishop lies and tells the police that the silver was a gift, giving Valjean a pair of silver candlesticks in addition. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver \"to become an honest man\" and that he has \"bought (Valjean's) soul for God\" (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Ashamed and humbled by the Bishop's kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem his sins (\"Valjean's Soliloquy\" / \"What Have I Done?\"). He tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole but giving himself a chance to start a new life free from the stigma of his criminal past.\n\nEight years later, in 1823, Valjean has assumed a new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. [[Fantine]] is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter [[Cosette]], who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labours in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes it out on the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers use the incident as a pretence to fire Fantine (\"At the End of the Day\"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both (\"[[I Dreamed a Dream]]\"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"), and attracts local sailors. When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realises she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nSoon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man, Fauchelevent, who is pinned by a runaway cart (\"The Runaway Cart\"). Javert, who has up until now not recognised Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is about to go to trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realises that this case of mistaken identity could free him forever, but he is not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court (\"Who Am I?\u2014The Trial\"). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her (\"Come to Me (Fantine's Death)\"). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (\"The Confrontation\").\n\nIn [[Montfermeil]], the duplicitous innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, [[\u00c9ponine]]. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (\"Castle on a Cloud\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and live a life of criminal depravity (\"Master of the House\"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Th\u00e9nardiers payment to adopt her (\"The Bargain\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nNine years later, in 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only man in the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries [[Marius Pontmercy]] and [[Enjolras]], who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Th\u00e9nardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang which consists of thugs Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse; the Th\u00e9nardier's daughter \u00c9ponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin [[Gavroche]], who knows everything that happens in the slums (\"Look Down\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier suddenly recognises Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed in Paris, comes to the rescue (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Th\u00e9nardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars \u2013 which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin \u2013 that he will find Valjean and recapture him (\"Stars\"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\").\n\nAt a small caf\u00e9, Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasising about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving [[Grantaire]] (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9\u2014Red and Black\"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realise that they can use the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past (\"Rue Plumet\u2014In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine leads Marius to Cosette's garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love, while a heartbroken \u00c9ponine watches them through the garden gate and laments that Marius has fallen in love with another (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but \u00c9ponine stops them by screaming a warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.\n\nOn the eve of the [[June Rebellion|1832 Paris Uprising]], Valjean prepares to go into exile; Cosette and Marius part in despair; Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution as he and the other students prepare for battle; \u00c9ponine acknowledges despairingly that Marius will never love her; Marius is conflicted whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising; Javert reveals his plans to spy on the students; and the Th\u00e9nardiers scheme to profit off the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate what the dawn will bring (\"One Day More\").<ref name=\"mastersbbc\" />\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Owen-Jones]] as Jean Valjean]]\nAs the students build a barricade to serve as their rally point, Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to \"spy\" on the government troops. Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels and, wanting to keep her away from the impending violence, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette. (\"Building the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\") Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. \u00c9ponine walks the streets of Paris alone, imagining that Marius is there with her, but laments that her love for Marius will never be reciprocated (\"On My Own\").\n\nThe French army arrives at the barricade and demands that the students surrender (\"At the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\"). Though Javert tells the students that the government will not attack that night (\"Javert's Arrival\"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert (\"Little People\"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. \u00c9ponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (\"A Little Fall of Rain\"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over the death of his best friend. Valjean arrives at the barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier (\"Night of Anguish\"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras to be the one to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty (\"The First Attack\").\n\nThe students settle down for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius to get some sleep, knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing \u00c9ponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (\"Drink with Me\"). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realises that the people of Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kills Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies on the other side of the barricade (\"The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche\"). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting \"Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!\". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers (\"The Final Battle\"). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, and finds the open sewer grating.\n\nValjean carries Marius through the sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is unconscious, Th\u00e9nardier, who has been looting bodies (\"Dog Eats Dog\"), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognises) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with his conception of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but no longer able to hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]] (\"Soliloquy/Javert's Suicide\").\n\nIn the wake of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (\"Turning\") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing (\"Every Day\"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (\"Valjean's Confession\"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry (\"Wedding Chorale\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers  [[Gate crashing#Wedding crashing|crash]] the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Th\u00e9nardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Th\u00e9nardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realises that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Th\u00e9nardier a punch in the face). The Th\u00e9nardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (\"Beggars at the Feast\").\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits his death, having nothing left to live for. The spirit of Fantine appears to him and tells him that he has been forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (\"Epilogue \u2013 Valjean's Death\"). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God.\" They are joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, who sing that in the next world, God lays low all tyranny and frees all oppressed people from their shackles (\"Do You Hear The People Sing? (Reprise)\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{Main|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Act I\n|-\n! !! width=\"34%\" | Song !!

While the touring production and the New York production were running simultaneously, the staff, cast members, crew, and musicians of the two productions interchanged often, which contributed to keeping both companies of the show in form. When the New York production closed in 2003, the Third National Tour continued for another three years, and enjoyed the influx of many members from the original and subsequent New York companies.\n\nThe First National Tour opened at Boston's Shubert Theatre on 12 December 1987, and continued to play major cities until late 1991. The Second National Tour (called \"The Fantine Company\") opened at Los Angeles' Shubert Theatre on 1 June 1988. The production played for fourteen months then transferred to San Francisco's Curran Theatre where it enjoyed a similar run. The Third National Tour of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (called \"The Marius Company\") was one of the longest running American touring musical productions. Opening on 28 November 1988, at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida, and closing on 23 July 2006, at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref>{{cite web |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131122193641/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2013 |title=Les Miz Tour's Final Stop Announced; Meet It in St. Louis |publisher=Playbill |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> the tour ran for seventeen years and 7,061 performances. The tour played in 145 cities in 43 states. The same touring company also frequently performed in Canada, made a 1994 diversion to Singapore, and another diversion in 2002 to be the first Western musical production to visit China, opening in Shanghai's Grand Theatre for a three-week engagement.\n\nAll US productions (including Broadway and its revival) were visually identical in scale and design but the third national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5&nbsp;million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up and ready to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.\n\nA new national tour began on 21 September 2017 at the Providence Performing Arts Centre (PPAC). It starred Nick Cartell as Valjean, Josh Davis as Javert, Melissa Mitchell as Fantine, J. Anthony Crane as Th\u00e9nardier, Allison Guinn as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Joshua Grosso as Marius, Phoenix Best as \u00c9ponine, Matt Shingledecker as Enjolras and Jillian Butler as Cosette. The roles of young Cosette and \u00c9ponine were shared by Zoe Glick and Sophie Knapp, while the role of Gavroche was shared by Jordan Cole and Julian Lerner. It uses much of the staging and technical work of the 2014 Broadway revival.<ref name=\"US 2017/18 Tour Dates\">{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=331855 |title=Les Miserables - US Tour Schedule |website=BroadwayWorld.com |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== UK and Ireland tours ====\n=====1992\u20131993 Tour=====\nThe first tour of the UK and Ireland opened at the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester]] 14 April 1992<ref name=This_day1>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1992/april/14 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> with Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), Philip Quast (Javert, later replaced by [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]])<ref name=YouTube_Burman>{{cite AV media |people=Manchester cast: Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]] (Javert), Richard Burman (Marius), Sarah Ryan (Cosette), [[Meredith Braun]] (\u00c9ponine), [[Daniel Coll]] (Enjolras), Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), [[Louise Plowright]] (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier) |date=20 November 1992 |title=BBC Children in Need (regional: North West)  | trans-title = One Day More |medium=Television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN3FGklAlfk |accessdate=12 August 2016 |time= |location=Manchester |publisher=Richard Burman: [[YouTube]]}}</ref> Ria Jones (Fantine), Meredith Braun (\u00c9ponine), Mike Sterling (Marius, later replaced by Richard Burman),<ref name=\"YouTube_Burman\" /> Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), Louise Plowright (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Sarah Ryan (Cosette) and Daniel Coll (Enjolras).<ref name=Telegraph_180492>{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Michael |title=Les Miserables - review |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 April 1992}}</ref><ref name=Manchester_CD>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Highlights from Les Mis\u00e9rables, Manchester Company |year=1992 |last1=Leyton |first1=Jeff (Jean Valjean) |last2=Quast |first2=Philip (Javert) |last3=Sterling |first3=Mike (Marius) |last4=Braun |first4=Meredith (\u00c9ponine) |last5=Jones |first5=Ria (Fantine) |publisher=First Night Records |asin=B000026YOI |id=Barcode: 5014636503427 |url=http://first-night-records.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=&products_id=109}}</ref> The production then moved on to the [[Point Theatre]], Dublin, Ireland, opening 30 June 1993,<ref name=This_day2>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/june/30 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> and then to [[Edinburgh Playhouse|Playhouse, Edinburgh]], Scotland, opening 23 September 1993.<ref name=This_day3>{{cite web |title=What Happened on September 23rd, 1993 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/september/23 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====1997\u20132000 Tour=====\nIn 1997 a second tour began at the [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], running from 6 May until 14 June,<ref name=UKTW_Plymouth>{{cite web |title=Les Miserables: Theatre Royal, Plymouth |url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/Plymouth/Theatre-Royal/Musical/Les-Miserables/L921466477/ |website=uktw.co.uk |publisher=UK Theatre Web |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> the cast featured: Stig Rossen (Jean Valjean), Michael McCarthy (Javert), Julia Worsley (Fantine), Gemma Sandy (\u00c9ponine), Norman Bowman (Marius), Cameron Blakely (Th\u00e9nardier), Cathy Breeze (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Rebecca Vere (Cosette) and Mark O'Malley (Enjolras).<ref name=Plymouth_programme>{{cite book |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables programme: Plymouth |url=http://www.ebay.ie/itm/272257057835 |publisher=John Good Holbrook Ltd |year=1997}}</ref> The tour then continued as detailed in the table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px;\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Cast details\n|-\n!

The original French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein. Its English-language adaptation by producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] has been running in London since October 1985, making it the [[List of the longest-running West End shows|longest-running musical]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original Off-Broadway run of ''[[The Fantasticks]]''.\n\nSet in early [[France in the nineteenth century|19th-century France]], ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' is the story of [[Jean Valjean]], a French peasant, and his desire for redemption after serving nineteen years in jail for having stolen a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child. Valjean decides to break his parole and start his life anew after a bishop inspires him by a tremendous act of mercy, but he is relentlessly tracked down by a police inspector named [[Javert]]. Along the way, Valjean and a slew of characters are swept into a [[June Rebellion|revolutionary period]] in France, where a group of [[Friends of the ABC|young idealists]] attempt to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.\n\n==Background==\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was originally released as a French-language [[concept album]], and the first musical-stage adaptation of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was presented at the [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]] in 1980.<ref name=\"Behr1993\">{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of Les Miserables |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&pg=PA51 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |year=1993 |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-1-55970-156-3 |page=51}}</ref> However, the production closed after three months due to the expiry of the booking contract.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn 1983, about six months after producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] had opened ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], he received a copy of the French concept album from director Peter Farago. Farago had been impressed by the work and asked Mackintosh to produce an English-language version of the show. Initially reluctant, Mackintosh eventually agreed. Mackintosh, in conjunction with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], assembled a production team to adapt the French musical for a British audience. After two years in development, the English-language version opened in London on 8 October 1985, by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the [[Barbican Centre]], then the London home of the RSC. The success of the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical led to a Broadway production.\n\n==Critical reception and milestones==\n{{See also|Long-running musical theatre productions}}\nCritical reviews for ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' were initially negative. At the opening of the London production, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Francis King described the musical as \"a lurid Victorian melodrama produced with Victorian lavishness\" and Michael Ratcliffe of ''[[The Observer]]'' considered the show \"a witless and synthetic entertainment\", while literary scholars condemned the project for converting classic [[literature]] into a musical.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news |last=Billington |first=Michael |title=Twenty-five years on, they ask me if I was wrong about Les Mis\u00e9rables ... |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/sep/21/les-miserables-25-year-anniversary |publisher=The Guardian Newspaper Online |accessdate=31 January 2013 |location=London |date=21 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Neon Tommy\">{{cite web |last=Kehe |first=Jason |title=Theater Review: \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" At The Ahmanson |url=http://www.neontommy.com/news/2011/06/theater-review-les-mis-rables-ahmanson |publisher=USC Annenberg |accessdate=31 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619041019/http://www.neontommy.com/news/2011/06/theater-review-les-mis-rables-ahmanson|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Public opinion differed: the box office received record orders.

It is usually cropped to a head-and-shoulders portrait, superimposed on the French flag. The image is based on an etching by [[Gustave Brion]], which in turn was based on the drawing by [[\u00c9mile Bayard]]. Bayard's drawing appeared in several of the novel's<!-- Novel or musical? --> earliest French-language editions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!--PLOT SHOULD BE OF THE MUSICAL ITSELF. DO NOT ADD DETAILS OF THE NOVEL AND ITS FILM ADAPTATIONS.-->\n\n===Act I===\nIn 1815 France, prisoners work at hard labor (\"Work Song\"). After 19 years in prison (five for stealing bread for his sister's starving son and her family, and the rest for trying to escape), [[Jean Valjean]], \"prisoner 24601\", is released on [[parole]] by the prison guard [[Javert]]. By law, Valjean must display a yellow [[ticket of leave]], which identifies him as an ex-convict (\"On Parole\"). As a convict, Valjean is shunned wherever he goes and cannot find regular work with decent wages or lodging, but the Bishop of [[Digne-les-Bains|Digne]] offers him food and shelter. Desperate and embittered, Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, angering a farmer and other merchants as he flees. He is captured by the police, but rather than turn him in, the Bishop lies and tells the police that the silver was a gift, giving Valjean a pair of silver candlesticks in addition. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver \"to become an honest man\" and that he has \"bought (Valjean's) soul for God\" (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Ashamed and humbled by the Bishop's kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem his sins (\"Valjean's Soliloquy\" / \"What Have I Done?\"). He tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole but giving himself a chance to start a new life free from the stigma of his criminal past.\n\nEight years later, in 1823, Valjean has assumed a new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. [[Fantine]] is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter [[Cosette]], who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labours in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes it out on the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers use the incident as a pretence to fire Fantine (\"At the End of the Day\"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both (\"[[I Dreamed a Dream]]\"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"), and attracts local sailors. When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realises she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nSoon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man, Fauchelevent, who is pinned by a runaway cart (\"The Runaway Cart\"). Javert, who has up until now not recognised Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is about to go to trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realises that this case of mistaken identity could free him forever, but he is not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court (\"Who Am I?\u2014The Trial\"). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her (\"Come to Me (Fantine's Death)\"). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (\"The Confrontation\").\n\nIn [[Montfermeil]], the duplicitous innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, [[\u00c9ponine]]. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (\"Castle on a Cloud\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and live a life of criminal depravity (\"Master of the House\"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Th\u00e9nardiers payment to adopt her (\"The Bargain\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nNine years later, in 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only man in the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries [[Marius Pontmercy]] and [[Enjolras]], who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Th\u00e9nardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang which consists of thugs Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse; the Th\u00e9nardier's daughter \u00c9ponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin [[Gavroche]], who knows everything that happens in the slums (\"Look Down\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier suddenly recognises Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed in Paris, comes to the rescue (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Th\u00e9nardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars \u2013 which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin \u2013 that he will find Valjean and recapture him (\"Stars\"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\").\n\nAt a small caf\u00e9, Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasising about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving [[Grantaire]] (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9\u2014Red and Black\"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realise that they can use the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past (\"Rue Plumet\u2014In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine leads Marius to Cosette's garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love, while a heartbroken \u00c9ponine watches them through the garden gate and laments that Marius has fallen in love with another (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but \u00c9ponine stops them by screaming a warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.\n\nOn the eve of the [[June Rebellion|1832 Paris Uprising]], Valjean prepares to go into exile; Cosette and Marius part in despair; Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution as he and the other students prepare for battle; \u00c9ponine acknowledges despairingly that Marius will never love her; Marius is conflicted whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising; Javert reveals his plans to spy on the students; and the Th\u00e9nardiers scheme to profit off the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate what the dawn will bring (\"One Day More\").<ref name=\"mastersbbc\" />\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Owen-Jones]] as Jean Valjean]]\nAs the students build a barricade to serve as their rally point, Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to \"spy\" on the government troops. Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels and, wanting to keep her away from the impending violence, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette. (\"Building the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\") Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. \u00c9ponine walks the streets of Paris alone, imagining that Marius is there with her, but laments that her love for Marius will never be reciprocated (\"On My Own\").\n\nThe French army arrives at the barricade and demands that the students surrender (\"At the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\"). Though Javert tells the students that the government will not attack that night (\"Javert's Arrival\"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert (\"Little People\"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. \u00c9ponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (\"A Little Fall of Rain\"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over the death of his best friend. Valjean arrives at the barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier (\"Night of Anguish\"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras to be the one to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty (\"The First Attack\").\n\nThe students settle down for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius to get some sleep, knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing \u00c9ponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (\"Drink with Me\"). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realises that the people of Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kills Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies on the other side of the barricade (\"The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche\"). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting \"Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!\". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers (\"The Final Battle\"). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, and finds the open sewer grating.\n\nValjean carries Marius through the sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is unconscious, Th\u00e9nardier, who has been looting bodies (\"Dog Eats Dog\"), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognises) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with his conception of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but no longer able to hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]] (\"Soliloquy/Javert's Suicide\").\n\nIn the wake of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (\"Turning\") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing (\"Every Day\"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (\"Valjean's Confession\"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry (\"Wedding Chorale\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers  [[Gate crashing#Wedding crashing|crash]] the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Th\u00e9nardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Th\u00e9nardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realises that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Th\u00e9nardier a punch in the face). The Th\u00e9nardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (\"Beggars at the Feast\").\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits his death, having nothing left to live for. The spirit of Fantine appears to him and tells him that he has been forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (\"Epilogue \u2013 Valjean's Death\"). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God.\" They are joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, who sing that in the next world, God lays low all tyranny and frees all oppressed people from their shackles (\"Do You Hear The People Sing? (Reprise)\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{Main|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Act I\n|-\n! !! width=\"34%\" | Song !!

After being released from imprisonment for serving nineteen years (five for stealing a loaf of bread and fourteen for multiple escape attempts), he breaks parole and, after receiving mercy from Bishop Myriel, turns his life around to live for God, showing the effects of God's grace that bring a corrupt man into virtuous and selfless living.

Minor changes included colourful projections blended into its existing lighting design, and a [[proscenium]] that extended out into the first two boxes on either side of the stage.\n\nSome cuts made to the show's prologue during its original Broadway run were restored, lyrics for Gavroche's death scene (known in the revival as \"Ten Little Bullets\") cut during the development of the original London production were restored, and much of the show was re-orchestrated by Christopher Jahnke, introducing a snare and timpani-heavy sound played by a 14-member band, a reduction of about 8 musicians from the original production's 22 musician orchestration.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe original 2006 Broadway revival cast included [[Alexander Gemignani]] as Jean Valjean, [[Norm Lewis]] as Javert, [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Fantine, [[Celia Keenan-Bolger]] as \u00c9ponine, [[Aaron Lazar]] as Enjolras, Adam Jacobs as Marius, [[Ali Ewoldt]] as Cosette, [[Gary Beach]] as Th\u00e9nardier, [[Jenny Galloway]] as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Brian D\u2019Addario, Jacob Levine, Skye Rainforth and Austyn Myers as Gavroche, and Tess Adams, Kylie Liya Goldstein and [[Carly Rose Sonenclar]] as Young Cosette/Young \u00c9ponine.

While the touring production and the New York production were running simultaneously, the staff, cast members, crew, and musicians of the two productions interchanged often, which contributed to keeping both companies of the show in form. When the New York production closed in 2003, the Third National Tour continued for another three years, and enjoyed the influx of many members from the original and subsequent New York companies.\n\nThe First National Tour opened at Boston's Shubert Theatre on 12 December 1987, and continued to play major cities until late 1991. The Second National Tour (called \"The Fantine Company\") opened at Los Angeles' Shubert Theatre on 1 June 1988. The production played for fourteen months then transferred to San Francisco's Curran Theatre where it enjoyed a similar run. The Third National Tour of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (called \"The Marius Company\") was one of the longest running American touring musical productions. Opening on 28 November 1988, at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida, and closing on 23 July 2006, at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref>{{cite web |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131122193641/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2013 |title=Les Miz Tour's Final Stop Announced; Meet It in St. Louis |publisher=Playbill |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> the tour ran for seventeen years and 7,061 performances. The tour played in 145 cities in 43 states. The same touring company also frequently performed in Canada, made a 1994 diversion to Singapore, and another diversion in 2002 to be the first Western musical production to visit China, opening in Shanghai's Grand Theatre for a three-week engagement.\n\nAll US productions (including Broadway and its revival) were visually identical in scale and design but the third national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5&nbsp;million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up and ready to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.\n\nA new national tour began on 21 September 2017 at the Providence Performing Arts Centre (PPAC). It starred Nick Cartell as Valjean, Josh Davis as Javert, Melissa Mitchell as Fantine, J. Anthony Crane as Th\u00e9nardier, Allison Guinn as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Joshua Grosso as Marius, Phoenix Best as \u00c9ponine, Matt Shingledecker as Enjolras and Jillian Butler as Cosette. The roles of young Cosette and \u00c9ponine were shared by Zoe Glick and Sophie Knapp, while the role of Gavroche was shared by Jordan Cole and Julian Lerner.

Recorded in 1985, when the show premiered, it is closest to the original French concept album. For example, \"Stars\" appears before \"Look Down\" and shortly after, the original version of \"Little People\" plays, which was later incorporated into the revealing of Javert. It also features a song titled \"I Saw Him Once\", sung by Cosette, which was later incorporated into the first part of \"In My Life\".

It included several changes to the songs that are still evident in today's performances. As with its predecessor, it is incomplete, and leaves out songs or parts that are more important narratively than musically (e.g., \"Fantine's Arrest\", \"The Runaway Cart\", \"The Final Battle\").

(The Czech Revival Recording is the only other album, in any language, to feature the entire score; on the other hand, the four 2003 Japanese recordings feature the entire score after the cuts first made on Broadway at the end of 2000.)

All parts were sung live, giving the performance a different mood from other recording. The score was recorded consecutively without pauses or multiple recordings. The concert's encores are also included. As with the original recordings, however, they differed from the stage versions by excluding some songs (e.g., those vital to plot such as \"Fantine's Arrest\" and \"The Runaway Cart\" were kept, while unnecessary or complex songs, such as \"At the Barricade\", were left out).\n\nThe cast includes Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Philip Quast as Javert, [[Ruthie Henshall]] as Fantine, Alun Armstrong as Th\u00e9nardier, [[Jenny Galloway]] as Mme.

This recording featured new arrangements and reinspired orchestrations, and included [[John Owen-Jones]] as Valjean, [[Earl Carpenter]] as Javert, [[Madalena Alberto]] as Fantine, [[Ashley Artus]] as M.

Although the [[Boston Celtics]] had the second-worst record in the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] and the best odds (36 percent) of winning the lottery with two picks, the Spurs, usually a model of winning and consistency, lost [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Sean Elliott]] to injury early in the season, finished with the third-worst record, and subsequently won the lottery. Leading up to the draft, there was no doubt that [[Tim Duncan]] would be selected at No. 1 by the Spurs, and the rest of the draft was regarded with some skepticism.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2007/05/21/luck_of_draw_went_spurs_way_in_97_with_duncan Peter May.

''Boston Globe'']</ref> The Celtics had the third and sixth picks, selecting [[Chauncey Billups]] and [[Ron Mercer]], both of whom were traded in the next two years.\n\nThe [[Washington Wizards]] forfeited their 1997 first-round pick in connection with the signing of [[Juwan Howard]]. (Washington would have had the 17th pick.)

Although the [[Boston Celtics]] had the second-worst record in the [[1996\u201397 NBA season|1996\u201397 season]] and the best odds (36 percent) of winning the lottery with two picks, the Spurs, usually a model of winning and consistency, lost [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] and [[Sean Elliott]] to injury early in the season, finished with the third-worst record, and subsequently won the lottery. Leading up to the draft, there was no doubt that [[Tim Duncan]] would be selected at No. 1 by the Spurs, and the rest of the draft was regarded with some skepticism.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2007/05/21/luck_of_draw_went_spurs_way_in_97_with_duncan Peter May.

(Washington would have had the 17th pick.)

{"title_page": "Exit the King", "text_new": "{{original research|date=March 2019}}\n{{italic title}}\n[[Image:ExitTheKing.jpg|thumb|First English edition cover <br>(publ. [[Grove Press]]) ]]\n\n'''''Exit the King''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le Roi se meurt'''}}) is an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist drama]] by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] that premiered in 1962. It is the third in Ionesco's \"Berenger Cycle\", preceded by ''[[Tueur sans gages|The Killer]]'' (1958) and [[Rhinoceros (play)|''Rhinoc\u00e9ros'']] (1959), and followed by ''A Stroll in the Air'' (1963).\n\n==Plot==\n'''THE SUNGUS DIPPED''' *crying noises*\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n''Exit the King'' is unusual among Ionesco's works in that the plot is linear and focuses on depletion rather than accumulation.  Often in Ionesco's plays, the stage is filled with more and more objects or characters; in ''Rhinoceros'', for example, there are gradually more and more rhinoceroses.  In this play, however, the kingdom and all the characters slowly disappear.  Likewise, the language is generally more straight forward and comprehensible, eschewing Ionesco's tendency toward abundant clich\u00e9s and nonsense.  Ionesco told Claude Bonnefoy in a 1966 interview that ''Exit the King'' did not \"originate in a dream\" as many of his plays did, but was \"much more consciously composed.  People immediately said: 'Oh! He\u2019s given up the [[avant-garde]], he\u2019s turning classical!'  It wasn\u2019t a question of choosing between classicism and the avant-garde.  I had quite simply written in a different style because I was on a different level of consciousness\".\n\nIonesco also said the play was composed while he was ill and frightened of death.  He was inspired partly by a childhood obsession with death in which Ionesco believed one could simply avoid being sick and live forever.  ''Exit the King'' was written to be a kind of lesson in death: \"I told myself that one could learn to die, that I could learn to die, that one can also help other people to die.  This seems to me to be the most important thing we can do, since we\u2019re all of us dying men who refuse to die.  This play is an attempt at an apprenticeship in dying\".<ref>Bonnefoy, Claude. ''Conversations with Ionesco''. Trans. Jan Dawson. New York: Hold, Rinehart and Winston, 1971. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nLes Essif in ''Empty Figure on an Empty Stage'' points out that ''Exit the King'' comes closest of all Ionesco's plays to the paradigm of absurdism established by [[Samuel Beckett]].  Though Beckett and Ionesco are commonly grouped together under the name \"Theatre of the Absurd\" because of their shared themes of alienation and the difficulty of communication, Beckett's plays generally present a stripped down, minimalist tableau whereas Ionesco presents a proliferation of chaos.  According to Essif, ''Exit the King'' is Ionesco's most Beckettian play: \"The image of an exterior world fades in cadence with the protagonist\u2019s surrender to the interiority of his consciousness, that is, with the increasing intensification of his inward-turning.  The vertical axis of the subjective abyss runs counter to the horizontality of the external world\".<ref>Essif, Les. Empty Figure on an Empty Stage. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2001. 106, 109.</ref>\n\n==Productions==\n\nIt was first presented in London by the [[English Stage Company]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in 1963. It premiered on 12 September 1963 and starred [[Alec Guinness]] as the King, [[Googie Withers]] as Queen Marguerite, [[Natasha Parry]] as Queen Marie and [[Eileen Atkins]] as Juliette. It was directed by [[George Devine]].<ref>Samuel French.

[[Grove Press]]) ]]\n\n'''''Exit the King''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le Roi se meurt'''}}) is an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist drama]] by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] that premiered in 1962. It is the third in Ionesco's \"Berenger Cycle\", preceded by ''[[Tueur sans gages|The Killer]]'' (1958) and [[Rhinoceros (play)|''Rhinoc\u00e9ros'']] (1959), and followed by ''A Stroll in the Air'' (1963).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the other plays of the \"Berenger Cycle\", Berenger appears as a depressed and insecure [[everyman]] who is prone to sentimentality.  In ''Exit the King'', he is the [[solipsism|solipsistic]] and belligerent King Berenger the First who was apparently at one point able to command nature and force others to obey his will. According to his first wife he is over four hundred years old.  He is informed early in the play that he is dying, and the kingdom is likewise crumbling around him.  He has lost the power to control his surroundings and is slowly losing his physical capabilities as well.  Through much of the play, he is in denial of his death and refuses to give up power.  Berenger's first wife, Marguerite, along with the Doctor, tries to make Berenger face the reality of his impending death.  Berenger's second wife, Marie, sympathetically attempts to keep Berenger from the pain of knowing his death is imminent.  The king lapses into Berenger's normal sentimentality and eventually accepts that he is going to die.  The characters disappear one by one, eventually leaving the king, now speechless, alone with Marguerite who prepares him for the end.  Marguerite and then the king disappear into darkness as the play ends.\n\n== Analysis ==\n\n''Exit the King'' is unusual among Ionesco's works in that the plot is linear and focuses on depletion rather than accumulation.  Often in Ionesco's plays, the stage is filled with more and more objects or characters; in ''Rhinoceros'', for example, there are gradually more and more rhinoceroses.  In this play, however, the kingdom and all the characters slowly disappear.  Likewise, the language is generally more straight forward and comprehensible, eschewing Ionesco's tendency toward abundant clich\u00e9s and nonsense.  Ionesco told Claude Bonnefoy in a 1966 interview that ''Exit the King'' did not \"originate in a dream\" as many of his plays did, but was \"much more consciously composed.  People immediately said: 'Oh! He\u2019s given up the [[avant-garde]], he\u2019s turning classical!'  It wasn\u2019t a question of choosing between classicism and the avant-garde.  I had quite simply written in a different style because I was on a different level of consciousness\".\n\nIonesco also said the play was composed while he was ill and frightened of death.  He was inspired partly by a childhood obsession with death in which Ionesco believed one could simply avoid being sick and live forever.  ''Exit the King'' was written to be a kind of lesson in death: \"I told myself that one could learn to die, that I could learn to die, that one can also help other people to die.  This seems to me to be the most important thing we can do, since we\u2019re all of us dying men who refuse to die.  This play is an attempt at an apprenticeship in dying\".<ref>Bonnefoy, Claude. ''Conversations with Ionesco''. Trans. Jan Dawson. New York: Hold, Rinehart and Winston, 1971. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nLes Essif in ''Empty Figure on an Empty Stage'' points out that ''Exit the King'' comes closest of all Ionesco's plays to the paradigm of absurdism established by [[Samuel Beckett]].  Though Beckett and Ionesco are commonly grouped together under the name \"Theatre of the Absurd\" because of their shared themes of alienation and the difficulty of communication, Beckett's plays generally present a stripped down, minimalist tableau whereas Ionesco presents a proliferation of chaos.  According to Essif, ''Exit the King'' is Ionesco's most Beckettian play: \"The image of an exterior world fades in cadence with the protagonist\u2019s surrender to the interiority of his consciousness, that is, with the increasing intensification of his inward-turning.  The vertical axis of the subjective abyss runs counter to the horizontality of the external world\".<ref>Essif, Les. Empty Figure on an Empty Stage.

Acting as the company's mascot, as well as being the eponymous protagonist of the series, Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Indian plumber who resides in the Drugshroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center upon rescuing Princess Fruit from the Koopa villain Internet Browser. His fraternal twin brother and sidekick is Lugi.\n\nWith more than 600 million units sold worldwide, the overall Mario franchise is the best-selling video game franchise of all time.[2][3] Outside of the Super Mario platform series, other Mario genres include the Mario Shopping Cart racing series, sports games such as the Mario Tennis and Mario Golf series, role-playing games such as Mario & Lugi, Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario, and educational games such as Mario Is Dead!, Mario's Time Machine and Mario Teaches Typing. The franchise has branched into several media, including television shows, film, comics, and licensed merchandise. Since 1990, Mario has been voiced by Charles Martinet.\n\n==Works==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Game title\n! scope=\"col\" | Role\n|-\n|2015||''[[Undertale]]''||Writer, composer, director, designer, programmer\n|-\n|2016||''Rose of Winter''||Composer\n|-\n|2017||''[[Hiveswap]]''||Composer\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2018||''[[Deltarune]]''||Writer, composer, director, designer, programmer\n|-\n|''[[Hiveswap Friendsim]]''||Guest composer\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |2019||''Escaped Chasm''||Composer\n|-\n|''[[YIIK: A Postmodern RPG]]''||Guest composer\n|-\n|''[[Super Smash Bros.
