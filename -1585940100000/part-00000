The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix plans to release the game as a multi-part series, with the first entry scheduled for release for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control [[mercenary]] [[Cloud Strife]] as he and a group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose Shinra, a [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines real-time action similar to ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''{{citation needed}} with other strategic elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced following years of fan requests and rumors. Key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. They also added content not seen in the original, and redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' retells [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier who joins the AVALANCHE [[eco-terrorist]] group as a mercenary to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks.

Producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that while the game has more real-time elements, there would still be strategic elements, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'}}s action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system will draw from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[Norm (social)|social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The team was also planning to include references to events detailed in the ''Compilation'' titles, though what form these references will take and their scope is still under consideration.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura later clarified that, as of early 2017, ''Remake'' does not share a direct continuity with the ''Compilation''.<ref name=\"FinaNomuraInterview\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game was to be fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nThe subtitle \"''Remake''\" was included to differentiate the game from its 1997 original. It was initially going to be story-related, but the team did not want to give the impression that it was a sequel or spin-off.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Rather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura is in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari is in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling is being supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with \"Enlighten,\" a lighting engine licensed from software company [[Geomerics]].<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]]: while their expertise was appreciated, the two companies needed to keep in close contact due to very different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n==Release==\nRumors of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' remake appeared in 2014.<ref name=\"RemakeRumor\"/> It was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) during the [[PlayStation]] conference, and received a standing ovation.<ref name=\"GSremake\"/><ref name=\"4Govation\"/> [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\" /> Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the [[YouTube]] release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks.<ref name=\"IGNstocks\" /><ref name=\"VIIRtrailer\" /> The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.<ref name=\"WiredPSE\"/>\n\nDuring the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in [[Tokyo]] on January 31, 2017 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII''\u2014 the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GamaAnniversary\"/> On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]].<ref name=\"Magic2017showing\"/> Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/><ref name=\"Nomura2018b\"/>\n\nAfter years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast. Kitase announced that the team had wanted to \"try something new\" on the State of Play broadcast by showing the trailer.<ref name=\"RemakeSoP\"/> The release date, March 3, 2020, was revealed the following month in a second teaser trailer during an orchestral concert dedicated to the [[Music of the Final Fantasy VII series|music of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"2020REL\"/> Further release details were announced at the company's [[E3 2019]] press conference, including different editions of ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeFirstInfo\"/> Kitase later clarified at the event that Square Enix had yet to determine the number of games in the ''Remake'' series, adding that they were in the process of planning the second installment.<ref name=\"RemakeScale\"/>\n\nAn extended gameplay showcase and demo was playable at E3 2019, demonstrating parts of the opening mission, including some of the exploration, combat system, and first boss battle. The playable demo has received a positive reception in early previews, with praise towards the graphics, gameplay and combat system.<ref name=\"metro\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake E3 2019 Preview -

The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix plans to release the game as a multi-part series, with the first entry scheduled for release for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control [[mercenary]] [[Cloud Strife]] as he and a group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose Shinra, a [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines real-time action similar to ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' with other strategic elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced following years of fan requests and rumors. Key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. They also added content not seen in the original, and redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' retells [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier who joins the AVALANCHE [[eco-terrorist]] group as a mercenary to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can also assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play entirely in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake still has ATB \u2026 kinda |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617105924/https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can also switch between party members at any time.

Producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that while the game has more real-time elements, there would still be strategic elements, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'}}s action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system will draw from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[Norm (social)|social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The team was also planning to include references to events detailed in the ''Compilation'' titles, though what form these references will take and their scope is still under consideration.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura later clarified that, as of early 2017, ''Remake'' does not share a direct continuity with the ''Compilation''.<ref name=\"FinaNomuraInterview\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game was to be fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nThe subtitle \"''Remake''\" was included to differentiate the game from its 1997 original. It was initially going to be story-related, but the team did not want to give the impression that it was a sequel or spin-off.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Rather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura is in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari is in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling is being supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with \"Enlighten,\" a lighting engine licensed from software company [[Geomerics]].<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]]: while their expertise was appreciated, the two companies needed to keep in close contact due to very different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n==Release==\nRumors of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' remake appeared in 2014.<ref name=\"RemakeRumor\"/> It was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) during the [[PlayStation]] conference, and received a standing ovation.<ref name=\"GSremake\"/><ref name=\"4Govation\"/> [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\" /> Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the [[YouTube]] release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks.<ref name=\"IGNstocks\" /><ref name=\"VIIRtrailer\" /> The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.<ref name=\"WiredPSE\"/>\n\nDuring the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in [[Tokyo]] on January 31, 2017 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII''\u2014 the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GamaAnniversary\"/> On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]].<ref name=\"Magic2017showing\"/> Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/><ref name=\"Nomura2018b\"/>\n\nAfter years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast. Kitase announced that the team had wanted to \"try something new\" on the State of Play broadcast by showing the trailer.<ref name=\"RemakeSoP\"/> The release date, March 3, 2020, was revealed the following month in a second teaser trailer during an orchestral concert dedicated to the [[Music of the Final Fantasy VII series|music of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"2020REL\"/> Further release details were announced at the company's [[E3 2019]] press conference, including different editions of ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeFirstInfo\"/> Kitase later clarified at the event that Square Enix had yet to determine the number of games in the ''Remake'' series, adding that they were in the process of planning the second installment.<ref name=\"RemakeScale\"/>\n\nAn extended gameplay showcase and demo was playable at E3 2019, demonstrating parts of the opening mission, including some of the exploration, combat system, and first boss battle.

Overwatch continued to protect the peace until it was disbanded years later under a cloud of suspicion, but its former members have returned to the fore in light of new threats to humanity. Blizzard wanted to create a diverse set of characters to reflect a positive outlook on this near future, incorporating non-human characters and non-standard character traits. The game launched with 21 characters, with eleven more added post-release.\n\nEight characters, [[Tracer (Overwatch)|Tracer]], [[Zarya (Overwatch)|Zarya]], [[#L\u00facio|L\u00facio]], [[Genji (Overwatch)|Genji]], [[D.Va]], [[#Ana|Ana]], [[#Junkrat|Junkrat]], and [[Hanzo (Overwatch)|Hanzo]] reprised their roles as playable heroes in the [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game, ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]''.<ref>\n{{cite web |url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/15/junkrat-and-ana-are-coming-to-heroes-of-the-storm |title = Junkrat and Ana are Coming to Heroes of the Storm |first = Tom |last = Marks |date = September 15, 2017 |accessdate = September 15, 2017 |work = [[IGN]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170915231255/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/15/junkrat-and-ana-are-coming-to-heroes-of-the-storm |archive-date = September 15, 2017 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-junkrat-joins-heroes-of-the-storm-today/1100-6454139/ |title = Overwatch's Junkrat Joins Heroes Of The Storm Today, Has A Hilarious Heroic Ability |first = Chris |last = Pereira |date = October 17, 2017 |accessdate = October 17, 2017 |work = [[GameSpot]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171018071748/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-junkrat-joins-heroes-of-the-storm-today/1100-6454139/ |archive-date = October 18, 2017 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |url = https://www.destructoid.com/alexstrasza-rocks-the-dragon-better-than-hanzo-in-heroes-of-the-storm-470718.phtml |title = Alexstrasza rocks the dragon better than Hanzo in Heroes of the Storm |first = Chris |last = Carter |date = November 3, 2017 |accessdate = November 3, 2017 |work = [[Destructoid]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171115072407/https://www.destructoid.com/alexstrasza-rocks-the-dragon-better-than-hanzo-in-heroes-of-the-storm-470718.phtml |archive-date = November 15, 2017 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Background==\n''Overwatch'' is primarily an online team-oriented [[first-person shooter]], and an example of a \"[[hero shooter]]\" where players select from one of several pre-designed hero characters with their own very unique abilities. ''Overwatch'' includes casual play modes, competitive ranked play modes, and various arcade modes where special rules apply. Most game modes bring together two teams of six players each into a match and compete in one of several objective-based game types based on the randomly selected map, including taking control points and escorting a payload.\n\nA match starts with each player selecting from one of the available hero characters. The game's characters are divided into three [[character classes|role]] classifications: damage, tank, and support.{{efn|Patch 1.25 issued in June 2018 merged former \"offense\" (Doomfist, Genji, McCree, Pharah, Reaper, Soldier: 76, Sombra, and Tracer) and \"defense\" (Bastion, Hanzo, Junkrat, Mei, Torbj\u00f6rn, and Widowmaker) into a single \"damage\" role.<ref name=\"gamespot patch1.25\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-makes-for-friendlier-post-matches/1100-6460040/ | title = Overwatch Update Makes For Friendlier Post-Matches | first = Steve | last = Watts | date = June 26, 2018 | accessdate = June 26, 2018 | work = [[Gamespot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180627062239/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-update-makes-for-friendlier-post-matches/1100-6460040/ | archive-date = June 27, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>}} Offense characters do the majority of the team's aggressive damage. Defense characters are equipped to guard the objective and halt the enemy's advance. Tank characters can absorb large amounts of damage for the team, and support characters share healing abilities and similar [[status effects]] for the team or against enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/94529/overwatch-best-heroes-for-new-players |title= Overwatch: Best Heroes for New Players}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2016/06/01/overwatch-guide/ |title= Overwatch guide: best heroes, abilities and strategies for Blizzard's shooter |date= June 6, 2016 }}</ref> The game will warn teams if they have an imbalance in their general role selection, and certain game modes require players to select different heroes. Players are able to switch between heroes mid-match after they are killed or if they return to their team's base.\n\nEach hero character has fundamentally different attributes such as health and movement speed, at least one basic attack, and at least one unique skill, collectively referred to as a skill kit. These skills can be used repeatedly after waiting out the skill's cooldown period. Each character also has at least one powerful ultimate ability that becomes available once its meter is charged, either slowly over time or through other actions such as killing opponents or healing teammates. Once the ultimate ability is used, the player has to wait for the meter to fill again. All characters have a close-combat, low damage melee attack that can be used at any time.\n\nWinning matches earns the player experience towards experience levels in the meta-game. The player earns a [[loot box]] on reaching a new experience level, which contain a random assortment of character skins, emotes, speech lines, and other cosmetic items for each character without specific game-changing effects. Players can also purchase loot boxes with real-world money. Blizzard has provided free post-release content for the game, such as new levels and characters.<ref name=\"Shacknews: post-launch\"/> Blizzard has also introduced limited-time seasonal events, offering new cosmetic items in loot boxes, themed levels, and gameplay modes.<ref>\n{{cite web |url= https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-winter-update-is-now-live-404634.phtml |title= Overwatch's winter update is now live |first= Kevin |last= McClusky |date= December 13, 2016 |accessdate= December 13, 2016 |work= [[Destructoid]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161213204748/https://www.destructoid.com/overwatch-s-winter-update-is-now-live-404634.phtml |archive-date= December 13, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' originally featured 12 characters at its November 2014 [[BlizzCon]] convention announcement,<ref name=\"Polygon: first 12\"/> but expanded to 21 by the next year's convention.<ref name=\"Polygon: BlizzCon 2015\"/> The game is character-driven, and reviewers noted ''Overwatch''{{'s}} emphasis on the individual differences between characters in the same role (e.g., between two snipers) as a departure from dominant class-based shooter paradigms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/overwatch-review/|title=Overwatch review|publisher=|date=May 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/overwatch-the-kotaku-review-1779831636 |title= Overwatch: The Kotaku Review |first=Patricia|last=Hernandez}}</ref> Critics widely praised the game's accessible and detailed character design and its role in the game's overall success.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/27/11797672/overwatch-review|title=Overwatch review |first=Russ |last=Frushtick |date= May 27, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/overwatch-early-impressions-a-shooter-with-character/ |title= Overwatch early impressions: A shooter with character }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/27/overwatch-review/ |title= Wot I Think: Overwatch }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/2016/05/overwatch-first-impressions/|title=Overwatch: A Laid-Back Shooter Without the Crappy Attitudes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/im-more-excited-for-overwatchs-world-than-its-gameplay |title= I'm more excited for Overwatch's world than its gameplay |website= pcgamer |access-date= June 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to Valve's initial launch of ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.destructoid.com/keep-these-overwatch-animated-shorts-coming-350045.phtml |title=Keep these Overwatch animated shorts coming }}</ref> in the absence of a dedicated story mode, Blizzard tells the backstory of ''Overwatch''{{'s}} plot and characters through media outside the game, including animated shorts, character press events, tweets, and webcomics.<ref name=\"Polygon: lore\">{{cite web |url= http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/24/11722688/overwatch-timeline |title=The definitive Overwatch timeline |first=Jeff |last=Ramos |date=May 24, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/07/blizzcon-2015-overwatch-animated-shorts-announced |title= BlizzCon 2015: Overwatch Animated Shorts Announced |first= Seth G.|last=Macy }}</ref> The game's story centers around a [[technological singularity]] in which humanity assembles a team of its best heroes, Overwatch, to fight off a rogue [[artificial intelligence]] and its robotic army of Omnics in an incident called the \"Omnic Crisis\".

With selection of this global theme, the developers wanted to create a cast of playable characters to portray diverse representations of [[Gender representation in video games|genders]], ages, ethnicities, and nationalities.

Initially, Reinhardt was an Omnic, but later was settled to be a human character, with the Omnic nature later revisited when the development team crafted Orisa.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/jetpack-cat-and-a-hockey-player-with-rocket-powered-skates-the-overwatch-heroes-that-could-have-been/ | title = Jetpack Cat and a hockey player with rocket skates: the Overwatch heroes that could've been | first = Samuel | last = Horti | date = November 5, 2017 | accessdate = November 5, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171106190358/http://www.pcgamer.com/jetpack-cat-and-a-hockey-player-with-rocket-powered-skates-the-overwatch-heroes-that-could-have-been/ | archive-date = November 6, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nCharacters introduced since the game's release are generally teased a few weeks in advance or given a cold surprise announcement. The only exception to this had been Sombra, who had been teased by a months-long [[alternate reality game]] (ARG) prior to her formal announcement. Blizzard found players reacted negatively to this deployment, and have opted to avoid this type of prolonged teasing for future characters.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-upcoming-heroes | title = Blizzard don't tease upcoming Overwatch heroes as much due to Sombra ARG feedback | first = Kirk | last = McLeand | date = February 16, 2017 | accessdate = February 16, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170217022549/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-upcoming-heroes | archive-date = February 17, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Blizzard will still seed upcoming hero characters into the game's announcement media but without making comments towards that, anticipating players would find these before the character is officially announced; for example, the 26th hero Moira had appeared in at least two works prior to her announcement.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-hero-27 | title = The next Overwatch hero has been hinted at already | first = Ben | last = Barrett | date = December 12, 2017 | accessdate = December 12, 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171212185204/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-hero-27 | archive-date = December 12, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Once a character is announced, they are typically made available on the \"Public Test Region\" (PTR) for Windows players to try out and help provide feedback to Blizzard.

A few characters have had major overhauls, notably [[Symmetra]] (with two separate overhauls of her skill), Mercy, and Torbj\u00f6rn.

She pilots a combat mecha armed with twin ''Fusion Cannons'', shotgun-like weapons that require no ammunition or reload time. Her mecha is equipped with rocket ''Boosters'' for short bursts of flight, as well as a ''Defense Matrix'' that allows it to shoot enemy projectiles out of the air. She can also fire a volley of ''Micro-Missiles'' that do splash damage on impact.<ref name=\"vg247 sept2017\"/> D.Va's ultimate ability, ''Self-Destruct'', overloads and detonates her mecha, dealing massive damage to all enemies in a huge radius within line of sight. If her mech is destroyed (either by her ultimate or in combat), she ejects and continues to fight on foot, armed with a mid-range ''Light Gun'', until her mecha can be summoned again.\n\nTo protect its cities against a massive omnic that rose from the [[East China Sea]], the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] developed automated battle mechs, deployed in a task force named MEKA (Mobile Exo-force of the Korean Army). As the omnic learned from its battles with the South Korean military, it disrupted the mechs' drone-control abilities, forcing the army to turn to human pilots. They elected to recruit professional gamers, who they believed possessed the necessary skills to pilot their mechs. Hana Song was the reigning ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|StarCraft II]]'' world champion at the time, with a reputation for playing to win at all costs and showing no mercy to her opponents.

He wears a heavy suit of Crusader power armor, and carries a rocket-powered [[war hammer]] (''Rocket Hammer'') as his primary weapon. His main ability is a wide hard-light ''Barrier Field'' mounted on his arm that allows him to protect himself and teammates behind him from enemy fire. He may also launch a flaming projectile that ignores enemy barriers (''Fire Strike''), or use a rocket booster to ''Charge'' into the enemy lines, crushing them against walls. His ultimate ability, ''Earthshatter'', makes him slam his hammer against the ground, sending out a shockwave that incapacitates enemies in front of him.\n\nReinhardt Wilhelm is a decorated [[Bundeswehr]] veteran from [[Stuttgart]] who lives under a knightly code of chivalry. He served as lieutenant to Colonel Balderich von Adler, commander of the Crusaders, which served alongside the regular army to act as their shield. Reckless in his younger years, Reinhardt often left his comrades behind to find glory in battle. That would change during the battle of Eichenwalde, where he lost his left eye to the blade of an OR14 assault omnic: Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle, Balderich gave Reinhardt his Overwatch initiation medal and sent him to rejoin the others, admonishing him to \"be their shield\". Becoming the only Crusader to survive the battle, Reinhardt remained in Overwatch service well into his fifties, his code of ethics and his blunt honesty making him a respected member of the team, until he was forced to retire due to his age and left to watch as Overwatch collapsed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reinhardt/|title=Reinhardt - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> When Winston issued the call to arms to his Overwatch comrades, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - answered without hesitation, despite the belief of his friend Brigitte that Overwatch had tossed him aside due to his age.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | title = The newest Overwatch cinematic, Honor and Glory, is all about Reinhardt | first = Cas | last = Marshall | date = November 3, 2017 | accessdate = November 6, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055832/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | archive-date = November 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nReinhardt had started as one of the characters in the cancelled ''Titan'' game, as the \"Juggernaut\" character.

He also has two defensive abilities: ''Experimental Barrier'', a shield that he can extend out in front of him to a variable distance and then recall it, upon which it starts regenerating any damage taken; and ''Kinetic Grasp'', which creates a field that absorbs projectiles that hit it which, upon release, coverts that into temporary shields for the character. His ultimate, ''Gravitic Flux'', allows him to fly up briefly to place a black hole on the ground.

With his winnings, he upgraded the mech further to escape from the Outback and travel the world.<ref name=\"pcgamesn hammond\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-wrecking-ball-abilities-release-date | title = Overwatch's newest hero is Wrecking Ball - here are his abilities | first = Dustin | last = Bailey | date = June 28, 2018 | accessdate = June 28, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180628222949/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-wrecking-ball-abilities-release-date | archive-date = June 28, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nThe concept of Wrecking Ball originated from a spheric robotic tank based on magnetism skills, conceived early in ''Overwatch''{{'}}s development, alongside a push for how \"cute\" they could make a hero design within the game; Wrecking Ball came about when the team, looking for a new tank character, recognized the potential linkage of ideas themed around a [[hamster ball]].

She is armed with a ''Particle Cannon'' that can either emit a continuous beam of energy or launch an energy projectile in an arc. She is also able to project a personal ''Particle Barrier'' onto herself or onto one of her teammates (''Projected Barrier''), and soaking up damage with these shields raises the power of her own attacks proportionally. Zarya's ultimate ability, ''Graviton Surge'', forms a gravity well that pulls enemies in and damages them, leaving them open to other attacks.\n\nIn her fictional backstory, Aleksandra Zaryanova's village in [[Siberia]] was on the front lines of the Omnic Crisis, which devastated the region. As she grew older, she swore to gain the strength to protect her people and homeland. She became a bodybuilder and weightlifter, expected to break a number of records in the world championships, but the dormant omnium in Siberia awakened on the eve of the tournament, and she withdrew from the competition to join the local defense forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/zarya/|title=Zarya - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nZarya was initially conceived of by artist Arnold Tsang after watching a weightlifting competition.

However, they can be more vulnerable to attacks from the other team with lower hit points than other roles.\n\n====Ashe====\nAshe, full name Elizabeth Caledonia \"Calamity\" Ashe, is an American gunslinger and leader of the Deadlock Gang, a band of [[Arms trafficking|arms-trafficking]] outlaws based in Arizona. Her main weapon is ''The Viper'', a [[lever action]] [[repeating rifle]] that can be used for short-ranged quick fire or sighted long shots. She also carries a ''[[Coach gun]]'' which can knock enemies back and propel her up or away from obstacles as well as enable limited [[rocket jumping]], and can throw ''[[Dynamite]]'' bundles that detonate after a short delay or immediately when shot with her rifle, setting opponents on fire. Her ultimate ability summons ''B.O.B.'', her Big Omnic Butler/Bodyguard, who charges forward to knock enemies into the air before laying down suppressive fire with his built-in arm cannons. Unlike deployable assets from other heroes, such as Torbj\u00f6rn's turrets, B.O.B. serves as a temporary seventh player on the team until his health is exhausted, and thus is able to capture or challenge objectives, and can be healed by allies.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/02/overwatchs-new-hero-is-ashe | title = Overwatch's new hero is Ashe | first = Mike | last = Minotti | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103092117/https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/02/overwatchs-new-hero-is-ashe/ | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/2/18053898/new-overwatch-hero-29-ashe-blizzcon-2018 | title = Overwatch's 29th hero is Ashe of the Deadlock Gang | first = Ashley | last = Oh | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181102215249/https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/2/18053898/new-overwatch-hero-29-ashe-blizzcon-2018 | archive-date = November 2, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"AsheInfo\">\n{{cite web | url = https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ashe | title = Ashe | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103045903/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ashe/ | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-bob-capture-points | title = Ashe's friend Bob can capture a point in Overwatch by himself | first = Chris | last = Capel | date = November 7, 2018 | accessdate = November 7, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181107224846/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-bob-capture-points | archive-date = November 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n \nBorn into a wealthy family with connections to the world's top CEOs, Ashe was largely neglected by her parents and left in the care of their omnic butler, B.O.B. She was regularly involved in fights at school, and also in petty crime. It was a chance meeting with a local ruffian named Jesse McCree, a string of crimes they committed together, and a desire to make her own \"family\" that led her to embrace the path of the outlaw, and she was one of the four original founders of the Deadlock Gang. Spurred by Ashe's increasingly larger heists, the Deadlock Gang's quick rise to prominence resulted in violent conflicts with the other criminal organizations in the American Southwest. After years of fighting, Ashe summoned the heads of the other major groups and used her business acumen, learned from her mostly-absent parents, to convince them that they could work better, if not together, then at least not against one another, so long as they kept their word, did not work with law enforcement, respected one another's territory, and punished any sort of betrayal. No longer having to focus on squabbles with other gangs, Ashe continued to build on her reputation, earning her a place at the top of the authorities' most wanted lists.<ref name=\"AsheInfo\"/>\n\nBlizzard considered Ashe a \"unicorn\" character in that her route from conception to implementation was straightforward, a rarity from their past experience. They wanted to create a female gunslinger, but needed to differentiate her from either McCree or Reaper, and some initial designs felt too goth-like. They settled on a mix of a biker and a cowboy. A similar streamlined experience was found with B.O.B., having been already drawn into the storyboard for the animated short \"Reunion\" and became an internal favorite to bring into the game, and only required translating his design into the game. One difficulty faced by the team was how to implement and optimize B.O.B., since he is treated as another teammate while on the field, impacting the game's memory and performance.<ref name=\"ashe makingof\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | title = The making of Overwatch's next hero, Ashe (and BOB) | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103052306/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nAshe was introduced as the 29th hero in the animated short ''Reunion'', shown at [[BlizzCon#2018|BlizzCon]] on November 2, 2018, and was available to play on the PTR on November 5.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | title = Overwatch's new hero Ashe is now playable on the PTR | first = Bo | last = Moore | date = November 5, 2018 | accessdate = November 5, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181106005129/https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | archive-date = November 6, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She was added to the main game for all players on November 13, 2018,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/today-s-overwatch-patch-brings-out-ashe-and-more-balance-changes-531105.phtml | title = Today's Overwatch patch brings out Ashe and more balance changes| first =Jordan | last = Devore | date = November 13, 2018 | accessdate = November 13, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> and to competitive play on November 27, 2018.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | title = Ashe and Bob join Overwatch competitive play | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = November 27, 2018 | accessdate = November 27, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181127234356/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | archive-date = November 27, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She is voiced by veteran voice actress [[Jennifer Hale]].<ref name=\"ashe makingof\"/>\n\n====Bastion====\nBastion is a combat robot-turned-explorer. It can ''Reconfigure'' between a mobile form outfitted with a submachine gun (''Configuration: Recon'') and a stationary form equipped with a [[Gatling gun]] (''Configuration: Sentry''). It also has the ability to ''Self-Repair'' and quickly regain lost health, and its ''Ironclad'' passive reduces damage taken. Its ultimate ability is ''Configuration: Tank'', which allows it to roll on treads and fire explosive rounds from a smooth-bore cannon for a short period of time.\n\nBastion is a SST Laboratories Siege Automaton E54, a battle automaton originally designed for peacekeeping purposes; during the Omnic Crisis, they were deployed against their human makers becoming a symbol of the horrors of the war. Bastion was severely damaged in the field near the German village of Eichenwalde in the [[Black Forest]] during the final days of the war, and was left dormant and exposed to the elements. For more than a decade, it became overgrown with plant life and the nests of small animals, until it unexpectedly reactivated. It had developed a fascination with nature, but its combat programming still took over whenever it encountered anything it perceived as a threat. Due to conflicts with fearful humans, Bastion largely avoids populated areas in favor of exploring the wild.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/bastion/|title=Bastion - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> It is usually accompanied by a small bird named Ganymede, who was building a nest on it when it reactivated, and both humanizes Bastion and makes it relatable.\n\nBastion is the focus of the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', showing the moments when Ganymede inadvertently reactivated it.<ref>\n{{Citation|last=PlayOverwatch|title=Overwatch Animated Short {{!}} \"The Last Bastion\"|date=2016-08-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827005735/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=live}}\n</ref> Bastion was also the first character to be made available in [[Lego]] form through official collaboration between Blizzard and [[The Lego Group]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | title = Lego Overwatch First Set Revealed, Available Now | first = Nick | last = Santangelo | date = October 10, 2018 | accessdate = October 10, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013718/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | archive-date = October 11, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> A limited-time event in 2019 allowed players the opportunity to earn a Bastion skin based on the Lego version.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/new-overwatch-event-lets-players-earn-a-lego-themed-bastion-skin/ | title = New Overwatch event lets players earn a Lego-themed Bastion skin | first = Bo | last= Moore | date = September 17, 2019 | accessdate = September 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nBastion is voiced by [[Chris Metzen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/50swfk/ama_request_the_overwatch_sound_design_team/?sort=old|title=AMA Request - The Overwatch Sound design team \u2022 r/Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Doomfist====\n{{Main|Doomfist}}\nDoomfist is both the name of the titular cybernetic [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] and the title of its wielder, currently the [[Nigerian]]-born Akande Ogundimu, businessman and mixed martial artist turned mercenary.

Doomfist can charge up a ''Rocket Punch'' that lets him lunge forward and punch an opponent backwards, a ''Seismic Slam'' that launches enemies in its range a short distance towards Doomfist, and a ''Rising Uppercut'' that greatly launches a single enemy while doing damage. Each ability that successfully hits also generates personal shielding for Doomfist (''The Best Defense...'').

His main attack method is to throw three ''[[Shurikens]]'', either in quick succession or simultaneously in a horizontal spread. His abilities are ''Swift Strike'', a quick dashing lunge with good range, and ''Deflect'', a defensive stance that briefly ricochets projectiles back at enemies with his [[wakizashi]]. His ''Cyber-Agility'' allows him to double-jump and run up walls. Genji's ultimate ability is ''Dragonblade'', during which Genji unsheathes the [[odachi]] on his back and delivers powerful, sweeping melee attacks.\n\nIn his origin story, Genji transforms from a slacker to a superhero.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/genji-is-with-you/|title=Genji is with you - Kill Screen|date=August 12, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|title=Overwatch: How to Use Genji Effectively|publisher=|access-date=November 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045314/http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|archive-date=August 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> His family\u2014the Japanese Shimada crime family\u2014ordered his eldest brother Hanzo to kill Genji for his selfish and hedonistic behavior (as shown in the short ''Dragons''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-animated-short-explores-hanzo-and-genjis-1776890949|title=Overwatch's New Animated Short Explores Hanzo And Genji's Tragic Rivalry|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-hanzo-and-genji-square-off-in-blizzards/1100-6439845/|title=Overwatch's Hanzo and Genji Square Off in Blizzard's Latest Short Film|publisher=}}</ref> and referenced in-game Hanamura map by a shrine devoted to Genji<ref name=\"PC Gamer: hidden lore\" />).

Since the cooldown for his ''Swift Strike'' resets upon scoring a kill, it is best used as a finishing move. Genji's ''Deflect'' ability can counter many enemy ultimate abilities, like Soldier: 76's ''Tactical Visor'' or McCree's ''Deadeye''. While some characters function best when paired with specific teammates, Genji works best in isolation.<ref name=\"Polygon: Guide\" /> Genji is strong against turrets like Bastion and those of Torbj\u00f6rn, and is effective at flanking snipers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/overwatch-how-to-play-genji|title=Overwatch - How to Play Genji|first=Mike|last=Williams|publisher=}}</ref> Genji is vulnerable against characters with energy weapons that bypass his deflection, such as Symmetra, Winston, and Zarya. As Genji is reliant on ''Deflect'', the common way to counter him is baiting him into using it then attacking when it's on cooldown.

He wields the ''Storm Bow'' and is equipped with specialized arrows, including ''Sonic Arrows'' to detect enemies and ''Storm Arrows'' to fire six full-power shots in rapid succession. He is also able to ''Wall Climb'', enabling him to reach vantage points, and ''Lunge'' forward while in mid-air. His ultimate ability is ''Dragonstrike'', in which he unleashes a spiraling spirit dragon that can travel through obstacles to deal damage in a straight line.\n\nHanzo is the elder brother of Genji, and the heir to the head of the Shimada clan. He was trained from an early age to take over the clan, becoming a skilled warrior and marksman, as well as a strategist. When his father died, Hanzo was directed by the clan elders to bring Genji into line; and when Genji refused, the two brothers battled, resulting in what appeared to be Genji's death. Guilty and grief-stricken, Hanzo abandoned the clan and traveled the world in an effort to restore his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/hanzo/|title=Hanzo - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHanzo is the focus of the animated short ''Dragons'', where he visits his family's castle on the day of his duel with Genji, leaving offerings at the castle shrine to honor Genji's memory.<ref name=\"Dragons\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Dragons\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=May 16, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Hanzo had an ability called ''Scatter Arrows'', an arrow that split into multiple arrows that could ricochet off the environment and hit targets around corners. Players grew to find this ability cheap since it, if well-placed, could take out even Tank characters with a single shot. Blizzard addressed this with a rework update that replaced the ability with the above ''Storm Arrows'' and ''Lunge'' abilities, which went live in May 2018.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/03/overwatchs-hanzo-rework-goes-live-today/|title=Overwatch's Hanzo rework goes live today|last=Grubb|first=Jeff|date=May 3, 2018|work=[[Venture Beat]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503225534/https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/03/overwatchs-hanzo-rework-goes-live-today/|archive-date=May 3, 2018|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nHanzo appears as a playable hero in ''[[Heroes of the Storm]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/hanzo/|title=Hanzo - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nHanzo is voiced by [[Paul Nakauchi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/12|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Junkrat====\nJunkrat, real name Jamison Fawkes, is an [[Australians|Australian]] scavenger, mercenary and [[Anarchy|anarchist]].

Junkrat's ultimate ability is ''RIP-Tire'', a self-propelled truck wheel loaded with explosives that he's able to manually steer and detonate. Junkrat was developed by Blizzard to balance out against Torbjorn's turrets.<ref name=\"polygon sxsw\" />\n\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, an \"omnium\" - an A.I. controller that directs omnics as part of a hive mind - was destroyed in the [[Outback]], turning it into an irradiated wasteland.

The effects of the radiation awakened a sense of madness which soon developed into [[pyromania]]. In the heart of the destroyed omnium, Junkrat found a valuable secret, making him the target of bounty hunters and rival gangs. He made a deal with the Junker enforcer Roadhog, who agreed to become his personal bodyguard in return for a 50-50 share of the profits from their finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/junkrat/|title=Junkrat - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> His loud personality often drives him into trouble, one of them is by blowing away their deception when attempting a Trojan-horse plan to get revenge on the Queen of Junkertown after banishing him and Roadhog from her dominion.<ref name=\"Junkertown: The Plan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q0QGtk_AM0 |title= \"Junkertown: The Plan\" {{!}} Overwatch |last=PlayOverwatch|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nJunkrat appears as a playable hero in [[Heroes of the Storm|''Heroes of the Storm.'']]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/junkrat/|title=Junkrat - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nJunkrat is voiced by [[Chris Parson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/11|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====McCree====\nMcCree, full name Jesse McCree, is an [[Americans|American]] [[bounty hunter]] and vigilante with a cybernetic arm and a [[Wild West]] motif.

She wears the Raptora Mark VI, a [[Jet pack|jetpack]]-equipped combat suit, and wields a ''[[Rocket launcher|Rocket Launcher]]'' as her primary weapon. She has a Wedjat ([[Eye of Horus]]) tattoo around her right eye. Her abilities are ''Concussive Blast'', a rocket with powerful knockback but no damage, and ''Jump Jets'', a quick jetpack-assisted vertical ascension comparable to a [[rocket jump]]. Her passive ability allows her to ''Hover'' in the air, which is paired well with her Jump Jets ability. Pharah's ultimate ability is ''Barrage'', where she fires a continuous stream of small air-to-ground rockets at targets, while she is frozen still in place.\n\nFareeha Amari is the daughter of Ana Amari, one of the founding members of Overwatch. She served as an officer in the [[Egyptian Army]] and aspired to follow in her mother's footsteps, but Overwatch was disbanded before she could join its ranks. After leaving the army, Pharah took a job with Helix Security International, a private security firm contracted to protect an [[artificial intelligence]] facility below the [[Giza Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/pharah/|title=Pharah - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nPharah is a solid attacker able to consistently maintain pressure on the enemy team. Her rocket launcher allows her to hold chokepoints or lay out suppressive fire onto objectives both in offense and defense, and her vertical agility renders her out of reach for characters reliant on close-range fighting. Her ''Concussion Blast'' disrupts enemy formations, and in the hands of a skilled player it can be used to score environmental kills. Pharah is a good match with Mercy, whose ''Guardian Angel'' ability allows both of them to fly alongside each other; this tactic is often called \"Pharmercy\". Pharah is vulnerable against long-range oriented characters, especially those wielding [[hitscan]] weapons, such as Widowmaker or McCree.\n\nPharah is voiced by Jen Cohn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/3|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Reaper====\nReaper, real name Gabriel Reyes, is an American mercenary and terrorist, originally a founding member of Overwatch, now a leading member of Talon. He is attired in a black hooded trenchcoat with a white skull mask and wields twin ''Hellfire Shotguns''. His abilities are ''Shadow Step'', a medium-range line of sight teleport, and ''Wraith Form'', a brief period of invincibility and speed increase. He was able to heal himself by consuming the souls of fallen enemies, visible as red burning \"Soul Globes\" on the ground but later was changed to a passive ability called ''The Reaping'' which allows him to steal a 20% heal from the damage he deals. Reaper's ultimate ability is ''Death Blossom'', a twin shotgun [[gun kata]] which deals massive damage in a short radius around him.\n\nBorn in [[Los Angeles]], Gabriel Reyes was a veteran officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]] who was subjected to a \"soldier enhancement program\", where he and the other selectees were genetically enhanced to become \"perfect soldiers\"; Reyes became known as \"Soldier: 24\". When the United Nations formed Overwatch to combat the Omnic Crisis, Reyes was one of the two men from the program on the shortlist to join up and was initially tapped to lead it. However, he was passed over in favor of his friend Jack Morrison, causing a rift between the two men. Reyes was later named commander of Blackwatch, Overwatch's black ops division, but his jealousy of Morrison (due to Morrison's publicity as the official leader of Overwatch, versus Reyes' secret dealings with Blackwatch) eventually caused Reyes to reveal Blackwatch's existence to the public, destroying both organizations and resulting in a battle that destroyed their headquarters in [[Switzerland]]. Both men were believed dead, but in reality survived, although Reyes's cells are now simultaneously decaying and regenerating, causing his body to fall apart and rebuild itself over and over again.<ref name=\"FadingGlory\">{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/19809396|title=Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nReyes resurfaced years later as \"the Reaper\", a mysterious mercenary responsible for terrorist attacks all around the world, having been consumed by his hunger for fame to the point that he no longer cared what he was known for. Through the efforts of rogue geneticist and former Blackwatch member [[#Moira|Moira O'Deorain]], he has developed the ability to steal life essence from his enemies, and also become incorporeal to avoid harm.<ref name=\"polygon moira story\"/> His true identity is unknown to the rest of the world, as are his motivations, though a pattern of his movements indicates that he is hunting down former agents of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reaper/|title=Reaper - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> He appears in the cinematic trailer, teamed with Widowmaker in a raid in the Overwatch Museum to steal Doomfist's gauntlet for Talon.<ref name=\"IntroCinematic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|title=Overwatch Cinematic Trailer|last=PlayOverwatch|date=November 7, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He also appears in the animated short ''Recall'', where he raids Winston's lab at [[Gibraltar]] to steal his list of Overwatch agents, though he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Recall\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB5zlHMsM7k|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Recall\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=March 23, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nReaper is a flanker/assassin type of character, able to teleport behind enemy lines and attack from the rear to single out targets of importance, before using ''Wraith Form'' to escape. The ability to heal from dealing damage helps him in taking out tanks, due to their large bodies and health pools making it easier for him to heal rapidly. Reaper is vulnerable while executing his ''Death Blossom'', so proper usage of it relies heavily on the element on surprise, taking enemies out with its massive damage output before they get the chance to react.\n\nReaper is voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/6|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Soldier: 76====\nSoldier: 76, real name Jack Francis Morrison, is an American soldier-turned-vigilante and a founding member of Overwatch. He wears a facemask with a visor and carries an experimental ''Heavy Pulse Rifle'' equipped with an underbarrel launcher that fires three ''Helix Rockets''. His abilities are ''Sprint'', a forward run with no duration limit or cooldown, and ''Biotic Field'', a deployable device which regenerates the health of allies in the immediate vicinity. His ultimate ability, ''Tactical Visor'', puts up a [[head-up display]] that allows his rifle to automatically track enemies in his line of sight for a brief period, similar to an [[aimbot]].\n\nJack Morrison was born in rural [[Indiana]], and enlisted in the United States military when he was eighteen. His bravery and work ethic earned him the attention of the \"soldier enhancement program\", and he later joined Overwatch alongside his friend Gabriel Reyes. His contributions to its success in ending the Omnic Crisis led to his being granted command of the task force, leading to a rift between him and Reyes. As Overwatch came under worldwide scrutiny due to allegations of corruption, the tensions between the two men came to outright conflict, resulting in the destruction of Overwatch headquarters. Morrison was believed to have been killed in the explosion, and was reportedly buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=\"FadingGlory\"/>\n\nFive years later, however, Morrison resurfaced as the vigilante \"Soldier: 76\", becoming the focus of an international manhunt following a series of attacks against former Overwatch facilities, stealing weapons and advanced technologies. He wages a personal war to discover the truth behind the events that led to the fall of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/soldier-76/|title=Soldier: 76 - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> In the \"Bastet\" short story released by Blizzard in January 2019, it is revealed that Soldier: 76 at one point had a gay relationship with a man named Vincent prior to fully investing his time into Overwatch, making him the second confirmed LGBT character of the ''Overwatch'' roster after Tracer.<ref name=\"vg247 s76 gay\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | title = Overwatch short story confirms that Soldier: 76 is gay | first = Shabana | last = Arif | date = January 7, 2019 | accessdate = January 7, 2019 | work = [[VG247]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190108032925/https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | archive-date = January 8, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was actually developed by ''Overwatch''{{'}}s creative director [[Chris Metzen]] in the early 2000s as part of non-gaming related projects within Blizzard, and which he later adapted for a comic story used in ''[[Digital Webbing]] Presents'' #16, published in July 2004. Metzen described Soldier: 76's background here as one of a line of American \"super soldiers\" that had been implanted with microchips to give them superhuman abilities. Soldier: 76 was thought killed in an assassination attempt but instead found himself abandoned in South America with no memories of his past, only returning to the United States after a second civil war breaks out, to help try to restore order and discover his past. While ''Overwatch'' modified Metzen's original design, the game's version of Soldier: 76 still maintains the same color scheme and jacket that was used in the comic book story.<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | title = One Overwatch Character Has Been Around For More Than A Decade | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = April 28, 2016 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170528141357/http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | archive-date = May 28, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | title = Warcraft, Diablo Creator Joins \"Digital Webbing Presents\" #16 | date = July 7, 2004 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021809/http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | archive-date = August 25, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Within ''Overwatch'' Metzen opted to use the name \"Jack Morrison\" referencing [[John Wayne]] and [[Jim Morrison]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | title = Soldier: 76's middle name is Francis | first = Ian | last = Bourdeau | date = September 30, 2018 | accessdate = September 30, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180930173622/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | archive-date = September 30, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was the most popular offense character during the game's open beta.<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\"/> He was conceived as a \"gateway hero\" to help players that are used to modern shooters ease into the game,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://overwatch.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzcon-2014-overwatch-unveiled-panel-transcript/2|title=BlizzCon 2014 - Overwatch Unveiled Panel Transcript - Page 2 of 4 - Blizzplanet - Overwatch|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> but his versatility and high skill ceiling makes him a good choice for veteran players as well. He is able to perform well in almost any situation, being effective on all ranges, move quickly around the battlefield, as well as able to heal both himself and his team. On the downside, unlike other attackers, he lacks a direct specialization, and his ultimate ability has less potential impact on the game.

She is equipped with a low-damage, high-capacity ''[[Machine pistol|Machine Pistol]]'' for short range combat. Her trademark ability allows her to ''Hack'' enemies, turrets or neutral health kits. Hacked enemies cannot use their abilities, hacked turrets are disabled, and hacked health kits respawn faster and become unusable to the enemy team. Sombra also has ''Thermoptic Camo'' that gives her invisibility paired with a speed boost, and can throw down a ''Translocator'' beacon that she can later teleport to. Her passive ability, ''Opportunist'', enables her to track enemies that are low on health, even through walls. Sombra's ultimate ability is ''[[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]'', an electromagnetic shockwave that hacks all enemies around her, as well as disabling their barriers and shields and displaying if they have fully charged ultimates.<ref name=\"gamespot sombra announced\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-next-character-sombra-officially-reveal/1100-6445128/ | title = Overwatch's Next Character, Sombra, Officially Revealed | first = Chris | last = Pereira | date = November 4, 2016 | accessdate = November 4, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161107181540/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-next-character-sombra-officially-reveal/1100-6445128/ | archive-date = November 7, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nIn the ''Overwatch'' narrative, Sombra had been orphaned at an early age but quickly discovered her natural gift for hacking.

His armor comes equipped with a mobile forge, and he carries a ''Rivet Gun'' that shoots molten slag and a ''Forge Hammer'' for construction and melee attacks. His ''Deploy Turret'' allows him to toss a turret a short distance away, which will then self-deploy before targeting and firing on any opponent in its sights. His ''Overload'' ability briefly increases his armor, and improves his speed and attack attributes for a short amount of time. His ultimate abilitiy ''Molten Core'' allows him to shoot up to ten globs of molten metal on the ground, damaging any opponent that crosses through them.\n\nTorbj\u00f6rn Lindholm believes that technology should serve a better vision for humanity, putting him at odds with his employers, who wanted to control the weapons with artificial intelligence. His deep-seated fear of sentient machines, dismissed at first as paranoia, became reality during the Omnic Crisis, during which he was recruited by Overwatch. His engineering knowledge proved invaluable to achieving Overwatch's aim of ending the Omnic Crisis. After Overwatch was disbanded, his weapons were stolen or stashed away, and Torbj\u00f6rn has set out to ensure they are not used to harm the innocent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/torbjorn/|title=Torbj\u00f6rn - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhile Torbj\u00f6rn was not the first character created for ''Overwatch'', his design, meant to bridge between ''Warcraft'' and ''Overwatch'', became the baseline for nearly all other asset design for the game.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/without-torbjorn-overwatch-wouldnt-be-overwatch-1792919785 | title = Overwatch's Unique Art Style Began With Torbjorn | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = March 2, 2017 | accessdate = March 2, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170303040136/http://kotaku.com/without-torbjorn-overwatch-wouldnt-be-overwatch-1792919785 | archive-date = March 3, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> At launch, Torbj\u00f6rn would have to place a turret and then hammer on it to bring it up to a higher level, while his ultimate ''Molten Core'' would be used to give him a burst of energy and speed as well as briefly upgrading the turret to its highest value. Torbj\u00f6rn could also collect scrap left by fallen players, when he then could use to make armor pickups for his allies.

She wields dual rapid-fire ''Pulse Pistols'', and is equipped with a \"chronal accelerator\" which grants her the ability to either jump forward in time, crossing many meters in a split second (''Blink'') or rewind three seconds into the past to heal and restore ammunition (''Recall''). Her ultimate ability is ''Pulse Bomb'', an explosive charge that sticks to enemies, exploding after a brief delay for massive damage.\n\nBorn in [[London]] following the events of the Omnic Crisis, Lena Oxton became the youngest test pilot in Overwatch's experimental flight program, and was tapped to test the \"Slipstream\", a fighter jet that used teleportation technology. During the test flight, a malfunction caused the craft to vanish and Tracer along with it. She was presumed dead. However, she reappeared months later, though suffering from a condition preventing her from maintaining a physical form and which caused her to vanish for hours or even days at a time. It was discovered that the accident desynchronized her molecules from time itself, a condition eventually called \"chronal disassociation.\" The enhanced gorilla scientist Winston invented the chronal accelerator to re-synchronize her with the normal flow of time.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Overwatch Heroes - Tracer|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/tracer|website=Official Overwatch Website|accessdate=October 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526154314/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/tracer/|archive-date=May 26, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nTracer was the first Hero developed for the game and used to test the gameplay mechanics.<ref name=\"arstech dev\">\n{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/when-its-done-overwatchs-director-on-the-games-finished-yet-fluid-launch/ | title = \"When it's done\": How Blizzard dragged Overwatch across the launch threshold | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = May 25, 2016 | accessdate = June 6, 2016 | work = [[Ars Technica]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160926203638/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/when-its-done-overwatchs-director-on-the-games-finished-yet-fluid-launch/ | archive-date = September 26, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Tracer features in the cinematic trailer, teamed with Winston as she tries to stop Widowmaker and Reaper from taking Doomfist's gauntlet.<ref>\n{{cite web|title=Overwatch Cinematic Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|publisher=PlayOverwatch|accessdate=October 12, 2016|date=November 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609072339/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|archive-date=June 9, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref> She also appears in the cinematic short ''Alive'', as she unsuccessfully tries to stop Widowmaker from assassinating the omnic monk Tekhartha Mondatta in London.<ref name=\"Alive\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U130wnpi-C0|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Alive\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=April 5, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Tracer is featured on the game's cover art, and is a playable hero in ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/tracer/|title=Tracer - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref> It was revealed in an ''Overwatch'' comic that she identifies as a lesbian.<ref name=\"comic.playoverwatch.com\">{{cite web|url=https://comic.playoverwatch.com/en-us/tracer-reflections|title=Blizzard - Comic Book Experience|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTracer is voiced by [[Cara Theobold]].\n\n====Widowmaker====\n{{main|Widowmaker (Overwatch)}}\nWidowmaker, real name Am\u00e9lie Lacroix, is a [[France|French]] [[sniper]] and assassin. She wields the ''Widow's Kiss'', a versatile rifle that fires in full automatic at close-range, and can convert into a sniper rifle for long-range kills. She also uses a ''Grappling Hook'' to reach high ledges and ''Venom Mines'' to disable enemies. Her ultimate ability is ''Infra-Sight'', which activates her recon visor to highlight all enemies through walls for her and her team, similar to a [[Cheating in online games#World-Hacking|wallhack]].\n\nAm\u00e9lie was a ballet dancer and was the wife of G\u00e9rard Lacroix, an Overwatch agent heading operations against the terrorist organization known as Talon. When their assassins were unable to get close to Lacroix, they kidnapped Am\u00e9lie and reprogrammed her as a sleeper agent. She was found and returned home by Overwatch agents, unaware of what had happened; two weeks later, she killed her husband in his sleep. Returning to Talon, she underwent extensive training in the covert arts, and her physiology was altered to slow her heart, turning her skin blue. Her emotional responses numbed by the conditioning, she feels little more than the satisfaction of the kill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/widowmaker/|title=Widowmaker - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWidowmaker appears in the intro cinematic, teamed with Reaper to steal Doomfist's gauntlet from the Overwatch Museum; a boy visiting the museum uses it against her.<ref name=\"IntroCinematic\"/> She is also featured in the animated short ''Alive'', on a mission to assassinate the omnic monk Tekhartha Mondatta, an advocate for peaceful human-omnic relations.<ref name=\"Alive\"/>\n\nWidowmaker was the most popular defense character during the game's open beta.<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\"/>\n\nWidowmaker is voiced by [[Chlo\u00e9 Hollings]].\n\n===Support heroes===\nSupport heroes typically lack any significant offensive abilities and instead provide support for their teammates, most often in the form of healing or other buffs. They may also be able to apply debuffs to the opposing team, making them more prone to attack. Support heroes tend to have the fewest hit points but also can self-regenerate their health at times.\n\n====Ana====\nAna, full name Ana Amari, is an Egyptian sniper and bounty hunter, and one of the founding members of Overwatch. She wields a ''Biotic Rifle'' loaded with smart darts that damage enemies and heal allies, as well as [[Tranquillizer gun|a sidearm that fires ''Sleep Darts'']]. She also carries ''Biotic Grenades'' that disable enemy healing and boost ally healing. Her ultimate ability is ''Nano Boost'', which grants an attack and defense boost to a teammate hero.\n\nHailing from [[Cairo]], Ana Amari was considered the best sniper in the world, and rushed in to support the unprepared Egyptian defense forces during the Omnic Crisis. Her marksmanship and her critical decision-making skills led to her being recruited by Overwatch, and she served for many years as Jack Morrison's second-in-command during the conflict, while trying to be a mother to her daughter, Fareeha. Even with her command responsibility, Ana refused to give up going on combat missions. Remaining in service well into her fifties, Ana was believed to have been killed by Widowmaker during a hostage rescue; when Ana hesitated to make the kill shot, realizing that her target had in fact been her friend Am\u00e9lie Lacroix, Widowmaker shot her through her rifle's lens, destroying her right eye, then proceeded to kill the hostages.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|title=[NEW HERO] Ana Origin Story - Overwatch|last=PlayOverwatch|date=July 12, 2016|via=YouTube|access-date=July 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713082817/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|archive-date=July 13, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://comic.playoverwatch.com/en-us/legacy|title=Blizzard - Comic Book Experience|publisher=}}</ref> Though Ana survived, Overwatch soon disbanded.

When they started brainstorming new playable heroes, the idea of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] was raised, leading to the concept of a \"skill-based support healer\", according to Chu. This led to them to consider making Ana this new playable character, as these support sniper skills would contrast well against those of the already-established character of Widowmaker.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | title = Overwatch Lead Writer Discusses Diversity and New Webcomic | first = Jason | last = Imms | date = December 20, 2016 | accessdate = December 21, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161224175838/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | archive-date = December 24, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Ana was the first character to be added to ''Overwatch'' following its launch; she was announced and available to play on the Public Test regions on July 12, 2016,<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | title = Our first look at Overwatch's new hero, Ana | first = Chris | last = Bratt | date = July 12, 2016 | accessdate = July 12, 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160713160749/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | archive-date = July 13, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> and was playable by all PC and console players on July 19, 2016.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | title = Overwatch's new hero, Ana, is now live for all to play | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = July 19, 2016 | accessdate = July 19, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160721062559/http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | archive-date = July 21, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> In January 2019, Blizzard published a short story \"Bastet\" that focused on Ana and her relationship with Soldier:76.

As a passive ability, Baptiste's ''Exo Boots'' allow him to jump higher after crouching. His active abilities includes a ''Regenerative Burst'' that heals himself and nearby allies over a short period of time, and an ''Immortality Field'' device that prevents teammates from dying while in range, but the device itself can be destroyed prematurely.  His ultimate is an ''Amplification Matrix'' that increases damage and healing effects of allies' shots that pass through it.<ref name=\"pcgamer baptiste intro\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/baptiste-abilities-overwatch/ | title = Baptiste abilities: Here's everything Overwatch's new combat medic can do | author = Bo Moore | date = February 26, 2019 | accessdate = February 26, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190227120753/https://www.pcgamer.com/baptiste-abilities-overwatch/ | archive-date = February 27, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nOriginally from [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]], Baptiste was among the thirty million children orphaned by the Omnic Crisis. He enlisted in the military of the Caribbean Coalition, an alliance of island nations united by the crisis, as a combat medic, driven by his desire to help others; he would eventually rise to become part of the Coalition's special ops division. After the end of the war, Baptiste struggled to find work until he was recruited by Talon, one of a number of mercenary groups that arose in the aftermath of the crisis. At first, he thrived within Talon, which gave him easy assignments that paid well enough for him to establish a clinic in his hometown. As time went on, however, the missions his unit was sent on became increasingly violent, including assassinations of rivals and operations that involved civilian casualties. Disgusted, Baptiste abandoned Talon and set out to wander the world, offering his aid where he could. Realizing that Baptiste knew too much about their operations, Talon regularly sent assassins, including members of his former unit, to silence him, without success; those few who were able to locate him were never seen again.<ref name=\"poly baptiste announce\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/25/18238602/overwatch-baptiste-hero-origins-animation-reveal | title = Overwatch reveals its newest hero, the support soldier Baptiste | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = February 25, 2019 | accessdate = February 25, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190226012602/https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/25/18238602/overwatch-baptiste-hero-origins-animation-reveal | archive-date = February 26, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"BaptisteInfo\">\n{{cite web | url = https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/baptiste | title = Baptiste | date = February 26, 2019 | accessdate = February 26, 2019 | work = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190227060726/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/baptiste | archive-date = February 27, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nAfter approximately a week of teases through their social media sites, Blizzard formally introduced Baptiste as the game's 30th hero with an origin story video on February 25, 2019,<ref name=\"poly baptiste announce\"/> and was added to the PTR the following day.<ref name=\"pcgamer baptiste intro\"/> Baptiste was made live for all servers on March 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/03/19/overwatch-adds-baptiste-hero-30/ | title = Overwatch patches in Baptiste to patch you up | first= Alice | last = O'Conner | date = March 19, 2019 | accessdate = March 19, 2019 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> In June 2019, Blizzard released \"What You Left Behind\" a short story about Baptiste's background written by [[Alissa Wong]] and illustrated by [[Arnold Tsang]].

As such, Brigitte became close friends with Reinhardt, and grew up on his tales of heroes and chivalry. While Torbj\u00f6rn was more interested in creating weapons, Brigitte's aptitudes were for creating armor and defensive systems. After the fall of Overwatch, Reinhardt elected to travel the world as something of a knight-errant, and Brigitte, to his surprise, asked him if she could accompany him as his squire, to which he agreed. Her job included maintaining Reinhardt's Crusader armor, to which she was well-suited as it was based on a design created by her father, but as time went on, she was often required to take care of Reinhardt himself, who maintained an overenthusiasm for combat in spite of his increasing age and frailty.

Most scientists found her research dangerous due to its perceived ethical shortfalls, with some even going so far as to accuse her of having the same obsession with scientific advancement that started the Omnic Crisis. Adding to the controversy, other geneticists were unable to reproduce the results of her research. With her career stalled, Moira received a lifeline from an unlikely source: Blackwatch, the covert ops division of Overwatch under the command of Gabriel Reyes. Her involvement with Blackwatch was kept a secret until inquiries following an incident in Venice (played out in the story-based game mode \"Retribution\") revealed her work, forcing Overwatch to publicly disavow any ties to her or her work. After Overwatch disbanded, Moira was employed by the Ministries, the scientific collective that founded the city of Oasis in southern [[Iraq]], as the head of the Ministry of Genetics. She was also financed by Talon, and (along with Doomfist and Reaper) is among the members of its ruling council who appear in the game.

Rather than moving on foot, he floats above the ground in a meditative pose. He is surrounded by a circle of 8 floating metal orbs named the ''Orbs of Destruction'' (resembling [[prayer beads]]), which he can use to launch a form of energy to damage foes, either one at a time or through a charged-shot. He can also cast these orbs onto teammates as ''Orbs of Harmony'' to regenerate health, or onto enemies as ''Orbs of Discord'' that lower their defenses. His ultimate ability is ''Transcendence'', which makes him temporarily invulnerable and applies massive regenerative effects to his allies in a large radius around him.\n\nZenyatta belonged to the Shambali, an order of omnic monks that had settled in a monastery deep within the [[Himalayas]] in northern [[Nepal]], after experiencing a \"spiritual awakening\" that led them to believe that, like humans, omnics also possessed a soul. Their leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, sought to heal the breach between humans and omnics and bring them into societal harmony through the spreading of their peaceful message in public rallies (one of which resulted in Mondatta's assassination by Widowmaker in London). Zenyatta disagreed with this approach, believing that only directly engaging humans and connecting with them person-to-person will bridge the divide between man and machine. He left the Shambali monastery and wandered the world, seeking to help those he meets find inner peace (such as his encounter with the cyborg warrior Genji).

Balderich was approached by Overwatch to become one of its founding members during the Omnic Crisis, but was forced to lead a defense against an army of Bastions in his home village of Eichenwalde, in the [[Black Forest]] near [[Stuttgart]]. It was during this battle that the omnics unleashed the OR14 (a progenitor to the OR15 on which Orisa is based), which overwhelmed the Crusaders and their army comrades. Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle with his friend and lieutenant Reinhardt Wilhelm, Balderich intended to stand his ground there, sending Reinhardt to protect the other troops, and giving him his Overwatch initiation medal. Armed with both his and Reinhardt's rocket hammers, Balderich held the line inside Eichenwalde Castle, destroying at least a large number of omnics to prevent them from overwhelming Reinhardt and the remaining troops, who at that point were at full retreat, that he was protecting, after which then he collapsed into the throne in the castle's great hall and died from his injuries. Many years later, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - left his tarnished Overwatch medallion on the arm of the throne next to his friend's body, before leaving to answer Winston's call to arms.\n\nThese events are briefly shown in the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', and in more detail in ''Honor and Glory'', while the \"Eichenwalde\" map sees one team trying to protect Balderich's remains in the castle from the other advancing team.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\" />\n\nBalderich von Adler is voiced by Michael Piatt.\n\n====Dae-hyun====\nDae-hyun is a MEKA mechanic assigned to [[#D.Va|D.Va]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/westofhouse/status/1032360277398835200|title=He's a mechanic, specifically assigned to D.Va|last=Chu|first=Michael|date=August 22, 2018|website=[[Twitter]]|access-date=August 24, 2018}}</ref> and a childhood friend of hers.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | title = What is Dae-Hyun's role? - Overwatch Forums | date = August 24, 2018 | accessdate = August 27, 2018 | website = us.blizard.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035652/https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | archive-date = August 28, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> He and D.Va have been working together in the MEKA unit.

Dare to see it for what it ''could'' be.\"\n\nWhen the other gorillas on the moon base rebelled, Harold and the other human scientists were killed; his prodigy took his name \"Winston\" to honor his fallen mentor, and escaped to Earth in a scratch-built rocket.

Seeing this, Blizzard incorporated pachimari more into the game and media, including placing a \"King Pachimari\" atop the payload for the Junkertown map, and licensed official plush toys for purchase.

Overwatch continued to protect the peace until it was disbanded years later under a cloud of suspicion, but its former members have returned to the fore in light of new threats to humanity.

Most game modes bring together two teams of six players each into a match and compete in one of several objective-based game types based on the randomly selected map, including taking control points and escorting a payload.\n\nA match starts with each player selecting from one of the available hero characters.

Players are able to switch between heroes mid-match after they are killed or if they return to their team's base.\n\nEach hero character has fundamentally different attributes such as health and movement speed, at least one basic attack, and at least one unique skill, collectively referred to as a skill kit. These skills can be used repeatedly after waiting out the skill's cooldown period. Each character also has at least one powerful ultimate ability that becomes available once its meter is charged, either slowly over time or through other actions such as killing opponents or healing teammates. Once the ultimate ability is used, the player has to wait for the meter to fill again. All characters have a close-combat, low damage melee attack that can be used at any time.\n\nWinning matches earns the player experience towards experience levels in the meta-game. The player earns a [[loot box]] on reaching a new experience level, which contain a random assortment of character skins, emotes, speech lines, and other cosmetic items for each character without specific game-changing effects. Players can also purchase loot boxes with real-world money.

Her mecha is equipped with rocket ''Boosters'' for short bursts of flight, as well as a ''Defense Matrix'' that allows it to shoot enemy projectiles out of the air. She can also fire a volley of ''Micro-Missiles'' that do splash damage on impact.<ref name=\"vg247 sept2017\"/> D.Va's ultimate ability, ''Self-Destruct'', overloads and detonates her mecha, dealing massive damage to all enemies in a huge radius within line of sight.

As the omnic learned from its battles with the South Korean military, it disrupted the mechs' drone-control abilities, forcing the army to turn to human pilots. They elected to recruit professional gamers, who they believed possessed the necessary skills to pilot their mechs.

He wears a heavy suit of Crusader power armor, and carries a rocket-powered [[war hammer]] (''Rocket Hammer'') as his primary weapon. His main ability is a wide hard-light ''Barrier Field'' mounted on his arm that allows him to protect himself and teammates behind him from enemy fire. He may also launch a flaming projectile that ignores enemy barriers (''Fire Strike''), or use a rocket booster to ''Charge'' into the enemy lines, crushing them against walls. His ultimate ability, ''Earthshatter'', makes him slam his hammer against the ground, sending out a shockwave that incapacitates enemies in front of him.\n\nReinhardt Wilhelm is a decorated [[Bundeswehr]] veteran from [[Stuttgart]] who lives under a knightly code of chivalry. He served as lieutenant to Colonel Balderich von Adler, commander of the Crusaders, which served alongside the regular army to act as their shield. Reckless in his younger years, Reinhardt often left his comrades behind to find glory in battle. That would change during the battle of Eichenwalde, where he lost his left eye to the blade of an OR14 assault omnic: Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle, Balderich gave Reinhardt his Overwatch initiation medal and sent him to rejoin the others, admonishing him to \"be their shield\". Becoming the only Crusader to survive the battle, Reinhardt remained in Overwatch service well into his fifties, his code of ethics and his blunt honesty making him a respected member of the team, until he was forced to retire due to his age and left to watch as Overwatch collapsed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reinhardt/|title=Reinhardt - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> When Winston issued the call to arms to his Overwatch comrades, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - answered without hesitation, despite the belief of his friend Brigitte that Overwatch had tossed him aside due to his age.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | title = The newest Overwatch cinematic, Honor and Glory, is all about Reinhardt | first = Cas | last = Marshall | date = November 3, 2017 | accessdate = November 6, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107055832/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2017/11/3/16604522/overwatch-reinhardt-crusaders-cinematic-honor-glory | archive-date = November 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nReinhardt had started as one of the characters in the cancelled ''Titan'' game, as the \"Juggernaut\" character.

His main weapons are ''Hyperspheres'', gravitic projectiles that can bounce off walls and damage a small area that draw foes into the explosion, and ''Accretion'', which gathers debris into a large projectile to kinetically throw at opponents, causing knockback. He also has two defensive abilities: ''Experimental Barrier'', a shield that he can extend out in front of him to a variable distance and then recall it, upon which it starts regenerating any damage taken; and ''Kinetic Grasp'', which creates a field that absorbs projectiles that hit it which, upon release, coverts that into temporary shields for the character. His ultimate, ''Gravitic Flux'', allows him to fly up briefly to place a black hole on the ground.

Winston's ultimate ability is ''Primal Rage'', in which he briefly gives in to \"the beast within\" to get massively increased health and powerful melee attacks with knockback, although he foregoes his primary weapon.\n\nWinston was among a group of genetically enhanced gorillas living at the Horizon Lunar Colony, a research base on the Moon, intended to test the effects of prolonged habitation in space. He took his name from his mentor and caretaker, Dr. Harold Winston, the colony's chief scientist, from whom he also gained his signature glasses. When the other gorillas rose up, killed the human scientists, and took over the colony, Winston escaped to Earth in a rocket he built himself. He later joined up with Overwatch, offering his scientific expertise to the team (such as building Tracer's chronal accelerator).

He can engage a temporary ''Adaptive Shield'' that increase in strength with the more enemies that are nearby. He can use a ''Grappling Claw'' to attach to a surface, switching the mech to its Roll form, and which he can then swing around, gaining momentum and damage enemies in his path, and release at any time.

However, they can be more vulnerable to attacks from the other team with lower hit points than other roles.\n\n====Ashe====\nAshe, full name Elizabeth Caledonia \"Calamity\" Ashe, is an American gunslinger and leader of the Deadlock Gang, a band of [[Arms trafficking|arms-trafficking]] outlaws based in Arizona. Her main weapon is ''The Viper'', a [[lever action]] [[repeating rifle]] that can be used for short-ranged quick fire or sighted long shots. She also carries a ''[[Coach gun]]'' which can knock enemies back and propel her up or away from obstacles as well as enable limited [[rocket jumping]], and can throw ''[[Dynamite]]'' bundles that detonate after a short delay or immediately when shot with her rifle, setting opponents on fire. Her ultimate ability summons ''B.O.B.'', her Big Omnic Butler/Bodyguard, who charges forward to knock enemies into the air before laying down suppressive fire with his built-in arm cannons. Unlike deployable assets from other heroes, such as Torbj\u00f6rn's turrets, B.O.B. serves as a temporary seventh player on the team until his health is exhausted, and thus is able to capture or challenge objectives, and can be healed by allies.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/02/overwatchs-new-hero-is-ashe | title = Overwatch's new hero is Ashe | first = Mike | last = Minotti | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Venture Beat]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103092117/https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/02/overwatchs-new-hero-is-ashe/ | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/2/18053898/new-overwatch-hero-29-ashe-blizzcon-2018 | title = Overwatch's 29th hero is Ashe of the Deadlock Gang | first = Ashley | last = Oh | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181102215249/https://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/2/18053898/new-overwatch-hero-29-ashe-blizzcon-2018 | archive-date = November 2, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"AsheInfo\">\n{{cite web | url = https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ashe | title = Ashe | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103045903/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/ashe/ | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-bob-capture-points | title = Ashe's friend Bob can capture a point in Overwatch by himself | first = Chris | last = Capel | date = November 7, 2018 | accessdate = November 7, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181107224846/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-bob-capture-points | archive-date = November 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n \nBorn into a wealthy family with connections to the world's top CEOs, Ashe was largely neglected by her parents and left in the care of their omnic butler, B.O.B. She was regularly involved in fights at school, and also in petty crime. It was a chance meeting with a local ruffian named Jesse McCree, a string of crimes they committed together, and a desire to make her own \"family\" that led her to embrace the path of the outlaw, and she was one of the four original founders of the Deadlock Gang. Spurred by Ashe's increasingly larger heists, the Deadlock Gang's quick rise to prominence resulted in violent conflicts with the other criminal organizations in the American Southwest. After years of fighting, Ashe summoned the heads of the other major groups and used her business acumen, learned from her mostly-absent parents, to convince them that they could work better, if not together, then at least not against one another, so long as they kept their word, did not work with law enforcement, respected one another's territory, and punished any sort of betrayal. No longer having to focus on squabbles with other gangs, Ashe continued to build on her reputation, earning her a place at the top of the authorities' most wanted lists.<ref name=\"AsheInfo\"/>\n\nBlizzard considered Ashe a \"unicorn\" character in that her route from conception to implementation was straightforward, a rarity from their past experience. They wanted to create a female gunslinger, but needed to differentiate her from either McCree or Reaper, and some initial designs felt too goth-like. They settled on a mix of a biker and a cowboy. A similar streamlined experience was found with B.O.B., having been already drawn into the storyboard for the animated short \"Reunion\" and became an internal favorite to bring into the game, and only required translating his design into the game. One difficulty faced by the team was how to implement and optimize B.O.B., since he is treated as another teammate while on the field, impacting the game's memory and performance.<ref name=\"ashe makingof\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | title = The making of Overwatch's next hero, Ashe (and BOB) | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = November 2, 2018 | accessdate = November 2, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181103052306/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/2/18057328/overwatch-hero-29-ashe-bob-concept-art-blizzcon-2018 | archive-date = November 3, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nAshe was introduced as the 29th hero in the animated short ''Reunion'', shown at [[BlizzCon#2018|BlizzCon]] on November 2, 2018, and was available to play on the PTR on November 5.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | title = Overwatch's new hero Ashe is now playable on the PTR | first = Bo | last = Moore | date = November 5, 2018 | accessdate = November 5, 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181106005129/https://www.pcgamer.com/overwatchs-new-hero-ashe-is-now-playable-on-the-ptr/ | archive-date = November 6, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She was added to the main game for all players on November 13, 2018,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.destructoid.com/today-s-overwatch-patch-brings-out-ashe-and-more-balance-changes-531105.phtml | title = Today's Overwatch patch brings out Ashe and more balance changes| first =Jordan | last = Devore | date = November 13, 2018 | accessdate = November 13, 2018 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}</ref> and to competitive play on November 27, 2018.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | title = Ashe and Bob join Overwatch competitive play | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = November 27, 2018 | accessdate = November 27, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Heroes Never Die]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181127234356/https://www.heroesneverdie.com/2018/11/27/18114806/ashe-competitive-play-unlock-available | archive-date = November 27, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> She is voiced by veteran voice actress [[Jennifer Hale]].<ref name=\"ashe makingof\"/>\n\n====Bastion====\nBastion is a combat robot-turned-explorer. It can ''Reconfigure'' between a mobile form outfitted with a submachine gun (''Configuration: Recon'') and a stationary form equipped with a [[Gatling gun]] (''Configuration: Sentry''). It also has the ability to ''Self-Repair'' and quickly regain lost health, and its ''Ironclad'' passive reduces damage taken. Its ultimate ability is ''Configuration: Tank'', which allows it to roll on treads and fire explosive rounds from a smooth-bore cannon for a short period of time.\n\nBastion is a SST Laboratories Siege Automaton E54, a battle automaton originally designed for peacekeeping purposes; during the Omnic Crisis, they were deployed against their human makers becoming a symbol of the horrors of the war. Bastion was severely damaged in the field near the German village of Eichenwalde in the [[Black Forest]] during the final days of the war, and was left dormant and exposed to the elements. For more than a decade, it became overgrown with plant life and the nests of small animals, until it unexpectedly reactivated. It had developed a fascination with nature, but its combat programming still took over whenever it encountered anything it perceived as a threat. Due to conflicts with fearful humans, Bastion largely avoids populated areas in favor of exploring the wild.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/bastion/|title=Bastion - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> It is usually accompanied by a small bird named Ganymede, who was building a nest on it when it reactivated, and both humanizes Bastion and makes it relatable.\n\nBastion is the focus of the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', showing the moments when Ganymede inadvertently reactivated it.<ref>\n{{Citation|last=PlayOverwatch|title=Overwatch Animated Short {{!}} \"The Last Bastion\"|date=2016-08-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827005735/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to8yh83jlXg|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=live}}\n</ref> Bastion was also the first character to be made available in [[Lego]] form through official collaboration between Blizzard and [[The Lego Group]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | title = Lego Overwatch First Set Revealed, Available Now | first = Nick | last = Santangelo | date = October 10, 2018 | accessdate = October 10, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181011013718/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/10/lego-overwatch-first-set-revealed-available-now | archive-date = October 11, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> A limited-time event in 2019 allowed players the opportunity to earn a Bastion skin based on the Lego version.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/new-overwatch-event-lets-players-earn-a-lego-themed-bastion-skin/ | title = New Overwatch event lets players earn a Lego-themed Bastion skin | first = Bo | last= Moore | date = September 17, 2019 | accessdate = September 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nBastion is voiced by [[Chris Metzen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/50swfk/ama_request_the_overwatch_sound_design_team/?sort=old|title=AMA Request - The Overwatch Sound design team \u2022 r/Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Doomfist====\n{{Main|Doomfist}}\nDoomfist is both the name of the titular cybernetic [[gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] and the title of its wielder, currently the [[Nigerian]]-born Akande Ogundimu, businessman and mixed martial artist turned mercenary.

Doomfist can charge up a ''Rocket Punch'' that lets him lunge forward and punch an opponent backwards, a ''Seismic Slam'' that launches enemies in its range a short distance towards Doomfist, and a ''Rising Uppercut'' that greatly launches a single enemy while doing damage. Each ability that successfully hits also generates personal shielding for Doomfist (''The Best Defense...'').

Genji's ultimate ability is ''Dragonblade'', during which Genji unsheathes the [[odachi]] on his back and delivers powerful, sweeping melee attacks.\n\nIn his origin story, Genji transforms from a slacker to a superhero.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://killscreen.com/articles/genji-is-with-you/|title=Genji is with you - Kill Screen|date=August 12, 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|title=Overwatch: How to Use Genji Effectively|publisher=|access-date=November 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045314/http://www.shacknews.com/article/94804/overwatch-how-to-use-genji-effectively|archive-date=August 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> His family\u2014the Japanese Shimada crime family\u2014ordered his eldest brother Hanzo to kill Genji for his selfish and hedonistic behavior (as shown in the short ''Dragons''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-animated-short-explores-hanzo-and-genjis-1776890949|title=Overwatch's New Animated Short Explores Hanzo And Genji's Tragic Rivalry|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-hanzo-and-genji-square-off-in-blizzards/1100-6439845/|title=Overwatch's Hanzo and Genji Square Off in Blizzard's Latest Short Film|publisher=}}</ref> and referenced in-game Hanamura map by a shrine devoted to Genji<ref name=\"PC Gamer: hidden lore\" />).

Since the cooldown for his ''Swift Strike'' resets upon scoring a kill, it is best used as a finishing move. Genji's ''Deflect'' ability can counter many enemy ultimate abilities, like Soldier: 76's ''Tactical Visor'' or McCree's ''Deadeye''. While some characters function best when paired with specific teammates, Genji works best in isolation.<ref name=\"Polygon: Guide\" /> Genji is strong against turrets like Bastion and those of Torbj\u00f6rn, and is effective at flanking snipers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/overwatch-how-to-play-genji|title=Overwatch - How to Play Genji|first=Mike|last=Williams|publisher=}}</ref> Genji is vulnerable against characters with energy weapons that bypass his deflection, such as Symmetra, Winston, and Zarya.

He wields the ''Storm Bow'' and is equipped with specialized arrows, including ''Sonic Arrows'' to detect enemies and ''Storm Arrows'' to fire six full-power shots in rapid succession. He is also able to ''Wall Climb'', enabling him to reach vantage points, and ''Lunge'' forward while in mid-air. His ultimate ability is ''Dragonstrike'', in which he unleashes a spiraling spirit dragon that can travel through obstacles to deal damage in a straight line.\n\nHanzo is the elder brother of Genji, and the heir to the head of the Shimada clan. He was trained from an early age to take over the clan, becoming a skilled warrior and marksman, as well as a strategist. When his father died, Hanzo was directed by the clan elders to bring Genji into line; and when Genji refused, the two brothers battled, resulting in what appeared to be Genji's death. Guilty and grief-stricken, Hanzo abandoned the clan and traveled the world in an effort to restore his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/hanzo/|title=Hanzo - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHanzo is the focus of the animated short ''Dragons'', where he visits his family's castle on the day of his duel with Genji, leaving offerings at the castle shrine to honor Genji's memory.<ref name=\"Dragons\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ09xdxzIJQ|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Dragons\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=May 16, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Hanzo had an ability called ''Scatter Arrows'', an arrow that split into multiple arrows that could ricochet off the environment and hit targets around corners. Players grew to find this ability cheap since it, if well-placed, could take out even Tank characters with a single shot. Blizzard addressed this with a rework update that replaced the ability with the above ''Storm Arrows'' and ''Lunge'' abilities, which went live in May 2018.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/03/overwatchs-hanzo-rework-goes-live-today/|title=Overwatch's Hanzo rework goes live today|last=Grubb|first=Jeff|date=May 3, 2018|work=[[Venture Beat]]|accessdate=May 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503225534/https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/03/overwatchs-hanzo-rework-goes-live-today/|archive-date=May 3, 2018|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nHanzo appears as a playable hero in ''[[Heroes of the Storm]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/hanzo/|title=Hanzo - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nHanzo is voiced by [[Paul Nakauchi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/12|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Junkrat====\nJunkrat, real name Jamison Fawkes, is an [[Australians|Australian]] scavenger, mercenary and [[Anarchy|anarchist]].

Junkrat's ultimate ability is ''RIP-Tire'', a self-propelled truck wheel loaded with explosives that he's able to manually steer and detonate. Junkrat was developed by Blizzard to balance out against Torbjorn's turrets.<ref name=\"polygon sxsw\" />\n\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, an \"omnium\" - an A.I. controller that directs omnics as part of a hive mind - was destroyed in the [[Outback]], turning it into an irradiated wasteland. Living in the ruins are the Junkers, a group of scavengers and mercenaries; Jamison Fawkes was among their numbers. The effects of the radiation awakened a sense of madness which soon developed into [[pyromania]]. In the heart of the destroyed omnium, Junkrat found a valuable secret, making him the target of bounty hunters and rival gangs. He made a deal with the Junker enforcer Roadhog, who agreed to become his personal bodyguard in return for a 50-50 share of the profits from their finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/junkrat/|title=Junkrat - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> His loud personality often drives him into trouble, one of them is by blowing away their deception when attempting a Trojan-horse plan to get revenge on the Queen of Junkertown after banishing him and Roadhog from her dominion.<ref name=\"Junkertown: The Plan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q0QGtk_AM0 |title= \"Junkertown: The Plan\" {{!}} Overwatch |last=PlayOverwatch|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nJunkrat appears as a playable hero in [[Heroes of the Storm|''Heroes of the Storm.'']]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/junkrat/|title=Junkrat - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>\n\nJunkrat is voiced by [[Chris Parson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/11|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====McCree====\nMcCree, full name Jesse McCree, is an [[Americans|American]] [[bounty hunter]] and vigilante with a cybernetic arm and a [[Wild West]] motif.

He can quickly dodge attacks using his ''Combat Roll'' ability which also instantly reloads his [[revolver]], and can throw a ''[[Stun grenade|Flashbang]]'' grenade a short distance which stuns enemies and interrupts their abilities.

He and his fellows were captured in an Overwatch sting operation, and he was given a choice: prison, or serving in Blackwatch, the [[black ops]] division of Overwatch. He chose the latter, believing he could make amends for his past crimes, and revelling in the lack of bureaucratic oversight. When Overwatch began to collapse and Blackwatch sought to reform it to its own ends, McCree went underground, resurfacing years later as a gunslinger for hire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/mccree/|title=McCree - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMcCree is considered one of the easiest characters to learn, enabled by the Flashbang/Fan the Hammer combo which can kill most low- to mid-health opponents in one shot.<ref name=\"redbull mccree\" />\n\nMcCree was one of the few characters developed for the game based on a [[stereotype]], often compared to the [[Man with No Name]],<ref name=\"vg247 mccree\"/><ref name=\"redbull mccree\"/> but they developed his character and narratives to embrace that stereotype.<ref name=\"gamasutra dice17\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/292245/How_Overwatchs_bleak_beginnings_turned_into_positivity_and_inclusiveness_.php | title = How Overwatch's bleak beginnings turned into positivity and inclusiveness | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = February 22, 2017 | accessdate = February 22, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170223211459/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/292245/How_Overwatchs_bleak_beginnings_turned_into_positivity_and_inclusiveness_.php | archive-date = February 23, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"eurogamer kaplan ama\">\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-14-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-traces-line-from-project-titan-to-overwatch | title = Blizzard's Jeff Kaplan traces line from Project Titan to Overwatch | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = March 14, 2017 | accessdate = March 14, 2017 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170315001401/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-03-14-blizzards-jeff-kaplan-traces-line-from-project-titan-to-overwatch | archive-date = March 15, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> The visual appearance of McCree came about based on a ''[[Starcraft]]'' tie-in game that the ''Overwatch'' team, following the cancellation of ''[[Titan (Blizzard Entertainment project)|Titan]]'', has considered before settling on ''Overwatch''.<ref name=\"pcgamer crossroads\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-team-considered-making-a-multi-class-mmo-called-crossworlds-before-landing-on-the-hero-shooter/ | title = The Overwatch team originally considered making a multi-class MMO called Crossworlds | first = Samual | last = Horti | date = November 5, 2017 | accessdate = November 5, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171106190355/http://www.pcgamer.com/the-overwatch-team-considered-making-a-multi-class-mmo-called-crossworlds-before-landing-on-the-hero-shooter/ | archive-date = November 6, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Blizzard wanted McCree to be a hero strong against agile opponents and to counter close-range abilities, according to Geoff Goodman.<ref name=\"redbull mccree\"/> To achieve this, McCree has seen a confusing sequence of buffs and nerfs in the months after the game's initial release, which led some to jokingly call him \"the most indecisive character\" of the game.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2016/07/27/overwatch-patch-buffs-ana-nerfs-mccree-again-after-the-buff-on-his-last-nerf/ | title = Overwatch patch buffs Ana, nerfs McCree again after the buff on his last nerf | first = Brenna | last = Hillier | date = July 27, 2016 | accessdate = March 23, 2017 | work = [[VG247]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161221061208/https://www.vg247.com/2016/07/27/overwatch-patch-buffs-ana-nerfs-mccree-again-after-the-buff-on-his-last-nerf/ | archive-date = December 21, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Initially, his burst damage output and versatility on all ranges made him a popular pick in almost any situation, but after numerous tweaks, he lost his main role of a tank killer and became a somewhat ambiguous anti-flanker with additional long-range capability.<ref name=\"redbull mccree\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.redbull.com/us-en/what-makes-overwatch-mccree-so-hard-to-balance | title = What Makes Overwatch's McCree So Hard to Balance? | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = August 12, 2016 | accessdate = March 23, 2017 | work = [[Red Bull]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170324084040/https://www.redbull.com/us-en/what-makes-overwatch-mccree-so-hard-to-balance | archive-date = March 24, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> When these updates were made, Kaplan said that they were necessary to bring more in line with their vision for McCree's role, saying that \"We want McCree to be a counter to people like Tracer, Genji and Reaper.

She wields an ''Endothermic Blaster'' that can either freeze enemies in place with a short-range spray or shoot a long-range icicle projectile, and she can also use it to ''Cryo-Freeze'' herself in a solid ice block to shield herself from damage and heal injuries, as well as erect ''Ice Walls'' with many versatile uses, primarily for blocking the enemies. Her ultimate ability is ''Blizzard'', which calls down Snowball, her personal weather modification drone, to freeze all enemies in a wide radius.\n\nMei was employed by Overwatch to help discover the cause for the planet's changing climate, which had been variously blamed on industry, the increasing Omnic population, and increased consumption of natural resources. While deployed at an Overwatch research base in [[Antarctica]], Mei and the other scientists there were trapped by a polar storm that damaged the facility. Lacking sufficient resources to wait for a rescue, they decided to enter cryostasis. But the pods malfunctioned, and Mei was the only survivor when she was found close to a decade later; by that time, Overwatch had disbanded, and all of the bases set up to monitor the climate crisis had stopped functioning. Mei elected to carry on the work alone, accompanied by Snowball.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/mei/|title=Mei - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> As she restores the base's communication system, she hears Winston's recall for Overwatch, and sets off with Snowball to make her way back to society, joining Winston and Tracer on the first mission to fight the Null Sector off in Paris.<ref name=\"ign story 2019\"/>\n\nMei is the focus of the animated short ''Rise and Shine'', showing the moments after she awakened from cryostasis and had to find a way to call for help.<ref>\n{{Citation|last=PlayOverwatch|title=Overwatch Animated Short {{!}} \"Rise and Shine\"|date=2017-08-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0|accessdate=2017-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824133610/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tjcm_kI0n0|archive-date=August 24, 2017|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\nMei is voiced by [[Zhang Yu (voice actress)|Yu \"Elise\" Zhang]].<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15506768/overwatch-mei-voice-line | title = Overwatch's cutest voice line was a recording booth accident | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = May 1, 2017 | accessdate = May 1, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170502012601/https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/1/15506768/overwatch-mei-voice-line | archive-date = May 2, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n====Pharah====\nPharah, real name Fareeha Amari, is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] security officer. She wears the Raptora Mark VI, a [[Jet pack|jetpack]]-equipped combat suit, and wields a ''[[Rocket launcher|Rocket Launcher]]'' as her primary weapon. She has a Wedjat ([[Eye of Horus]]) tattoo around her right eye. Her abilities are ''Concussive Blast'', a rocket with powerful knockback but no damage, and ''Jump Jets'', a quick jetpack-assisted vertical ascension comparable to a [[rocket jump]]. Her passive ability allows her to ''Hover'' in the air, which is paired well with her Jump Jets ability. Pharah's ultimate ability is ''Barrage'', where she fires a continuous stream of small air-to-ground rockets at targets, while she is frozen still in place.\n\nFareeha Amari is the daughter of Ana Amari, one of the founding members of Overwatch. She served as an officer in the [[Egyptian Army]] and aspired to follow in her mother's footsteps, but Overwatch was disbanded before she could join its ranks. After leaving the army, Pharah took a job with Helix Security International, a private security firm contracted to protect an [[artificial intelligence]] facility below the [[Giza Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/pharah/|title=Pharah - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nPharah is a solid attacker able to consistently maintain pressure on the enemy team. Her rocket launcher allows her to hold chokepoints or lay out suppressive fire onto objectives both in offense and defense, and her vertical agility renders her out of reach for characters reliant on close-range fighting. Her ''Concussion Blast'' disrupts enemy formations, and in the hands of a skilled player it can be used to score environmental kills. Pharah is a good match with Mercy, whose ''Guardian Angel'' ability allows both of them to fly alongside each other; this tactic is often called \"Pharmercy\". Pharah is vulnerable against long-range oriented characters, especially those wielding [[hitscan]] weapons, such as Widowmaker or McCree.\n\nPharah is voiced by Jen Cohn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/3|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Reaper====\nReaper, real name Gabriel Reyes, is an American mercenary and terrorist, originally a founding member of Overwatch, now a leading member of Talon. He is attired in a black hooded trenchcoat with a white skull mask and wields twin ''Hellfire Shotguns''. His abilities are ''Shadow Step'', a medium-range line of sight teleport, and ''Wraith Form'', a brief period of invincibility and speed increase. He was able to heal himself by consuming the souls of fallen enemies, visible as red burning \"Soul Globes\" on the ground but later was changed to a passive ability called ''The Reaping'' which allows him to steal a 20% heal from the damage he deals. Reaper's ultimate ability is ''Death Blossom'', a twin shotgun [[gun kata]] which deals massive damage in a short radius around him.\n\nBorn in [[Los Angeles]], Gabriel Reyes was a veteran officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]] who was subjected to a \"soldier enhancement program\", where he and the other selectees were genetically enhanced to become \"perfect soldiers\"; Reyes became known as \"Soldier: 24\". When the United Nations formed Overwatch to combat the Omnic Crisis, Reyes was one of the two men from the program on the shortlist to join up and was initially tapped to lead it. However, he was passed over in favor of his friend Jack Morrison, causing a rift between the two men. Reyes was later named commander of Blackwatch, Overwatch's black ops division, but his jealousy of Morrison (due to Morrison's publicity as the official leader of Overwatch, versus Reyes' secret dealings with Blackwatch) eventually caused Reyes to reveal Blackwatch's existence to the public, destroying both organizations and resulting in a battle that destroyed their headquarters in [[Switzerland]]. Both men were believed dead, but in reality survived, although Reyes's cells are now simultaneously decaying and regenerating, causing his body to fall apart and rebuild itself over and over again.<ref name=\"FadingGlory\">{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/blog/19809396|title=Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nReyes resurfaced years later as \"the Reaper\", a mysterious mercenary responsible for terrorist attacks all around the world, having been consumed by his hunger for fame to the point that he no longer cared what he was known for. Through the efforts of rogue geneticist and former Blackwatch member [[#Moira|Moira O'Deorain]], he has developed the ability to steal life essence from his enemies, and also become incorporeal to avoid harm.<ref name=\"polygon moira story\"/> His true identity is unknown to the rest of the world, as are his motivations, though a pattern of his movements indicates that he is hunting down former agents of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/reaper/|title=Reaper - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> He appears in the cinematic trailer, teamed with Widowmaker in a raid in the Overwatch Museum to steal Doomfist's gauntlet for Talon.<ref name=\"IntroCinematic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnKB22pOC0|title=Overwatch Cinematic Trailer|last=PlayOverwatch|date=November 7, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He also appears in the animated short ''Recall'', where he raids Winston's lab at [[Gibraltar]] to steal his list of Overwatch agents, though he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Recall\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB5zlHMsM7k|title=Overwatch Animated Short - \"Recall\"|last=PlayOverwatch|date=March 23, 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nReaper is a flanker/assassin type of character, able to teleport behind enemy lines and attack from the rear to single out targets of importance, before using ''Wraith Form'' to escape. The ability to heal from dealing damage helps him in taking out tanks, due to their large bodies and health pools making it easier for him to heal rapidly.

He wears a facemask with a visor and carries an experimental ''Heavy Pulse Rifle'' equipped with an underbarrel launcher that fires three ''Helix Rockets''. His abilities are ''Sprint'', a forward run with no duration limit or cooldown, and ''Biotic Field'', a deployable device which regenerates the health of allies in the immediate vicinity. His ultimate ability, ''Tactical Visor'', puts up a [[head-up display]] that allows his rifle to automatically track enemies in his line of sight for a brief period, similar to an [[aimbot]].\n\nJack Morrison was born in rural [[Indiana]], and enlisted in the United States military when he was eighteen. His bravery and work ethic earned him the attention of the \"soldier enhancement program\", and he later joined Overwatch alongside his friend Gabriel Reyes. His contributions to its success in ending the Omnic Crisis led to his being granted command of the task force, leading to a rift between him and Reyes. As Overwatch came under worldwide scrutiny due to allegations of corruption, the tensions between the two men came to outright conflict, resulting in the destruction of Overwatch headquarters. Morrison was believed to have been killed in the explosion, and was reportedly buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=\"FadingGlory\"/>\n\nFive years later, however, Morrison resurfaced as the vigilante \"Soldier: 76\", becoming the focus of an international manhunt following a series of attacks against former Overwatch facilities, stealing weapons and advanced technologies. He wages a personal war to discover the truth behind the events that led to the fall of Overwatch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/soldier-76/|title=Soldier: 76 - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref> In the \"Bastet\" short story released by Blizzard in January 2019, it is revealed that Soldier: 76 at one point had a gay relationship with a man named Vincent prior to fully investing his time into Overwatch, making him the second confirmed LGBT character of the ''Overwatch'' roster after Tracer.<ref name=\"vg247 s76 gay\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | title = Overwatch short story confirms that Soldier: 76 is gay | first = Shabana | last = Arif | date = January 7, 2019 | accessdate = January 7, 2019 | work = [[VG247]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190108032925/https://www.vg247.com/2019/01/07/overwatchs-soldier-76-confirmed-as-gay/ | archive-date = January 8, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was actually developed by ''Overwatch''{{'}}s creative director [[Chris Metzen]] in the early 2000s as part of non-gaming related projects within Blizzard, and which he later adapted for a comic story used in ''[[Digital Webbing]] Presents'' #16, published in July 2004. Metzen described Soldier: 76's background here as one of a line of American \"super soldiers\" that had been implanted with microchips to give them superhuman abilities. Soldier: 76 was thought killed in an assassination attempt but instead found himself abandoned in South America with no memories of his past, only returning to the United States after a second civil war breaks out, to help try to restore order and discover his past. While ''Overwatch'' modified Metzen's original design, the game's version of Soldier: 76 still maintains the same color scheme and jacket that was used in the comic book story.<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | title = One Overwatch Character Has Been Around For More Than A Decade | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = April 28, 2016 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170528141357/http://kotaku.com/one-overwatch-character-has-been-around-for-more-than-a-1773669625 | archive-date = May 28, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | title = Warcraft, Diablo Creator Joins \"Digital Webbing Presents\" #16 | date = July 7, 2004 | accessdate = May 24, 2017 | work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170825021809/http://www.cbr.com/warcraft-diablo-creator-joins-digital-webbing-presents-16/ | archive-date = August 25, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Within ''Overwatch'' Metzen opted to use the name \"Jack Morrison\" referencing [[John Wayne]] and [[Jim Morrison]].<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | title = Soldier: 76's middle name is Francis | first = Ian | last = Bourdeau | date = September 30, 2018 | accessdate = September 30, 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180930173622/https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-soldier-76-middle-name | archive-date = September 30, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nSoldier: 76 was the most popular offense character during the game's open beta.<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\"/> He was conceived as a \"gateway hero\" to help players that are used to modern shooters ease into the game,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://overwatch.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/blizzcon-2014-overwatch-unveiled-panel-transcript/2|title=BlizzCon 2014 - Overwatch Unveiled Panel Transcript - Page 2 of 4 - Blizzplanet - Overwatch|date=November 24, 2014|publisher=}}</ref> but his versatility and high skill ceiling makes him a good choice for veteran players as well.

His ''Deploy Turret'' allows him to toss a turret a short distance away, which will then self-deploy before targeting and firing on any opponent in its sights. His ''Overload'' ability briefly increases his armor, and improves his speed and attack attributes for a short amount of time. His ultimate abilitiy ''Molten Core'' allows him to shoot up to ten globs of molten metal on the ground, damaging any opponent that crosses through them.\n\nTorbj\u00f6rn Lindholm believes that technology should serve a better vision for humanity, putting him at odds with his employers, who wanted to control the weapons with artificial intelligence. His deep-seated fear of sentient machines, dismissed at first as paranoia, became reality during the Omnic Crisis, during which he was recruited by Overwatch. His engineering knowledge proved invaluable to achieving Overwatch's aim of ending the Omnic Crisis.

Support heroes tend to have the fewest hit points but also can self-regenerate their health at times.\n\n====Ana====\nAna, full name Ana Amari, is an Egyptian sniper and bounty hunter, and one of the founding members of Overwatch. She wields a ''Biotic Rifle'' loaded with smart darts that damage enemies and heal allies, as well as [[Tranquillizer gun|a sidearm that fires ''Sleep Darts'']]. She also carries ''Biotic Grenades'' that disable enemy healing and boost ally healing. Her ultimate ability is ''Nano Boost'', which grants an attack and defense boost to a teammate hero.\n\nHailing from [[Cairo]], Ana Amari was considered the best sniper in the world, and rushed in to support the unprepared Egyptian defense forces during the Omnic Crisis. Her marksmanship and her critical decision-making skills led to her being recruited by Overwatch, and she served for many years as Jack Morrison's second-in-command during the conflict, while trying to be a mother to her daughter, Fareeha. Even with her command responsibility, Ana refused to give up going on combat missions. Remaining in service well into her fifties, Ana was believed to have been killed by Widowmaker during a hostage rescue; when Ana hesitated to make the kill shot, realizing that her target had in fact been her friend Am\u00e9lie Lacroix, Widowmaker shot her through her rifle's lens, destroying her right eye, then proceeded to kill the hostages.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|title=[NEW HERO] Ana Origin Story - Overwatch|last=PlayOverwatch|date=July 12, 2016|via=YouTube|access-date=July 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713082817/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzFWIw7wV8Q|archive-date=July 13, 2016|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://comic.playoverwatch.com/en-us/legacy|title=Blizzard - Comic Book Experience|publisher=}}</ref> Though Ana survived, Overwatch soon disbanded.

When they started brainstorming new playable heroes, the idea of an [[alchemy|alchemist]] was raised, leading to the concept of a \"skill-based support healer\", according to Chu. This led to them to consider making Ana this new playable character, as these support sniper skills would contrast well against those of the already-established character of Widowmaker.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | title = Overwatch Lead Writer Discusses Diversity and New Webcomic | first = Jason | last = Imms | date = December 20, 2016 | accessdate = December 21, 2016 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161224175838/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-lead-writer-discusses-diversity-and-new-/1100-6446434/ | archive-date = December 24, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Ana was the first character to be added to ''Overwatch'' following its launch; she was announced and available to play on the Public Test regions on July 12, 2016,<ref>\n{{Cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | title = Our first look at Overwatch's new hero, Ana | first = Chris | last = Bratt | date = July 12, 2016 | accessdate = July 12, 2016 | work = [[Eurogamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160713160749/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-07-12-our-first-look-at-overwatchs-new-hero-ana | archive-date = July 13, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> and was playable by all PC and console players on July 19, 2016.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | title = Overwatch's new hero, Ana, is now live for all to play | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = July 19, 2016 | accessdate = July 19, 2016 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160721062559/http://kotaku.com/overwatch-s-new-hero-ana-is-now-live-for-all-to-play-1783928089 | archive-date = July 21, 2016 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> In January 2019, Blizzard published a short story \"Bastet\" that focused on Ana and her relationship with Soldier:76.

His active abilities includes a ''Regenerative Burst'' that heals himself and nearby allies over a short period of time, and an ''Immortality Field'' device that prevents teammates from dying while in range, but the device itself can be destroyed prematurely.

He enlisted in the military of the Caribbean Coalition, an alliance of island nations united by the crisis, as a combat medic, driven by his desire to help others; he would eventually rise to become part of the Coalition's special ops division. After the end of the war, Baptiste struggled to find work until he was recruited by Talon, one of a number of mercenary groups that arose in the aftermath of the crisis. At first, he thrived within Talon, which gave him easy assignments that paid well enough for him to establish a clinic in his hometown. As time went on, however, the missions his unit was sent on became increasingly violent, including assassinations of rivals and operations that involved civilian casualties. Disgusted, Baptiste abandoned Talon and set out to wander the world, offering his aid where he could. Realizing that Baptiste knew too much about their operations, Talon regularly sent assassins, including members of his former unit, to silence him, without success; those few who were able to locate him were never seen again.<ref name=\"poly baptiste announce\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/25/18238602/overwatch-baptiste-hero-origins-animation-reveal | title = Overwatch reveals its newest hero, the support soldier Baptiste | first = Cass | last = Marshall | date = February 25, 2019 | accessdate = February 25, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190226012602/https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/25/18238602/overwatch-baptiste-hero-origins-animation-reveal | archive-date = February 26, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"BaptisteInfo\">\n{{cite web | url = https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/baptiste | title = Baptiste | date = February 26, 2019 | accessdate = February 26, 2019 | work = [[Blizzard Entertainment]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190227060726/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/baptiste | archive-date = February 27, 2019 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nAfter approximately a week of teases through their social media sites, Blizzard formally introduced Baptiste as the game's 30th hero with an origin story video on February 25, 2019,<ref name=\"poly baptiste announce\"/> and was added to the PTR the following day.<ref name=\"pcgamer baptiste intro\"/> Baptiste was made live for all servers on March 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/03/19/overwatch-adds-baptiste-hero-30/ | title = Overwatch patches in Baptiste to patch you up | first= Alice | last = O'Conner | date = March 19, 2019 | accessdate = March 19, 2019 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> In June 2019, Blizzard released \"What You Left Behind\" a short story about Baptiste's background written by [[Alissa Wong]] and illustrated by [[Arnold Tsang]].

As such, Brigitte became close friends with Reinhardt, and grew up on his tales of heroes and chivalry. While Torbj\u00f6rn was more interested in creating weapons, Brigitte's aptitudes were for creating armor and defensive systems. After the fall of Overwatch, Reinhardt elected to travel the world as something of a knight-errant, and Brigitte, to his surprise, asked him if she could accompany him as his squire, to which he agreed. Her job included maintaining Reinhardt's Crusader armor, to which she was well-suited as it was based on a design created by her father, but as time went on, she was often required to take care of Reinhardt himself, who maintained an overenthusiasm for combat in spite of his increasing age and frailty. Eventually she decided that just maintaining Reinhardt's armor was not enough, and had Reinhardt train her in combat while she created her own suit of armor in secret, so that she could fight alongside him.<ref name=\"BrigitteBio\">\n{{Cite web |url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/brigitte/ |title=Brigitte - Heroes - Overwatch |access-date=February 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228181926/https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/brigitte |archive-date=February 28, 2018 |url-status=live  }}\n</ref> She accompanies Reinhardt to answer Winston's Overwatch recall.<ref name=\"ign story 2019\"/>\n\nShe appears in the digital comics ''Dragon Slayer'' and ''Reflections''.

When Overwatch disbanded, she dedicated herself to helping those who were affected by decades of global war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/mercy/|title=Mercy - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMercy was the most popular support character during the game's open beta.<ref name=\"Polygon: beta stats\" /> Like Symmetra, Mercy saw a major redesign in a September 2017 update, as initially her ultimate ability was ''Resurrect'' that could be used to bring all downed players in a small radius back to full health, but which encouraged Mercy players to stay out of battle until needed. With her present kit, Mercy has become a divisive character in the game's meta, being nearly always picked as part of a team composition in competitive modes, but changing the dynamics of a match's ebb and flow.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://compete.kotaku.com/mercys-redesign-shows-the-tug-of-war-between-casual-and-1819780953 | title = Mercy's Redesign Shows The Tug Of War Between Casual And Competitive Overwatch | first = Maddy | last = Myers | date = October 23, 2017 | accessdate = November 16, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171118232350/https://compete.kotaku.com/mercys-redesign-shows-the-tug-of-war-between-casual-and-1819780953 | archive-date = November 18, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nMercy is voiced by [[Lucie Pohl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/14|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Moira====\n{{main|Moira (Overwatch)}}\nMoira, full name Moira O'Deorain, is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[geneticist]], a leading member of Talon, and Minister of Genetics for the city of Oasis. ''Overwatch'' executive producer Jeff Kaplan has labelled Moira as a \"hybrid\" hero; while categorized as a support character, she possesses abilities to also deal a high amount of damage. Her main weapon is the ''Biotic Grasp'', which latches on to nearby enemies and drains their health and biotic energy; this biotic energy can then be sprayed out in a cone to heal her allies.<ref name=\"vb moira\"/> Her skills include ''Fade'', allowing her to teleport a short distance, and ''Biotic Orb'', a rebounding sphere that can either heal nearby allies or damage nearby enemies. Her ultimate ability is ''Coalescence'', a beam that heals all allies and injures all opponents it passes, bypassing any shields that may be in place.<ref name=\"gs moria\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-overwatch-hero-revealed-moira-the-dps-healer/1100-6454645/ | title = New Overwatch Hero Revealed, Moira The DPS Healer| first = Alessandro | last = Fillari | date = November 3, 2017 | accessdate = November 3, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nOriginally from [[Dublin]], Moira O'Deorain made waves in the scientific community more than a decade prior to the game, after publishing a controversial paper detailing a methodology for creating custom genetic programs that could alter DNA at a cellular level. Most scientists found her research dangerous due to its perceived ethical shortfalls, with some even going so far as to accuse her of having the same obsession with scientific advancement that started the Omnic Crisis. Adding to the controversy, other geneticists were unable to reproduce the results of her research. With her career stalled, Moira received a lifeline from an unlikely source: Blackwatch, the covert ops division of Overwatch under the command of Gabriel Reyes. Her involvement with Blackwatch was kept a secret until inquiries following an incident in Venice (played out in the story-based game mode \"Retribution\") revealed her work, forcing Overwatch to publicly disavow any ties to her or her work. After Overwatch disbanded, Moira was employed by the Ministries, the scientific collective that founded the city of Oasis in southern [[Iraq]], as the head of the Ministry of Genetics. She was also financed by Talon, and (along with Doomfist and Reaper) is among the members of its ruling council who appear in the game. Her origin story video reveals that she is responsible for transforming Gabriel Reyes into Reaper.<ref name=\"polygon moira story\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/3/16604950/overwatch-moira-backstory-origin-story-lore | title = Overwatch's Moira backstory fills a gap in the lore | first = Ashley | last = Oh | date = November 3, 2017 | accessdate = November 3, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polgon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032028/https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/3/16604950/overwatch-moira-backstory-origin-story-lore | archive-date = November 4, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref><ref name=\"gs moria\"/> She had made an appearance in Doomfist's introductory comic, released earlier in 2017.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/new-overwatch-hero-moira-made-a-cameo-in-doomfists-comic-months-ago | title = New Overwatch Hero Moira Made a Cameo in Doomfist's Comic Months Ago | first = Caty | last = McCarthy | date = November 3, 2017 | accessdate = November 4, 2017 | work = [[US Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171105062138/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/new-overwatch-hero-moira-made-a-cameo-in-doomfists-comic-months-ago | archive-date = November 5, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref>\n\nMoira was announced at BlizzCon 2017 as the game's 26th hero on November 3, 2017,<ref name=\"gs moria\"/> and was made available to play on the Public Test Region a few days later.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-character-moira-is-out-now-on-pc-fo/1100-6454712/ | title = Overwatch's New Character, Moira, Is Out Now On PC For Some | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = November 6, 2017 | accessdate = November 6, 2017 | work = [[GameSpot]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107060758/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatchs-new-character-moira-is-out-now-on-pc-fo/1100-6454712/ | archive-date = November 7, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Moira was added for all players in all regions on November 16, 2017.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://compete.kotaku.com/1820515472 | title = Moira, Overwatch's new healer, has just gone live | first = Maddy | last = Myers | date = November 16, 2017 | accessdate = November 16, 2017 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001922/https://compete.kotaku.com/1820515472 | archive-date = November 17, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> Kaplan said that Moira had been in the works for months well prior to this, having anticipated that the ''Overwatch'' player base had been asking for another healer character.<ref name=\"vb moira\"/> Kaplan believed that Moira's fit as a healer depends on the proper team composition where the team generally stays in close proximity, but that her abilities can help support those that tend to separate from the group, like Genji.<ref name=\"vb moira\"/> Art-wise, she was envisioned by Arnold Tsang to be a [[warlock]]- or [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]-like character, with robes, sleeves and hand motions that evoked a use of magic.<ref name=\"usgamer moira\">\n{{cite web | url = https://www.usgamer.net/articles/overwatch-devs-discuss-moira-blizzard-world-and-which-overwatch-heroes-play-warcraft | title = Overwatch Devs Discuss Moira, Blizzard World, and Which Overwatch Heroes Play WarCraft | first = Matt | last = Kim | date = November 8, 2017 | accessdate = November 8, 2017 | work = [[US Gamer]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171111031134/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/overwatch-devs-discuss-moira-blizzard-world-and-which-overwatch-heroes-play-warcraft | archive-date = November 11, 2017 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> This subsequently created some difficulty with her character animations, specifically her sleeves; while they had done long flowing clothes before for Reaper, animating the sleeves with the complex hand movements took several months.

Rather than moving on foot, he floats above the ground in a meditative pose. He is surrounded by a circle of 8 floating metal orbs named the ''Orbs of Destruction'' (resembling [[prayer beads]]), which he can use to launch a form of energy to damage foes, either one at a time or through a charged-shot. He can also cast these orbs onto teammates as ''Orbs of Harmony'' to regenerate health, or onto enemies as ''Orbs of Discord'' that lower their defenses. His ultimate ability is ''Transcendence'', which makes him temporarily invulnerable and applies massive regenerative effects to his allies in a large radius around him.\n\nZenyatta belonged to the Shambali, an order of omnic monks that had settled in a monastery deep within the [[Himalayas]] in northern [[Nepal]], after experiencing a \"spiritual awakening\" that led them to believe that, like humans, omnics also possessed a soul. Their leader, Tekhartha Mondatta, sought to heal the breach between humans and omnics and bring them into societal harmony through the spreading of their peaceful message in public rallies (one of which resulted in Mondatta's assassination by Widowmaker in London). Zenyatta disagreed with this approach, believing that only directly engaging humans and connecting with them person-to-person will bridge the divide between man and machine. He left the Shambali monastery and wandered the world, seeking to help those he meets find inner peace (such as his encounter with the cyborg warrior Genji). He made Genji, a cyborg, more relaxed and made him understand the purpose of his metallic body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/zenyatta/|title=Zenyatta - Overwatch|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nZenyatta is voiced by [[Feodor Chin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twinfinite.net/gallery/here-are-the-voice-actors-of-the-overwatch-cast/5|title=Here Are the Voice Actors of the Overwatch Cast|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Non-playable characters===\nThe following are characters who appear in other ''Overwatch'' media.\n\n====Antonio Bartalotti====\nAntonio Bartalotti was an [[Italian people|Italian]] businessman and member of Talon who orchestrated a terrorist attack on Overwatch's headquarters in Oslo, Norway, in the comic \"Retribution\".

Balderich was approached by Overwatch to become one of its founding members during the Omnic Crisis, but was forced to lead a defense against an army of Bastions in his home village of Eichenwalde, in the [[Black Forest]] near [[Stuttgart]]. It was during this battle that the omnics unleashed the OR14 (a progenitor to the OR15 on which Orisa is based), which overwhelmed the Crusaders and their army comrades. Retreating into Eichenwalde Castle with his friend and lieutenant Reinhardt Wilhelm, Balderich intended to stand his ground there, sending Reinhardt to protect the other troops, and giving him his Overwatch initiation medal. Armed with both his and Reinhardt's rocket hammers, Balderich held the line inside Eichenwalde Castle, destroying at least a large number of omnics to prevent them from overwhelming Reinhardt and the remaining troops, who at that point were at full retreat, that he was protecting, after which then he collapsed into the throne in the castle's great hall and died from his injuries. Many years later, Reinhardt - living in the ruins of Eichenwalde - left his tarnished Overwatch medallion on the arm of the throne next to his friend's body, before leaving to answer Winston's call to arms.\n\nThese events are briefly shown in the animated short ''The Last Bastion'', and in more detail in ''Honor and Glory'', while the \"Eichenwalde\" map sees one team trying to protect Balderich's remains in the castle from the other advancing team.<ref name=\"HonorAndGlory\" />\n\nBalderich von Adler is voiced by Michael Piatt.\n\n====Dae-hyun====\nDae-hyun is a MEKA mechanic assigned to [[#D.Va|D.Va]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/westofhouse/status/1032360277398835200|title=He's a mechanic, specifically assigned to D.Va|last=Chu|first=Michael|date=August 22, 2018|website=[[Twitter]]|access-date=August 24, 2018}}</ref> and a childhood friend of hers.<ref>\n{{cite web | url = https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | title = What is Dae-Hyun's role? - Overwatch Forums | date = August 24, 2018 | accessdate = August 27, 2018 | website = us.blizard.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035652/https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/what-is-dae-hyuns-role/195936/17 | archive-date = August 28, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}\n</ref> He and D.Va have been working together in the MEKA unit.

Harold took a special interest in one young gorilla who showed a great curiosity for the world around him, beginning with stealing Harold's glasses because he thought there would be more to see. Showing the young gorilla a view of Earth, Harold gave him a piece of advice he remembered years later: \"Never accept the world as it appears to be. Dare to see it for what it ''could'' be.\"\n\nWhen the other gorillas on the moon base rebelled, Harold and the other human scientists were killed; his prodigy took his name \"Winston\" to honor his fallen mentor, and escaped to Earth in a scratch-built rocket.

James and his lover, Zoe, are having sex for the last time at her beach house, where she reveals that she is pregnant with James' child. Wishing to block out all feelings and avoid what's coming, James berates Zoe for sharing her news and leaves for \"the party to end all parties\".\n\nAfter having his car stolen, he comes across two men who have kidnapped a young girl and are planning to rape her. James kills them, and rescues the girl. The girl, named Rose, explains that she was separated from her father in [[Malaga, Western Australia|Malaga]] en route to her aunt's house in [[Roleystone, Western Australia|Roleystone]]. Without enough petrol, and wishing to get to his party, James instead plans to leave her with his sister and her children. But upon arriving, he finds his sister and her husband dead in the shower, and three crosses marking what appear to be his nieces' graves, in what is an apparent [[murder suicide]].\n\nOther attempts at locating Rose's dad, or someone to leave her with, have sobering results, and James eventually heads to the party with Rose in tow. The party is overflowing with people, a game of [[Russian roulette]] is being played, and an orgy is going on inside the house. James is noticeably uncomfortable and appears to want to leave. James meets with the host of the party, Freddy, whose sister is James' girlfriend, Vicki. James leaves Rose in the pool to speak with Vicki. In a reversal of the earlier scene with Zoe, James attempts to share a serious moment with Vicki, only for her to berate him for bringing her down with his news.\n\nVicki shows James a bunker built underneath Freddy's garage, which obviously does not have sufficient food, protection, or space for the miraculous survival Vicki envisions. James tells Vicki and Freddy that they will all die, even with the bunker. Freddy's reaction to this statement informs Vicki that her brother had known this all along. James accepts that his death is inevitable and cannot be blocked out, and commits himself to reuniting Rose with her family.\n\nMeanwhile, outside, a drug-affected woman follows Rose, claiming that she is her daughter, Mandy. When James finally comes back outside to find Rose, she is hallucinating and vomiting after being coerced into taking an [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy pill]], with the woman leaning over her. James tries to leave the party with Rose, causing the woman to scream that he is kidnapping her child. Freddy holds James at gunpoint, before Vicki calmly takes the gun and shoots the woman, telling James to go.\n\nJames drives Rose to his estranged mother's house, with whom he reconciles whilst Rose recovers. She gives James petrol and Rose some old clothes, and the pair leave for Rose's aunt's house. Upon arrival, nobody seems to be home, but James finds the bodies of Rose's family, including her father, outside in what seems to be a [[mass suicide]]. Although hysterical at the news of her father's death, Rose insists on seeing him. James comforts her and brings her his body, and they lay him by a pond with flowers as she tells him that her dad wanted them to be together for the end. James then confides in Rose about his relationship with Zoe and her pregnancy, which leads him to realise his love for her. Rose convinces him to make amends with her while he still can. He heeds her advice, and the two share an emotional farewell before James leaves. His car overheats on the highway as the firestorm approaches, and he runs for the rest of the way.

It was selected to be screened as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Cannes2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes/cannes-directors-fortnight-2014-lineup-unveiled/5070844.article |title=Cannes Directors' Fortnight 2014 lineup unveiled |accessdate=26 April 2014 |work=[[Screen International|Screendaily]]}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in [[Perth]], and begins ten minutes after an [[Impact event|asteroid has collided with earth]] in the [[North Atlantic]], leaving approximately twelve hours until the subsequent global [[firestorm]] reaches [[Western Australia]]. James and his lover, Zoe, are having sex for the last time at her beach house, where she reveals that she is pregnant with James' child. Wishing to block out all feelings and avoid what's coming, James berates Zoe for sharing her news and leaves for \"the party to end all parties\".\n\nAfter having his car stolen, he comes across two men who have kidnapped a young girl and are planning to rape her. James kills them, and rescues the girl. The girl, named Rose, explains that she was separated from her father in [[Malaga, Western Australia|Malaga]] en route to her aunt's house in [[Roleystone, Western Australia|Roleystone]]. Without enough petrol, and wishing to get to his party, James instead plans to leave her with his sister and her children. But upon arriving, he finds his sister and her husband dead in the shower, and three crosses marking what appear to be his nieces' graves, in what is an apparent [[murder suicide]].\n\nOther attempts at locating Rose's dad, or someone to leave her with, have sobering results, and James eventually heads to the party with Rose in tow. The party is overflowing with people, a game of [[Russian roulette]] is being played, and an orgy is going on inside the house. James is noticeably uncomfortable and appears to want to leave. James meets with the host of the party, Freddy, whose sister is James' girlfriend, Vicki. James leaves Rose in the pool to speak with Vicki. In a reversal of the earlier scene with Zoe, James attempts to share a serious moment with Vicki, only for her to berate him for bringing her down with his news.\n\nVicki shows James a bunker built underneath Freddy's garage, which obviously does not have sufficient food, protection, or space for the miraculous survival Vicki envisions. James tells Vicki and Freddy that they will all die, even with the bunker. Freddy's reaction to this statement informs Vicki that her brother had known this all along. James accepts that his death is inevitable and cannot be blocked out, and commits himself to reuniting Rose with her family.\n\nMeanwhile, outside, a drug-affected woman follows Rose, claiming that she is her daughter, Mandy. When James finally comes back outside to find Rose, she is hallucinating and vomiting after being coerced into taking an [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy pill]], with the woman leaning over her. James tries to leave the party with Rose, causing the woman to scream that he is kidnapping her child. Freddy holds James at gunpoint, before Vicki calmly takes the gun and shoots the woman, telling James to go.\n\nJames drives Rose to his estranged mother's house, with whom he reconciles whilst Rose recovers. She gives James petrol and Rose some old clothes, and the pair leave for Rose's aunt's house. Upon arrival, nobody seems to be home, but James finds the bodies of Rose's family, including her father, outside in what seems to be a [[mass suicide]]. Although hysterical at the news of her father's death, Rose insists on seeing him. James comforts her and brings her his body, and they lay him by a pond with flowers as she tells him that her dad wanted them to be together for the end. James then confides in Rose about his relationship with Zoe and her pregnancy, which leads him to realise his love for her. Rose convinces him to make amends with her while he still can. He heeds her advice, and the two share an emotional farewell before James leaves. His car overheats on the highway as the firestorm approaches, and he runs for the rest of the way. He finds Zoe on the beach, watching the approaching firestorm. She is initially hostile towards James, however the two quickly reconcile and confess their mutual love. The pair then embrace, and turn towards the ocean as they are consumed by the firestorm.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nathan Phillips (actor)|Nathan Phillips]] as James\n* [[Angourie Rice]] as Rose\n* [[Jessica De Gouw]] as Zoe\n* [[Kathryn Beck]] as Vicki\n* [[Daniel Henshall]] as Freddy\n* [[Sarah Snook]] as Mandy's mother\n* [[Lynette Curran]] as James' mother\n* [[David Field (actor)|David Field]] as Radio Man\n{{div end}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''These Final Hours'' opened in a [[limited release]] across Australia, grossing $360,234 throughout its entire theatrical run.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 83% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.03/10.
