Douglas'''; August 27, 1877 \u2013 February 13, 1951) was an American [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] and author.\n\nDouglas was one of the most popular American authors of his time, although he did not write his first novel until he was 50.\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born in [[Columbia City, Indiana]], spent part of his boyhood in [[Monroeville, Indiana]], [[Wilmot, Indiana|Wilmot]], Indiana and [[Florence, Kentucky]], where his father, [[Alexander Jackson Douglas]], was pastor of the Hopeful Lutheran Church.  According to the 1910 Census Douglas was listed as a Lutheran Clergyman.  He was married to Bessie I. Porch.  They had two children: Bessie J. Douglas, 4 at the time and Virginia V Douglas, 2 at the time. They employed a cook, Ms. Josephine Somach. He died in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\nAfter receiving the A.M. degree from Wittenberg College (now [[Wittenberg University]]) in Springfield, Ohio, in 1903, Douglas was ordained in the [[Lutheran]] ministry. He served in pastorates in [[North Manchester, Indiana]], [[Lancaster, Ohio]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]. From 1911 to 1915, he was director of religious work at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. The next six years, he was minister of ''The First Congregational Church'' in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], from there moving to [[Akron, Ohio]], and serving as the Sr. Minister of the [[First Congregational Church of Akron]] from 1920 to 1926, then to Los Angeles, California, and finally to [[St. James United Church (Montreal)|St. James United Church]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], from which pulpit he retired to write.  His biographer, Louis Sheaffer, comments, \"he never stated publicly why he changed denominations.\"\n\nHis written works were of a moral, [[didactic]], and distinctly religious tone. His first novel, ''[[Magnificent Obsession]]'', published in 1929, was an immediate and sensational success. Critics held that his type of fiction was in the tradition of the great religious writings of an earlier generation, such as ''[[Ben-Hur (novel)|Ben-Hur]]'' and ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]''.\n\nDouglas then wrote ''Forgive Us Our Trespasses''; ''Precious Jeopardy''; ''[[Green Light (1937 film)|Green Light]]''; ''[[White Banners]]''; ''[[Disputed Passage]]''; '' Invitation To Live''; ''Doctor Hudson's Secret Journal''; ''[[The Robe]]'', and ''[[The Big Fisherman]]''. ''The Robe'' sold more than 2 million copies, without any reprint edition.  Douglas sold the motion picture rights to this story, though the [[The Robe (film)|film]], starring Richard Burton, was not released until 1953, after Douglas's death.\n\nHis own unhappy experience of filming prompted Douglas, when he produced ''The Big Fisherman'' as the sequel to ''The Robe'', to stipulate that ''The Big Fisherman'' would be his last novel, and that he would not permit it to be made into a motion picture, used over the radio, condensed or serialised. Eventually, ''The Big Fisherman'' was filmed in 1959, starring [[Howard Keel]] in one of his few non-singing screen roles as Peter.\n\nHis last book was the autobiographical ''Time To Remember'' which described his life up to his childhood and education for the ministry. He died before he was able to write the intended second volume but the task was completed in ''The Shape of Sunday'' by his daughters, Virginia Douglas Dawson and Betty Douglas Wilson.\n\nDouglas is buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].\n\n==Works==\n* ''The Fate Of The Limited'', (1919)\n* ''Wanted - A Congregation'', (1920)\n* ''An Affair Of The Heart'', (1922)\n* ''The Minister's Everyday Life'', (1924)\n* ''These Sayings Of Mine: An Interpretation Of The Teachings Of Jesus'', (1926)\n* ''Those Disturbing Miracles'', (1927)\n* ''Magnificent Obsession'', (1929)\n* ''Forgive Us Our Trespasses'', (1932)\n* ''Precious Jeopardy: A Christmas Story'', (1933)\n* ''The College Student Facing A Muddled World'', (1933)\n* ''Green Light'', (1935)\n* ''White Banners'', (1936)\n* ''Home For Christmas'', (1937)\n* ''Disputed Passage'', (1939)\n* ''Dr Hudson's Secret Journal'', (1939)\n* ''Invitation To Live'', (1940)\n* ''The Robe'', (1942)\n* ''The Big Fisherman'', (1948)\n* ''A Time To Remember'', (1951)\n* ''The Living Faith: Selected Sermons'', (1955)\n \nSource: <ref name=authorandbook>{{cite web |title=Author - Rev, Doya Cassel Douglas |url=http://www.authorandbookinfo.com/cgi-bin/auth.pl?D003277 |publisher=Author and Book Info}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{Citation | first = Lloyd C | last = Douglas | title = Time to Remember | place = Boston | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year=1951}}.\n* {{Citation | first1 = VD | last1 = Dawson | first2 = BD | last2 = Wilson | title = The Shape of Sunday: An Intimate Biography of Lloyd C Douglas | year = 1952}} (by his daughters).\n* {{Citation | first = H Max | last = Lentz | title = A History of the Lutheran Churches in Boone County, Kentucky, together with Sketches of the Pastors Who Have Served Them | place = York, PA | publisher = Anstadt & Sons | year = 1902 | pages = 80\u201383}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Louis | last = Sheaffer | chapter = Lloyd Cassel Douglas | title = Dictionary of American Biography | pages = 181\u2013182 (Supplement 5)}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* {{Find a Grave|6739}}\n* {{FadedPage|id=Douglas, Lloyd C.|name=Lloyd C.

The national flag on the Peace Tower is also hoisted to full mast if a foreign [[head of state]] or [[head of government]] is visiting the parliament. These exemptions, though, do not apply to the period of mourning for the death of a [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian monarch]]. The [[Queen's Personal Canadian Flag|Royal Standard of Canada]] also never flies at half-mast, as it is considered representative of the sovereign, who ascends to the throne automatically upon the death of his or her predecessor. Each province can make its own determination of when to fly the flag at half-mast when provincial leaders or honoured citizens pass away.\n\nTo raise a flag in this position, the flag must be flown to the top of the pole first, then brought down halfway before the flag is secured for flying. When such mourning occurs, all flags should be flown at that position or not be flown at all, with the exception of flags permanently attached to poles.<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=31 March 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1901/01/23/archives/grief-in-canada-flags-at-half-mast-everywhere-and-amusement-places.html |title=Flags at Half Mast Everywhere and Amusement Places Closed. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 January 1901}}</ref>\n\nA controversy surfaced in April 2006, when the newly elected [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government discontinued the practice, initiated by the previous [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government following the [[Tarnak Farm incident]],<ref name=\"tarnak\">{{Cite news |accessdate=31 March 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/yourspace/flag_halfmast.html |title=Conservatives decide not to lower the Canadian flag to fly the flag at half-mast every time a Canadian soldier is killed |publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC]] |date=1 April 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120115035/http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/yourspace/flag_halfmast.html |archivedate=20 January 2011}}</ref> of flying the flag at half-mast on all government buildings whenever a Canadian soldier was killed in action in [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/24/flag060424.html |title=Peace Tower flag will not be lowered for military deaths |publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC]] |date=24 April 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606225332/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/24/flag060424.html |archivedate=6 June 2008}}</ref> The issue divided veterans' groups and military families, some of whom supported the return to the original tradition of using Remembrance Day to honour all soldiers killed in action, while others felt it was an appropriate way to honour the fallen and to remind the population of the costs of war.<ref name=\"tarnak\" /> In spite of the federal government's policy, local authorities have often decided to fly the flag at half-mast to honour fallen soldiers who were from their jurisdiction, including [[Toronto]] and [[Saskatchewan]].<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2006/08/08/flags-sask.html |title=Sask. flags at half-mast for fallen soldier |publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC]] |date=9 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508121537/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2006/08/08/flags-sask.html |archivedate=8 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2008, the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] voted in favour of a motion calling on the government to reinstate the former policy regarding the half-masting of the flag on federal buildings.

At the same time, a federal advisory committee tabled its report on the protocol of flying the national flag at half-mast, recommending that the Peace Tower flag remain at full height on days such as the Police Officers National Memorial Day and the National Day or Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, stating that the flag should only be half-masted on Remembrance Day.

For example, the flag was flown at half-mast after the deaths of [[Zhou Enlai]] (1976), [[Zhu De]] (1976), [[Mao Zedong]] (1976), [[Soong Ching-ling]] (1981), [[Hu Yaobang]] (1989), [[Li Xiannian]] (1992), [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1997),[[Yang Shangkun]] (1998), [[Qiao Shi]](2015), [[Wan Li]](2015) and [[Li Peng]](2019),as well as death of foreigners such as [[Joseph Stalin]](1953) , [[Patrice Lumumba]](1961) , [[Charles de Gaulle]](1970) and [[Norodom Sihanouk]](2012).\n*When major disasters happen, such as when the flag was flown at half-mast from 19 to 21 May 2008, the three national mourning days for the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]\uff0cas well as at 4 April 2020 ([[Qingming Festival]])\uff0cthe national mourning day for the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Finland==\n[[File:Half raised flag.jpg|thumb|The [[Flag of Finland|Finnish flag]] flying at half-mast after the [[2011 Norway attacks]].]]\nIn Finland, the official term for flying a flag at half-mast is known as ''suruliputus'' (''mourning by flag(ging)''). It is performed by raising the flag briefly to the top of the mast and lowering it approximately one-third of the length of the flagpole, placing the lower hoist corner at half-mast. On wall-mounted and roof-top flagpoles the middle of the flag should fly at the middle of the flagpole. When removing the flag from half-mast, it is briefly hoisted to the finial before lowering.\n\nTraditionally, private residences and apartment houses fly the national flag at half-mast on the day of the death of a resident, when the flag is displayed at half-mast until sunset or 21:00, whichever comes first. Flags are also flown at half-mast on the day of the burial, with the exception that the flag is to be hoisted to the finial after the inhumation takes place.\n\nFlags are also to be flown at half-mast on the days of national mourning. Such days are the deaths of former or current [[President of Finland|Finnish presidents]], as well as significant catastrophic events such as the aftermath of [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], [[2011 Norway attacks]] and significant national events such as the 2004 [[Konginkangas bus disaster]] and school shootings of [[Jokela school shooting|Jokela]] and [[Kauhajoki school shooting|Kauhajoki]].\n\nHistorically, flags were flown at half-mast on the [[Commemoration Day of Fallen Soldiers]] which takes place on the third Sunday of May. Originally, flag was raised to the finial in the morning, displayed at half-mast from 10:00 to 14:00, and again raised to the finial for the rest of the day. In 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the tradition of flying the flag at half-mast was discontinued and flag is displayed at the finial in a usual manner.\n\n==France==\nThe [[French flag]] is flown half mast on any Day of Mourning by order of the government (for example after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' attack]] on 7 January 2015, the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris attacks]] on 13 November 2015, and the [[2016 Nice truck attack|Nice attack]] on 14 July 2016). Other countries have also flown the French flag at half mast because of this too. (Australia's Sydney Harbour Bridge flew the French flag at half mast because of the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015).\n\nSome occurrences of the French flag being flown half mast have been controversial, especially after the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/roland-garros/article/2005/04/04/drapeaux-en-berne-et-le-deuil-du-pape_635227_1616946.html|title=Drapeaux en berne et le deuil du pape|website=Le Monde.fr}}</ref> but also in a lesser measure at the time following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in March 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/12/06/01016-20131206ARTFIG00356-drapeaux-en-berne-un-honneur-rare-pour-une-personnalite-etrangere.php|title=Drapeaux en berne : un honneur rare pour une personnalit\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8re|date=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\n[[File:Land-bw-g.jpg|thumb|Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that cannot be lowered to halfmast]]\n\nThe [[flag of Germany]] and the flags of its federal states are flown at half-mast:\n*On 27 January, [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day|Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism]];\n*On National Day of Mourning (33rd Sunday of [[Ordinary Time]]).\n*On any day of mourning by order of the [[President of Germany|federal president]] for all of Germany, or by order of a [[Minister-President#Germany|minister president]] for a particular state. E.g. upon the death of a current or former ranking politician or person of high esteem, or multiple deaths in accidents or natural disasters.\n{{-}}\n\n==Greece==\nAccording to Law 851/1978, the only day specified on which the [[flag of Greece|Greek flag]] is flown at half-mast is [[Good Friday]]. Also, on other national and public mourning days.\n\n==Hong Kong==\n[[File:Flags at half-staff in GBS.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong SAR flag flown at half mast]]\n\nSimilar rules as in China apply for Hong Kong. See [[flag of Hong Kong#Half-mast|Flag of Hong Kong]] for details. Prior to the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] in 1997, the rules for flying the flag at half-mast were the same as the British ones.\n*The HKSAR flag was flown at half-mast on 24\u201326 August 2010, for the fatalities of the Hong Thai Travel tourists in the [[2010 Manila hostage crisis]].\n*The national flag of the PRC was also flown at half-mast on 26 August in Hong Kong.\n*The HKSAR flag was flown at half-mast on 4\u20136 October 2012, for the [[2012 Lamma Island ferry collision|Lamma Ferry Accident]] victims in which 39 people died.\n{{-}}\n\n==India==\nThe [[flag of India]] is flown at half-mast for the death of a [[President of India|President]], [[Vice President of India|Vice-President]], or [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], all over India. For the Speaker of the [[Lok Sabha]] and the Chief Justice of The [[Supreme Court of India]], it is flown in [[Delhi]] and for a [[Cabinet of India|Union Cabinet]] Minister it is flown in Delhi and the state capitals, from where he or she came. For a Minister of State, it is flown only in Delhi. For a Governor, Lt. Governor, or Chief Minister of a state or union territory, it is flown in the concerned state.\n\nIf the intimation of the death of any dignitary is received in the afternoon, the flag shall be flown at half-mast on the following day also at the place or places indicated above, provided the funeral has not taken place before sunrise on that day. On the day of the funeral of a dignitary mentioned above, the flag shall be flown at half-mast at the place of the funeral. For example, on 17 March 2019, The Government of India declared a National Day of mourning on 18 March 2019 due to the death of the Chief Minister of Goa, Manohar Parrekar on 17 March 2019. This means, that on 18 March 2019, the Indian National Flag must be at half-mast in the National Capital i.e. New Delhi and in the capital cities of all the 29 states and Union Territories.\n\nIn the event of a halfmast day coinciding with the [[Republic Day]], [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]], National Week (6 to 13 April), any other particular day of national rejoicing as may be specified by the [[Government of India]], or, in the case of a state, on the anniversary of formation of that state, flags are not permitted to be flown at half-mast except over the building where the body of the deceased is lying until it has been removed and that flag shall be raised to the full-mast position after the body has been removed.\n\nObservances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Home Ministry) in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag on the above-mentioned days. India observed a five-day period of National Mourning on the death of [[Nelson Mandela]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-day-state-mourning-in-India-as-a-mark-of-respect-to-Nelson-Mandela/articleshow/26957822.cms |work=The Times of India |title=5-day state mourning in India as a mark of respect to Nelson Mandela \u2013 The Times of India}}</ref> India also declared 29 March 2015 as a day of National Mourning as a mark of respect to the former Prime Minister of Singapore, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].\n\n==Iran==\nThe [[flag of Iran]] is flown at half-mast on the death of a national figure or mourning days.\n*On 21 January 2017 Iran's flag was flown at half-mast worldwide to respect the victims of the [[Plasco Building]] collapse;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13951102000001 |accessdate=21 January 2017 |title=Flag of Iran is flown half-mast}}</ref>\n*On 10 January 2017 Iran's flag was flown at half-mast worldwide to respect the death of the national figure and late Chairman of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]] Ayatollah [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] who died on 8 January 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82381769/ |accessdate=21 January 2017 |title=Flag of Iran is flown half-mast}}</ref>\n\n==Ireland==\nThe [[flag of Ireland]] is flown at half-mast on the death of a national or international figure, that is, former and current [[President of Ireland|Presidents]] or [[Taoiseach]], on all prominent government buildings equipped with a flag pole. The death of a prominent local figure can also be marked locally by the flag being flown at half-mast. When the national flag is flown at half-mast, no other flag should be half-masted. When a balcony in Berkeley, California, US collapsed, killing six Irish people, flags were flown at half mast above all state buildings.\n\n==Israel==\n[[File:Yom HaShoah Flags halfmast.jpg|thumb|Flags in Israel at half mast on the eve of [[Yom HaShoah]]]]\nThe [[flag of Israel]] is flown at half-mast in [[Israel]]:\n*On [[Yom HaShoah]], or the Holocaust Remembrance Day;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Jewish+Themes/Holidays/Holocaust+Remembrance+Day.htm |accessdate=23 October 2010 |title=Holidays \u2013 Holocaust Remembrance Day}}</ref>\n*On [[Yom Hazikaron]], or Fallen Soldiers and Victims of Terrorism Remembrance Day;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/MemorialDayLaw_eng.htm |title=Memorial Day Law for the Fallen of Israel's Wars (unofficial translation) |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>\n*On other national days of mourning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Italy==\nThe [[flag of Italy]] was flown at half-mast after the [[2013 Sardinia floods]] on 22 November 2013.\n\n==Indonesia==\nThe [[flag of Indonesia]] is flown half-mast for:\n#Three days following the death of the President/Vice President (in office or former) of Indonesia throughout the country and on official Indonesian installations abroad. \n#Two days following the death of the head of a state institution, minister or minister-level officials.

Each province can make its own determination of when to fly the flag at half-mast when provincial leaders or honoured citizens pass away.\n\nTo raise a flag in this position, the flag must be flown to the top of the pole first, then brought down halfway before the flag is secured for flying. When such mourning occurs, all flags should be flown at that position or not be flown at all, with the exception of flags permanently attached to poles.<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=31 March 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1901/01/23/archives/grief-in-canada-flags-at-half-mast-everywhere-and-amusement-places.html |title=Flags at Half Mast Everywhere and Amusement Places Closed. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=23 January 1901}}</ref>\n\nA controversy surfaced in April 2006, when the newly elected [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government discontinued the practice, initiated by the previous [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government following the [[Tarnak Farm incident]],<ref name=\"tarnak\">{{Cite news |accessdate=31 March 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/yourspace/flag_halfmast.html |title=Conservatives decide not to lower the Canadian flag to fly the flag at half-mast every time a Canadian soldier is killed |publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC]] |date=1 April 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120115035/http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/yourspace/flag_halfmast.html |archivedate=20 January 2011}}</ref> of flying the flag at half-mast on all government buildings whenever a Canadian soldier was killed in action in [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/24/flag060424.html |title=Peace Tower flag will not be lowered for military deaths |publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC]] |date=24 April 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606225332/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/24/flag060424.html |archivedate=6 June 2008}}</ref> The issue divided veterans' groups and military families, some of whom supported the return to the original tradition of using Remembrance Day to honour all soldiers killed in action, while others felt it was an appropriate way to honour the fallen and to remind the population of the costs of war.<ref name=\"tarnak\" /> In spite of the federal government's policy, local authorities have often decided to fly the flag at half-mast to honour fallen soldiers who were from their jurisdiction, including [[Toronto]] and [[Saskatchewan]].<ref>{{Cite news |accessdate=25 March 2008 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2006/08/08/flags-sask.html |title=Sask. flags at half-mast for fallen soldier |publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC]] |date=9 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508121537/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2006/08/08/flags-sask.html |archivedate=8 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2008, the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] voted in favour of a motion calling on the government to reinstate the former policy regarding the half-masting of the flag on federal buildings.

At the same time, a federal advisory committee tabled its report on the protocol of flying the national flag at half-mast, recommending that the Peace Tower flag remain at full height on days such as the Police Officers National Memorial Day and the National Day or Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, stating that the flag should only be half-masted on Remembrance Day.

For example, the flag was flown at half-mast after the deaths of [[Zhou Enlai]] (1976), [[Zhu De]] (1976), [[Mao Zedong]] (1976), [[Soong Ching-ling]] (1981), [[Hu Yaobang]] (1989), [[Li Xiannian]] (1992), [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1997),[[Yang Shangkun]] (1998), [[Qiao Shi]](2015), [[Wan Li]](2015) and [[Li Peng]](2019),as well as death of foreigners such as [[Joseph Stalin]](1953) , [[Patrice Lumumba]](1961) , [[Charles de Gaulle]](1970) and [[Norodom Sihanouk]](2012).\n*When major disasters happen, such as when the flag was flown at half-mast from 19 to 21 May 2008, the three national mourning days for the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]\uff0cas well as at 4 April 2020 ([[Qingming Festival]])\uff0cthe national mourning day for the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Finland==\n[[File:Half raised flag.jpg|thumb|The [[Flag of Finland|Finnish flag]] flying at half-mast after the [[2011 Norway attacks]].]]\nIn Finland, the official term for flying a flag at half-mast is known as ''suruliputus'' (''mourning by flag(ging)''). It is performed by raising the flag briefly to the top of the mast and lowering it approximately one-third of the length of the flagpole, placing the lower hoist corner at half-mast. On wall-mounted and roof-top flagpoles the middle of the flag should fly at the middle of the flagpole. When removing the flag from half-mast, it is briefly hoisted to the finial before lowering.\n\nTraditionally, private residences and apartment houses fly the national flag at half-mast on the day of the death of a resident, when the flag is displayed at half-mast until sunset or 21:00, whichever comes first. Flags are also flown at half-mast on the day of the burial, with the exception that the flag is to be hoisted to the finial after the inhumation takes place.\n\nFlags are also to be flown at half-mast on the days of national mourning. Such days are the deaths of former or current [[President of Finland|Finnish presidents]], as well as significant catastrophic events such as the aftermath of [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], [[2011 Norway attacks]] and significant national events such as the 2004 [[Konginkangas bus disaster]] and school shootings of [[Jokela school shooting|Jokela]] and [[Kauhajoki school shooting|Kauhajoki]].\n\nHistorically, flags were flown at half-mast on the [[Commemoration Day of Fallen Soldiers]] which takes place on the third Sunday of May. Originally, flag was raised to the finial in the morning, displayed at half-mast from 10:00 to 14:00, and again raised to the finial for the rest of the day. In 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the tradition of flying the flag at half-mast was discontinued and flag is displayed at the finial in a usual manner.\n\n==France==\nThe [[French flag]] is flown half mast on any Day of Mourning by order of the government (for example after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|''Charlie Hebdo'' attack]] on 7 January 2015, the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris attacks]] on 13 November 2015, and the [[2016 Nice truck attack|Nice attack]] on 14 July 2016). Other countries have also flown the French flag at half mast because of this too. (Australia's Sydney Harbour Bridge flew the French flag at half mast because of the Paris attacks on 13 November 2015).\n\nSome occurrences of the French flag being flown half mast have been controversial, especially after the death of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/roland-garros/article/2005/04/04/drapeaux-en-berne-et-le-deuil-du-pape_635227_1616946.html|title=Drapeaux en berne et le deuil du pape|website=Le Monde.fr}}</ref> but also in a lesser measure at the time following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in March 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2013/12/06/01016-20131206ARTFIG00356-drapeaux-en-berne-un-honneur-rare-pour-une-personnalite-etrangere.php|title=Drapeaux en berne : un honneur rare pour une personnalit\u00e9 \u00e9trang\u00e8re|date=6 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Germany==\n[[File:Land-bw-g.jpg|thumb|Black ribbons indicate mourning on banners that cannot be lowered to halfmast]]\n\nThe [[flag of Germany]] and the flags of its federal states are flown at half-mast:\n*On 27 January, [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day|Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism]];\n*On National Day of Mourning (33rd Sunday of [[Ordinary Time]]).\n*On any day of mourning by order of the [[President of Germany|federal president]] for all of Germany, or by order of a [[Minister-President#Germany|minister president]] for a particular state. E.g. upon the death of a current or former ranking politician or person of high esteem, or multiple deaths in accidents or natural disasters.\n{{-}}\n\n==Greece==\nAccording to Law 851/1978, the only day specified on which the [[flag of Greece|Greek flag]] is flown at half-mast is [[Good Friday]]. Also, on other national and public mourning days.\n\n==Hong Kong==\n[[File:Flags at half-staff in GBS.jpg|thumb|Hong Kong SAR flag flown at half mast]]\n\nSimilar rules as in China apply for Hong Kong. See [[flag of Hong Kong#Half-mast|Flag of Hong Kong]] for details. Prior to the [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] in 1997, the rules for flying the flag at half-mast were the same as the British ones.\n*The HKSAR flag was flown at half-mast on 24\u201326 August 2010, for the fatalities of the Hong Thai Travel tourists in the [[2010 Manila hostage crisis]].\n*The national flag of the PRC was also flown at half-mast on 26 August in Hong Kong.\n*The HKSAR flag was flown at half-mast on 4\u20136 October 2012, for the [[2012 Lamma Island ferry collision|Lamma Ferry Accident]] victims in which 39 people died.\n{{-}}\n\n==India==\nThe [[flag of India]] is flown at half-mast for the death of a [[President of India|President]], [[Vice President of India|Vice-President]], or [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], all over India. For the Speaker of the [[Lok Sabha]] and the Chief Justice of The [[Supreme Court of India]], it is flown in [[Delhi]] and for a [[Cabinet of India|Union Cabinet]] Minister it is flown in Delhi and the state capitals, from where he or she came. For a Minister of State, it is flown only in Delhi. For a Governor, Lt. Governor, or Chief Minister of a state or union territory, it is flown in the concerned state.\n\nIf the intimation of the death of any dignitary is received in the afternoon, the flag shall be flown at half-mast on the following day also at the place or places indicated above, provided the funeral has not taken place before sunrise on that day. On the day of the funeral of a dignitary mentioned above, the flag shall be flown at half-mast at the place of the funeral. For example, on 17 March 2019, The Government of India declared a National Day of mourning on 18 March 2019 due to the death of the Chief Minister of Goa, Manohar Parrekar on 17 March 2019. This means, that on 18 March 2019, the Indian National Flag must be at half-mast in the National Capital i.e. New Delhi and in the capital cities of all the 29 states and Union Territories.\n\nIn the event of a halfmast day coinciding with the [[Republic Day]], [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day]], National Week (6 to 13 April), any other particular day of national rejoicing as may be specified by the [[Government of India]], or, in the case of a state, on the anniversary of formation of that state, flags are not permitted to be flown at half-mast except over the building where the body of the deceased is lying until it has been removed and that flag shall be raised to the full-mast position after the body has been removed.\n\nObservances of State mourning on the death of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs (Home Ministry) in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that country may fly the national flag on the above-mentioned days. India observed a five-day period of National Mourning on the death of [[Nelson Mandela]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-day-state-mourning-in-India-as-a-mark-of-respect-to-Nelson-Mandela/articleshow/26957822.cms |work=The Times of India |title=5-day state mourning in India as a mark of respect to Nelson Mandela \u2013 The Times of India}}</ref> India also declared 29 March 2015 as a day of National Mourning as a mark of respect to the former Prime Minister of Singapore, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].\n\n==Iran==\nThe [[flag of Iran]] is flown at half-mast on the death of a national figure or mourning days.\n*On 21 January 2017 Iran's flag was flown at half-mast worldwide to respect the victims of the [[Plasco Building]] collapse;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13951102000001 |accessdate=21 January 2017 |title=Flag of Iran is flown half-mast}}</ref>\n*On 10 January 2017 Iran's flag was flown at half-mast worldwide to respect the death of the national figure and late Chairman of the [[Expediency Discernment Council]] Ayatollah [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] who died on 8 January 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82381769/ |accessdate=21 January 2017 |title=Flag of Iran is flown half-mast}}</ref>\n\n==Ireland==\nThe [[flag of Ireland]] is flown at half-mast on the death of a national or international figure, that is, former and current [[President of Ireland|Presidents]] or [[Taoiseach]], on all prominent government buildings equipped with a flag pole. The death of a prominent local figure can also be marked locally by the flag being flown at half-mast. When the national flag is flown at half-mast, no other flag should be half-masted. When a balcony in Berkeley, California, US collapsed, killing six Irish people, flags were flown at half mast above all state buildings.\n\n==Israel==\n[[File:Yom HaShoah Flags halfmast.jpg|thumb|Flags in Israel at half mast on the eve of [[Yom HaShoah]]]]\nThe [[flag of Israel]] is flown at half-mast in [[Israel]]:\n*On [[Yom HaShoah]], or the Holocaust Remembrance Day;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tourism.gov.il/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Jewish+Themes/Holidays/Holocaust+Remembrance+Day.htm |accessdate=23 October 2010 |title=Holidays \u2013 Holocaust Remembrance Day}}</ref>\n*On [[Yom Hazikaron]], or Fallen Soldiers and Victims of Terrorism Remembrance Day;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/laws/special/eng/MemorialDayLaw_eng.htm |title=Memorial Day Law for the Fallen of Israel's Wars (unofficial translation) |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref>\n*On other national days of mourning.\n{{-}}\n\n==Italy==\nThe [[flag of Italy]] was flown at half-mast after the [[2013 Sardinia floods]] on 22 November 2013.\n\n==Indonesia==\nThe [[flag of Indonesia]] is flown half-mast for:\n#Three days following the death of the President/Vice President (in office or former) of Indonesia throughout the country and on official Indonesian installations abroad. \n#Two days following the death of the head of a state institution, minister or minister-level officials.

The aircraft crashed after only forty-nine seconds after liftoff from the [[Dryden Regional Airport]] because it was not able to achieve enough altitude to clear the trees beyond the end of the runway due to ice and snow on the wings. This caused the death of 21 of 65 passengers and 3 of 4 crew members. Some of the survivors were able to escape from the plane on their own but the others were carried to safety. The accident happened because the APU (auxiliary power unit) did not work, so the crew had to keep one of the engines running at Dryden. However, the necessary [[De-ice|de-icing]] was only authorised if both the main engines are stopped. Air Ontario's policies forbid de-icing if one of the engines was running due to the possibility of the fumes being sucked into the air conditioning system and harming those in the cabin. Furthermore, if the pilots had shut down the engines, with no APU and with Dryden airport not having the equipment required to restart the engines, the plane would have been stranded. This situation was exacerbated by an extended wait on the taxiway while priority was given to an incoming Cessna. However, it is possible that de-icing would not have prevented this accident, as the type of fluid commonly used at the time was not intended for long wait times. Additionally, the de-icing process would be completed at the terminal, and not on the runway, reducing the time that the fluid would be effective after application.
