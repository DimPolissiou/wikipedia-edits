Nystagmus may be caused by [[congenital disorder]] or [[sleep deprivation]], acquired or [[central nervous system]] disorders, [[toxicity]], [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], or rotational movement. Previously considered untreatable, in recent years several drugs have been identified for treatment of nystagmus. Nystagmus is also occasionally associated with [[vertigo]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Causes==\nThe cause of pathological nystagmus may be [[congenital]], [[idiopathic]], or secondary to a pre-existing [[neurological disorder]]. It also may be induced temporarily by disorientation (such as on roller coaster rides) or by some [[psychoactive drug|drug]]s ([[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[lidocaine]], and other [[central nervous system]] depressants, inhalant drugs, [[stimulant]]s, [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]s, and [[dissociative]] drugs).\n\n===Early-onset nystagmus===\nEarly onset nystagmus occurs more frequently than acquired nystagmus. It can be insular or accompany other disorders (such as micro-ophthalmic anomalies or [[Down syndrome]]). Early-onset nystagmus itself is usually mild and non-progressive.

Nystagmus is not to be confused with other superficially similar-appearing disorders of eye movements ([[Saccade|saccadic]] oscillations) such as [[opsoclonus]] or [[ocular flutter]] that are composed purely of fast-phase (saccadic) eye movements, while nystagmus is characterized by the combination of a smooth pursuit, which usually acts to take the eye off the point of focus, interspersed with the saccadic movement that serves to bring the eye back on target.

Starting in the late 1990s, UConn men's basketball moved most of their important games&mdash;including the bulk of their [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] games&mdash;to the Coliseum.   During the 2011\u20132012 season, for instance, they played 11 home games at the Coliseum and only eight at their on-campus facility, [[Harry A. Gampel Pavilion|Gampel Pavilion]].  This practice continued when the Huskies joined the [[American Athletic Conference]], [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment|successor]] to the original Big East, in 2013. The [[Connecticut Huskies men's ice hockey|UConn men's hockey team]] uses the XL Center as its primary home as the newest men's member of [[Hockey East]].<!--UConn is still the newest men's member of Hockey East, but not the newest overall; that would be the Holy Cross women.-->\n\nIt was the home of the [[Hartford Whalers|New England/Hartford Whalers]] of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] from 1975 to 1978 and 1980 to 1997, and the [[Hartford Hellions]] of the [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978\u20131992)|MISL]] from 1980 to 1981, and the [[New England Blizzard]] of the [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)|ABL]] from 1996 to 1998, and hosted occasional [[Boston Celtics]] home games from 1975 to 1995.  It was the home of the [[Connecticut Coyotes]] and later the [[New England Sea Wolves]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]].\n\nThe arena seats 15,635 for [[ice hockey]] and 16,294 for [[basketball]], 16,606 for center-stage [[concerts]], 16,282 for end-stage concerts, and 8,239 for \u00be-end stage concerts, and contains 46 luxury suites and a 310-seat Coliseum Club, plus {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|-2}} of arena floor space, enabling it to be used for trade shows and conventions in addition to concerts, circuses, ice shows, sporting events and other events.  The [[Commencement at CCSU|graduation ceremonies of Central Connecticut State University]] and other local colleges are also held annually at the XL Center.\n\n===Early history and roof collapse===\n[[File:HartfordCivicCenterSoldOut.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The arena remains a site for popular concerts. October 2007.]]\nAs originally built in 1975, it seated 10,507 for hockey, and served as the home of the then&ndash;[[New England Whalers]] for three years. In the early morning of January 18, 1978, the weight of snow from the day's heavy snowstorm caused the Civic Center's roof to collapse. Engineering analyses during litigation following the collapse indicated that compression members were overloaded through undersizing and underestimation of the probable loadings, and that lateral bracing of individual members was insufficient. Investigations attributed the design issues to the unprecedented use of and trust in computer analysis. An absence of peer review for the novel structure and design process, and fragmentation of oversight responsibility during construction were also cited as contributing factors. Evidence showed that the roof had started to fail during construction, with bowed compression members. These distortions, and an unpredicted degree of deflection in the structure, were not investigated before the collapse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hartford Civic Center Arena Roof Collapse|first=Rachel|last=Martin|url=http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Hartford%20Civic%20Center/hartford.htm|publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham|accessdate=November 20, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108024915/http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Hartford%20Civic%20Center/hartford.htm|archivedate=January 8, 2008}}</ref> There were no injuries due to the collapse. The building was heavily renovated and re-opened January 17, 1980.\n\nThe Arena hosted the [[Hartford Whalers]] from January 11, 1980 to April 13, 1997. Shortly thereafter the team relocated to [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] to become the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]. In 1994, new owner [[Peter Karmanos]] purchased the team and pledged to keep the Whalers in Connecticut until 1998, unless they could not sell over 11,000 season tickets. After failed negotiations to build a new downtown arena for the Whalers with then-Governor [[John G. Rowland]], on March 25, 1997, Karmanos announced that the team would leave. The [[New York Rangers]], looking to capitalize on Hartford as a potential market, placed its farm team there to become the Hartford Wolf Pack starting in 1997. After a short stint as the [[Connecticut Whale (AHL)|Connecticut Whale]], they reverted to the Wolf Pack moniker in 2013. Renovations were complete in October 2014, which is set to serve the arena until its fiftieth birthday.\n\n===Current arena and recent renovations===\nIn September 2010, the arena was upgraded with a new center-hung scoreboard with four Sony Jumbotrons and a state-of-the-art sound system.<ref>{{cite news |title=XL Center Gets New Video Boards|first=Jeff|last=Jacobs|url=http://articles.courant.com/2010-10-05/sports/hc-xl-scoreboard-20101005_1_video-boards-video-screens-aeg|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>\nThe Connecticut State Legislature set aside $35 million in funding for improvements to the XL Center that began in early spring 2014 and completed in time for the start of the 2014-15 seasons of the Wolf Pack and UConn men's hockey in October. Improvements included upgrades to the mechanical system, locker rooms and concourse, replacing jumbotrons with a new [[high-definition video|HD video]] board, as well as aesthetic improvements such as a new bar area inside the arena and luxury seating in the lower bowl. A portion of the $35 million allocation went  towards a study on the arena's long-term viability; either more major renovations or replacing it with a new facility.\n\n==Events==\nThe XL Center has held many notable events including:\n[[File:Hartfordmj.jpg|thumb|200px|The Veterans Memorial Coliseum as set up for [[Monster Jam]].]]\n\n*The [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments|ECAC New England Region Tournament]], a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] men's [[college basketball]] tournament organized by the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC), took place at the Hartford Civic Center on March 3 and 5, [[ECAC Men's Basketball Tournaments#1977 Tournaments|1977]].

It is owned by the City of Hartford and operated by [[Comcast Spectacor#Global Spectrum|Spectra]].  In December 2007, the Center was renamed when the arena's naming rights were sold to [[XL Group]] insurance company in a 6-year agreement.  The arena is ranked the 28th largest among college basketball arenas.  Opened in 1974 as the Hartford Civic Center and originally located adjacent to [[Civic Center Mall]], which was demolished in 2004. It consists of two facilities: the Veterans Memorial Coliseum and the Exhibition Center.\n\nOn March 21, 2007, the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) selected the Northland/[[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] proposal.  It was revealed that Northland will assume total responsibility for the building paying for any and all losses, and will keep any profits.  In 2012, the CRDA, put the contract out to bid with hopes of combining the operations with [[Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field|Rentschler Field]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Secrecy On XL Center, Rentschler Plans Isn't Helping Matters|first=Jeff|last=Jacobs|url=http://articles.courant.com/2013-02-03/sports/hc-jacobs-column-0204-20130203_1_crda-board-capital-region-development-authority-bids|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=February 3, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> In February 2013, [[Comcast Spectacor#Global Spectrum|Global Spectrum]] of Philadelphia, was chosen to take over both the XL Center and Rentschler Field<ref>{{cite news |title=Philadelphia Group Picked To Run XL Center, Rentschler Field|first=Kenneth R.|last=Gosselin|url=http://articles.courant.com/2013-02-07/business/hc-xl-center-rentschler-decision-20130207_1_capital-improvements-aeg-management-ct-bushnell-management-services|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref> with Ovations Food Services taking over all food and beverage operations.\n\n==Hartford Civic Center==\nThe Civic Center is the full-time home of the [[Hartford Wolf Pack]] AHL hockey team and part-time home of the [[University of Connecticut]] (UConn) men's and women's basketball teams and the [[UConn Huskies men's ice hockey]] team.  Starting in the late 1990s, UConn men's basketball moved most of their important games&mdash;including the bulk of their [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] games&mdash;to the Coliseum.   During the 2011\u20132012 season, for instance, they played 11 home games at the Coliseum and only eight at their on-campus facility, [[Harry A. Gampel Pavilion|Gampel Pavilion]].  This practice continued when the Huskies joined the [[American Athletic Conference]], [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment|successor]] to the original Big East, in 2013. The [[Connecticut Huskies men's ice hockey|UConn men's hockey team]] uses the XL Center as its primary home as the newest men's member of [[Hockey East]].<!--UConn is still the newest men's member of Hockey East, but not the newest overall; that would be the Holy Cross women.-->\n\nIt was the home of the [[Hartford Whalers|New England/Hartford Whalers]] of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] from 1975 to 1978 and 1980 to 1997, and the [[Hartford Hellions]] of the [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978\u20131992)|MISL]] from 1980 to 1981, and the [[New England Blizzard]] of the [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)|ABL]] from 1996 to 1998, and hosted occasional [[Boston Celtics]] home games from 1975 to 1995.  It was the home of the [[Connecticut Coyotes]] and later the [[New England Sea Wolves]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]].\n\nThe arena seats 15,635 for [[ice hockey]] and 16,294 for [[basketball]], 16,606 for center-stage [[concerts]], 16,282 for end-stage concerts, and 8,239 for \u00be-end stage concerts, and contains 46 luxury suites and a 310-seat Coliseum Club, plus {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|-2}} of arena floor space, enabling it to be used for trade shows and conventions in addition to concerts, circuses, ice shows, sporting events and other events.  The [[Commencement at CCSU|graduation ceremonies of Central Connecticut State University]] and other local colleges are also held annually at the XL Center.\n\n===Early history and roof collapse===\n[[File:HartfordCivicCenterSoldOut.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The arena remains a site for popular concerts. October 2007.]]\nAs originally built in 1975, it seated 10,507 for hockey, and served as the home of the then&ndash;[[New England Whalers]] for three years. In the early morning of January 18, 1978, the weight of snow from the day's heavy snowstorm caused the Civic Center's roof to collapse. Engineering analyses during litigation following the collapse indicated that compression members were overloaded through undersizing and underestimation of the probable loadings, and that lateral bracing of individual members was insufficient. Investigations attributed the design issues to the unprecedented use of and trust in computer analysis. An absence of peer review for the novel structure and design process, and fragmentation of oversight responsibility during construction were also cited as contributing factors. Evidence showed that the roof had started to fail during construction, with bowed compression members. These distortions, and an unpredicted degree of deflection in the structure, were not investigated before the collapse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hartford Civic Center Arena Roof Collapse|first=Rachel|last=Martin|url=http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Hartford%20Civic%20Center/hartford.htm|publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham|accessdate=November 20, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108024915/http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Hartford%20Civic%20Center/hartford.htm|archivedate=January 8, 2008}}</ref> There were no injuries due to the collapse. The building was heavily renovated and re-opened January 17, 1980.\n\nThe Arena hosted the [[Hartford Whalers]] from January 11, 1980 to April 13, 1997. Shortly thereafter the team relocated to [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] to become the [[Carolina Hurricanes]]. In 1994, new owner [[Peter Karmanos]] purchased the team and pledged to keep the Whalers in Connecticut until 1998, unless they could not sell over 11,000 season tickets. After failed negotiations to build a new downtown arena for the Whalers with then-Governor [[John G. Rowland]], on March 25, 1997, Karmanos announced that the team would leave. The [[New York Rangers]], looking to capitalize on Hartford as a potential market, placed its farm team there to become the Hartford Wolf Pack starting in 1997. After a short stint as the [[Connecticut Whale (AHL)|Connecticut Whale]], they reverted to the Wolf Pack moniker in 2013. Renovations were complete in October 2014, which is set to serve the arena until its fiftieth birthday.\n\n===Current arena and recent renovations===\nIn September 2010, the arena was upgraded with a new center-hung scoreboard with four Sony Jumbotrons and a state-of-the-art sound system.<ref>{{cite news |title=XL Center Gets New Video Boards|first=Jeff|last=Jacobs|url=http://articles.courant.com/2010-10-05/sports/hc-xl-scoreboard-20101005_1_video-boards-video-screens-aeg|newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]]|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>\nThe Connecticut State Legislature set aside $35 million in funding for improvements to the XL Center that began in early spring 2014 and completed in time for the start of the 2014-15 seasons of the Wolf Pack and UConn men's hockey in October. Improvements included upgrades to the mechanical system, locker rooms and concourse, replacing jumbotrons with a new [[high-definition video|HD video]] board, as well as aesthetic improvements such as a new bar area inside the arena and luxury seating in the lower bowl.

In October 2006, he won the 85th [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]].\n\nHe began as an apprentice for the trainer [[Robert Collet]], and rode in his first race on 6 December 1994, on Raspoutine at [[Hippodrome de Saint-Cloud|Saint-Cloud Racecourse]]. His first victory was in his second race, riding Floris at [[Amiens]] racecourse on 9 September 1995.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Pasquier is a turbulent and strong character, and confesses to have lost his way in 1997, needing guidance from [[Robert Collet]] to help him back. Pasquier won his first Listed Race in 1999, then his first Group 3 race in May 2001, riding Acceleration in the [[Prix Corrida]].\n\nDuring the winter of 2001\u20132002, he rode in [[Singapore]] and on returning to France won his first Group 2 race, the [[Prix Greffulhe]]. His first ride in the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] followed in October 2002, finishing 8th on Fair Mix.\n\nAfter continued successes in Group races throughout 2003, in July 2004, his talent allowed him to join the prestigious [[Daniel Wildenstein]] stable as second jockey alongside the number one, [[Olivier Peslier]].\n\nOn 24 October 2004 he won the [[Prix Royal-Oak]], his first Group 1 race, with [[Westerner (horse)|Westerner]]. Several weeks later, he finished 4th in the [[Japan Cup]] aboard [[Policy Maker]].\n\nIn 2005, he won two Group 2 races (the [[Prix Maurice de Nieuil]] with Ostankino and the [[Grand Prix de Deauville]] with Marend), and finished 3rd in the [[Grosser Preis von Baden]], a Group 1, with [[Westerner (horse)|Westerner]].\n\nIn early 2006, everything was fine for St\u00e9phane Pasquier, winning a lot of races. But in the summer, he had a bizarre accident whilst watching the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] final, breaking a glass in his hands when [[David Trezeguet]]'s penalty shot hit the crossbar. The injury was expected to keep him out of racing for two months, but his strong character helped him to come back sooner. In late August, he resumed racing, and soon started winning again.

In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the [[defensive spectrum]]. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer.\n\nTraditionally, the pitcher also bats. Starting in 1973 with the [[American League]] and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of [[designated hitter]], a cause of some controversy. The [[National League]] in [[Major League Baseball]] and the Japanese [[Central League]] are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Hiroshima toyo carp 2010 number 18.ogv|thumb|320px|(video) [[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]] number 18, [[Kenta Maeda]], pitching a ball.]]\nIn most cases, the objective of the pitcher is to deliver the [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] to the catcher without allowing the [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] to [[hit (baseball)|hit]] the ball with the bat. A successful pitch is delivered in such a way that the batter either allows the pitch to pass through the [[strike zone]], swings the bat at the ball and misses it, or hits the ball poorly (resulting in a pop fly or ground out). If the batter elects not to swing at the pitch, it is called a ''strike'' if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone and a ''ball'' when no part of the ball passes through the strike zone.  A check swing is when the batter begins to swing, but then stops the swing short. If the batter successfully checks the swing and the pitch is out of the strike zone, it is called a ball.\n\nThere are two legal [[pitching position]]s, the ''windup'' and the set position or ''stretch''. Either position may be used at any time; typically, the windup is used when the bases are empty, while the set position is used when at least one runner is on base. Each position has certain procedures that must be followed.  A balk can be called on a pitcher from either position.  A [[power pitcher]] is one who relies on the velocity of his pitches to succeed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/velocity+|accessdate=August 10, 2007|title=Velocity|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|year=2007}}</ref>  Generally, power pitchers record a high percentage of [[strikeouts]].  A [[control pitcher]] succeeds by throwing accurate pitches and thus records few walks.\n\n[[Image:Baseball P.svg|thumb|left|The position of the pitcher]]\n\nNearly all action during a game is centered on the pitcher for the defensive team. A pitcher's particular style, time taken between pitches, and skill heavily influence the dynamics of the game and can often determine the victor. Starting with the pivot foot on the ''pitcher's rubber'' at the center of the pitcher's mound, which is {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} from ''home plate'', the pitcher throws the baseball to the [[catcher]], who is positioned behind home plate and catches the ball. Meanwhile, a [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] stands in the [[batter's box]] at one side of the plate, and attempts to bat the ball [[Hit (baseball)|safely]] into fair play.\n\nThe type and sequence of pitches chosen depend upon the particular situation in a game. Because pitchers and catchers must coordinate each pitch, a system of hand signals is used by the catcher to communicate choices to the pitcher, who either vetoes or accepts by shaking his head or nodding. The relationship between pitcher and catcher is so important that some teams select the starting catcher for a particular game based on the starting pitcher. Together, the pitcher and catcher are known as the ''[[battery (baseball)|battery]]''.\n\nAlthough the object and mechanics of pitching remain the same, pitchers may be classified according to their roles and effectiveness. The [[starting pitcher]] begins the game, and he may be followed by various [[relief pitcher]]s, such as the [[long reliever]], the [[left-handed specialist]], the [[middle relief pitcher|middle reliever]], the [[setup pitcher|setup man]], and/or the [[closer (baseball)|closer]].\n\nIn [[Major League Baseball]], every team uses [[Baseball Rubbing Mud]] to rub game balls in before their pitchers use them in games.<ref name=florida>{{cite web |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070406/sps_3737799.shtml |title=All-American mud needed to take shine off baseballs |work=The Florida Times-Union |date=July 4, 2006 |author=Schneider, Jason }}</ref>\n\n==Pitching in a game==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}} \n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n| [[Image:Baseball pitch release.jpg|thumb|180px|none|A [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] pitcher releases the baseball from the pitcher's mound]]\n| [[Image:Baseball pitch delivery.jpg|thumb|173px|none|Delivery of the baseball from the pitcher to catcher]]\n|}\n\nA skilled pitcher often throws a variety of different pitches to prevent the batter from hitting the ball well. The most basic pitch is a [[fastball]], where the pitcher throws the ball as hard as he can. Some pitchers are able to throw a fastball at a [[speed]] over {{convert|100|mph|km/h ft/s}}, ex., [[Aroldis Chapman]]. Other common types of pitches are the [[curveball]], [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], [[changeup]], [[cutter (baseball)|cutter]], [[sinker (baseball)|sinker]], [[screwball]], [[forkball]], [[split-fingered fastball]], [[slurve]], and [[knuckleball]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pitch Types |url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/pitch-types |website=mlb.com |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |accessdate=17 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref> These generally are intended to have unusual movement or to deceive the batter as to the rotation or velocity of the ball, making it more difficult to hit. Very few pitchers throw all of these pitches, but most use a subset or blend of the basic types. Some pitchers also release pitches from different arm angles, making it harder for the batter to pick up the flight of the ball. (See [[List of baseball pitches]].) A pitcher who is throwing well on a particular day is said to have brought his \"good stuff.\"\n\nThere are a number of distinct throwing styles used by pitchers. The most common style is a three-quarters delivery in which the pitcher's arm snaps downward with the release of the ball. Some pitchers use a sidearm delivery in which the arm arcs laterally to the torso. Some pitchers use a [[Submarine (baseball)|submarine]] style in which the pitcher's body tilts sharply downward on delivery, creating an exaggerated sidearm motion in which the pitcher's knuckles come very close to the mound.\n\nEffective pitching is vitally important in baseball. In [[baseball statistics]], for each game, one pitcher will be credited with [[win (baseball statistics)|winning]] the game, and one pitcher will be charged with losing it. This is not necessarily the starting pitchers for each team, however, as a reliever can get a win and the starter would then get a no-decision.\n\n==Rotation and specialization==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}} \nPitching is physically demanding, especially if the pitcher is throwing with maximum effort. A full game usually involves 120\u2013170 pitches thrown by each team, and most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. As a result, the pitcher who starts a game often will not be the one who finishes it, and he may not be recovered enough to pitch again for a few days. The act of throwing a baseball at high speed is very unnatural to the body and somewhat damaging to human muscles; thus pitchers are very susceptible to injuries, soreness, and general pain.\n\n[[Image:20070616 Chris Young visits Wrigley (4)-edit3.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Chris Young (pitcher)|Chris Young]] throws a [[four-seam fastball]] in the [[bullpen]] pregame.]]\n\nTeams have devised two strategies to address this problem: rotation and specialization. To accommodate playing nearly every day, a team will include a group of pitchers who start games and rotate between them, allowing each pitcher to rest for a few days between starts. A team's roster of starting pitchers are usually not even in terms of skill. Exceptional pitchers are highly sought after and in the professional ranks draw large salaries, thus teams can seldom stock each slot in the rotation with top-quality pitchers.\n\nThe best starter in the team's rotation is called the [[Ace (baseball)|ace]]. He is usually followed in the rotation by 3 or 4 other starters before he would be due to pitch again. Barring injury or exceptional circumstances, the ace is usually the pitcher that starts on Opening Day. Aces are also preferred to start crucial games late in the season and in the playoffs; sometimes they are asked to pitch on shorter rest if the team feels he would be more effective than the 4th or 5th starter. Typically, the further down in the rotation a starting pitcher is, the weaker he is compared with the others on the staff. The \"5th starter\" is seen as the cut-off between the starting staff and the ''[[bullpen]]''. A team may have a designated 5th starter, sometimes known as a [[spot starter]] or that role may shift cycle to cycle between members of the bullpen or [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] starters. Differences in rotation setup could also have tactical considerations as well, such as alternating right- or left-handed pitchers, in order to throw off the other team's hitting game-to-game in a series.\n\nTeams have additional pitchers reserved to replace that game's starting pitcher if he tires or proves ineffective. These players are called ''[[relief pitcher]]s'', ''relievers'', or collectively the ''bullpen''. Once a starter begins to tire or is starting to give up hits and runs a call is made to the bullpen to have a reliever start to warm up. This involves the reliever starting to throw practice balls to a coach in the bullpen so as to be ready to come in and pitch whenever the manager wishes to pull the current pitcher. Having a reliever warm up does not always mean he will be used; the current pitcher may regain his composure and retire the side, or the manager may choose to go with another reliever if strategy dictates. Commonly, pitching changes will occur as a result of a [[pinch hitter]] being used in the late innings of a game, especially if the pitcher is in the batting lineup due to not having the designated hitter. A reliever would then come out of the bullpen to pitch the next inning.\n\nWhen making a pitching change a manager will come out to the mound. He will then call in a pitcher by the tap of the arm which the next pitcher throws with. The manager or pitching coach may also come out to discuss strategy with the pitcher, but on his second trip to the mound with the same pitcher in the same inning, the pitcher has to come out. The relief pitchers often have even more specialized roles, and the particular reliever used depends on the situation. Many teams designate one pitcher as the ''[[closer (baseball)|closer]]'', a relief pitcher specifically reserved to pitch the final inning or innings of a game when his team has a narrow lead, in order to preserve the victory. More recently, teams began experimenting with an ''[[opener (baseball)|opener]]'', a relief pitcher who starts a game but only pitches at least the first inning. Other relief roles include [[set-up pitcher|set-up men]], [[middle relief pitcher|middle relievers]], [[left-handed specialist]]s, and [[long reliever]]s. Generally, relievers pitch fewer innings and throw fewer pitches than starters, but they can usually pitch more frequently without the need for several days of rest between appearances. Relief pitchers are typically guys with \"special stuff\". Meaning that they have really effective pitches or a very different style of delivery. This makes the batter see a very different way of pitching in attempt to get them out. One example is a sidearm or submarine pitcher.\n[[File:Baseball pitcher by thrashbandicoot01 dd8zz5g.jpg|thumb|A pitcher for the [[DeLand Suns]] prepares to throw a pitch against the Lakeland Lightning. June 8, 2019. ]]\n[[Position player]]s are eligible to pitch in a game as well, this however is rare as these players are not truly trained as pitchers and risk injury. (For instance, in a 1993 game, [[Jose Canseco]] suffered a season ending arm injury after pitching 2 innings.) Plus, they tend to throw with less velocity. For these reasons, managers will typically only use a position player as a pitcher in a blowout loss, or if they have run out of available pitchers in order to avoid a forfeit (the latter typically only happens in extra-inning games). [[Cliff Pennington (baseball)|Cliff Pennington]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], who pitched 1/3 of an inning in game 4 of the [[2015 American League Championship Series]] en route to a 14\u20132 loss, was the only documented position player to pitch during the [[postseason]], until [[Austin Romine]] of the [[New York Yankees]] pitched the ninth inning of Game 3 in a 16\u20131 loss against the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the [[2018 American League Division Series]]. The only regulation game in which ''both'' pitchers of record were position players occurred on May 6, 2012, when the Baltimore Orioles' designated hitter Chris Davis was the winner in a 16-inning game against Boston while Red Sox outfielder Darnell McDonald took the loss.\n\n==After the ball is pitched==\nThe pitcher's duty does not cease after he pitches the ball. Unlike the other fielders, a pitcher and catcher must start every play in a designated area. The pitcher must be on the [[pitcher's mound]], with one foot in contact with the [[pitcher's rubber]], and the catcher must be behind [[home plate]] in the [[catcher's box]]. Once the ball is in play, however, the pitcher and catcher, like the other fielders, can respond to any part of the field necessary to make or assist in a defensive play.<ref>Baseball Explained, by Phillip Mahony.

The pitcher must attempt to field any balls coming up the middle, and in fact a [[Gold Glove Award]] is reserved for the pitcher with the best fielding ability. He must head over to [[first base]], to be available to cover it, on balls hit to the right side, since the first baseman might be fielding them too far to the baseman's right to reach first base before the batter-runner can. Except for the first baseman, the pitcher ordinarily has the shortest run to first base of anyone other than the first baseman, and is the second-most-likely person to make a putout at first base by retrieving a fielded ball thrown by an infielder (typically a first baseman). On [[passed ball]]s and [[wild pitch]]es, he covers home-plate when there are runners on. Also, he generally backs up throws to home plate. When there is a throw from the outfield to third base, he has to back up the play to third base as well.\n\n==Pitching biomechanics==\nThe physical act of overhand pitching is complex and unnatural to the human anatomy. Most major league pitchers throw at speeds between 70 and 100 mph, with fastballs, the most common pitch, generally ranging from 86-102mph, putting high amounts of stress on the pitching arm. Pitchers are by far the most frequently injured players and many professional pitchers will have multiple surgeries to repair damage in the elbow and shoulder by the end of their careers.\n\nAs such, the [[biomechanics]] of pitching are closely studied and taught by coaches at all levels and are an important field in [[sports medicine]]. Glenn Fleisig, a biomechanist who specializes in the analysis of baseball movements, says that pitching is \"the most violent human motion ever measured.\"<ref name=\"Dean, J. 2010\">{{cite journal |last=Dean |first=J. |date=October 2010 |title=Perfect Pitch |journal=WIRED |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=62 }}</ref>  He claims that the pelvis can rotate at 515\u2013667\u00b0/sec, the trunk can rotate at 1,068\u20131,224\u00b0/s, the elbow can reach a maximal angular velocity of 2,200\u20132,700\u00b0/s and the force pulling the pitcher's throwing arm away from the shoulder at ball release is approximately {{convert|280|lbf|lk=on}}.<ref name=\"Dean, J. 2010\"/>\n\n\n\nThe [[overhead throwing motion]] can be divided into phases which include windup, early cocking, late cocking, early acceleration, late acceleration, deceleration, and follow-through.<ref>{{Citation |last=Benjamin |first=Holly J. |last2=Briner |first2=William W., Jr. |year=2005 |title=Little League Elbow |journal=[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201340 |doi=10.1097/00042752-200501000-00008|pmid=15654190 }}</ref> Training for pitchers often includes targeting one or several of these phases.

Jobes can be done using either resistance bands or lightweight dumbbells.  Common jobe exercises include shoulder external rotation, shoulder flexion, horizontal abduction, prone abduction and scaption (at 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and inverse 45\u00b0).\n\nIn addition to the Jobes exercises, many pitching coaches are creating lifting routines that are specialized for pitchers. Pitchers should avoid exercises that deal with a barbell. The emphasis on the workout should be on the legs and the core. Other body parts should be worked on but using lighter weights. Over lifting muscles, especially while throwing usually ends up in a strain muscle or possible a tear.\n\n==Equipment==\n\nOther than the catcher, pitchers and other fielders wear very few pieces of equipment. In general the ball cap, [[baseball glove]] and cleats are equipment used. Pitchers may also keep with them at the mound a bag of powdered rosin. Handling the bag applies a small layer of the rosin to the pitcher's fingers in order to increase his grip on the ball. \n\nCurrently there is a new trend of introducing a pitcher helmet to provide head protection from batters hitting [[line drive]]s back to the pitcher. {{As of|2014|1}}, MLB approved a protective pitchers cap which can be worn by any pitcher if they choose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/10363291/pitchers-protective-caps-approved-major-league-baseball |title=Pitchers' protective caps approved |date=January 28, 2014 |work=ESPN.com }}</ref> San Diego Padres relief pitcher, [[Alex Torres (baseball)|Alex Torres]] was the first player in MLB to wear the protective cap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchershelmet.com/who-was-the-first-pitcher-to-wear-protective-headgear/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304114557/http://www.pitchershelmet.com/who-was-the-first-pitcher-to-wear-protective-headgear/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2015 |title=Who was the first pitcher to wear protective headgear |date=July 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOne style of helmet is worn on top of the ballcap to provide protection to the forehead and sides.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/07/idUS180810+07-Mar-2011+BW20110307 |title=New Pitching Helmet Prototype Unveiled by Easton-Bell Sports |agency=Reuters |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407101016/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/07/idUS180810+07-Mar-2011+BW20110307 |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn [[softball]], a full face helmet is available to all players including pitchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastpitch-softball-coaching.com/softball-helmet.html |title=Softball Helmet: Selection and prices for the popular models |publisher=Fastpitch-softball-coaching.com |date=March 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> These fielder's masks are becoming increasingly popular in younger fast pitch leagues, some leagues even requiring them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n{{commons category|Pitchers (baseball)}}\n* [[Pitching machine]]\n* [[List of baseball pitches]]\n* [[Baseball fielding positions]]\n* [[Cy Young Award]] winners\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders]]\n* [[Bowler (cricket)|Bowler]] \u2013 similar position in [[cricket]]\n* [[American Sports Medicine Institute]] \u2013 Pitching Biomechanics Evaluation\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web|first1=Chris|last1=Ballard|first2=Owen|last2=Good|title=The Invisible Fastball: Six decades ago a minor league pitcher accomplished something we'll never see again|date=October 17, 2011|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1191155/1/index.htm|accessdate=October 19, 2011|quote=When [Kelly] Jack Swift arrived in Elkin, N.C., in late 1951, he was nobody's idea of a prospect.}}\n\n{{Baseball positions}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball pitching]]\n[[Category:Baseball positions]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the player in baseball|the container|pitcher (container)|other uses|pitcher (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2014}}\n[[Image: Noah Syndergaard (20697486276).jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Noah Syndergaard]] pitching for the [[New York Mets]]]]\n\nIn [[baseball]], the '''pitcher''' is the player who throws the [[Baseball (ball)|baseball]] from the [[pitcher's mound]] toward the [[catcher]] to begin each play, with the goal of [[out (baseball)|retiring]] a [[batter (baseball)|batter]], who attempts to either make contact with the [[pitch (baseball)|pitched]] ball or draw a [[base on balls|walk]]. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, and as such is situated at the right end of the [[defensive spectrum]]. There are many different types of pitchers, such as the starting pitcher, relief pitcher, middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and the closer.\n\nTraditionally, the pitcher also bats. Starting in 1973 with the [[American League]] and spreading to further leagues throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the hitting duties of the pitcher have generally been given over to the position of [[designated hitter]], a cause of some controversy. The [[National League]] in [[Major League Baseball]] and the Japanese [[Central League]] are among the remaining leagues that have not adopted the designated hitter position.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Hiroshima toyo carp 2010 number 18.ogv|thumb|320px|(video) [[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]] number 18, [[Kenta Maeda]], pitching a ball.]]\nIn most cases, the objective of the pitcher is to deliver the [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] to the catcher without allowing the [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] to [[hit (baseball)|hit]] the ball with the bat. A successful pitch is delivered in such a way that the batter either allows the pitch to pass through the [[strike zone]], swings the bat at the ball and misses it, or hits the ball poorly (resulting in a pop fly or ground out). If the batter elects not to swing at the pitch, it is called a ''strike'' if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone and a ''ball'' when no part of the ball passes through the strike zone.  A check swing is when the batter begins to swing, but then stops the swing short. If the batter successfully checks the swing and the pitch is out of the strike zone, it is called a ball.\n\nThere are two legal [[pitching position]]s, the ''windup'' and the set position or ''stretch''. Either position may be used at any time; typically, the windup is used when the bases are empty, while the set position is used when at least one runner is on base. Each position has certain procedures that must be followed.  A balk can be called on a pitcher from either position.  A [[power pitcher]] is one who relies on the velocity of his pitches to succeed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/velocity+|accessdate=August 10, 2007|title=Velocity|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|year=2007}}</ref>  Generally, power pitchers record a high percentage of [[strikeouts]].  A [[control pitcher]] succeeds by throwing accurate pitches and thus records few walks.\n\n[[Image:Baseball P.svg|thumb|left|The position of the pitcher]]\n\nNearly all action during a game is centered on the pitcher for the defensive team. A pitcher's particular style, time taken between pitches, and skill heavily influence the dynamics of the game and can often determine the victor. Starting with the pivot foot on the ''pitcher's rubber'' at the center of the pitcher's mound, which is {{convert|60|ft|6|in|m}} from ''home plate'', the pitcher throws the baseball to the [[catcher]], who is positioned behind home plate and catches the ball. Meanwhile, a [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] stands in the [[batter's box]] at one side of the plate, and attempts to bat the ball [[Hit (baseball)|safely]] into fair play.\n\nThe type and sequence of pitches chosen depend upon the particular situation in a game. Because pitchers and catchers must coordinate each pitch, a system of hand signals is used by the catcher to communicate choices to the pitcher, who either vetoes or accepts by shaking his head or nodding. The relationship between pitcher and catcher is so important that some teams select the starting catcher for a particular game based on the starting pitcher. Together, the pitcher and catcher are known as the ''[[battery (baseball)|battery]]''.\n\nAlthough the object and mechanics of pitching remain the same, pitchers may be classified according to their roles and effectiveness. The [[starting pitcher]] begins the game, and he may be followed by various [[relief pitcher]]s, such as the [[long reliever]], the [[left-handed specialist]], the [[middle relief pitcher|middle reliever]], the [[setup pitcher|setup man]], and/or the [[closer (baseball)|closer]].\n\nIn [[Major League Baseball]], every team uses [[Baseball Rubbing Mud]] to rub game balls in before their pitchers use them in games.<ref name=florida>{{cite web |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/070406/sps_3737799.shtml |title=All-American mud needed to take shine off baseballs |work=The Florida Times-Union |date=July 4, 2006 |author=Schneider, Jason }}</ref>\n\n==Pitching in a game==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}} \n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n| [[Image:Baseball pitch release.jpg|thumb|180px|none|A [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] pitcher releases the baseball from the pitcher's mound]]\n| [[Image:Baseball pitch delivery.jpg|thumb|173px|none|Delivery of the baseball from the pitcher to catcher]]\n|}\n\nA skilled pitcher often throws a variety of different pitches to prevent the batter from hitting the ball well. The most basic pitch is a [[fastball]], where the pitcher throws the ball as hard as he can. Some pitchers are able to throw a fastball at a [[speed]] over {{convert|100|mph|km/h ft/s}}, ex., [[Aroldis Chapman]]. Other common types of pitches are the [[curveball]], [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], [[changeup]], [[cutter (baseball)|cutter]], [[sinker (baseball)|sinker]], [[screwball]], [[forkball]], [[split-fingered fastball]], [[slurve]], and [[knuckleball]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pitch Types |url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/pitch-types |website=mlb.com |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |accessdate=17 May 2019 |language=English}}</ref> These generally are intended to have unusual movement or to deceive the batter as to the rotation or velocity of the ball, making it more difficult to hit. Very few pitchers throw all of these pitches, but most use a subset or blend of the basic types. Some pitchers also release pitches from different arm angles, making it harder for the batter to pick up the flight of the ball. (See [[List of baseball pitches]].) A pitcher who is throwing well on a particular day is said to have brought his \"good stuff.\"\n\nThere are a number of distinct throwing styles used by pitchers. The most common style is a three-quarters delivery in which the pitcher's arm snaps downward with the release of the ball. Some pitchers use a sidearm delivery in which the arm arcs laterally to the torso. Some pitchers use a [[Submarine (baseball)|submarine]] style in which the pitcher's body tilts sharply downward on delivery, creating an exaggerated sidearm motion in which the pitcher's knuckles come very close to the mound.\n\nEffective pitching is vitally important in baseball. In [[baseball statistics]], for each game, one pitcher will be credited with [[win (baseball statistics)|winning]] the game, and one pitcher will be charged with losing it. This is not necessarily the starting pitchers for each team, however, as a reliever can get a win and the starter would then get a no-decision.\n\n==Rotation and specialization==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}} \nPitching is physically demanding, especially if the pitcher is throwing with maximum effort. A full game usually involves 120\u2013170 pitches thrown by each team, and most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. As a result, the pitcher who starts a game often will not be the one who finishes it, and he may not be recovered enough to pitch again for a few days. The act of throwing a baseball at high speed is very unnatural to the body and somewhat damaging to human muscles; thus pitchers are very susceptible to injuries, soreness, and general pain.\n\n[[Image:20070616 Chris Young visits Wrigley (4)-edit3.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Chris Young (pitcher)|Chris Young]] throws a [[four-seam fastball]] in the [[bullpen]] pregame.]]\n\nTeams have devised two strategies to address this problem: rotation and specialization. To accommodate playing nearly every day, a team will include a group of pitchers who start games and rotate between them, allowing each pitcher to rest for a few days between starts. A team's roster of starting pitchers are usually not even in terms of skill. Exceptional pitchers are highly sought after and in the professional ranks draw large salaries, thus teams can seldom stock each slot in the rotation with top-quality pitchers.\n\nThe best starter in the team's rotation is called the [[Ace (baseball)|ace]]. He is usually followed in the rotation by 3 or 4 other starters before he would be due to pitch again. Barring injury or exceptional circumstances, the ace is usually the pitcher that starts on Opening Day. Aces are also preferred to start crucial games late in the season and in the playoffs; sometimes they are asked to pitch on shorter rest if the team feels he would be more effective than the 4th or 5th starter. Typically, the further down in the rotation a starting pitcher is, the weaker he is compared with the others on the staff. The \"5th starter\" is seen as the cut-off between the starting staff and the ''[[bullpen]]''. A team may have a designated 5th starter, sometimes known as a [[spot starter]] or that role may shift cycle to cycle between members of the bullpen or [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] starters. Differences in rotation setup could also have tactical considerations as well, such as alternating right- or left-handed pitchers, in order to throw off the other team's hitting game-to-game in a series.\n\nTeams have additional pitchers reserved to replace that game's starting pitcher if he tires or proves ineffective. These players are called ''[[relief pitcher]]s'', ''relievers'', or collectively the ''bullpen''. Once a starter begins to tire or is starting to give up hits and runs a call is made to the bullpen to have a reliever start to warm up. This involves the reliever starting to throw practice balls to a coach in the bullpen so as to be ready to come in and pitch whenever the manager wishes to pull the current pitcher. Having a reliever warm up does not always mean he will be used; the current pitcher may regain his composure and retire the side, or the manager may choose to go with another reliever if strategy dictates. Commonly, pitching changes will occur as a result of a [[pinch hitter]] being used in the late innings of a game, especially if the pitcher is in the batting lineup due to not having the designated hitter. A reliever would then come out of the bullpen to pitch the next inning.\n\nWhen making a pitching change a manager will come out to the mound. He will then call in a pitcher by the tap of the arm which the next pitcher throws with. The manager or pitching coach may also come out to discuss strategy with the pitcher, but on his second trip to the mound with the same pitcher in the same inning, the pitcher has to come out. The relief pitchers often have even more specialized roles, and the particular reliever used depends on the situation. Many teams designate one pitcher as the ''[[closer (baseball)|closer]]'', a relief pitcher specifically reserved to pitch the final inning or innings of a game when his team has a narrow lead, in order to preserve the victory. More recently, teams began experimenting with an ''[[opener (baseball)|opener]]'', a relief pitcher who starts a game but only pitches at least the first inning. Other relief roles include [[set-up pitcher|set-up men]], [[middle relief pitcher|middle relievers]], [[left-handed specialist]]s, and [[long reliever]]s. Generally, relievers pitch fewer innings and throw fewer pitches than starters, but they can usually pitch more frequently without the need for several days of rest between appearances. Relief pitchers are typically guys with \"special stuff\". Meaning that they have really effective pitches or a very different style of delivery. This makes the batter see a very different way of pitching in attempt to get them out. One example is a sidearm or submarine pitcher.\n[[File:Baseball pitcher by thrashbandicoot01 dd8zz5g.jpg|thumb|A pitcher for the [[DeLand Suns]] prepares to throw a pitch against the Lakeland Lightning. June 8, 2019. ]]\n[[Position player]]s are eligible to pitch in a game as well, this however is rare as these players are not truly trained as pitchers and risk injury. (For instance, in a 1993 game, [[Jose Canseco]] suffered a season ending arm injury after pitching 2 innings.) Plus, they tend to throw with less velocity. For these reasons, managers will typically only use a position player as a pitcher in a blowout loss, or if they have run out of available pitchers in order to avoid a forfeit (the latter typically only happens in extra-inning games). [[Cliff Pennington (baseball)|Cliff Pennington]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], who pitched 1/3 of an inning in game 4 of the [[2015 American League Championship Series]] en route to a 14-2 loss, was the only documented position player to pitch during the [[postseason]], until [[Austin Romine]] of the [[New York Yankees]] pitched the ninth inning of Game 3 in a 16-1 loss against the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the [[2018 American League Division Series]]. The only regulation game in which ''both'' pitchers of record were position players occurred on May 6, 2012, when the Baltimore Orioles' designated hitter Chris Davis was the winner in a 16-inning game against Boston while Red Sox outfielder Darnell McDonald took the loss.\n\n==After the ball is pitched==\nThe pitcher's duty does not cease after he pitches the ball. Unlike the other fielders, a pitcher and catcher must start every play in a designated area. The pitcher must be on the [[pitcher's mound]], with one foot in contact with the [[pitcher's rubber]], and the catcher must be behind [[home plate]] in the [[catcher's box]]. Once the ball is in play, however, the pitcher and catcher, like the other fielders, can respond to any part of the field necessary to make or assist in a defensive play.<ref>Baseball Explained, by Phillip Mahony. McFarland Books, 2014. See [http://www.baseballexplained.com www.baseballexplained.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813034018/http://www.baseballexplained.com/ |date=August 13, 2014 }}</ref> At that point, the pitcher has several standard roles. The pitcher must attempt to field any balls coming up the middle, and in fact a [[Gold Glove Award]] is reserved for the pitcher with the best fielding ability. He must head over to [[first base]], to be available to cover it, on balls hit to the right side, since the first baseman might be fielding them too far to the baseman's right to reach first base before the batter-runner can. Except for the first baseman, the pitcher ordinarily has the shortest run to first base of anyone other than the first baseman, and is the second-most-likely person to make a putout at first base by retrieving a fielded ball thrown by an infielder (typically a first baseman). On [[passed ball]]s and [[wild pitch]]es, he covers home-plate when there are runners on. Also, he generally backs up throws to home plate. When there is a throw from the outfield to third base, he has to back up the play to third base as well.\n\n==Pitching biomechanics==\nThe physical act of overhand pitching is complex and unnatural to the human anatomy. Most major league pitchers throw at speeds between 70 and 100 mph, with fastballs, the most common pitch, generally ranging from 86-102mph, putting high amounts of stress on the pitching arm. Pitchers are by far the most frequently injured players and many professional pitchers will have multiple surgeries to repair damage in the elbow and shoulder by the end of their careers.\n\nAs such, the [[biomechanics]] of pitching are closely studied and taught by coaches at all levels and are an important field in [[sports medicine]].

The pitcher catcher combination results in many throws and may increase the risk of injury. 8) If a pitcher complains of pain in his/her elbow, get an evaluation from a sports medicine physician. 9) Inspire youth to have fun playing baseball and other sports.

Jobes can be done using either resistance bands or lightweight dumbbells.  Common jobe exercises include shoulder external rotation, shoulder flexion, horizontal abduction, prone abduction and scaption (at 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and inverse 45\u00b0).\n\nIn addition to the Jobes exercises, many pitching coaches are creating lifting routines that are specialized for pitchers. Pitchers should avoid exercises that deal with a barbell. The emphasis on the workout should be on the legs and the core. Other body parts should be worked on but using lighter weights. Over lifting muscles, especially while throwing usually ends up in a strain muscle or possible a tear.\n\n==Equipment==\n\nOther than the catcher, pitchers and other fielders wear very few pieces of equipment. In general the ball cap, [[baseball glove]] and cleats are equipment used. Pitchers may also keep with them at the mound a bag of powdered rosin. Handling the bag applies a small layer of the rosin to the pitcher\u2019s fingers in order to increase his grip on the ball. \n\nCurrently there is a new trend of introducing a pitcher helmet to provide head protection from batters hitting [[line drive]]s back to the pitcher. {{As of|2014|1}}, MLB approved a protective pitchers cap which can be worn by any pitcher if they choose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/10363291/pitchers-protective-caps-approved-major-league-baseball |title=Pitchers' protective caps approved |date=January 28, 2014 |work=ESPN.com }}</ref> San Diego Padres relief pitcher, [[Alex Torres (baseball)|Alex Torres]] was the first player in MLB to wear the protective cap.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchershelmet.com/who-was-the-first-pitcher-to-wear-protective-headgear/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304114557/http://www.pitchershelmet.com/who-was-the-first-pitcher-to-wear-protective-headgear/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2015 |title=Who was the first pitcher to wear protective headgear |date=July 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nOne style of helmet is worn on top of the ballcap to provide protection to the forehead and sides.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/07/idUS180810+07-Mar-2011+BW20110307 |title=New Pitching Helmet Prototype Unveiled by Easton-Bell Sports |agency=Reuters |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407101016/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/07/idUS180810+07-Mar-2011+BW20110307 |archivedate=April 7, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn [[softball]], a full face helmet is available to all players including pitchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fastpitch-softball-coaching.com/softball-helmet.html |title=Softball Helmet: Selection and prices for the popular models |publisher=Fastpitch-softball-coaching.com |date=March 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> These fielder's masks are becoming increasingly popular in younger fast pitch leagues, some leagues even requiring them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n{{commons category|Pitchers (baseball)}}\n* [[Pitching machine]]\n* [[List of baseball pitches]]\n* [[Baseball fielding positions]]\n* [[Cy Young Award]] winners\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders]]\n* [[Bowler (cricket)|Bowler]] \u2013 similar position in [[cricket]]\n* [[American Sports Medicine Institute]] \u2013 Pitching Biomechanics Evaluation\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web|first1=Chris|last1=Ballard|first2=Owen|last2=Good|title=The Invisible Fastball: Six decades ago a minor league pitcher accomplished something we'll never see again|date=October 17, 2011|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1191155/1/index.htm|accessdate=October 19, 2011|quote=When [Kelly] Jack Swift arrived in Elkin, N.C., in late 1951, he was nobody's idea of a prospect.}}\n\n{{Baseball positions}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball pitching]]\n[[Category:Baseball positions]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 14-2 \u2192 14\u20132 (2), \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher"}
