It was part of [[Operation Cartwheel]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[strategy]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] to isolate the Japanese base around [[Rabaul]]. The campaign took place in the [[New Georgia Islands|New Georgia]] group of islands, in the central [[Solomon Islands]] and followed the Allied capture of the [[Russell Island group|Russell Islands]]. The main fighting took place on New Georgia island itself, although significant actions also took place around the island chain throughout the campaign. \n\nThe campaign began on 30 June 1943, when US troops carried out landings in the [[Kula Gulf]], in the north of New Georgia island, and around the Munda area on the western coast. In addition, smaller landings were undertaken at [[Battle of Viru Harbor|Viru Harbor]] on the southern coast of the island, [[Battle of Wickham Anchorage|Wickham Anchorage]] on Vangunu Island, and on [[Landings on Rendova|Rendova]]. In the north, several actions were fought around [[Battle of Enogai|Enogai]] and [[Battle of Bairoko|Bairoko]] throughout July, while in the western, the main US objective was the Japanese airfield on Munda Point. Stubborn defense by the Japanese delayed the US [[Drive on Munda Point|advance on Munda]] and the Japanese mounted a [[New Georgia counterattack|strong counterattack]] before US force eventually [[Battle of Munda Point|captured Munda Point]] in early August. Elsewhere, further actions took place on [[Arundel Island]] in August and September after Japanese forces withdrew there after the fighting around Munda Point. A large number of Japanese troops concentrated on Kolombangara late in the campaign, but were bypassed by US troops who landed on [[Battle of Vella Lavella (land)|Vella Lavella]] in mid-August and were later reinforced by New Zealand troops. The campaign ended on 7 October 1943 when the last Japanese troops were withdrawn from [[Vella Lavella]], finalising the  and resulted in the Allied capture of the islands. \n\nA series of naval actions also took place in conjunction with the fighting on land, including actions in the [[Battle of Kula Gulf|Kula Gulf]], off [[Battle of Kolombangara|Kolombangara]], in the [[Battle of Vella Gulf|Vella Gulf]], off [[Battle off Horaniu|Horaniu]] and off [[Battle of Vella Lavella (naval)| Vella Lavella]].\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:SolomonsNewGeorgiaPacificWarMap.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Map showing the area in which Operation Cartwheel took place, with New Guinea in the west and the New Georgias highlighted]]\n\nThe [[Japan]]ese had captured [[New Georgia]] in 1942 and built an airbase at Munda Point which began operations in December 1942 to support the [[Guadalcanal campaign|Guadalcanal offensives]]. As it became clear at the end of 1942 that they could not hold [[Guadalcanal]], the Japanese commanders guessed that the Allies would move toward the Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] on [[New Britain]], and that the central Solomon Islands were logical steps on the way.<ref>Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', p. 8</ref>\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) believed that holding the Solomon Islands would be ultimately unsuccessful and that it would be better to wait for an Allied attack on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] which would be much less costly to supply and reinforce. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) preferred to delay the Allied advance for as long as possible by maintaining a distant line of defense. With no effective central command, the two Japanese services implemented their own plans: the navy assumed responsibility for the defense of the central Solomons and the army for the northern Solomons.<ref>Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', p. 9</ref>\n\nIn early 1943, Japanese defenses were prepared against possible Allied landings on New Georgia, [[Kolombangara]] and [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]]. By June 1943, there were 10,500&nbsp;troops on New Georgia and 9,000 on Kolombangara, all under the command of General [[Minoru Sasaki|Minoru (Noboru) Sasaki]], well dug in and waiting for an Allied attack.<ref>Miller,  ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 97</ref><ref>Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', pp. 9 & 25</ref>\n\n==Allied planning==\n\n===Choice of New Georgia===\nBy early 1943, some Allied leaders had wanted to focus on capturing Rabaul, but Japanese strength there and lack of landing craft meant that such an operation was not practical in 1943. Instead, on the initiative of the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], a plan known as Operation Cartwheel was developed, which proposed to envelop and cut off Rabaul without capturing it, by simultaneous offensives in the Territory of [[New Guinea]] and northward through the Solomon Islands.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 20\u201326; 225</ref>\n\nThe Allied base at Guadalcanal continued to suffer from Japanese bombing raids even after the island was declared secured on 9 February 1943. The Japanese airfield at Munda made these raids easier by giving Japanese planes a convenient place to refuel on the way to and from their main base at Rabaul. The Allies attempted to neutralize Munda with repeated bombing raids and naval shelling, but the Japanese were always able to repair the airfield in short order.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 90</ref> The Allied command thus determined that Munda had to be captured by ground troops. Since the [[New Georgia Islands|New Georgias]] lay within the [[South Pacific Area]], the operation would be the responsibility of Admiral [[William F. Halsey]],<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 67</ref> headquartered at [[Noum\u00e9a]] on [[New Caledonia]].<ref> Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', p. 25</ref> US forces committed to capturing Munda totaled 32,000 Army personnel and 1,700 Marines.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 245</ref> Forces allocated to capturing Vella Lavella totaled 9,588, of which 5,888 were US servicemen and 3,700 were New Zealanders.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 176</ref><ref>Gillespie, ''The Pacific'', p. 128</ref>\n\n===Capture of the Russells===\n\n[[File:R K Turner2-Feb44.jpg|thumb|right|Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, Commander South Pacific Amphibious Forces]]\n\nThe [[Russell Island group]], lying between Guadalcanal and the New Georgia group, had served as a troop staging base for the Japanese during the fight for Guadalcanal, and Admiral Halsey, Commander South Pacific Force (renamed US Third Fleet on 15 March 1943), determined to capture it in preparation for the main action in the New Georgias. In early February, he instructed Rear Admiral [[Richmond Kelly Turner]], formerly his Deputy Commander and now his Commander Amphibious Force, to undertake [[Operation Cleanslate]].<ref>Miller ''Guadalcanal: The First Offensive'', pp. 351\u2013356</ref>\n\nBeginning 21 February, Admiral Turner landed the US Army [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd Infantry Division]] under Major General [[John H. Hester]] and the [[Marine Raiders|3rd Marine Raider Battalion]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[Harry B. Liversedge]] on the [[Russells]], a total of approximately 9,000 troops and their equipment. These landings were totally unopposed because, unbeknownst to the Allies, the Japanese had evacuated the Russells soon after leaving Guadalcanal. In fact, the men landing on nearby Banika Island were greeted by two [[coastwatchers]] with the offer of a cup of tea.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 21</ref>\n\n===Preliminaries to the New Georgia landings===\n\n[[File:Battle of New Georgia map.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Allied landings in the New Georgias]]\n\nAlarmed that the Allies were working their way up the Solomons chain, the Japanese bombed the new American base in the Russells and began strengthening their own airfields at Munda and at nearby [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]] on [[Kolombangara Island]]. In their turn, the Americans continued attempting to subdue Munda field with naval shellings of dubious effectiveness.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 106\u2013107</ref> During the course of one of these overnight bombardment sorties, on the night of 6\u20137 March 1943, an American force consisting of three light cruisers and three [[destroyer]]s under the command of Rear Admiral [[Aaron S. Merrill|A. Stanton Merrill]] encountered the Japanese destroyers ''Murasame'' and ''Minegumo'' as they were returning up [[Kula Gulf]] from delivering food and supplies to the garrison at Vila. In the ensuing action, known as the [[Battle of Blackett Strait]], both Japanese destroyers were sunk.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 107\u2013110</ref>\n\nThe Americans next attempted to interdict the Japanese supply lanes by mining the ocean approaches to Vila and Munda. This proved as ineffective as bombardment had been, since the Japanese were able to sweep up the mines readily.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 110\u2013116</ref>\n\nThe Allies had plenty of time to plan Operation Toenails, as the invasion of the New Georgias was called. The plan called for simultaneous landings on 30 June at four places. From southeast to northwest, these were: (1) Wickham Anchorage on the southeast coast of [[Vangunu Island]]; (2) [[Segi Point Airfield|Segi Point]] on the southeastern tip of New Georgia; (3) Viru Harbor on the southwest coast of New Georgia, just a few miles up from Segi; and (4) Rendova Harbor on [[Rendova Island]] just across [[Blanche Channel]] from Munda, placing the latter Japanese base well within range of land-based artillery.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 139</ref>\n\nDuring the entire New Georgia Campaign, the resolution and resourcefulness of the British Commonwealth coastwatchers proved invaluable to the Allied cause. District Officer [[Donald Gilbert Kennedy]], a New Zealander, set the tone in a message he delivered to every native village when occupation by the Japanese was imminent: \"These islands are British and they are to remain British. The government is not leaving. Even if the Japanese come, we shall stay with you and in the end they will be driven out.\" In the event, it was the prospect of District Officer Kennedy being killed or captured that led Admiral Turner to move up the first Allied landings by nine days. He sent two companies of the [[Marine Raiders|4th Marine Raider Battalion]] to capture Segi Point on the morning of 21 June, where Kennedy and his native comrades were rescued.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 141</ref>\n\n==Conquest of New Georgia island==\n{{split section|date=March 2020}}\n===Main landings: 30 June \u2013 2 July===\n{{main article|Landings on Rendova}}\n[[File:Human conveyer belts.jpg|thumb|right|[[Landing Craft Infantry|LCIs]] unloading at Rendova]]\n\nA force consisting of portions of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion and the [[103rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|103rd Infantry Regiment]] landed at Oloana Bay on the south coast of Vangunu Island on 30 June. From there they marched overland to Vura village which overlooked [[Battle of Wickham Anchorage|Wickham Anchorage]], the first of the objectives of the original plan. By 12 July, Vura was secured and garrisoned.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 46\u201351</ref>\n\nAnother company from the 103rd Infantry Regiment [[Battle of Viru Harbor|landed at Viru Harbor]] on 30 June, while elements of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion advanced overland from Segi Point where they had landed on 27 June.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 83\u201384</ref> This represented a third of the original plan's objectives. The Japanese were driven off and by 9 July the area was secured and garrisoned.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 44\u201346</ref>\n\nThe landings in the area around Munda were obviously the most important of the four. Admiral Turner personally commanded this portion of the invasion fleet from his flagship, the attack transport ''McCawley'', which after being damaged by a Japanese air-launched torpedo that afternoon, was mistakenly sunk by an American [[PT boat]] that night. The US Army's [[172nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|172nd Infantry Regiment]] landed at Rendova Harbor while Companies A and B of the [[169th Infantry Regiment (United States)|169th Infantry Regiment]] along with a New Zealand-trained and led commando unit of 130 South Pacific islanders took three vitally placed islets in Blanche Channel.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 54\u201357</ref><ref>Larsen, ''Pacific Commandos'', pp. 9 & 108</ref>  These were to provide staging areas for the main event, the siege of Munda.<ref>Miller,  ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, the Americans were ready to make a landing in the Munda area. Laiana beach was closest, being only {{convert|2|miles|km}} from Munda, but as it was heavily defended, it was rejected in favor of Zanana beach, more than {{convert|3|miles|km}} farther east. Zanana would prove to be an unfortunate choice from an Allied perspective.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 92, footnote 27</ref><ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 177</ref>\n\n===Landings in Kula Gulf===\n[[File:LiversedgeNewGeorgia.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant Colonel Harry B. Liversedge on New Georgia.]]\n\nHalsey's counterparts at Rabaul, Vice Admiral [[Jinichi Kusaka]] and Lieutenant General [[Hitoshi Imamura]], had no intention of allowing New Georgia to fall the way Guadalcanal had. They loaded 4,000 troops on destroyers, brought them down The Slot on the night of 4\u20135 July and landed them at Vila on the southeast coast of Kolombangara Island.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 156</ref> From there, the men would be ferried across Kula Gulf on barges to Bairoko on the northwest coast of New Georgia, from where they would follow the eight-mile jungle trail to Munda.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', Map p. 100 & pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nThe Allies also carried out an amphibious operation in Kula Gulf that night. Admiral Halsey had dispatched transports carrying 4,600 troops (consisting of elements of the 1st Marine Raider Regiment and two US Army battalions from the [[145th Infantry Regiment (United States)|145th]] and [[148th Infantry Regiment (United States)|148th Infantry Regiments]])<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabual'', pp. 119\u2013121</ref> under Colonel Liversedge to Rice Anchorage on the northwest coast of New Georgia. Covering these troopships was a force of three light cruisers and four destroyers commanded by Rear Admiral [[Walden L. Ainsworth]]. One of Ainsworth's destroyers, the ''Strong'', was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese as the latter were retiring up the Gulf from their reinforcement mission to Vila.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 156\u2013158</ref>\n\nLiversedge's men were tasked with moving down the coast and capturing Bairoko, thereby interdicting the trailhead used by the Japanese to reinforce Munda. They were successfully landed at dawn, but were only able to advance {{convert|5|mi|km|sp=us}} through the heavy jungle the first day.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 157</ref> After three days, they had covered {{convert|7|mi|km|sp=us}}.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 176</ref>\n\nThe night (5\u20136 July) after the Kula Gulf landings, the opposing naval forces engaged in a full-scale battle in the waters northeast of Kolombangara Island, an action that came to be called the [[Battle of Kula Gulf]]. The Americans lost the light cruiser ''Helena'' while the Japanese lost two destroyers, ''Niizuki'' and ''Nagatsuki'', as well as Rear Admiral [[Teruo Akiyama]].<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 99</ref><ref>Prados, ''Combined Fleet Decoded'', p. 491</ref> In the north, after advancing from Rice Anchorage, US forces occupied Triri on 7\u20138 July. A 400-strong Japanese force launched a counterattack on 8 July against Triri, which initially made some gains before it was checked by a flanking move. Following this, US troops [[Battle of Enogai|captured Enogai]] at the mouth of the inlet on 10\u201311 July, before moving to establish a block along the Munda\u2013Bairoko trail.<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabaul'', pp. 123\u2013130</ref>\n\n===Debacle at Munda===\n[[File:Drive toward Munda Point.jpg|thumb|right|Initial drive towards Munda]]\n\nThe US Army troops' [[Drive on Munda Point|advance from Zanana to Munda]] was completely stymied, hampered by difficult terrain, supply problems and low morale.<ref>Miller,  ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 106\u2013115</ref> General Hester tried to break the stalemate by sending the 172nd Infantry Regiment around to the north to take the Japanese position in the rear, while the 169th Infantry Regiment continued the frontal assault. Historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] had this to say about the decision:\n\n{{quote|This was perhaps the worst blunder in the most unintelligently waged land campaign of the Pacific war (with the possible exception of Okinawa). Laiana should have been chosen as the initial beachhead; if it was now required, the 172nd should have been withdrawn from Zanana and landed at Laiana under naval gunfire and air support. Or Hester might have made the landing with his reserves then waiting at Rendova. As it was, General Sasaki interpreted the move correctly and by nightfall had brought both advances to a standstill.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 177</ref>}}\n\nThe American ground troops on New Georgia were thus halted in both the north and the south. The Japanese brought reinforcements over by barge from Vila to Bairoko, and 1,200 more troops were  loaded onto four [[High-speed transport |destroyer-transports]] at Rabaul and sent down to be landed at Vila on the night of 12\u201313 July. These ships were escorted by a light cruiser and five destroyers. Admiral Ainsworth was sent to intercept this flotilla with three light cruisers and ten destroyers. He encountered the Japanese force in The Slot in the waters north of Kolombangara Island. The ensuing [[Battle of Kolombangara]] resulted in the sinking of the American destroyer ''Gwin'', the Japanese light cruiser ''Jintsu'', and the death of Rear Admiral [[Shunji Isaki]].<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 180\u2013182</ref>\n\n===Changes in command and the capture of Munda===\n[[File:Capture of Munda Point.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Siege and capture of Munda]]\n{{main article|Battle of Munda Point}}\n\nMajor General [[Oscar Griswold|Oscar W. Griswold]], commander XIV Army Corps and General Hester's immediate superior, visited New Georgia to assess the situation and determined that it was indeed dire. He radioed that at least another division was needed to break the stalemate. At Noum\u00e9a, Admiral Halsey had had no conception of how bad things were.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 198</ref> He sent Lieutenant General [[Millard F. Harmon]], of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], to the front to straighten the matter out. Harmon thoroughly investigated the situation on New Georgia and gave field command to Griswold so that Hester could concentrate on leading his own division. At the same time, a long-anticipated change in naval command took place with Rear Admiral [[Theodore Stark Wilkinson]] taking over leadership of the amphibious forces from Admiral Turner on 15 July.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 77</ref>\n\nGeneral Sasaki took advantage of the disorder on the American side. Samuel Eliot Morison described it this way:\n\n{{quote|Darkness came to the jungle like the click of a camera shutter. Then the Japanese crept close to the American lines. They attacked with bloodcurdling screams, plastered bivouacs with artillery and mortar barrages, crawled silently into American foxholes and stabbed or strangled the occupants. Often they cursed loudly in English, rattled their equipment, named the American commanding officers and dared the Americans to fight, reminding them that they were \"not in the Louisiana maneuvers now.\" For sick and hungry soldiers who had fought all day, this unholy shivaree was terrifying. They shot at everything in sight \u2013 fox fire on rotting stumps, land crabs clattering over rocks, even comrades.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 199</ref>}}\n\nThe Japanese learned to apply close assault tactics to American tanks, rendering armor even less effective in the jungle than usual. On the night of 17 July, the Japanese launched a [[New Georgia counterattack|strong counterattack]] and actually succeeded in overrunning the command post of the 43rd Division near Zanana. Eventually, however, Sasaki's troops became sick and exhausted; also, he had lost communications with Rabaul. He ordered a retreat from the Munda area on 3 August. General Griswold had his men sweep around Munda to the northwest and on 5 August plastered the remaining Japanese with artillery fire. That day, the Americans moved unopposed into Munda, finally achieving the campaign's most important goal.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 200\u2013206</ref>\n\n===Capture of Bairoko===\n[[File:Approach to bairoko.jpg|thumb|right|Approach to Bairoko]]\n{{main article|Battle of Bairoko}}\n\nOn the northern front, Colonel Liversedge's Marines consolidated their position around Enogai after 12 July and began patrolling the local area while US Army troops occupied the blocking position. This was subsequently abandoned on 17 July and the soldiers returned to Triri.<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabaul'', pp. 131\u2013133</ref> had been reinforced by 700 Marines from the 4th Raider Battalion and made plans to capture Bairoko village, on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 202</ref> His Army detachment was to attack the village from the southeast while his Marines converged from the northeast, a classic pincer movement. The Japanese defensive positions were so well designed, and had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage;<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabaul'', pp. 134\u2013135</ref> as a result, neither force made any progress, and US casualties began to mount. Just before dawn on 22 July, Liversedge called for air strikes to cover his withdrawal. With a view to compensating for failures in land-based air cover following previous such requests, what followed was the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign so far.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 105\u2013108</ref>\n\nOn the night of 1\u20132 August, while patrolling Blackett Strait west of Kolombangara, ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT 109]]'' was cut in two and sunk by destroyer ''Amagiri''. The boat's commander was Lieutenant [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 211</ref>\n\nBeginning 3 August, Liversedge tried again, first establishing a battalion of the 148th Infantry Regiment at a blocking position on the Munda trail. Two days later he relieved these men with a combined Army/Marine force and moved the 148th to a dominant position overlooking the entire area. On 10 August, Liversedge picked up another US battalion and renewed the direct attack on Bairoko. After two more grueling weeks, the Americans entered Bairoko unopposed on 24 August.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 109</ref>\n\n===Securing New Georgia===\n[[File:Clean up new georgia.jpg|thumb|right|Actions in western New Georgia]]\n\nAdmiral Kusaka and General Imamura at Rabaul made a final, disastrous attempt to bring reinforcements to General Sasaki. Under the protection of a single destroyer, 940 troops and 700 naval personnel were loaded aboard three destroyer-transports and sent down under the command of Rear Admiral [[Kaju Sugiura]] to Kolombangara on the night of 6\u20137 August. Admiral Wilkinson, thinking such a movement likely on that night, sent a force of six destroyers under Commander [[Frederick Moosbrugger]] to intercept them.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 118</ref> The American destroyer sailors were jubilant that at last they would be free of the combat doctrine that required them to stick close to the cruisers; on this night, they would be able to apply their own tactics.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 212\u2013213</ref> In the resulting [[Battle of Vella Gulf]], fought in the waters northwest of Kolombangara, the American destroyers took the Japanese completely by surprise. The three ships carrying passengers, ''Arashi'', ''Hagikaze'', and ''Kawakaze'', were torpedoed and sunk, and the escort ship, ''Shigure'', did not linger to search for survivors.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 118\u2013120</ref>\n\nFollowing this major reversal, General Sasaki moved his headquarters to Kolombangara on 8\u20139 August, leaving behind a token force to defend the west coast of New Georgia. His mission now was simply to hold the remaining islands of the New Georgia group as long as possible, giving the Japanese a chance to reinforce the northern Solomons. US Army forces moved along the west coast of New Georgia, wiping out the 200 Japanese remaining in the Zieta area, and capturing the islet of Baanga to silence the enemy artillery there by 20 August. Under the noses of U.S. patrols, the last Japanese troops on New Georgia were moved by barge from Bairoko Harbor over to Kolombangara on the night of 23 August. This marked the end of ground combat on New Georgia.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 121\u2013122</ref>\n\n==Outlying islands==\n\n===Arundel===\nGeneral Sasaki played his delaying role to the hilt. When the US 172nd Infantry Regiment landed on [[Arundel Island]], just west of New Georgia, on 27 August, he allowed them to come ashore unopposed and establish a beachhead. Just as the Americans were feeling the occupation would be easy, Sasaki counterattacked in multiple places, tying the Americans down and forcing them to call for reinforcements. He carried out a particularly determined attack on 15 September, bringing the whole Allied effort on Arundel to a halt, and with far fewer troops than his opponents. General Griswold ordered a full-scale effort, including Marine Corps tanks, to drive the Japanese off the island. After vicious fighting on 17 and 18 September, the Japanese abandoned Arundel for good on the night of 20\u201321 September.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 124\u2013128</ref>\n\n=== Vella Lavella===\nAdmiral Halsey had earlier seen the wisdom of bypassing the heavily fortified island of Kolombangara and [[Land Battle of Vella Lavella|invading Vella Lavella]] instead, the latter island lying closer to Bougainville and Rabaul and being less well defended. Thus, a month before New Georgia was secured by the Allies, they landed a reconnaissance party on Vella Lavella to gain information about Japanese strength and dispositions as well as about suitable landing sites. These men and their native guides managed to explore the island for a full week, completely avoiding contact with the Japanese. On 31 July, they returned to Guadalcanal with thorough intelligence about the target. The village of [[Barakoma Airfield|Barakoma]] near the island's southeastern tip was selected as the landing place.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 130</ref>\n\nThe invasion force consisted of seven destroyer-transports, three [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]]s, two [[submarine chaser]]s and twelve destroyers under the personal command of Admiral Wilkinson aboard one of the destroyers. Embarked were about 6,500 ground troops led by Major General [[Robert B. McClure]]. Japanese planes attacked multiple Allied bases on the night of 14 August, but completely missed this fleet headed for Vella Lavella. The next morning, disembarkation began at Barakoma.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 135</ref>\n\n[[File:155-mm-gun-4th-defense-battalion-barakoma.jpg|thumb|right|155&nbsp;mm gun at Barakoma]]\n\nThe Japanese high command in Tokyo had already decided that no more troops would be wasted in the central Solomons. Rather than reinforce and defend Vella Lavella, it was to be used merely as a way station for the evacuation of the troops on Kolombangara that had been bypassed by the Allies with this new landing. Horaniu on the northeast coast was selected as a barge staging point and on the night of 17\u201318 August two IJA [[Company (military)|companies]] and an IJN  [[platoon]] were landed there. The covering force of four destroyers was met in The Slot by an American force, also made up of four destroyers under Captain  [[Thomas J. Ryan (admiral)|Thomas J. Ryan]], that had been sent to disrupt the operation. In the ensuing [[Battle off Horaniu]], no ships of either side were lost and the Japanese succeeded in establishing a barge base.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 233\u2013234</ref>\n\nThe Allies decided to squeeze the remaining enemy ground forces on Vella Lavella into a pocket in the northwest corner of the island and wipe them out. The [[3rd Division (New Zealand)|3rd New Zealand Division]], under the command of Major General [[Harold Barrowclough|Harold E. Barrowclough]], was given this assignment. The New Zealanders began their pincer movement on 21 September, but the Japanese resisted so fiercely that it took until 5\u20136 October to bottle them up.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 141</ref>\n\nOn the night of 6\u20137 October, Rear Admiral [[Matsuji Ijuin]] led a force consisting of three destroyer-transports and twelve small craft to take the 600 remaining ground troops off Vella Lavella. Ijuin personally commanded a group of six destroyers sent to cover the operation from American naval interference. Admiral Wilkinson hurriedly rerouted two groups of three destroyers each to attempt to disrupt the evacuation. Only the first group, under the command of Captain Frank R. Walker, arrived in time to engage in combat. In the resulting [[Naval Battle of Vella Lavella|naval battle]], the US destroyer ''Chevalier'' and the Japanese destroyer ''Yugumo'' were lost. Ijuin succeeded in keeping the American ships from interfering in the evacuation.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 243\u2013250</ref> As a result, General Barrowclough's men entered the evacuated area unopposed.

It was part of [[Operation Cartwheel]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[strategy]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] to isolate the Japanese base around [[Rabaul]]. The campaign took place in the [[New Georgia Islands|New Georgia]] group of islands, in the central [[Solomon Islands]] and followed the Allied capture of the [[Russell Island group|Russell Islands]]. The main fighting took place on New Georgia island itself, although significant actions also took place around the island chain throughout the campaign. \n\nThe campaign began on 30 June 1943, when US troops carried out landings in the [[Kula Gulf]], in the north of New Georgia island, and around the Munda area on the western coast. In addition, smaller landings were undertaken at [[Battle of Viru Harbor|Viru Harbor]] on the southern coast of the island, [[Battle of Wickham Anchorage|Wickham Anchorage]] on Vangunu Island, and on [[Landings on Rendova|Rendova]]. In the north, several actions were fought around [[Battle of Enogai|Enogai]] and [[Battle of Bairoko|Bairoko]] throughout July, while in the western, the main US objective was the Japanese airfield on Munda Point. Stubborn defense by the Japanese delayed the US [[Drive on Munda Point|advance on Munda]] and a the Japanese mounted [[New Georgia counterattack|strong counterattack]] before US force eventually [[Battle of Munda Point|captured Munda Point]] in early August. Elsewhere, further actions took place on [[Arundel Island]] in August and September after Japanese forces withdrew there after the fighting around Munda Point. A large number of Japanese troops concentrated on Kolombangara late in the campaign, but were bypassed by US troops who landed on [[Battle of Vella Lavella (land)|Vella Lavella]] in mid-August and were later reinforced by New Zealand troops. The campaign ended on 7 October 1943 when the last Japanese troops were withdrawn from [[Vella Lavella]], finalising the  and resulted in the Allied capture of the islands. \n\nA series of naval actions also took place in conjunction with the fighting on land, including actions in the [[Battle of Kula Gulf|Kula Gulf]], off [[Battle of Kolombangara|Kolombangara]], in the [[Battle of Vella Gulf|Vella Gulf]], off [[Battle off Horaniu|Horaniu]] and off [[Battle of Vella Lavella (naval)| Vella Lavella]].\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:SolomonsNewGeorgiaPacificWarMap.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Map showing the area in which Operation Cartwheel took place, with New Guinea in the west and the New Georgias highlighted]]\n\nThe [[Japan]]ese had captured [[New Georgia]] in 1942 and built an airbase at Munda Point which began operations in December 1942 to support the [[Guadalcanal campaign|Guadalcanal offensives]]. As it became clear at the end of 1942 that they could not hold [[Guadalcanal]], the Japanese commanders guessed that the Allies would move toward the Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] on [[New Britain]], and that the central Solomon Islands were logical steps on the way.<ref>Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', p. 8</ref>\n\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) believed that holding the Solomon Islands would be ultimately unsuccessful and that it would be better to wait for an Allied attack on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] which would be much less costly to supply and reinforce. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) preferred to delay the Allied advance for as long as possible by maintaining a distant line of defense. With no effective central command, the two Japanese services implemented their own plans: the navy assumed responsibility for the defense of the central Solomons and the army for the northern Solomons.<ref>Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', p. 9</ref>\n\nIn early 1943, Japanese defenses were prepared against possible Allied landings on New Georgia, [[Kolombangara]] and [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]]. By June 1943, there were 10,500&nbsp;troops on New Georgia and 9,000 on Kolombangara, all under the command of General [[Minoru Sasaki|Minoru (Noboru) Sasaki]], well dug in and waiting for an Allied attack.<ref>Miller,  ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 97</ref><ref>Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', pp. 9 & 25</ref>\n\n==Allied planning==\n\n===Choice of New Georgia===\nBy early 1943, some Allied leaders had wanted to focus on capturing Rabaul, but Japanese strength there and lack of landing craft meant that such an operation was not practical in 1943. Instead, on the initiative of the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], a plan known as Operation Cartwheel was developed, which proposed to envelop and cut off Rabaul without capturing it, by simultaneous offensives in the Territory of [[New Guinea]] and northward through the Solomon Islands.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 20\u201326; 225</ref>\n\nThe Allied base at Guadalcanal continued to suffer from Japanese bombing raids even after the island was declared secured on 9 February 1943. The Japanese airfield at Munda made these raids easier by giving Japanese planes a convenient place to refuel on the way to and from their main base at Rabaul. The Allies attempted to neutralize Munda with repeated bombing raids and naval shelling, but the Japanese were always able to repair the airfield in short order.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 90</ref> The Allied command thus determined that Munda had to be captured by ground troops. Since the [[New Georgia Islands|New Georgias]] lay within the [[South Pacific Area]], the operation would be the responsibility of Admiral [[William F. Halsey]],<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 67</ref> headquartered at [[Noum\u00e9a]] on [[New Caledonia]].<ref> Lofgren, ''Northern Solomons: The U.S. Army Campaigns of World War II'', p. 25</ref> US forces committed to capturing Munda totaled 32,000 Army personnel and 1,700 Marines.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 245</ref> Forces allocated to capturing Vella Lavella totaled 9,588, of which 5,888 were US servicemen and 3,700 were New Zealanders.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 176</ref><ref>Gillespie, ''The Pacific'', p. 128</ref>\n\n===Capture of the Russells===\n\n[[File:R K Turner2-Feb44.jpg|thumb|right|Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner, Commander South Pacific Amphibious Forces]]\n\nThe [[Russell Island group]], lying between Guadalcanal and the New Georgia group, had served as a troop staging base for the Japanese during the fight for Guadalcanal, and Admiral Halsey, Commander South Pacific Force (renamed US Third Fleet on 15 March 1943), determined to capture it in preparation for the main action in the New Georgias. In early February, he instructed Rear Admiral [[Richmond Kelly Turner]], formerly his Deputy Commander and now his Commander Amphibious Force, to undertake [[Operation Cleanslate]].<ref>Miller ''Guadalcanal: The First Offensive'', pp. 351\u2013356</ref>\n\nBeginning 21 February, Admiral Turner landed the US Army [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd Infantry Division]] under Major General [[John H. Hester]] and the [[Marine Raiders|3rd Marine Raider Battalion]] under Lieutenant Colonel [[Harry B. Liversedge]] on the [[Russells]], a total of approximately 9,000 troops and their equipment. These landings were totally unopposed because, unbeknownst to the Allies, the Japanese had evacuated the Russells soon after leaving Guadalcanal. In fact, the men landing on nearby Banika Island were greeted by two [[coastwatchers]] with the offer of a cup of tea.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 21</ref>\n\n===Preliminaries to the New Georgia landings===\n\n[[File:Battle of New Georgia map.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Allied landings in the New Georgias]]\n\nAlarmed that the Allies were working their way up the Solomons chain, the Japanese bombed the new American base in the Russells and began strengthening their own airfields at Munda and at nearby [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]] on [[Kolombangara Island]]. In their turn, the Americans continued attempting to subdue Munda field with naval shellings of dubious effectiveness.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 106\u2013107</ref> During the course of one of these overnight bombardment sorties, on the night of 6\u20137 March 1943, an American force consisting of three light cruisers and three [[destroyer]]s under the command of Rear Admiral [[Aaron S. Merrill|A. Stanton Merrill]] encountered the Japanese destroyers ''Murasame'' and ''Minegumo'' as they were returning up [[Kula Gulf]] from delivering food and supplies to the garrison at Vila. In the ensuing action, known as the [[Battle of Blackett Strait]], both Japanese destroyers were sunk.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 107\u2013110</ref>\n\nThe Americans next attempted to interdict the Japanese supply lanes by mining the ocean approaches to Vila and Munda. This proved as ineffective as bombardment had been, since the Japanese were able to sweep up the mines readily.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 110\u2013116</ref>\n\nThe Allies had plenty of time to plan Operation Toenails, as the invasion of the New Georgias was called. The plan called for simultaneous landings on 30 June at four places. From southeast to northwest, these were: (1) Wickham Anchorage on the southeast coast of [[Vangunu Island]]; (2) [[Segi Point Airfield|Segi Point]] on the southeastern tip of New Georgia; (3) Viru Harbor on the southwest coast of New Georgia, just a few miles up from Segi; and (4) Rendova Harbor on [[Rendova Island]] just across [[Blanche Channel]] from Munda, placing the latter Japanese base well within range of land-based artillery.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 139</ref>\n\nDuring the entire New Georgia Campaign, the resolution and resourcefulness of the British Commonwealth coastwatchers proved invaluable to the Allied cause. District Officer [[Donald Gilbert Kennedy]], a New Zealander, set the tone in a message he delivered to every native village when occupation by the Japanese was imminent: \"These islands are British and they are to remain British. The government is not leaving. Even if the Japanese come, we shall stay with you and in the end they will be driven out.\" In the event, it was the prospect of District Officer Kennedy being killed or captured that led Admiral Turner to move up the first Allied landings by nine days. He sent two companies of the [[Marine Raiders|4th Marine Raider Battalion]] to capture Segi Point on the morning of 21 June, where Kennedy and his native comrades were rescued.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 141</ref>\n\n==Conquest of New Georgia island==\n{{split section|date=March 2020}}\n===Main landings: 30 June \u2013 2 July===\n{{main article|Landings on Rendova}}\n[[File:Human conveyer belts.jpg|thumb|right|[[Landing Craft Infantry|LCIs]] unloading at Rendova]]\n\nA force consisting of portions of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion and the [[103rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|103rd Infantry Regiment]] landed at Oloana Bay on the south coast of Vangunu Island on 30 June. From there they marched overland to Vura village which overlooked [[Battle of Wickham Anchorage|Wickham Anchorage]], the first of the objectives of the original plan. By 12 July, Vura was secured and garrisoned.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 46\u201351</ref>\n\nAnother company from the 103rd Infantry Regiment [[Battle of Viru Harbor|landed at Viru Harbor]] on 30 June, while elements of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion advanced overland from Segi Point where they had landed on 27 June.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 83\u201384</ref> This represented a third of the original plan's objectives. The Japanese were driven off and by 9 July the area was secured and garrisoned.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 44\u201346</ref>\n\nThe landings in the area around Munda were obviously the most important of the four. Admiral Turner personally commanded this portion of the invasion fleet from his flagship, the attack transport ''McCawley'', which after being damaged by a Japanese air-launched torpedo that afternoon, was mistakenly sunk by an American [[PT boat]] that night. The US Army's [[172nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|172nd Infantry Regiment]] landed at Rendova Harbor while Companies A and B of the [[169th Infantry Regiment (United States)|169th Infantry Regiment]] along with a New Zealand-trained and led commando unit of 130 South Pacific islanders took three vitally placed islets in Blanche Channel.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 54\u201357</ref><ref>Larsen, ''Pacific Commandos'', pp. 9 & 108</ref>  These were to provide staging areas for the main event, the siege of Munda.<ref>Miller,  ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, the Americans were ready to make a landing in the Munda area. Laiana beach was closest, being only {{convert|2|miles|km}} from Munda, but as it was heavily defended, it was rejected in favor of Zanana beach, more than {{convert|3|miles|km}} farther east. Zanana would prove to be an unfortunate choice from an Allied perspective.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 92, footnote 27</ref><ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 177</ref>\n\n===Landings in Kula Gulf===\n[[File:LiversedgeNewGeorgia.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant Colonel Harry B. Liversedge on New Georgia.]]\n\nHalsey's counterparts at Rabaul, Vice Admiral [[Jinichi Kusaka]] and Lieutenant General [[Hitoshi Imamura]], had no intention of allowing New Georgia to fall the way Guadalcanal had. They loaded 4,000 troops on destroyers, brought them down The Slot on the night of 4\u20135 July and landed them at Vila on the southeast coast of Kolombangara Island.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 156</ref> From there, the men would be ferried across Kula Gulf on barges to Bairoko on the northwest coast of New Georgia, from where they would follow the eight-mile jungle trail to Munda.<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', Map p. 100 & pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nThe Allies also carried out an amphibious operation in Kula Gulf that night. Admiral Halsey had dispatched transports carrying 4,600 troops (consisting of elements of the 1st Marine Raider Regiment and two US Army battalions from the [[145th Infantry Regiment (United States)|145th]] and [[148th Infantry Regiment (United States)|148th Infantry Regiments]])<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabual'', pp. 119\u2013121</ref> under Colonel Liversedge to Rice Anchorage on the northwest coast of New Georgia. Covering these troopships was a force of three light cruisers and four destroyers commanded by Rear Admiral [[Walden L. Ainsworth]]. One of Ainsworth's destroyers, the ''Strong'', was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese as the latter were retiring up the Gulf from their reinforcement mission to Vila.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 156\u2013158</ref>\n\nLiversedge's men were tasked with moving down the coast and capturing Bairoko, thereby interdicting the trailhead used by the Japanese to reinforce Munda. They were successfully landed at dawn, but were only able to advance {{convert|5|mi|km|sp=us}} through the heavy jungle the first day.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 157</ref> After three days, they had covered {{convert|7|mi|km|sp=us}}.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 176</ref>\n\nThe night (5\u20136 July) after the Kula Gulf landings, the opposing naval forces engaged in a full-scale battle in the waters northeast of Kolombangara Island, an action that came to be called the [[Battle of Kula Gulf]]. The Americans lost the light cruiser ''Helena'' while the Japanese lost two destroyers, ''Niizuki'' and ''Nagatsuki'', as well as Rear Admiral [[Teruo Akiyama]].<ref>Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 99</ref><ref>Prados, ''Combined Fleet Decoded'', p. 491</ref> In the north, after advancing from Rice Anchorage, US forces occupied Triri on 7\u20138 July. A 400-strong Japanese force launched a counterattack on 8 July against Triri, which initially made some gains before it was checked by a flanking move. Following this, US troops [[Battle of Enogai|captured Enogai]] at the mouth of the inlet on 10\u201311 July, before moving to establish a block along the Munda\u2013Bairoko trail.<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabaul'', pp. 123\u2013130</ref>\n\n===Debacle at Munda===\n[[File:Drive toward Munda Point.jpg|thumb|right|Initial drive towards Munda]]\n\nThe US Army troops' [[Drive on Munda Point|advance from Zanana to Munda]] was completely stymied, hampered by difficult terrain, supply problems and low morale.<ref>Miller,  ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', pp. 106\u2013115</ref> General Hester tried to break the stalemate by sending the 172nd Infantry Regiment around to the north to take the Japanese position in the rear, while the 169th Infantry Regiment continued the frontal assault. Historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] had this to say about the decision:\n\n{{quote|This was perhaps the worst blunder in the most unintelligently waged land campaign of the Pacific war (with the possible exception of Okinawa). Laiana should have been chosen as the initial beachhead; if it was now required, the 172nd should have been withdrawn from Zanana and landed at Laiana under naval gunfire and air support. Or Hester might have made the landing with his reserves then waiting at Rendova. As it was, General Sasaki interpreted the move correctly and by nightfall had brought both advances to a standstill.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 177</ref>}}\n\nThe American ground troops on New Georgia were thus halted in both the north and the south. The Japanese brought reinforcements over by barge from Vila to Bairoko, and 1,200 more troops were  loaded onto four [[High-speed transport |destroyer-transports]] at Rabaul and sent down to be landed at Vila on the night of 12\u201313 July. These ships were escorted by a light cruiser and five destroyers. Admiral Ainsworth was sent to intercept this flotilla with three light cruisers and ten destroyers. He encountered the Japanese force in The Slot in the waters north of Kolombangara Island. The ensuing [[Battle of Kolombangara]] resulted in the sinking of the American destroyer ''Gwin'', the Japanese light cruiser ''Jintsu'', and the death of Rear Admiral [[Shunji Isaki]].<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 180\u2013182</ref>\n\n===Changes in command and the capture of Munda===\n[[File:Capture of Munda Point.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Siege and capture of Munda]]\n{{main article|Battle of Munda Point}}\n\nMajor General [[Oscar Griswold|Oscar W. Griswold]], commander XIV Army Corps and General Hester's immediate superior, visited New Georgia to assess the situation and determined that it was indeed dire. He radioed that at least another division was needed to break the stalemate. At Noum\u00e9a, Admiral Halsey had had no conception of how bad things were.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 198</ref> He sent Lieutenant General [[Millard F. Harmon]], of the [[United States Army Air Forces]], to the front to straighten the matter out. Harmon thoroughly investigated the situation on New Georgia and gave field command to Griswold so that Hester could concentrate on leading his own division. At the same time, a long-anticipated change in naval command took place with Rear Admiral [[Theodore Stark Wilkinson]] taking over leadership of the amphibious forces from Admiral Turner on 15 July.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 77</ref>\n\nGeneral Sasaki took advantage of the disorder on the American side. Samuel Eliot Morison described it this way:\n\n{{quote|Darkness came to the jungle like the click of a camera shutter. Then the Japanese crept close to the American lines. They attacked with bloodcurdling screams, plastered bivouacs with artillery and mortar barrages, crawled silently into American foxholes and stabbed or strangled the occupants. Often they cursed loudly in English, rattled their equipment, named the American commanding officers and dared the Americans to fight, reminding them that they were \"not in the Louisiana maneuvers now.\" For sick and hungry soldiers who had fought all day, this unholy shivaree was terrifying. They shot at everything in sight \u2013 fox fire on rotting stumps, land crabs clattering over rocks, even comrades.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 199</ref>}}\n\nThe Japanese learned to apply close assault tactics to American tanks, rendering armor even less effective in the jungle than usual. On the night of 17 July, the Japanese launched a [[New Georgia counterattack|strong counterattack]] and actually succeeded in overrunning the command post of the 43rd Division near Zanana. Eventually, however, Sasaki's troops became sick and exhausted; also, he had lost communications with Rabaul. He ordered a retreat from the Munda area on 3 August. General Griswold had his men sweep around Munda to the northwest and on 5 August plastered the remaining Japanese with artillery fire. That day, the Americans moved unopposed into Munda, finally achieving the campaign's most important goal.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 200\u2013206</ref>\n\n===Capture of Bairoko===\n[[File:Approach to bairoko.jpg|thumb|right|Approach to Bairoko]]\n{{main article|Battle of Bairoko}}\n\nOn the northern front, Colonel Liversedge's Marines consolidated their position around Enogai after 12 July and began patrolling the local area while US Army troops occupied the blocking position. This was subsequently abandoned on 17 July and the soldiers returned to Triri.<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabaul'', pp. 131\u2013133</ref> had been reinforced by 700 Marines from the 4th Raider Battalion and made plans to capture Bairoko village, on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 202</ref> His Army detachment was to attack the village from the southeast while his Marines converged from the northeast, a classic pincer movement. The Japanese defensive positions were so well designed, and had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage;<ref>Shaw & Kane, ''Isolation of Rabaul'', pp. 134\u2013135</ref> as a result, neither force made any progress, and US casualties began to mount. Just before dawn on 22 July, Liversedge called for air strikes to cover his withdrawal. With a view to compensating for failures in land-based air cover following previous such requests, what followed was the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign so far.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 105\u2013108</ref>\n\nOn the night of 1\u20132 August, while patrolling Blackett Strait west of Kolombangara, ''[[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT 109]]'' was cut in two and sunk by destroyer ''Amagiri''. The boat's commander was Lieutenant [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 211</ref>\n\nBeginning 3 August, Liversedge tried again, first establishing a battalion of the 148th Infantry Regiment at a blocking position on the Munda trail. Two days later he relieved these men with a combined Army/Marine force and moved the 148th to a dominant position overlooking the entire area. On 10 August, Liversedge picked up another US battalion and renewed the direct attack on Bairoko. After two more grueling weeks, the Americans entered Bairoko unopposed on 24 August.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 109</ref>\n\n===Securing New Georgia===\n[[File:Clean up new georgia.jpg|thumb|right|Actions in western New Georgia]]\n\nAdmiral Kusaka and General Imamura at Rabaul made a final, disastrous attempt to bring reinforcements to General Sasaki. Under the protection of a single destroyer, 940 troops and 700 naval personnel were loaded aboard three destroyer-transports and sent down under the command of Rear Admiral [[Kaju Sugiura]] to Kolombangara on the night of 6\u20137 August. Admiral Wilkinson, thinking such a movement likely on that night, sent a force of six destroyers under Commander [[Frederick Moosbrugger]] to intercept them.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 118</ref> The American destroyer sailors were jubilant that at last they would be free of the combat doctrine that required them to stick close to the cruisers; on this night, they would be able to apply their own tactics.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 212\u2013213</ref> In the resulting [[Battle of Vella Gulf]], fought in the waters northwest of Kolombangara, the American destroyers took the Japanese completely by surprise. The three ships carrying passengers, ''Arashi'', ''Hagikaze'', and ''Kawakaze'', were torpedoed and sunk, and the escort ship, ''Shigure'', did not linger to search for survivors.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 118\u2013120</ref>\n\nFollowing this major reversal, General Sasaki moved his headquarters to Kolombangara on 8\u20139 August, leaving behind a token force to defend the west coast of New Georgia. His mission now was simply to hold the remaining islands of the New Georgia group as long as possible, giving the Japanese a chance to reinforce the northern Solomons. US Army forces moved along the west coast of New Georgia, wiping out the 200 Japanese remaining in the Zieta area, and capturing the islet of Baanga to silence the enemy artillery there by 20 August. Under the noses of U.S. patrols, the last Japanese troops on New Georgia were moved by barge from Bairoko Harbor over to Kolombangara on the night of 23 August. This marked the end of ground combat on New Georgia.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 121\u2013122</ref>\n\n==Outlying islands==\n\n===Arundel===\nGeneral Sasaki played his delaying role to the hilt. When the US 172nd Infantry Regiment landed on [[Arundel Island]], just west of New Georgia, on 27 August, he allowed them to come ashore unopposed and establish a beachhead. Just as the Americans were feeling the occupation would be easy, Sasaki counterattacked in multiple places, tying the Americans down and forcing them to call for reinforcements. He carried out a particularly determined attack on 15 September, bringing the whole Allied effort on Arundel to a halt, and with far fewer troops than his opponents. General Griswold ordered a full-scale effort, including Marine Corps tanks, to drive the Japanese off the island. After vicious fighting on 17 and 18 September, the Japanese abandoned Arundel for good on the night of 20\u201321 September.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', pp. 124\u2013128</ref>\n\n=== Vella Lavella===\nAdmiral Halsey had earlier seen the wisdom of bypassing the heavily fortified island of Kolombangara and [[Land Battle of Vella Lavella|invading Vella Lavella]] instead, the latter island lying closer to Bougainville and Rabaul and being less well defended. Thus, a month before New Georgia was secured by the Allies, they landed a reconnaissance party on Vella Lavella to gain information about Japanese strength and dispositions as well as about suitable landing sites. These men and their native guides managed to explore the island for a full week, completely avoiding contact with the Japanese. On 31 July, they returned to Guadalcanal with thorough intelligence about the target. The village of [[Barakoma Airfield|Barakoma]] near the island's southeastern tip was selected as the landing place.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 130</ref>\n\nThe invasion force consisted of seven destroyer-transports, three [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]]s, two [[submarine chaser]]s and twelve destroyers under the personal command of Admiral Wilkinson aboard one of the destroyers. Embarked were about 6,500 ground troops led by Major General [[Robert B. McClure]]. Japanese planes attacked multiple Allied bases on the night of 14 August, but completely missed this fleet headed for Vella Lavella. The next morning, disembarkation began at Barakoma.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 135</ref>\n\n[[File:155-mm-gun-4th-defense-battalion-barakoma.jpg|thumb|right|155&nbsp;mm gun at Barakoma]]\n\nThe Japanese high command in Tokyo had already decided that no more troops would be wasted in the central Solomons. Rather than reinforce and defend Vella Lavella, it was to be used merely as a way station for the evacuation of the troops on Kolombangara that had been bypassed by the Allies with this new landing. Horaniu on the northeast coast was selected as a barge staging point and on the night of 17\u201318 August two IJA [[Company (military)|companies]] and an IJN  [[platoon]] were landed there. The covering force of four destroyers was met in The Slot by an American force, also made up of four destroyers under Captain  [[Thomas J. Ryan (admiral)|Thomas J. Ryan]], that had been sent to disrupt the operation. In the ensuing [[Battle off Horaniu]], no ships of either side were lost and the Japanese succeeded in establishing a barge base.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 233\u2013234</ref>\n\nThe Allies decided to squeeze the remaining enemy ground forces on Vella Lavella into a pocket in the northwest corner of the island and wipe them out. The [[3rd Division (New Zealand)|3rd New Zealand Division]], under the command of Major General [[Harold Barrowclough|Harold E. Barrowclough]], was given this assignment. The New Zealanders began their pincer movement on 21 September, but the Japanese resisted so fiercely that it took until 5\u20136 October to bottle them up.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 141</ref>\n\nOn the night of 6\u20137 October, Rear Admiral [[Matsuji Ijuin]] led a force consisting of three destroyer-transports and twelve small craft to take the 600 remaining ground troops off Vella Lavella. Ijuin personally commanded a group of six destroyers sent to cover the operation from American naval interference. Admiral Wilkinson hurriedly rerouted two groups of three destroyers each to attempt to disrupt the evacuation. Only the first group, under the command of Captain Frank R. Walker, arrived in time to engage in combat. In the resulting [[Naval Battle of Vella Lavella|naval battle]], the US destroyer ''Chevalier'' and the Japanese destroyer ''Yugumo'' were lost. Ijuin succeeded in keeping the American ships from interfering in the evacuation.<ref>Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 243\u2013250</ref> As a result, General Barrowclough's men entered the evacuated area unopposed. The New Georgia campaign was complete.<ref>Horton, ''New Georgia: Pattern for Victory'', p. 141</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties during the campaign amounted to 1,195 US servicemen killed and 93 aircraft destroyed, while the Japanese lost 1,671 killed, and 358 aircraft destroyed.<ref name=Altobello354>Altobello, ''Into the Shadows Furious'', p. 354.</ref> The next stage of the Allied advance through the Solomons saw them [[Landings at Cape Torokina|land at Cape Torokina]] as part of efforts to [[Bougainville campaign|secure Bougainville]] beginning in November; this campaign would last until the end of the war with Australian troops relieving US troops in late 1944.

At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team.  When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation.

The amount of increase each school district received was determined by then Governor [[Edward Rendell]] and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt?open=512&objID=4571&mode=2 |title=Pennsylvania Budget Proposal |author=Office of Budget |date=February 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''In the 2009-2010 budget year''', the [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] provided a 5.94% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $2,743,481 to Loyalsock Township School District.

These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, Loyalsock Township School District applied for and received $103,921 in addition to all other state and federal funding.

Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.  For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/referendum_exceptions/7456 Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.]</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the Loyalsock Township School District 2006-2007 through 2010-2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AqCAjQ6eteArdFFCaWRjMUhzSkl5RTYxMjNJN1RQemc&hl=en#gid=0 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006-2007 through 2011-2012 |author= Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* 2006-07 - 3.9%, Base 3.9%\n* 2007-08 - 3.4%, Base 3.4%\n* 2008-09 - 5.1%, Base 4.4%\n* 2009-10 - 4.8%, Base 4.1%\n{{col-2-of-2}}\n* 2010-11 - 3.4%, Base 2.9%\n* 2011-12 - 1.7%, Base 1.4%\n* 2012-13 - 2.0%, Base 1.7% <ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvscmN--D7LbdDRZbGNnbGNZeTFKZy0xT01mYm9tbXc&hl=en_US#gid=0 |title=SSAct1 Adjusted Index History 2006-07 thru 2012-1213 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 4, 2011}}</ref>\n* 2013-14 - 2.1%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012</ref>\n*2014-15 - 2.5%, Base 2.1% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2014-2015 School District Adjusted Index, September 2013</ref>\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''For the 2014-15 budget year''', Loyalsock Township School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed their Act 1 Index limit.

At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team.  When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation.

He also took a [[Sumatra]]n Malay [[Dharmasraya]] princess named [[Dara Petak]] as his wife.\n\nThe new kingdom faced challenges. Some of Kertarajasa's most trusted men, including [[Ranggalawe]], Sora, and Nambi were rebelled against him, though unsuccessfully.

The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city. With the help of [[Gajah Mada]] and his ''Bhayangkara'' palace guard,<ref name=Coedes/>{{rp|233}} Jayanegara barely escaped from the capital and safely hid in Badander village. While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti's rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.\n\nAfter Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation.

After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach.

However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities.

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades.

In this age, even to the 17th century, the Nusantaran soldiers fought on a platform called ''Balai'' and performed boarding actions.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins.

He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples).

The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

This region is ruled by provincial kings called ''Paduka Bhattara'' with the title ''Bhre''. This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.\n\nDuring the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350\u20131389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"80%\"\n! width=\"260\" |Provinces\n! width=\"120\" |Titles\n! width=\"140\" |Rulers\n! width=\"260\" |Relation to the King\n|-\n|[[Kahuripan]] (or [[Janggala]], today [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]])\n|Bhre Kahuripan\n|Tribhuwanatunggadewi\n|queen mother\n|-\n|Daha (former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]])\n|Bhre Daha\n|Rajadewi Maharajasa\n|aunt and also mother-in-law\n|-\n|Tumapel (former capital of [[Singhasari]])\n|Bhre Tumapel\n|Kertawardhana\n|father\n|-\n|Wengker (today [[Ponorogo]])\n|Bhre Wengker\n|Wijayarajasa\n|uncle and also father-in-law\n|-\n|Matahun (today [[Bojonegoro]])\n|Bhre Matahun\n|Rajasawardhana\n|husband of the duchess of Lasem, king's cousin\n|-\n|Wirabhumi ([[Blambangan]])\n|Bhre Wirabhumi\n|Bhre Wirabhumi{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=Bhre Wirabhumi is actually the title: the Duke of Wirabhumi (Blambangan), the real name is unknown.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor entity \u2013 [[Singhasari]] kingdom, in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition (1275-1293) to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. \n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adityawarman]], a senior minister of Majapahit depicted as Bhairava. He established the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] in Central Sumatra.]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\n[[File:Cast Chinese coins (330 B.C. - 1912 A.D.).jpg|thumb|right|On center bottom row (no. 8) is a Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 T\u014dng-B\u01ceo (\u6c38\u6a02\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin cast under the [[Yongle Emperor|Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 Emperor]] (\u6c38\u6a02\u5e1d) of Ming dynasty. These were cast in great quantities and used by Ashikaga Shogunate, the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom, as well as Majapahit Empire where these coins are still commonly dug up today.]]\nMajapahit true rival for domination however, was the powerful [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Chinese]]. After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\nMajapahit ultimate nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestigue of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities. Its capital was inhabited by a cosmopolitan population among whom literature and art flourished.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nNumbers of local legends and [[folklore]]s in the region had mentioned about the Majapahit kingdom. Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350. The chronicle described that the Majapahit invasion was a punishment for Sultan Ahmad Malik Az-Zahir's crime on ruining a royal marriage between Pasai Prince Tun Abdul Jalil and Raden Galuh Gemerencang, a Majapahit princess \u2013 that led to the death of the royal couple.<ref name=\"Tirto-Pasai\"/> \n[[File:Masjid Menara Kudus.jpg|thumb|left|The Majapahit style minaret of Kudus Mosque.]]\nIn West Sumatra, the [[Minangkabau (legend)|legend of Minangkabau]] mentioned an invading foreign prince \u2013 associated with Javanese Majapahit kingdom \u2013 being defeated in a buffalo fight.<ref name=\"Sindo-Minangkabau\"/> In West Java, the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] tragedy caused a myth to revolve around Indonesians, which forbids marriage between a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and a [[Javanese people|Javanese]], as it would be unsustainable and only bring misery to the couple.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tragedi Perang Bubat dan mitos orang jawa dilarang kawin dengan sunda | date = 24 April 2015 | author = Hery H Winarno | url = https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/tragedi-perang-bubat-mitos-orang-jawa-dilarang-kawin-dengan-sunda.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> In Malay peninsula, the [[Malay annals]] mentioned the legend of the fall of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] to Majapahit forces in 1398 was due to the betrayal of Sang Rajuna Tapa that opened the fortified city gate.<ref>{{harvnb|A.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java. The descriptions of the architecture of the capital's pavilions (''[[pendopo]]'') in the ''Nagarakretagama'' evoke the Javanese [[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]] also the [[Pura (Balinese temple)|Balinese temples]] and palace compounds of today. The Majapahit architectural style that often employs [[Majapahit Terracotta|terracotta]] and [[red brick]] heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of [[Airlangga]] to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and [[History of Bali|history]].<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/history Lonely Planet: History of Bali]</ref> The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand. Although it has been suggested that the keris, and native daggers similar to it, predate Majapahit, nevertheless the empire expansion contributed to its popularity and diffusion in the region around the year 1492.<ref name=\"JPostKris\">{{cite news|title=Kris, more than just a simple dagger |author=Tantri Yuliandini |date=18 April 2002 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |accessdate=30 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203644/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 }}</ref> For example, [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to 1264 Saka (which correspondends to 1342). The Malay legend of Kris [[Taming Sari]] is also attributed to Majapahit origin.\n\nFor Indonesians in later centuries, Majapahit became a symbol of past greatness.

The Indonesian national flag \"[[Flag of Indonesia|Sang Merah Putih]]\" (\"Red and White\") or sometimes called \"Dwiwarna\" (\"The bicolor\"), derived from the Majapahit royal colour. The Indonesian Navy flag of red and white stripes also has a Majapahit origin. The Indonesian national motto, \"''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]''\", is a quotation from an [[Old Javanese]] poem \"''Kakawin Sutasoma''\", written by a Majapahit poet, Mpu Tantular.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1256649489/bhinekatunggalikakaryagemilangmputantular |title=Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, masterpiece of Mpu Tantular, Antara (in Indonesian) |access-date=17 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008024249/http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1256649489/bhinekatunggalikakaryagemilangmputantular |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nThe Indonesian coat of arms, ''[[Coat of arms of Indonesia|Garuda Pancasila]]'', also derives from [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Javanese Hindu elements]].

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the ''jong''.\n# On the ''Rise of the Rajas'' expansion pack from ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', [[Gajah Mada]] appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gosari inscription]]\n* [[Kidung Sunda]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Osing people|Osing]]\n* [[Srivijaya]]\n* [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]\n* [[Hinduism in Indonesia]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist | group=lower-roman | close}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=miksic>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9813018267\n| series    = Indonesian Heritage Series\n| title     = Ancient History\n| publisher = Archipelago Press / Editions Didier Millet\n| year      = 1999\n| editor    = John Miksic\n| volume    = Vol 1\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=ricklefs>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780804721950\n| last      = Ricklefs\n| first     = Merle Calvin\n| title     = A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300\n| year      = 1993\n| publisher = Stanford University Press / Macmillans\n| edition   = 2nd\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=yingyai>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780521010320\n| author    = Ma Huan\n| title     = [[Yingya Shenglan|Ying-yai Sheng-lan]] (\u701b\u6daf\u80dc\u89c8) The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\n| others    = translated by J.V.G Mills\n| language  = Chinese\n| origyear  = 1433\n| year      = 1970\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| series    = [[Hakluyt Society]]\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Majapahit}}\n{{div col}}\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/trowulan/history/history.html A Short History of Majapahit]\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/ Memoirs of Majapahit Kingdom]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/network.indonesia/ni4001c6.htm A brief history of Majapahit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120125090000/http://sejarahnasional.org/index.php/kerajaan-nusantara/1-terjemahan-manuskrip-nagarakertagama A Complete Transcription of Majapahit Royal Manuscript of Nagarakertagama from SejarahNasional.org an National History Website]\n{{col div end}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n{{Asia in topic|Hinduism in}}\n{{Empires}}\n{{Coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:1527 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1293]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1527]]\n[[Category:Historical Hindu empires]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:1293 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Malaysian history]]\n[[Category:Majapahit]]\n[[Category:Former empires in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Indonesian history]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:Indianized kingdoms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Empire based on the island of Java from 1293 to around 1500}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Majapahit Empire\n|common_name            = Majapahit Empire\n|native_name            = \ua9a4\ua992\ua9ab\ua9b6\ua98f\ua9ab\ua997\ua9a4\ua9c0\ua9a9\ua997\ua9a5\ua9bb\ua9a0\ua9c0 {{small|([[Bahasa Jawa|Jawa]])}}<br>\u1b27\u1b44\u1b2d\u1b1a\u1b2b\u1b1a\u1b27\u1b33\u1b36\u1b22\u1b44 {{small|([[Basa Bali|Bali]])}}<br>''\u1b8a\u1b9b\u1b8f\u1b83\u1b94\u1baa\u1b99\u1b8f\u1b95\u1ba0\u1ba4\u1b92\u1baa'' {{small|([[Bahasa Sunda|Sunda]])}}\n|religion               = [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Kebatinan|Kejawen]], [[Animism]]\n|p1                     = Singhasari\n|s1                     = Demak Sultanate\n|s2                     = Bali Kingdom\n|year_start             = 1293\n|year_end               = 1527\n|date_start             = 10 November<ref name=\"NGI Trowulan\">{{cite web|title = 10 November, Hari Berdirinya Majapahit | author = Mahandis Y.

He also took a [[Sumatra]]n Malay [[Dharmasraya]] princess named [[Dara Petak]] as his wife.\n\nThe new kingdom faced challenges. Some of Kertarajasa's most trusted men, including [[Ranggalawe]], Sora, and Nambi were rebelled against him, though unsuccessfully.

The reign of Jayanegara was a difficult and chaotic one, troubled with several rebellions by his father's former companions in arms. Among others are Gajah Biru's rebellion in 1314 and the Kuti rebellion in 1319. The Kuti rebellion was the most dangerous one, as Kuti managed to take control of the capital city. With the help of [[Gajah Mada]] and his ''Bhayangkara'' palace guard,<ref name=Coedes/>{{rp|233}} Jayanegara barely escaped from the capital and safely hid in Badander village. While the king was in hiding, Gajah Mada returned to the capital city to assess the situation. After learning that Kuti's rebellion was not supported by the people or nobles of Majapahit court, Gajah Mada raised resistance forces to crush the Kuti rebellion.\n\nAfter Kuti forces were defeated, Jayanegara was safely returned to his throne.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife. However, according to the Balinese manuscript ''[[Babad Dalem]]'', the assassination was a stratagem crafted by Gajah Mada himself in order to rid the kingdom of an evil tyrant.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\">{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/gajah-mada-dan-kontroversi-dalang-pembunuhan-raja-majapahit-cCRR|title=Gajah Mada dan Kontroversi Dalang Pembunuhan Raja Majapahit|last=Raditya|first=Iswara |website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=29 July 2019}}</ref> Tradition mentions that the immoral, cruel and abusive king often seduced and abused women, even the wives of his own subordinates.<ref>{{cite news | title = Goda Istri Orang, Raja Jayanegara Dibunuh Tabib (Bagian-2) | author = Bahari | date = 12 September 2015 | work = Sindo | language = Indonesian | url = https://daerah.sindonews.com/read/1043588/29/goda-istri-orang-raja-jayanegara-dibunuh-tabib-bagian-2-1441971107/13}}</ref> Other possible reason includes to protect the two princesses \u2013 Gitarja and Rajadewi, the daughters of Gayatri Rajapatni from the king's cruelty.<ref name=\"Tirto-Gajah Mada\"/> Since the slain king was childless, he left no successor.\n\n===Golden age===\n\n====Queen Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi====\n[[File:Parvati Majapahit 2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The statue of [[Parvati]] as mortuary deified portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwanottunggadewi]], queen of Majapahit, mother of [[Hayam Wuruk]].]] \nJayanegara's stepmother, Gayatri Rajapatni \u2013 the most revered matriarch of the court \u2013 was supposed to take the helm.

After seven months of battles, Majapahit forces defeated the Balinese king and captured the Balinese capital of Bedulu in 1343. After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses. Through this campaign, Majapahit planted a vassal dynasty that would rule the [[Bali Kingdom]] in the following centuries. Tribhuwana ruled Majapahit until the death of her mother in 1350.

The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\n====Queen Suhita====\n[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]\nWikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.<ref>Claire Holt. ''Art in Indonesia: Continuities and Change''. Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1967, p. 276.</ref>\n\nIn 1447, Suhita died and was succeeded by [[Kertawijaya]], her brother.<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} He ruled until 1451. After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.\n\n[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.\n\nDuring this period of Majapahit's retreat to the inland [[Kediri|Daha]] and war in Java, [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.<ref name=\":3\" />{{rp|154\u2013155}}\n\n====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====\n[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]\nIn 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]]. The delicate balance between Demak and Daha ended when Udara, seeing an opportunity to eliminate Demak, asked for [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese]] help in Malacca, forcing Demak to attack both Malacca and Daha under [[Demak Sultanate#Adipati Yunus|Adipati Yunus]] to end this alliance.{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1= V.<ref>MB.

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades. Aristocrats are deeply influenced by Indian culture, usually armed with swords and spears, dressed in white.<ref name=\":0\">Song Lian.

In this age, even to the 17th century, the Nusantaran soldiers fought on a platform called ''Balai'' and performed boarding actions.

The Javanese lords are so noble and exalted that there is no nation to compare with them over a wide area in these parts.

There is no paper or pen, they use ''Chiao-chang'' (''kajang'') or palm leaf (''[[Palm-leaf manuscript#Javanese and Balinese|lontar]]''), written by scraping it with a sharp knife.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

''Mang-chi-shi'' \u2013 is something like a pomegranate, peel it like an orange, it has four lumps of white flesh, sweet and sour taste and very delicious. ''Lang-ch\u2019a'' is a fruit similar to Loquat, but larger, contained three blocky white flesh with sweet and sour taste.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes.

The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Since early of its formation, Majapahit inherited the foreign outlook of its predecessor entity \u2013 [[Singhasari]] kingdom, in which its last king [[Kertanegara]] projected his influence abroad by launching [[Pamalayu]] expedition (1275-1293) to incorporate Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula within Javanese sphere of influence. Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest.\n\nDuring its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. \n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adityawarman]], a senior minister of Majapahit depicted as Bhairava. He established the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] in Central Sumatra.]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\n[[File:Cast Chinese coins (330 B.C. - 1912 A.D.).jpg|thumb|right|On center bottom row (no. 8) is a Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 T\u014dng-B\u01ceo (\u6c38\u6a02\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin cast under the [[Yongle Emperor|Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 Emperor]] (\u6c38\u6a02\u5e1d) of Ming dynasty. These were cast in great quantities and used by Ashikaga Shogunate, the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom, as well as Majapahit Empire where these coins are still commonly dug up today.]]\nMajapahit true rival for domination however, was the powerful [[Ming Dynasty|Ming Chinese]]. After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore. \n\nMajapahit ultimate nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestigue of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java.

The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy.

The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand.

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit.

The [[principality]] became part of the scattered holdings of the [[house of Orange-Nassau]] from the time that [[William the Silent]] inherited the title of [[Prince of Orange]] from his [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon|cousin]] in 1544, until it was finally ceded to [[France]] in 1713 under the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]].  Although permanently lost by the Nassaus then, this fief gave its name to the extant [[House of Orange|Royal House of the Netherlands]]. The area of the principality was approximately {{Convert|12|mi}} long by {{Convert|9|mi}} wide, or {{Convert|108|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite book\n  | author=George Ripley And Charles A.

Appleton And Company\n  | year =1873\n  | location =article on Principality of Orange}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Carolingian counts of Orange had their origin in the 8th century, and the fief passed into the family of the [[lords of Baux]]. The Baux counts of Orange became fully independent with the breakup of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] after 1033. In 1163 Orange was raised to a principality, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 1365, Orange university was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] when he was in [[Arles]] for his coronation as [[king of Arles]].\n[[File:Oranje1547.png|thumb|left|Orange within papal [[Comtat Venaissin]] as of 1547]]\nIn 1431 the Count of Provence waived taxation duties for Orange's rulers ([[Mary of Baux-Orange]] and [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Ch\u00e2lons]] of Burgundy) in exchange for liquid assets to be used for a ransom. The town and principality of Orange was a part of administration and province of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nIn 1544, [[William the Silent]], count of [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], with large properties in the Netherlands, inherited the principality. William, 11 years old at the time, was the cousin of [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon]] who died without an heir when he was shot at St. Dizier in 1544 during the Franco-Imperial wars.  Ren\u00e9, it turned out, willed his entire fortune to this very young relative. Among those titles and estates was the Principality of Orange.  Ren\u00e9's mother, Claudia, had held the title prior to it being passed to young William since Philibert de Ch\u00e2lon was her brother.\n\nWhen William inherited the Principality, it was incorporated into the holdings of what became the [[House of Orange]]. This pitched it into the [[Protestant]] side in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], during which the town was badly damaged. In 1568 the [[Eighty Years' War]] began with William as [[Stadtholder]] of Holland leading the bid for independence of the Netherlands from Spain. William the Silent was assassinated in [[Delft]] in 1584. It was his son, [[Maurice of Nassau]] (Prince of Orange after his elder brother died in 1618), with the help of [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who solidified the independence of the Dutch republic.\n\nAs an independent enclave within France, Orange became an attractive destination for Protestants and a [[Huguenot]] stronghold. William III of Orange, who ruled England as [[William III of England]], was the last Prince of Orange to rule the principality. The principality was captured by the forces of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under Fran\u00e7ois Adh\u00e9mar de Monteil [[Comte de Grignan]], in 1672 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]], and again in August 1682, but William did not concede his claim to rule.  In 1702, William III died childless and the right to the principality became a matter of dispute between [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz]], who both claimed the title 'Prince of Orange'.  In 1702 also, Louis XIV of France enfeoffed [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]], a relative of the Ch\u00e2lon dynasty, with the Principality of Orange, so that there were three claimants to the title.\n\nFinally in 1713 in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], Frederick I of Prussia ceded the Principality to France (without surrendering the princely title) in which cession the Holy Roman Empire as suzerain concurred, though John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, the other claimant to the principality, did not concur. Only in 1732, with the [[Treaty of Partage]], did John William Friso's successor [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], renounce all his claims to the territory, but again (like Frederick I) he did not renounce his claim to the title. In the same treaty an agreement was made between both claimants, stipulating that both houses be allowed to use the title.\n\nIn 1713, after Orange was officially ceded to France, it became a part of the Province of the [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, Orange was absorbed into the French ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Dr\u00f4me]] in 1790, then [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], then finally [[Vaucluse]].\n\nIn 1814 after the defeat of Napoleon, the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] was not revived but replaced into the [[Kingdom of the United Netherlands]], under a King of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].

The castle and fortress sat on an outcropping of rock from the '''[[:fr:Colline Saint-Eutrope|Colline Saint-Eutrope]]''' with the town below.  The natural defense provided by the escarpment allowed the princes to control all the approaches to Orange and the surrounding countryside, including the passage up and down the Rhone, and the approaches from the Mediterranean.  It also made the fortress impervious to the military technology of the time until Louis XIV overwhelmed it with his armies in 1672.\n\n[[File:Chateau and city of Orange 17th century.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Chateau of the Princes of Orange and city of Orange 17th century]]\n\n:''\u00ab Du sommet de la colline, s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 une centaine de m\u00e8tres au-dessus de la plaine, et dominant la Ville d\u2019Orange, la vue embrasse l\u2019admirable paysage du Comtat jusqu\u2019au-del\u00e0 d\u2019Avignon, et des C\u00e9vennes au mont Ventoux.\n:''Enfin ses flancs plant\u00e9s d\u2019arbres forment un d\u00e9cor grandiose aux imposants vestiges romains, constituant dans leur ensemble un site dont la protection et la conservation s\u2019imposent au premier chef<ref>Extrait du rapport de la Commission sup\u00e9rieure des sites, mars 1933 (dossier Minist\u00e8re).</ref>. \u00bb''\n\n=== The Ch\u00e2teau ===\nIn the 12th century, [[:fr:Tiburge d'Orange|Tiburge d\u2019Orange]], daughter [[:fr:Raimbaud II d'Orange|Count Raimbaud of Nice]], \nrebuilt the Roman walls of the town and rehabilitated the ancient \"castrum Aurasice\". In the 14th century, the Les Baux princes of Orange consolidated the donjon and rampart of the chateau in order to resist the assaults the \"grandes compagnies\" that were devastating Provence at the time.  The population of the town was concentrated around the fortress in an area much smaller than the ancient Roman town.  Prince [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Chalon]] added three wings to the dungeon in the last years of the century, which gave it a square shape.\n\n=== The Citadel of the Princes ===\n[[File:ORANGE - Military Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the military fortifications of the city and chateau of Orange built by [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice]].]]\n\nBy the 17th century, the chateau had suffered damage due to the [[French Wars of Religion]].  Much of the essential defenses were in need of complete rebuilding.  The incumbent prince of Orange, the celebrated general [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], executed a plan by by the architect Servole to build a fortress incorporating the modern science of fortification he had pioneered in his wars in the Netherlands.  The fortress was composed of three parts:  the 14th century castle, the curtain wall, and the \"Vignasse\", an esplanade, says Joseph of Pisa, capable of containing 10,000 men at arms.  The entire complex and the city were surrounded by moats and [[Bastion fort]] walls to protect against cannon fire similar to the fortifications of towns in the Netherlands.\n\n\n[[File:Vestige de l'ancien ch\u00e2teau de Maurice de Nassau.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Vestiges of the ch\u00e2teau of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice]]. ]]\n\nWhen completed, the citadel consisted of 11 bastions connected by curtain walls and ditches. It was built with walls of extraordinary thickness extending over the whole hill.   It was heavily fortified and garrisoned. In 1672, in reprisal for the young [[William III]], prince of Orange and \"stadtholder\" of Holland defending the interests of his nation and of the Protestant religion, Louis XIV instructed the count of Grignan to lay siege to the citadel and to destroy it. It was necessary to use gunpowder to demolish the enormous walls of which one can see today some vestiges on the hill. In 1991, an excavation was carried out to study this architectural and military features<ref>Guide historique Orange ville d'art et d'histoire</ref>.\n\n\n\n==Later uses==\n{{norefs|section|date = May 2019}}\n[[File:DirkvdM koninginnedag 3.jpg|thumb|People dressed in [[Orange (colour)|orange]] in [[Amsterdam]] during Queen's Day in 2007]]\nDue to its connection with the Dutch royal family, Orange gave its name to other Dutch-influenced parts of the world, such as the [[Orange River]] and the [[Orange Free State]] in [[South Africa]], and [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] in the U.S. state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The town of [[Orange, Connecticut]] is named after the principality.\n\nThe orange portion of the [[flag of Ireland]], invented in 1848, represents Irish Protestants, who were grateful for their rescue by [[William III of England]] (\"William of Orange\") in 1689\u20131691.  The [[flag of South Africa]] from 1928 to 1994 had an orange upper stripe and was very similar to the old [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]], also called [[Prince's Flag]], because it was inspired by the history of the [[Afrikaners]], who are chiefly of Dutch descent.\n\nThe [[flag of New York City]] and the [[Coat of arms of Albany, New York|flag of Albany, New York]] (which was originally known as Fort Orange) also each have an orange stripe to reflect the Dutch origins of those cities. In turn, orange is included in the team colors of the [[New York Mets]], the [[New York Knicks]], and the [[New York Islanders]]. It is also a team color of the [[San Francisco Giants]], which was a New York team until 1957.\n\nThe color orange is still the [[national colors|national color]] of the modern [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]] originally had an orange stripe instead of a red, and today an orange pennant is still flown above the flag on [[Koningsdag]].  Dutch national sports teams usually compete in orange, and a wide variety of orange-colored items are displayed by Dutch people on occasions of national pride or festivity.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Prince of Orange]]\n* [[Orange (word)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|44.14|4.81|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Orange, Principality of}}\n[[Category:1713 disestablishments in France]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1163]]\n[[Category:Principalities of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Orange, Vaucluse|Principality of Orange]]\n[[Category:1713 in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Feudal state in what is now France}}\n{{Redirect|County of Orange||Orange County (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name = ''Principaut\u00e9 d'Orange''\n|conventional_long_name = Principality of Orange\n|common_name = Orange\n|\n|era       = \n|status    = [[Vassal state]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|status_text= \n|empire    = \n|government_type    = Feudal Monarchy\n|\n|event_start = Principality status granted \n|year_start  = 1163\n|date_start  = \n|event_end   = Ceded to France by the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]]\n|year_end    = 1713\n|date_end    =  \n| \n|event1      = \n|date_event1 = \n|event2      = \n|date_event2 = \n|event3      = \n|date_event3 = \n|event_pre   = \n|date_pre    = \n|\n|p1          = Kingdom of Arles\n|flag_p1     = \n|s1          = Kingdom of France\n|flag_s1     = Royal Standard of the King of France.svg\n|\n|flag        = \n|flag_type   = \n|image_flag  = \n|symbol       = \n|symbol_type  = \n|image_coat   = Arms of the Principality of Orange.svg\n|image_map    = Principality of Orange (1633).png\n|image_map_caption = Map of the Principality of Orange (with south at the top)\n|capital          = [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]]\n|national_motto   = \n|national_anthem  = \n|common_languages = [[French language|French]]\n|religion         =  \n|currency         = \n|\n|<!--- Titles and names of the first and last leaders and their deputies --->\n|leader1      = [[Bertrand I of Baux]] (first)\n|year_leader1 = 1171\u20131185\n|leader2      = [[William III of England|William III of Orange and England]] (last)\n|year_leader2 = 1650\u20131702\n|title_leader = [[Prince of Orange]]\n|\n|area_sq_mi               = 108\n|footnotes  = \n}}\nThe '''Principality of Orange''' ({{lang-fr|la Principaut\u00e9 d'Orange}}) was, from 1163 to 1713, a feudal state in [[Provence]], in the south of modern-day [[France]], on the east bank of the river [[Rhone]], north of the city of [[Avignon]], and surrounded by the independent papal state of [[Comtat Venaissin]].\n\nIt was constituted in 1163, when [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] elevated the [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundian]] '''County of Orange''' (consisting of the [[Orange, Vaucluse|city of Orange]] and the land surrounding it) to a [[imperial immediacy|sovereign]] principality within the Empire.  The [[principality]] became part of the scattered holdings of the [[house of Orange-Nassau]] from the time that [[William the Silent]] inherited the title of [[Prince of Orange]] from his [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon|cousin]] in 1544, until it was finally ceded to [[France]] in 1713 under the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]].  Although permanently lost by the Nassaus then, this fief gave its name to the extant [[House of Orange|Royal House of the Netherlands]]. The area of the principality was approximately {{Convert|12|mi}} long by {{Convert|9|mi}} wide, or {{Convert|108|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite book\n  | author=George Ripley And Charles A.

The Baux counts of Orange became fully independent with the breakup of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] after 1033. In 1163 Orange was raised to a principality, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 1365, Orange university was founded by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] when he was in [[Arles]] for his coronation as [[king of Arles]].\n[[File:Oranje1547.png|thumb|left|Orange within papal [[Comtat Venaissin]] as of 1547]]\nIn 1431 the Count of Provence waived taxation duties for Orange's rulers ([[Mary of Baux-Orange]] and [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Ch\u00e2lons]] of Burgundy) in exchange for liquid assets to be used for a ransom. The town and principality of Orange was a part of administration and province of [[Dauphin\u00e9]].\n\nIn 1544, [[William the Silent]], count of [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], with large properties in the Netherlands, inherited the principality. William, 11 years old at the time, was the cousin of [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon]] who died without an heir when he was shot at St. Dizier in 1544 during the Franco-Imperial wars.  Ren\u00e9, it turned out, willed his entire fortune to this very young relative. Among those titles and estates was the Principality of Orange.  Ren\u00e9's mother, Claudia, had held the title prior to it being passed to young William since Philibert de Ch\u00e2lon was her brother.\n\nWhen William inherited the Principality, it was incorporated into the holdings of what became the [[House of Orange]]. This pitched it into the [[Protestant]] side in the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]], during which the town was badly damaged. In 1568 the [[Eighty Years' War]] began with William as [[Stadtholder]] of Holland leading the bid for independence of the Netherlands from Spain. William the Silent was assassinated in [[Delft]] in 1584. It was his son, [[Maurice of Nassau]] (Prince of Orange after his elder brother died in 1618), with the help of [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who solidified the independence of the Dutch republic.\n\nAs an independent enclave within France, Orange became an attractive destination for Protestants and a [[Huguenot]] stronghold. William III of Orange, who ruled England as [[William III of England]], was the last Prince of Orange to rule the principality. The principality was captured by the forces of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] under Fran\u00e7ois Adh\u00e9mar de Monteil [[Comte de Grignan]], in 1672 during the [[Franco-Dutch War]], and again in August 1682, but William did not concede his claim to rule.  In 1702, William III died childless and the right to the principality became a matter of dispute between [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz]], who both claimed the title 'Prince of Orange'.  In 1702 also, Louis XIV of France enfeoffed [[Fran\u00e7ois Louis, Prince of Conti]], a relative of the Ch\u00e2lon dynasty, with the Principality of Orange, so that there were three claimants to the title.\n\nFinally in 1713 in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], Frederick I of Prussia ceded the Principality to France (without surrendering the princely title) in which cession the Holy Roman Empire as suzerain concurred, though John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, the other claimant to the principality, did not concur.

The castle and fortress sat on an outcropping of rock from the '''[[:fr:Colline Saint-Eutrope|Colline Saint-Eutrope]]''' with the town below.  The natural defense provided by the escarpment allowed the princes to control all the approaches to Orange and the surrounding countryside, including the passage up and down the Rhone, and the approaches from the Mediterranean.  It also made the fortress impervious to the military technology of the time until Louis XIV overwhelmed it with his armies in 1672.\n\n[[File:Chateau and city of Orange 17th century.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Chateau of the Princes of Orange and city of Orange 17th century]]\n\n:''\u00ab Du sommet de la colline, s\u2019\u00e9levant \u00e0 une centaine de m\u00e8tres au-dessus de la plaine, et dominant la Ville d\u2019Orange, la vue embrasse l\u2019admirable paysage du Comtat jusqu\u2019au-del\u00e0 d\u2019Avignon, et des C\u00e9vennes au mont Ventoux.\n:''Enfin ses flancs plant\u00e9s d\u2019arbres forment un d\u00e9cor grandiose aux imposants vestiges romains, constituant dans leur ensemble un site dont la protection et la conservation s\u2019imposent au premier chef<ref>Extrait du rapport de la Commission sup\u00e9rieure des sites, mars 1933 (dossier Minist\u00e8re).</ref>. \u00bb''\n\n=== The Ch\u00e2teau ===\nIn the 12th century, [[:fr:Tiburge d'Orange|Tiburge d\u2019Orange]], daughter [[:fr:Raimbaud II d'Orange|Count Raimbaud of Nice]], \nrebuilt the Roman walls of the town and rehabilitated the ancient \"castrum Aurasice\". In the 14th century, the Les Baux princes of Orange consolidated the donjon and rampart of the chateau in order to resist the assaults the \"grandes compagnies\" that were devastating Provence at the time.  The population of the town was concentrated around the fortress in an area much smaller than the ancient Roman town.  Prince [[John III of Chalon-Arlay|Jean de Chalon]] added three wings to the dungeon in the last years of the century, which gave it a square shape.\n\n=== The Citadel of the Princes ===\n[[File:ORANGE - Military Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the military fortifications of the city and chateau of Orange built by [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice]].]]\n\nBy the 17th century, the chateau had suffered damage due to the [[French Wars of Religion]].  Much of the essential defenses were in need of complete rebuilding.  The incumbent prince of Orange, the celebrated general [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], executed a plan by by the architect Servole to build a fortress incorporating the modern science of fortification he had pioneered in his wars in the Netherlands.  The fortress was composed of three parts:  the 14th century castle, the curtain wall, and the \"Vignasse\", an esplanade, says Joseph of Pisa, capable of containing 10,000 men at arms.  The entire complex and the city were surrounded by moats and [[Bastion fort]] walls to protect against cannon fire similar to the fortifications of towns in the Netherlands.\n\n\n[[File:Vestige de l'ancien ch\u00e2teau de Maurice de Nassau.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Vestiges of the ch\u00e2teau of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice]]. ]]\n\nWhen completed, the citadel consisted of 11 bastions connected by curtain walls and ditches. It was built with walls of extraordinary thickness extending over the whole hill.   It was heavily fortified and garrisoned. In 1672, in reprisal for the young [[William III]], prince of Orange and \"stadtholder\" of Holland defending the interests of his nation and of the Protestant religion, Louis XIV instructed the count of Grignan to lay siege to the citadel and to destroy it. It was necessary to use gunpowder to demolish the enormous walls of which one can see today some vestiges on the hill. In 1991, an excavation was carried out to study this architectural and military features<ref>Guide historique Orange ville d'art et d'histoire</ref>.\n\n\n\n==Later uses==\n{{norefs|section|date = May 2019}}\n[[File:DirkvdM koninginnedag 3.jpg|thumb|People dressed in [[Orange (colour)|orange]] in [[Amsterdam]] during Queen's Day in 2007]]\nDue to its connection with the Dutch royal family, Orange gave its name to other Dutch-influenced parts of the world, such as the [[Orange River]] and the [[Orange Free State]] in [[South Africa]], and [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] in the U.S. state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. The town of [[Orange, Connecticut]] is named after the principality.\n\nThe orange portion of the [[flag of Ireland]], invented in 1848, represents Irish Protestants, who were grateful for their rescue by [[William III of England]] (\"William of Orange\") in 1689\u20131691.  The [[flag of South Africa]] from 1928 to 1994 had an orange upper stripe and was very similar to the old [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]], also called [[Prince's Flag]], because it was inspired by the history of the [[Afrikaners]], who are chiefly of Dutch descent.\n\nThe [[flag of New York City]] and the [[Coat of arms of Albany, New York|flag of Albany, New York]] (which was originally known as Fort Orange) also each have an orange stripe to reflect the Dutch origins of those cities. In turn, orange is included in the team colors of the [[New York Mets]], the [[New York Knicks]], and the [[New York Islanders]]. It is also a team color of the [[San Francisco Giants]], which was a New York team until 1957.\n\nThe color orange is still the [[national colors|national color]] of the modern [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]] originally had an orange stripe instead of a red, and today an orange pennant is still flown above the flag on [[Koningsdag]].  Dutch national sports teams usually compete in orange, and a wide variety of orange-colored items are displayed by Dutch people on occasions of national pride or festivity.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Prince of Orange]]\n* [[Orange (word)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord|44.14|4.81|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Orange, Principality of}}\n[[Category:1713 disestablishments in France]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1163]]\n[[Category:Principalities of the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:Orange, Vaucluse|Principality of Orange]]\n[[Category:1713 in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Stray word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Orange"}

The new company's managing director was Mark Howarth who had previously managed [[Western National]], the local [[Badgerline]] (later [[FirstGroup]]) operation, and he was joined by Robin Orbell who had also worked for Badgerline. Within a few weeks R&M Coaches, another local operator, also sold out to Western Greyhound which brought one more vehicle and an office near Newquay bus station.<ref name=Buses661>{{cite journal|last=Millar|first=Alan|title=Mr Cornwall|journal=Buses|volume=62|issue=661|pages=32\u201335|publisher=Ian Allan|date=April 2010|issn=0007-6392}}</ref> This left one other independent bus operator in the town, Pleasure Travel Minicoaches, but this went out of business and the contracts were also taken on by Western Greyhound.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.westerngreyhound.com/history.php|title=Western Greyhound - My Blog|website=www.westerngreyhound.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913055426/http://www.westerngreyhound.com/history.php|archivedate=13 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe company expanded beyond contract and private hire work with its first scheduled services on 14 December 1998. These two routes (592 and 594) were contracts awarded by [[Cornwall Council]] and were operated by three new minibuses. Further contracts were awarded in 2001, and double decker buses were added to the fleet to operate school routes relinquished by [[First South West|First Devon & Cornwall]]. After that many more routes were added to the network including some from [[Plymouth Citybus]] and DAC Coaches in the south east, and Hookways in the north. There were also some new routes, such as Newquay to [[Bodmin]], two towns which had not previously been directly connected by bus (the service has not survived).\n\nThe expanding fleet meant that the company needed a larger depot, and nearby [[Summercourt]] was chosen. Initially the depot was on existing premises, but in 2004 a new depot and offices were built. In the same year the ex-Western National bus station in East Street, Newquay was closed on safety grounds and replaced by a new and larger terminal at nearby Manor Road. This is owned by Cornwall Council but was managed on its behalf by Western Greyhound until 2015. Western Greyhound\u2019s town centre shop was also moved to the Manor Road site where it became the bus station enquiry office.<ref name=History/> The company maintained its bus stops and used satellite tracking to monitor its fleet.<ref name=Buses661/>\n\nIn December 2014, the [[Liskeard]] based operations were sold to [[Plymouth Citybus]] with nine buses,<ref>[http://www.plymouthbus.co.uk/about-us/news/go-cornwall-bus-is-launched Go Cornwall Bus is launched] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316233647/http://www.plymouthbus.co.uk/about-us/news/go-cornwall-bus-is-launched |date=16 March 2015 }} Plymouth Citybus 8 December 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.westerngreyhound.com/latest_news.php Latest News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222004340/http://www.westerngreyhound.com/latest_news.php |date=22 December 2014 }} Western Greyhound 10 December 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.busandcoachbuyer.com/go-cornwall-liskeard/ Go Cornwall in Liskeard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113031612/http://www.busandcoachbuyer.com/go-cornwall-liskeard/ |date=13 January 2015 }} ''Bus & Coach Buyer'' 11 December 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.busandcoach.com/news/articles/go-ahead-takes-western-greyhound-liskeard-routes/ Go-Ahead takes Western Greyhound Liskeard routes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222001543/http://www.busandcoach.com/news/articles/go-ahead-takes-western-greyhound-liskeard-routes/ |date=22 December 2014 }} ''Bus & Coach Professional'' 11 December 2014</ref> while the remainder of the business was sold to Michael Bishop.<ref name=Bishop>[http://www.busandcoachbuyer.com/western-greyhound-deal-safeguards-133-jobs/ Western Greyhound deal safeguards 133 jobs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000602/http://www.busandcoachbuyer.com/western-greyhound-deal-safeguards-133-jobs/ |date=22 December 2014 }} ''Bus & Coach Buyer'' 18 December 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.busandcoach.com/news/articles/bishop-buys-western-greyhound-business/ Bishop buys Western Greyhound business] ''Bus & Coach Professional'' 19 December 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/Troubled-bus-firm-sells-rest-business/story-25717980-detail/story.html Troubled Western Greyhound bus firm sells rest of business] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222005102/http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/Troubled-bus-firm-sells-rest-business/story-25717980-detail/story.html |date=22 December 2014 }} ''[[Cornish Guardian]]'' 19 December 2014</ref>\n\n===Depot fires===\nOn 13 May 2013, a serious fire broke out at the Summercourt depot, the alarm being raised just after 01:00.
