Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the off-season, other than drafting [[James Harden (basketball)|James Harden]] from [[Arizona State University]] with the third overall pick in the [[2009 NBA draft|NBA Draft]]. The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009\u201310 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Orlando Magic]] and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games.\n\n{{multiple image\n | width1 = 144\n | image1 = Russell Westbrook.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Russell Westbrook]]\n | image2 = James Harden 2.jpg\n | width2 = 123\n | caption2 = [[James Harden]]\n | width3 = 93\n | image3 = Kevin Durant 2.jpg\n | caption3 = [[Kevin Durant]]\n | image4 = Serge_Ibaka_Feb_2014.jpg\n | width4 = 145\n | caption4 = [[Serge Ibaka]]\n | image5 = Kendrick_Perkins.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Kendrick Perkins]]\n | width5 = 123\n}}\n\nThe Thunder finished 50\u201332, more than doubling their win total from the previous season.

In addition, [[Kendrick Perkins]] lost more than 30 pounds during the lockout. The Thunder made their two pre-season appearances, after the lockout, against the [[Dallas Mavericks]], winning both games. They won their first regular-season game against Orlando at home and went on a five-game winning streak. Kevin Durant became the sixth player to score 30 or more points in four consecutive games at the start of a season. In addition, the Thunder was the first to sweep their back-to-back-to-back games, winning a home-and-home series with the [[Houston Rockets]], then routing the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Thunder players Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Perkins, and Ibaka made it onto the [[2012 NBA All-Star Game|2012 All-Star]] ballots. After the Thunder's win over the [[Utah Jazz]] on February 11, 2012, [[Scott Brooks]] was named as the head coach for the Western Conference All-Star squad for the [[2012 NBA All-Star Game]] in [[Orlando, Florida]].\n\nIn the [[2012 NBA Playoffs]], the Thunder swept the defending champion [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the first round to advance and face off against their first round foes from 2010, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. They defeated the Lakers in five games and advanced to play the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder lost the first two games against the Spurs but won the next three including a Game 5 road win, to take a commanding 3\u20132 game lead in the series. In Game 6, the Thunder defeated the Spurs 107\u201399 and advanced to the [[2012 NBA Finals]]. Durant led the way with 34 points, playing all of regulation time in the game. In the 2012 NBA Finals against the [[Miami Heat]], the Thunder won the first game at home but then lost four in a row and lost the series in five games.\n\n===2012\u20132016: Westbrook and Durant era===\n====2012\u201313 season====\n{{Main|2012\u201313 Oklahoma City Thunder season}}\nIn the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Thunder selected [[Baylor Bears basketball|Baylor University]] forward [[Perry Jones III]] with the 28th overall pick. The Thunder also signed free agents [[Hasheem Thabeet]] and [[Daniel Orton]], and signed [[guard (basketball)|guards]] [[Andy Rautins]] and [[DeAndre Liggins]]. They re-signed [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[Serge Ibaka]] to a four-year, $48 million extension. After failing to sign [[James Harden]] to an extension that was reportedly worth four years and $52 million, the team decided to trade Harden rather than having to pay the luxury tax penalty. On October 27, 2012, the Thunder traded Harden along with [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Cole Aldrich]] and forwards [[Daequan Cook]] and [[Lazar Hayward]] to the [[Houston Rockets]] for [[Kevin Martin (basketball, born 1983)|Kevin Martin]], [[Jeremy Lamb]], first round draft picks from [[Toronto Raptors|Toronto]] and [[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]], and one second round draft pick. Martin took over Harden's sixth-man role for the season. The Thunder finished with a 60\u201322 regular season, taking both the Northwest division title and top seed of the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the 8th-seeded Houston Rockets, featuring former team member James Harden. In game two of the series, [[Russell Westbrook]] was struck by Rockets point guard [[Patrick Beverley]], and fell down with an injury and missed the rest of the playoffs after having knee surgery. Without the team's second-leading scorer, the Thunder, who had a 3\u20130 lead, lost the next two games to bring the series to 3\u20132. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Rockets to advance to the second round, facing a rematch of the 2011 second round, with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Thunder lost the series 4\u20131, losing four straight games after winning Game 1 at home.\n\n====2013\u201314 season====\n{{Main|2013\u201314 Oklahoma City Thunder season}}\n[[File:Steven Adams (32049572304).jpg|thumb|right|The Thunder selected [[Steven Adams]] as the 12th pick in the [[2013 NBA Draft]].]]\nIn the [[2013 NBA draft]], the Thunder selected 12th pick [[Steven Adams]], traded for the 26th pick [[Andr\u00e9 Roberson|Andre Roberson]], and selected 47th pick [[Grant Jerrett]].

The team finished second in the Western conference with a 59\u201323 record. They met the Memphis Grizzlies for the third time in the playoffs, which set a record for most consecutive overtimes in a playoff series, with four. Oklahoma City prevailed in seven games to play the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] in the semi-finals, whom they defeated in six games.

But they lost shooting guard [[Thabo Sefolosha]] as his contract expired and he agreed to a three-year, $12 million contract with the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. Several weeks before the season started, the Thunder suffered a setback as Durant was diagnosed with a [[Jones fracture]] in his right foot and missed the first 17 games of the season. During the opening game against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], Westbrook scored 38 points, but found himself sidelined due to a small fracture in his right hand. He missed 16 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4\u201312. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant both came back, and similarly suffered more injuries. Durant was ruled out of the rest of the season in March, deciding to have foot surgery. Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and recorded several triple-doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February to April. He also won the 2014\u20132015 NBA scoring title. However, despite the effort, the Thunder missed the playoffs due to a tiebreaker with the [[New Orleans Pelicans]], and Westbrook fell short of the MVP award, finishing fourth in voting. They finished with a 45\u201337 record. On April 22, 2015, [[Scott Brooks]] was fired as the Thunder head coach. [[Billy Donovan]] was hired on April 30, 2015.

On April 2, 2017, Westbrook tied Oscar Robertson's record for most triple-doubles in an NBA season (41); he broke the record on April 9 against the [[Denver Nuggets]], marking his 42nd triple-double of the season. Westbrook, in that game, also hit the game winning buzzer beater from 36 feet, ending the Nuggets' playoffs hopes and securing the Thunder's 3rd seed matchup with the [[Houston Rockets]] in the NBA playoffs. Oklahoma City lost the playoff series in the first round to the Houston Rockets 4\u20131.

The Thunder selected [[Rodrigue Beaubois]] with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for the 24th pick, center [[Byron Mullens]] from [[Ohio State University]]. The team then added veteran center [[Etan Thomas]] and guard [[Kevin Ollie]]. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for [[Eric Maynor]] from the [[Utah Jazz]]. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.\n\nFrom the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of [[Kevin Durant]], along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players, including future [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]]s [[Russell Westbrook]] and [[James Harden]], were signs of the Thunder's improvement.

Road victories over the [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Utah Jazz]], [[Miami Heat]], [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]] further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention.

She was arrested at the age of 20 and spent 14 months in jail. Later she moved to Paris with her husband, [[Youssef Abdelke]]. There she decided to embark in cinema, and contacted her friends Amiralay, Malas and Mohammad for guidance. Their advice, to let the idea go, only increased her passion grow and determination.\n\n== Cinema and politics ==\nHala started working in cinema at 31, travelling between France and Syria. Originally an artistic collaborator, she became a co-director. She is the producer and manager of a company named Ramadfilm in Syria.\n\nAt 50, she released her well-known documentary \u201cI Am the One Who Brings Flowers to Her Grave\u201d, the movie was a great success and recognised internationally, winning awards at the Venice Film Festival and the Dubai International Film Festival. It was also nominated at the Venice Film Festival for another award, and garnered additional nominations at the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival and the Nantes Three Continents Film Festival. She used cinema as an instrument, a mean of communication whether for politics or poetry. Hala lived near the [[Damascus|Damacus]] Cin\u00e9 Club, and used to discuss cinema with its owners at the time -- [[Omar Amiralay]] and [[Mohammad Malas|Moaammad Malas]] and others. After a time she felt the need to make movies herself, drawn by their potential for carrying a strong political message or advocating for a cause. The movies began, to her, to be something shaped like a work of art, as an aesthetic audio-visual base. ''I Am the One Who Brings Flowers to Her Grave'' reflects her journey in cinema, the political message as a work of art.\n\n==Cinematography==\n* ''Comme si nous attrapions un cobra'', As If We Were Catching A Cobra, (2012)<ref name=af/>\n* ''H\u00e9!

Documentaries enrich the eyes of the audience after the 40 years of commercial and manipulated movies they have been seeing. Hala has said that documentaries should be introduced{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and be in demand from audiences. However, Syria is one of the countries that is resisting these new forms of expression and work. Documentaries have their own language that people get after being exposed enough to documentaries.\n\n== Censorship and cinema ==\nDetermination is a necessity in the field of documentaries to give them the true, brave and free feel. Hala says that [https://web.archive.org/web/20171018191159/http://www.babelmed.net/component/content/article/48-syria/4209-la-situation-du-documentaire-en-syrie-rencontre-avec-hala-alabdalla.html a documentary cannot be neutral and objective, must not be.

Ramadfilm started 20 years ago in Lebanon, under the name of Maram CTV. With the return of Omar Amiralay to Syria, Maram CTV moved to Damascus with a new name; Ramadfilm. Chaired by Omar Amiralay Ramadfilm produced all of Amiralay's documentaries, as well as ''The Night'' by Malas, and ''Sacrifices'' from O. Mohammad, and the films of some French directors.\n\n== ''Je suis celle qui porte les fleurs vers sa tombe'', I Am She who Brings the Flowers to her Grave ==\nThis is one of the movies that Hala is well known for, it was the winner of Best Documentary Award in Venice.\n\nIt is a journey through the Syrian landscape. Hala merged poetry with filmmaking. Poetry was a main element in the movie, it illustrated the longing that her friends have for Syria. Some people went into exile and will never see their country again, some of which are her friends that live in Paris yet they still miss their homeland. The movie contains interviews with 3 of her friends who chose to leave Syria for France. It also shows that the political exile ended up being and inner exile in the people even while leaving in France. Poetry is the main component of this movie, it shows the impact of poetry on people and everyday situations.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography==\n* Armes, Roy; [http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/3984 ''Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East''] (English)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171018191159/http://www.babelmed.net/component/content/article/48-syria/4209-la-situation-du-documentaire-en-syrie-rencontre-avec-hala-alabdalla.html La situation du documentaire en Syrie: rencontre avec Hala Alabdalla], by Florence Ollivry, Babelmed (in French), accessed 2016-11-30\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yacoub, Hala Al-Abdallah}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Syrian film directors]]\n[[Category:Syrian women film directors]]\n[[Category:Women cinematographers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Underlinked|date=April 2016}}\n\n'''Hala Alabdalla''' (born 1956 in [[Hama]]) is a Syrian cinematographer and director.

Her father's family came originally from Lincolnshire and her mother's from Cornwall.\n\nHer father joined Nelke Phillips, a London stockbroking firm who counted Edward VII as one of their clients. He was elected to the Stock Exchange on 25 March 1904 and became one of their partners at their office at 4 Moorgate Street. At the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], all the German stockbrokers were forced to resign. In 1917 he set up his own firm, Vickers, da Costa, which counted Sir [[Winston Churchill]] among their clients. Her brother, Ralph Vickers was later Senior Partner of the firm.\n\nVickers was educated at St Monica's, [[Burgh Heath]], [[Surrey]], and in [[Paris]]. She was trained as a Norland Nurse, working in the Margaret Macdonald and Mary Middleton Hospital, [[Notting Hill]] and was active in politics in Battersea and Islington.  She was presented at court by Mrs Winston Churchill in 1926.  She hunted in [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], rode horses for the [[Irish Free State army|Irish Free State Army]] to ladies classes and competed in the Dublin Horse Show as a jumper. She served with the [[Red Cross]] in [[South East Asia]] and was area welfare officer of the Social Welfare Department in [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. She was later chairman of the Anglo-[[Indonesia]]n Society. She served as a [[London County Council]]lor 1937\u201345 and was UK delegate to the Status of Women Commission of the [[United Nations]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nSeeking a career in politics, she went to see Winston Churchill at Chartwell. He told her he deeply disapproved of women in politics but advised her to wear a pretty hat and join the London County Council.  In 1936 she was elected a Member of the Ladies\u2019 Grand Council of the Primrose League.\n\nIn 1937 she was elected to the London County Council, representing the Norwood division of Lambeth, and serving until 1945. In 1939 she was nominated by the British Red Cross to serve as Divisional Secretary, Lambeth Division, and in 1940 similarly for Southwark. However, during the war, she was often abroad, repatriating prisoners of war.\n\n==Overseas==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nVickers worked for 14 months with the Red Cross in Indonesia, four years in Malaysia as a Social Welfare Area Officer in Negri Sembilan, Malacca and Johore. She was nominated a member of the Legislative Council in Negri Sembilan. She was a founder member of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, and started the work in Malaysia, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Kenya.\n\nMore specifically, in August 1945, she signed up to serve as Chief Welfare Officer, S.E.A.C. with the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John. In September 1945 she arrived with six other women in Batavia, primarily to help British troops but working not only in British hospitals but also in Dutch, Indonesian and Chinese hospitals. She left in November 1946, having given great help to troops and medical units. The Dutch Red Cross were most appreciative and she was awarded the Netherlands Red Cross Order of Merit (1946). She was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (1946). From there she went to Malaya where she served as Area Welfare Officer, Department of Social Service from January 1947 to May 1948. She visited Singapore, New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1948.\n\nVickers unsuccessfully contested [[South Poplar (UK Parliament constituency)|South Poplar]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. At the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]] she was elected as the [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]], defeating the Labour candidate, [[Michael Foot]], by 100 votes. She defeated him again in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] by the greatly increased majority of 6,454.  Her seat was always marginal, but she held it in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]], [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] elections. \n\nShe was considered a dedicated constituency MP, taking a house in Devonport, travelling to and from the constituency every weekend and holding regular surgeries. She never became a Minister, possibly because she always voted on conscience rather than following the whip.  She was appointed DBE in 1964.

Every year she was elected by all parties to a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. She sat on the UK COSA Committee. She was a working member of the International Friendship League.

Her father\u2019s family came originally from Lincolnshire and her mother\u2019s from Cornwall.\n\nHer father joined Nelke Phillips, a London stockbroking firm who counted Edward VII as one of their clients. He was elected to the Stock Exchange on 25 March 1904 and became one of their partners at their office at 4 Moorgate Street. At the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], all the German stockbrokers were forced to resign. In 1917 he set up his own firm, Vickers, da Costa, which counted Sir [[Winston Churchill]] among their clients. Her brother, Ralph Vickers was later Senior Partner of the firm.\n\nVickers was educated at St Monica's, [[Burgh Heath]], [[Surrey]], and in [[Paris]]. She was trained as a Norland Nurse, working in the Margaret Macdonald and Mary Middleton Hospital, [[Notting Hill]] and was active in politics in Battersea and Islington.  She was presented at court by Mrs Winston Churchill in 1926.  She hunted in [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], rode horses for the [[Irish Free State army|Irish Free State Army]] to ladies classes and competed in the Dublin Horse Show as a jumper. She served with the [[Red Cross]] in [[South East Asia]] and was area welfare officer of the Social Welfare Department in [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. She was later chairman of the Anglo-[[Indonesia]]n Society. She served as a [[London County Council]]lor 1937\u201345 and was UK delegate to the Status of Women Commission of the [[United Nations]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nSeeking a career in politics, she went to see Winston Churchill at Chartwell. He told her he deeply disapproved of women in politics but advised her to wear a pretty hat and join the London County Council.  In 1936 she was elected a Member of the Ladies\u2019 Grand Council of the Primrose League.\n\nIn 1937 she was elected to the London County Council, representing the Norwood division of Lambeth, and serving until 1945. In 1939 she was nominated by the British Red Cross to serve as Divisional Secretary, Lambeth Division, and in 1940 similarly for Southwark. However, during the war, she was often abroad, repatriating prisoners of war.\n\n==Overseas==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nVickers worked for 14 months with the Red Cross in Indonesia, four years in Malaysia as a Social Welfare Area Officer in Negri Sembilan, Malacca and Johore. She was nominated a member of the Legislative Council in Negri Sembilan. She was a founder member of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind, and started the work in Malaysia, Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Kenya.\n\nMore specifically, in August 1945, she signed up to serve as Chief Welfare Officer, S.E.A.C. with the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John. In September 1945 she arrived with six other women in Batavia, primarily to help British troops but working not only in British hospitals but also in Dutch, Indonesian and Chinese hospitals. She left in November 1946, having given great help to troops and medical units. The Dutch Red Cross were most appreciative and she was awarded the Netherlands Red Cross Order of Merit (1946). She was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (1946). From there she went to Malaya where she served as Area Welfare Officer, Department of Social Service from January 1947 to May 1948. She visited Singapore, New Zealand and Australia in the summer of 1948.\n\nVickers unsuccessfully contested [[South Poplar (UK Parliament constituency)|South Poplar]] at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. At the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]] she was elected as the [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]], defeating the Labour candidate, [[Michael Foot]], by 100 votes. She defeated him again in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] by the greatly increased majority of 6,454.  Her seat was always marginal, but she held it in the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]], [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]] elections. \n\nShe was considered a dedicated constituency MP, taking a house in Devonport, travelling to and from the constituency every weekend and holding regular surgeries.

He left school at 15 to be a boy clerk in the Post Office. Two years later he transferred into [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise]], and rose steadily through the ranks to finish as a Higher Executive Officer. Active in his trade union, Redhead left the civil service to be General Secretary of the [[Society of Civil Servants]] in 1948.\nA school on Higham Hill Road was later named, Edward Redhead Junior School.\n\n==Political activity==\nHe was active in municipal affairs, and was elected as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] councillor to Walthamstow Borough Council in 1929. From 1945 he was an [[Alderman]], and served as Mayor of the town in 1949-1950 and again in 1961\u20131962.

In October 1965 he transferred to the [[Department of Education and Science (UK)|Department of Education and Science]], retiring due to ill health in January 1967. He died the following April.

He left school at 15 to be a boy clerk in the Post Office. Two years later he transferred into [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise]], and rose steadily through the ranks to finish as a Higher Executive Officer. Active in his trade union, Redhead left the civil service to be General Secretary of the [[Society of Civil Servants]] in 1948.\nA school on Higham Hill Road was later named, Edward Redhead Junior School.\n\n==Political activity==\nHe was active in municipal affairs, and was elected as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] councillor to Walthamstow Borough Council in 1929. From 1945 he was an [[Alderman]], and served as Mayor of the town in 1949-1950 and again in 1961-1962. At the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], Redhead fought [[Gillingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Gillingham]].\n\n==Parliament==\nWhen [[Clement Attlee]] received an Earldom, Redhead was the local candidate picked to follow him. He kept the seat in a 1956 byelection. From 1959 to 1964 Redhead served as an Opposition Whip, and when Labour came into government, he was Minister of State at the Board of Trade. In October 1965 he transferred to the [[Department of Education and Science (UK)|Department of Education and Science]], retiring due to ill health in January 1967. He died the following April.  The resulting by-election came at an inconvenient time for the Labour government, and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate [[Frederick Silvester]] gained the seat.\n\n==References==\n*M.

{"title_page": "Gilmour Leburn", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n'''William Gilmour Leburn''' (30 July 1913 \u2013 15 August 1963) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] company director and Conservative [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Kinross and Western Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross and West Perthshire]] from 1955 until 1963.  He served in the government of [[Harold Macmillan]] as [[Under-Secretary of State for Scotland]]; his sudden death opened the way for Macmillan's successor, Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]] to return to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\n==Early life==\nLeburn went to [[Gateside (Fife)|Gateside]] Village School and then [[Strathallan School]], an [[Independent school (UK)|independent school]] in [[Perthshire]]. Instead of university, he became a woodworking apprentice for Gateside Mills Co. Ltd., with which his family had connections.\n\n==Wartime service==\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] Leburn became brigade signal officer with the \n[[154th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|154th Infantry Brigade]] of the [[51st (Highland) Division|51st Highland Division]], which served in [[France]]. In 1941 he was made staff officer for the brigade, and fought at  [[First Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] where he was severely wounded: he took two years in hospital to recover. When well, he joined the [[Staff College, Camberley]], where he was promoted to the rank of major. During the war, Leburn was [[mentioned in despatches]] on two separate occasions.\n\n==Political activity==\nWhen demobilised, Leburn returned to the Gateside Mills Company, where he moved into management. He became active politically as a [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist]], and in 1948 was elected to [[Fife]] County Council. He enjoyed life on the Council and was Vice Convener in 1951\u201352. Leburn was selected to follow [[William McNair Snadden]] as Unionist candidate for [[Kinross and Western Perthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Kinross and West Perthshire]] when Snadden stood down at the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]]. Leburn easily won what was a safe seat.\n\n==Parliament==\nHis maiden speech called for the use of smaller driver-operated buses in rural areas. Leburn was loyal to the government of [[Anthony Eden]] over the Suez crisis, signing a motion which commended the Foreign Secretary's policy while condemning the United States government's attitude. He became popular with Conservative MPs, and was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[John Maclay, 1st Viscount Muirshiel|John Maclay]] (the [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]) from 1957.\n\n==Ministerial office==\nAfter the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959 general election]] Leburn was brought into the government as Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office. He had specific responsibility for agriculture, forestry and fishing, which led him to intervene to try to solve a dispute between Scots fishermen over the [[Isle of Lewis]] in 1961. The next year, he made it clear he was aware of the loophole whereby British fishing vessels could register in Ireland. From September 1962, Leburn switched responsibilities to planning, housing and industry. He encouraged the building of strategic bridges.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Succession==\nLeburn died suddenly from a heart attack while at his hunting lodge at Lochmore near Lairg, Sutherland in August 1963, aged 50.<ref>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=Coventry Evening Telegraph|date=16 August 1963|page=16|title=Scottish Minister Dies on Holiday}}</ref> His seat was at the time the safest [[Conservative and Unionist Party|Conservative and Unionist]] seat in Scotland.

Season four, as it was filmed after ''[[Fred: The Movie]]'', marked a change in production style, it is filmed in a higher video quality, and shows other on-screen characters. The original production style was revived for a few episodes in 2010, introducing the Claudio character, after the movie was released in the UK, and ended when Cruikshank returned to movie filming. Leading up to the second movie's release, a new series, called ''Figgle Chat'' was produced and features Internet and television stars. Following that, an animated series, ''It's Fred!'', named after Fred's catchphrase, began being uploaded to the channel.\n\nCruikshank has described the channel as \"programming for kids by kids\".<ref name=\"Ind\"/> The series is intended as a parody of people who, in Cruikshank's words, \"think that everyone is so interested in them.\" Cruikshank believes that viewers either \"automatically love Fred or automatically hate Fred, there is no in between\".<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi57YE9jon4|title=The Teen Behind Fred.|last=Brook|first=Anderson|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912233840/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi57YE9jon4|archive-date=September 12, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The videos primarily consist of the character [[Fourth wall|speaking to the audience]] about what is happening in his life. Fred has a high-pitched \"chipmunk\" voice, making him sound more like a 6-year-old. According to Cruikshank, this effect, and the hyperactive appearance of the character, are achieved by speeding up the audio.<ref name=\"partnersproject\"/>\n\nThe first season follows Fred attempting to perform a number of activities during the summer, until his mother attends rehab for cocaine abuse. \"Fred Goes Swimming\" is the second most watched video on the Fred channel, with over 68 million views.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fred Goes Swimming|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqwKNNQBwc|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=October 3, 2016|author=Fred|date=June 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912024041/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqwKNNQBwc|archive-date=September 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The second season explores Fred's infatuation with Judy, a girl in his class, and attending school. There Fred decides to run against class bully Kevin, for class president. The song \"Watch How I Do This\", by Kev Blaze, is featured in a number of the season 2 videos. Season three again follows the daily adventures of Fred, in school, and with classmates, and shows Fred's interest in singing. The fourth season, now with on-screen characters, shows Fred traveling around town trying out different occupations. Following this, Fred holds contests surrounding his first two movies, gets a visit from a creeping character named Claudio, gets invited to host a talk show, dispels rumours of being owned by [[Nickelodeon]], becomes animated, and is kidnapped by a Korean corporation. In the few Fred videos on Lucas' personal channel, Fred lives in the house of a middle aged man named Jeffrey, who lets Fred live there for free as long has he cleans the house once a week in nothing but his underwear. His mom currently is watching over various children, none of which are related to her, that she has tried to leave to be [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] multiple times. However, nobody will kidnap them.\n\nThe series uses a [[floating timeline]], meaning it is always taking place in the current year, and Fred is perpetually six years old and in [[kindergarten]].\n\n=== Filmography ===\nThis is a list of videos uploaded to the Fred channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fred Uploaded Videos|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/Fred/videos?view=u|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=September 1, 2014|author=Fred|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708080609/https://www.youtube.com/user/Fred/videos?view=u|archive-date=July 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> 60 videos are considered part of the original ''Fred'' series, however no official list exists.

The mother's deep voice is often heard. It is implied that Fred has been the victim of child abuse (for example being locked in a dog cage for three days), however he frequently speaks of his love for his mother, particularly after her stay at rehab. Fred's father is mentioned several times as being a former [[rock music]]ian, and currently on death row in the state [[Prison|penitentiary]]. Fred has not met his father, as he left Mrs. Figglehorn while she was still pregnant with Fred. In seasons one through three, Fred communicates with all characters off-screen.\n\nOn screen characters are seen for the first time in a [[dream sequence]], in \"Fred: A Star In His Own Mind\", Fred dreams of being a famous actor, meeting fan girls and other famous actors. Season four, as it was filmed after ''[[Fred: The Movie]]'', marked a change in production style, it is filmed in a higher video quality, and shows other on-screen characters. The original production style was revived for a few episodes in 2010, introducing the Claudio character, after the movie was released in the UK, and ended when Cruikshank returned to movie filming. Leading up to the second movie's release, a new series, called ''Figgle Chat'' was produced and features Internet and television stars. Following that, an animated series, ''It's Fred!'', named after Fred's catchphrase, began being uploaded to the channel.\n\nCruikshank has described the channel as \"programming for kids by kids\".<ref name=\"Ind\"/> The series is intended as a parody of people who, in Cruikshank's words, \"think that everyone is so interested in them.\" Cruikshank believes that viewers either \"automatically love Fred or automatically hate Fred, there is no in between\".<ref name=\"cnn\">{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi57YE9jon4|title=The Teen Behind Fred.|last=Brook|first=Anderson|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912233840/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi57YE9jon4|archive-date=September 12, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The videos primarily consist of the character [[Fourth wall|speaking to the audience]] about what is happening in his life. Fred has a high-pitched \"chipmunk\" voice, making him sound more like a 6-year-old. According to Cruikshank, this effect, and the hyperactive appearance of the character, are achieved by speeding up the audio.<ref name=\"partnersproject\"/>\n\nThe first season follows Fred attempting to perform a number of activities during the summer, until his mother attends rehab for cocaine abuse. \"Fred Goes Swimming\" is the second most watched video on the Fred channel, with over 68 million views.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fred Goes Swimming|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqwKNNQBwc|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=October 3, 2016|author=Fred|date=June 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912024041/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEqwKNNQBwc|archive-date=September 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The second season explores Fred's infatuation with Judy, a girl in his class, and attending school. There Fred decides to run against class bully Kevin, for class president. The song \"Watch How I Do This\", by Kev Blaze, is featured in a number of the season 2 videos. Season three again follows the daily adventures of Fred, in school, and with classmates, and shows Fred's interest in singing. The fourth season, now with on-screen characters, shows Fred traveling around town trying out different occupations. Following this, Fred holds contests surrounding his first two movies, gets a visit from a creeping character named Claudio, gets invited to host a talk show, dispels rumours of being owned by [[Nickelodeon]], becomes animated, and is kidnapped by a Korean corporation. In the few Fred videos on Lucas' personal channel, Fred lives in the house of a middle aged man named Jeffrey, who lets Fred live there for free as long has he cleans the house once a week in nothing but his underwear. His mom currently is watching over various children, none of which are related to her, that she has tried to leave to be [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] multiple times.
