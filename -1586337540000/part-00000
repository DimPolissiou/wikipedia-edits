It is a [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] and [[townland]] of 755 acres lying on the shore of [[Belfast Lough]], between Belfast and [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]]. [[Holywood Exchange]] and [[Belfast City Airport]] are nearby. The town hosts an annual [[jazz]] and [[blues]] festival.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe English name ''Holywood'' comes {{etymology|la|Sanctus Boscus|holy wood}}. This was the name the [[Normans]] gave to the woodland surrounding the [[monastery]] of St Laiseran, son of Nasca. The monastery was founded by Laiseran before 640 and was on the site of the present [[Holywood Priory]]. The earliest [[Anglicised]] form appears as ''Haliwode'' in a 14th-century document. Today, the name is pronounced ''Hollywood''.\n\nThe [[Irish language|Irish]] name for Holywood is ''Ard Mhic Nasca'' meaning \"high ground of Mac Nasca\".<ref name=\"PDI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/66065.aspx|title=Ard Mhic Nasca/Holywood|website=Logainm.ie}}</ref><ref name=name>{{cite web|title=Ulster Place Names, County Down|url=http://www.ulsterplacenames.org/ainm_index_down.htm|work=Ainm:Journal of the Ulster Place-name Society (1987, 1988)|accessdate=22 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214225130/http://www.ulsterplacenames.org/ainm_index_down.htm|archive-date=14 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the 17th century, [[Ulster]] ports began to rise in prominence. In 1625, William Pitt was appointed as Customer of the ports of [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]], [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum]], [[Killough]], [[Portaferry]], [[Donaghadee]], [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] and Holywood.<ref>{{cite book|author1=O'Sullivan, Aidan  |author2=Breen, Colin|year=2007|title=Maritime Ireland. An Archaeology of Coastal Communities|publisher=Tempus|location=Stroud|page=211|isbn=978-0-7524-2509-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Holywood, like many other coastal villages throughout Ireland, became popular as a [[Seaside resort|resort]] for [[bathing|sea-bathing]]. Many wealthy [[Belfast]] merchants chose the town and the surrounding area to build large homes for themselves. These included the Kennedys of [[Cultra]] and the Harrisons of Holywood. Dalchoolin House stood on the site of the present [[Ulster Transport Museum]], while Cultra Manor was built between 1902\u201304 and now houses part of the [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]].\n\nThe railway line from Belfast to Holywood opened in 1848, and this led to rapid development. The population of Holywood was approximately 3,500 in 1900 and had grown to 12,000 by 2001. This growth, coupled with that of other towns and villages along the coastal strip to [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], necessitated the construction of the Holywood Bypass in the early 1970s. Holywood today is a popular [[residential area]] and is well known for its fashionable shops, boutiques, arts and crafts.\n[[File:The Priory, Holywood - geograph.org.uk - 344064.jpg|thumb|Holywood Priory]]\n\nThe Old Priory ruins lie at the bottom of the High Street. The tower dates from 1800, but the oldest ruins date from the early 13th century. The Priory graveyard is the resting place for many distinguished [[citizens]] including the educational reformer, Dr Robert Sullivan, and the Praeger family. [[Robert Lloyd Praeger]] (1865\u20131953) was an internationally renowned [[botanist]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Praeger|first=Robert Lloyd|year=1969|title=The Way that I Went: An Irishman in Ireland|pages=10\u201312|location=Dublin|publisher= Allen Figgis|isbn= 0-900372-93-1}}</ref> and his sister, [[Rosamond Praeger]] (1867\u20131954), gained fame as a [[sculpture|sculptor]] and writer. \"Johnny the Jig\", one of her sculptures, is situated in the town. Praeger House at [[Sullivan Upper School|Sullivan Upper Grammar School]] is named after the family. Bishop [[Robert Bent Knox]] is also buried there.\n\nOn 17 June 1994, Garnet Bell, a former pupil bearing a grudge, entered an assembly hall at [[Sullivan Upper School]] and used a flamethrower to attack students taking [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] examinations. Six pupils were injured; three of them seriously.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flame-thrower case man 'did not mean to hurt pupils'|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=20 June 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/flamethrower-case-man-did-not-mean-to-hurt-pupils-1587302.html|accessdate=1 August 2009|location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 April 2010, at around 12:24am, a car bombing occurred near [[Palace Barracks]], a [[British Army]] barracks on the edge of Holywood's town centre.

Cricket may have been played in Holywood as early as 1860 but the present club, as we know it, was formed as a result of a meeting held on Monday, 28 March 1881. In the first season games against Ballynahinch, Enfield, Lurgan, North Down and Sydenham followed the opening game against Wellington, when the team was captained by Joe Ross. The club's first home was at Kinnegar where the club President and Benefactor for many years gave use of part of his land to the club free of charge. The members worked hard to turn the area into a cricket ground and by 1883 had secured sufficient money to erect a new pavilion.\n\nNorth Down Borough Council has provided HCC with a new home at Seapark. \"Seapark Oval\" was finally ready during the 2005 season, after 8 years of using the pitch at Sullivan School. The club had been forced off the Belfast Road grounds it occupied for 100+ years due to the GAA upgrading the pitch it leases from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Connor and Down, which meant that with the playing surfaces of the two sports pitches being at different levels, cricket could no longer be played at this venue unless the ground was raised to the same level as the GAA pitch. The cricket club now share the Seapark grounds with a bowling club and [[Holywood F.C.|Holywood Football Club]], the latter hoping to secure new grounds at Spafield in the near future. There are also plans for a new club house at the Seapark grounds.\n\n===Football===\n[[Holywood F.C.]] was formed in 1983 following the amalgamation of two Northern Amateur League teams, Loughview Star (1961\u201383) and Holywood Town (1972\u201383). These two clubs had not been very successful, though Loughview had caused a sensation when they reached the Clarence Cup final while still a Second Division club, losing 2\u20130 to Lisburn Rangers in 1964\u201365. Loughview won Division 2B in 1981\u201382 and after the amalgamation, the new club finished runners up in 2b in 1992\u201393, but were soon relegated again. The club's biggest day came when they won the [[IFA Junior Cup]] final in 1989\u201390, beating their town rivals Holywood Rec. in the decider. The club has enjoyed success in recent years, by winning the 2a title and the Cochrane & Corry Cup in the 1999\u20132000 season. As a result, the club were promoted for the first time in their history to [[Northern Ireland football league system|intermediate]] status in Division 1B.\n\n===GAA===\nThe first [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] club in Holywood was organised in 1927. It was called St Colmcille's. The team's strip was made up of black shorts and black shirts with white collars. This early club team also sponsored a handball team and a drama club. Although successful in the early days, the club lasted only ten years. It was revived in 1948 under the title of Holywood's Patron Saint, St. Laiseran, by John Regan, Davy McCoy and Paddy McNally, and lasted until it withdrew from the League in 1956.\n\nThe successful Thomas Russell Gaelic Club was formed in 1962 and soon earned the name \"the Holywood Giant Killers\". It played on a notoriously uneven pitch in the 'Convent Fields'. But early success did not continue \u2013 the club struggled on until 1976 when it withdrew from the Antrim League. St. Paul's Gaelic Football Club was founded in 1979 as an amalgamation of the Holywood, Bangor, and Newtownards clubs. It operated under a deal with [[Holywood Cricket Club]] which maintained the Gaelic pitch in return for using a small section of the lower pitch as part of its 'out-field'.\n\n===Golf===\nHolywood Golf Club, founded in 1904 is where 2011 US Open, 2012 US PGA, The Open 2014, and 2014 US PGA champion [[Rory McIlroy]] learned his golf, and the champion still calls it his home course. Nearby [[Craigavad]] is the home of the [[Royal Belfast Golf Club]], the oldest in Ireland, dating from 1881. The club's present course was designed by architect Harry Colt in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://royalbelfast.com/|title=Royal Belfast Golf Club \u2013 RBGC The Oldest Golf Club in Ireland}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n* Sir Keith Scott, recognised global leader in the world of championship manager and weekly visitor to Skinners\n* [[Mark Adair]], former cricketer for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]]; former [[Sullivan Upper School]] pupil\n* [[Desmond Boal]], QC, leading Northern Ireland barrister and former Stormont MP, resided in Holywood\n* [[Charles Brett]], architectural historian, born in Holywood\n* [[Stephen Brown (author)|Rev Stephen Brown, SJ]], writer, librarian, founder of the [[Central Catholic Library]] (in Dublin), was born in Holywood\n* [[Barbara Callcott]], Australian television personality, born in Holywood\n* [[Darren Cave]], played rugby for Ulster Rugby and helped Ireland Under-20 win the Six Nations Grand Slam in 2007\n* [[Jamie Dornan]], actor, model\n* [[Garth Ennis]], comic writer \n* [[Mick Fealty]], editor of ''[[Slugger O'Toole]]'' was raised in Holywood\n* [[Henry Harrison (MP)|Henry Harrison, MP]], secretary to [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], is buried in the Priory graveyard in the centre of Holywood\n* [[Maurice Jay]], [[U105]] radio station presenter\n* [[David Jeffrey]], Northern Irish football manager and former player.\n* [[Bap Kennedy]], singer-songwriter and record producer\n* [[Tom Kerr]], comic strip artist\n* [[Stephen Martin (field hockey)|Stephen Martin]], [[Great Britain men's national field hockey team|Great Britain]] and [[Ireland men's national field hockey team|Ireland]] field hockey international\n* [[Robert McCartney (Northern Irish politician)|Robert McCartney]], QC, leading barrister and ex-UK Unionist Westminster MP for North Down (1995\u20132001); resides in Holywood.\n* [[Alban McGuinness]], lawyer and [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) politician; born in Holywood.\n* [[Rory McIlroy]], professional golfer.

[[Holywood Exchange]] and [[Belfast City Airport]] are nearby. The town hosts an annual [[jazz]] and [[blues]] festival.\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe English name ''Holywood'' comes {{etymology|la|Sanctus Boscus|holy wood}}. This was the name the [[Normans]] gave to the woodland surrounding the [[monastery]] of St Laiseran, son of Nasca. The monastery was founded by Laiseran before 640 and was on the site of the present [[Holywood Priory]]. The earliest [[Anglicised]] form appears as ''Haliwode'' in a 14th-century document. Today, the name is pronounced ''Hollywood''.\n\nThe [[Irish language|Irish]] name for Holywood is ''Ard Mhic Nasca'' meaning \"high ground of Mac Nasca\".<ref name=\"PDI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/66065.aspx|title=Ard Mhic Nasca/Holywood|website=Logainm.ie}}</ref><ref name=name>{{cite web|title=Ulster Place Names, County Down|url=http://www.ulsterplacenames.org/ainm_index_down.htm|work=Ainm:Journal of the Ulster Place-name Society (1987, 1988)|accessdate=22 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214225130/http://www.ulsterplacenames.org/ainm_index_down.htm|archive-date=14 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the 17th century, [[Ulster]] ports began to rise in prominence. In 1625, William Pitt was appointed as Customer of the ports of [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]], [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum]], [[Killough]], [[Portaferry]], [[Donaghadee]], [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] and Holywood.<ref>{{cite book|author1=O'Sullivan, Aidan  |author2=Breen, Colin|year=2007|title=Maritime Ireland. An Archaeology of Coastal Communities|publisher=Tempus|location=Stroud|page=211|isbn=978-0-7524-2509-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, Holywood, like many other coastal villages throughout Ireland, became popular as a [[Seaside resort|resort]] for [[bathing|sea-bathing]]. Many wealthy [[Belfast]] merchants chose the town and the surrounding area to build large homes for themselves. These included the Kennedys of [[Cultra]] and the Harrisons of Holywood. Dalchoolin House stood on the site of the present [[Ulster Transport Museum]], while Cultra Manor was built between 1902\u201304 and now houses part of the [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]].\n\nThe railway line from Belfast to Holywood opened in 1848, and this led to rapid development. The population of Holywood was approximately 3,500 in 1900 and had grown to 12,000 by 2001. This growth, coupled with that of other towns and villages along the coastal strip to [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], necessitated the construction of the Holywood Bypass in the early 1970s. Holywood today is a popular [[residential area]] and is well known for its fashionable shops, boutiques, arts and crafts.\n[[File:The Priory, Holywood - geograph.org.uk - 344064.jpg|thumb|Holywood Priory]]\n\nThe Old Priory ruins lie at the bottom of the High Street. The tower dates from 1800, but the oldest ruins date from the early 13th century. The Priory graveyard is the resting place for many distinguished [[citizens]] including the educational reformer, Dr Robert Sullivan, and the Praeger family. [[Robert Lloyd Praeger]] (1865\u20131953) was an internationally renowned [[botanist]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Praeger|first=Robert Lloyd|year=1969|title=The Way that I Went: An Irishman in Ireland|pages=10\u201312|location=Dublin|publisher= Allen Figgis|isbn= 0-900372-93-1}}</ref> and his sister, [[Rosamond Praeger]] (1867\u20131954), gained fame as a [[sculpture|sculptor]] and writer. \"Johnny the Jig\", one of her sculptures, is situated in the town. Praeger House at [[Sullivan Upper School|Sullivan Upper Grammar School]] is named after the family. Bishop [[Robert Bent Knox]] is also buried there.\n\nOn 17 June 1994, Garnet Bell, a former pupil bearing a grudge, entered an assembly hall at [[Sullivan Upper School]] and used a flamethrower to attack students taking [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] examinations. Six pupils were injured; three of them seriously.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flame-thrower case man 'did not mean to hurt pupils'|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=20 June 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/flamethrower-case-man-did-not-mean-to-hurt-pupils-1587302.html|accessdate=1 August 2009|location=London, UK}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 April 2010, at around 12:24am, a car bombing occurred near [[Palace Barracks]], a [[British Army]] barracks on the edge of Holywood's town centre.

Cricket may have been played in Holywood as early as 1860 but the present club, as we know it, was formed as a result of a meeting held on Monday, 28 March 1881. In the first season games against Ballynahinch, Enfield, Lurgan, North Down and Sydenham followed the opening game against Wellington, when the team was captained by Joe Ross. The club's first home was at Kinnegar where the club President and Benefactor for many years gave use of part of his land to the club free of charge. The members worked hard to turn the area into a cricket ground and by 1883 had secured sufficient money to erect a new pavilion.\n\nNorth Down Borough Council has provided HCC with a new home at Seapark. \"Seapark Oval\" was finally ready during the 2005 season, after 8 years of using the pitch at Sullivan School. The club had been forced off the Belfast Road grounds it occupied for 100+ years due to the GAA upgrading the pitch it leases from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Connor and Down, which meant that with the playing surfaces of the two sports pitches being at different levels, cricket could no longer be played at this venue unless the ground was raised to the same level as the GAA pitch. The cricket club now share the Seapark grounds with a bowling club and [[Holywood F.C.|Holywood Football Club]], the latter hoping to secure new grounds at Spafield in the near future. There are also plans for a new club house at the Seapark grounds.\n\n===Football===\n[[Holywood F.C.]] was formed in 1983 following the amalgamation of two Northern Amateur League teams, Loughview Star (1961\u201383) and Holywood Town (1972\u201383). These two clubs had not been very successful, though Loughview had caused a sensation when they reached the Clarence Cup final while still a Second Division club, losing 2\u20130 to Lisburn Rangers in 1964\u201365. Loughview won Division 2B in 1981\u201382 and after the amalgamation, the new club finished runners up in 2b in 1992\u201393, but were soon relegated again. The club's biggest day came when they won the [[IFA Junior Cup]] final in 1989\u201390, beating their town rivals Holywood Rec. in the decider. The club has enjoyed success in recent years, by winning the 2a title and the Cochrane & Corry Cup in the 1999\u20132000 season. As a result, the club were promoted for the first time in their history to [[Northern Ireland football league system|intermediate]] status in Division 1B.\n\n===GAA===\nThe first [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] club in Holywood was organised in 1927. It was called St Colmcille's. The team's strip was made up of black shorts and black shirts with white collars. This early club team also sponsored a handball team and a drama club. Although successful in the early days, the club lasted only ten years. It was revived in 1948 under the title of Holywood's Patron Saint, St. Laiseran, by John Regan, Davy McCoy and Paddy McNally, and lasted until it withdrew from the League in 1956.\n\nThe successful Thomas Russell Gaelic Club was formed in 1962 and soon earned the name \"the Holywood Giant Killers\". It played on a notoriously uneven pitch in the 'Convent Fields'. But early success did not continue \u2013 the club struggled on until 1976 when it withdrew from the Antrim League. St. Paul's Gaelic Football Club was founded in 1979 as an amalgamation of the Holywood, Bangor, and Newtownards clubs. It operated under a deal with [[Holywood Cricket Club]] which maintained the Gaelic pitch in return for using a small section of the lower pitch as part of its 'out-field'.\n\n===Golf===\nHolywood Golf Club, founded in 1904 is where 2011 US Open, 2012 US PGA, The Open 2014, and 2014 US PGA champion [[Rory McIlroy]] learned his golf, and the champion still calls it his home course. Nearby [[Craigavad]] is the home of the [[Royal Belfast Golf Club]], the oldest in Ireland, dating from 1881. The club's present course was designed by architect Harry Colt in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://royalbelfast.com/|title=Royal Belfast Golf Club \u2013 RBGC The Oldest Golf Club in Ireland}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Mark Adair]], former cricketer for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club]]; former [[Sullivan Upper School]] pupil\n* [[Desmond Boal]], QC, leading Northern Ireland barrister and former Stormont MP, resided in Holywood\n* [[Charles Brett]], architectural historian, born in Holywood\n* [[Stephen Brown (author)|Rev Stephen Brown, SJ]], writer, librarian, founder of the [[Central Catholic Library]] (in Dublin), was born in Holywood\n* [[Barbara Callcott]], Australian television personality, born in Holywood\n* [[Darren Cave]], played rugby for Ulster Rugby and helped Ireland Under-20 win the Six Nations Grand Slam in 2007\n* [[Jamie Dornan]], actor, model\n* [[Garth Ennis]], comic writer \n* [[Mick Fealty]], editor of ''[[Slugger O'Toole]]'' was raised in Holywood\n* [[Henry Harrison (MP)|Henry Harrison, MP]], secretary to [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], is buried in the Priory graveyard in the centre of Holywood\n* [[Maurice Jay]], [[U105]] radio station presenter\n* [[David Jeffrey]], Northern Irish football manager and former player.\n* [[Bap Kennedy]], singer-songwriter and record producer\n* [[Tom Kerr]], comic strip artist\n* [[Stephen Martin (field hockey)|Stephen Martin]], [[Great Britain men's national field hockey team|Great Britain]] and [[Ireland men's national field hockey team|Ireland]] field hockey international\n* [[Robert McCartney (Northern Irish politician)|Robert McCartney]], QC, leading barrister and ex-UK Unionist Westminster MP for North Down (1995\u20132001); resides in Holywood.\n* [[Alban McGuinness]], lawyer and [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) politician; born in Holywood.\n* [[Rory McIlroy]], professional golfer.

Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another. To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]] (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.\n\nThese enzymes are found in [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] and provide a defence mechanism against invading [[virus]]es.<ref name=\"pmid4897066\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Arber W, Linn S | title = DNA modification and restriction | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue =  | pages = 467\u2013500 | year = 1969 | pmid = 4897066 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.38.070169.002343 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid6314109\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kr\u00fcger DH, Bickle TA | title = Bacteriophage survival: multiple mechanisms for avoiding the deoxyribonucleic acid restriction systems of their hosts | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 345\u201360 | date = September 1983 | pmid = 6314109 | pmc = 281580 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.47.3.345-360.1983 }}</ref> Inside a [[prokaryote]], the restriction enzymes selectively cut up ''foreign'' DNA in a process called ''restriction digestion''; meanwhile, host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme (a [[methyltransferase]]) that [[DNA methylation|modifies]] the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage.

The host cell, in this example ''E. coli'' K, is known as the restricting host and appears to have the ability to reduce the biological activity of the phage \u03bb. If a phage becomes established in one strain, the ability of that phage to grow also becomes restricted in other strains. In the 1960s, it was shown in work done in the laboratories of [[Werner Arber]] and [[Matthew Meselson]] that the restriction is caused by an enzymatic cleavage of the phage DNA, and the enzyme involved was therefore termed a restriction enzyme.<ref name=\"pmid4897066\" /><ref name=\"pmid4868368\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meselson M, Yuan R | title = DNA restriction enzyme from E. coli | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5134 | pages = 1110\u20134 | date = March 1968 | pmid = 4868368 | doi = 10.1038/2171110a0 | bibcode = 1968Natur.217.1110M }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid13888713\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dussoix D, Arber W | title = Host specificity of DNA produced by Escherichia coli.

For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short ''polylinker'' sequence (called the [[multiple cloning site]], or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since it is necessary to avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a [[DNA ligase]].<ref name=\"urlCloning using restriction enzymes\">{{cite web | url = http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/restriction_enzymes/ | title = Cloning using restriction enzymes | author = Geerlof A | publisher = European Molecular Biology Laboratory - Hamburg | access-date = 2008-06-07}}</ref><ref name=\"isbn0-87969-576-5\">{{cite book | vauthors = Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | edition =  | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-87969-576-5 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/molecularcloning0000samb_p7p5 }}</ref>\n\nRestriction enzymes can also be used to distinguish gene [[allele]]s by specifically recognizing single base changes in DNA known as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs).<ref name=\"pmid18330346\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JN, Gemmell NJ | title = Combining allele-specific fluorescent probes and restriction assay in real-time PCR to achieve SNP scoring beyond allele ratios of 1:1000 | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 193\u20134, 196, 199 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18330346 | doi = 10.2144/000112719 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15980518\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang R, Zhu Z, Zhu H, Nguyen T, Yao F, Xia K, Liang D, Liu C | display-authors = 6 | title = SNP Cutter: a comprehensive tool for SNP PCR-RFLP assay design | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W489-92 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15980518 | pmc = 1160119 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gki358 }}</ref> This is however only possible if a SNP alters the restriction site present in the allele. In this method, the restriction enzyme can be used to [[genotype]] a DNA sample without the need for expensive [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]]. The sample is first digested with the restriction enzyme to generate DNA fragments, and then the different sized fragments separated by [[gel electrophoresis]]. In general, alleles with correct restriction sites will generate two visible bands of DNA on the gel, and those with altered restriction sites will not be cut and will generate only a single band. A [[restriction map|DNA map]] by restriction digest can also be generated that can give the relative positions of the genes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/mapping-282 |title=Mapping |work=Nature }}</ref>  The  different lengths of DNA generated by restriction digest also produce a specific pattern of bands after gel electrophoresis, and can be used for [[DNA fingerprinting]].\n\nIn a similar manner, restriction enzymes are used to digest [[genomic]] DNA for gene analysis by [[Southern blot]]. This technique allows researchers to identify how many copies (or [[paralogue]]s) of a gene are present in the genome of one individual, or how many gene [[mutation]]s ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]) have occurred within a population. The latter example is called [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism|restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP).<ref name=\"isbn0-7167-4684-0\">{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | edition = Fifth | publisher = W.H.

ZFN work in pairs, their dimerization being mediated in-situ through the ''Fok''I domain. Each zinc finger array (ZFA) is capable of recognizing 9\u201312 base pairs, making for 18\u201324 for the pair. A 5\u20137 bp spacer between the cleavage sites further enhances the specificity of ZFN, making them a safe and more precise tool that can be applied in humans.

He is also openly [[racist]] and [[homophobic]], but at the same time he is sexually attracted to other men and regularly has secret [[Men who have sex with men|sexual encounters]] with other white closeted men.\n\nAt his daughter's wedding reception, he meets Christian Roodt (Charlie Keegan), the handsome young son of old family friends who live in [[Cape Town]]. Christian is studying law at university while also enjoying a budding side career as a male model. Fran\u00e7ois becomes infatuated with Christian, learning everything he can about him. When Fran\u00e7ois' other daughter Anika later starts dating Christian, Fran\u00e7ois becomes jealous and contrives a way to punish her.\n\nDuring a visit to his doctor for an examination, it becomes clear that Fran\u00e7ois is suffering from psychological problems that are affecting his health, no doubt partly related to his inability to come to terms with his true sexuality.\n\nAfter telling his wife he needs to go to Cape Town on business for a few days, Fran\u00e7ois goes to visit the Roodts so that he can be around Christian. When Christian is not there, he asks for Christian's phone number under the pretext of discussing a legal matter with him. Later, after getting drunk in a gay bar in the city, Fran\u00e7ois calls Christian and asks him to come and collect him. Christian obliges and the two have a meal. Fran\u00e7ois is thrilled at the chance of being alone with him, and later invites him back to his hotel room for a drink. Once there, Christian takes the opportunity to ask Fran\u00e7ois if he would invest in his plan to start his own business. Suspecting that Christian may not actually be interested in him but only his money, Fran\u00e7ois clumsily attempts to kiss him but is gently rebuffed. After a few moments, Fran\u00e7ois then unexpectedly erupts into a violent rage and assaults and rapes Christian.\n\nDays later, back at home, Fran\u00e7ois asks Anika if she is still seeing Christian but she says she hasn't heard from him in a while.

To this end, Curtis founded the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book ''The Commonwealth of God'', began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to [[Protestant churches]] as being the work of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] to elicit their support.<ref>Curtis, Lionel.

Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state [[Elihu Root]], that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921.

Quigley also argued that, although the [[Round Table movement#Current organisation and membership|Round Table still exists today]], its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during [[World War I]] and slowly waned after the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Today the Round Table is largely a [[ginger group]], designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but faces strong opposition.

In the past the conspirators were usually said to be [[crypto-communism|crypto-communists]] who were intent upon bringing the [[United States]] under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the [[United Nations]] as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American [[The Establishment|Establishment]] to give it anything but a limited role.<ref name=\"Domhoff 2005\"/>\n\nAlthough skeptical of New World Order conspiracism, political scientist [[David Rothkopf]] argues, in the 2008 book ''[[Superclass (book)|Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making]]'', that the world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the [[great power]]s provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]) and entrepreneurs ([[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]], [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]]).

To this end, Curtis founded the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book ''The Commonwealth of God'', began advocating for the creation of an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to [[Protestant churches]] as being the work of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] to elicit their support.<ref>Curtis, Lionel. ''Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God'' London (1938).

Originally envisioned as a group of American and British scholars and diplomats, some of whom belonging to the Round Table movement, it was a subsequent group of 108 New York financiers, manufacturers and international lawyers organized in June 1918 by Nobel Peace Prize recipient and U.S. secretary of state [[Elihu Root]], that became the Council on Foreign Relations on 29 July 1921. The first of the council's projects was a quarterly journal launched in September 1922, called ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/about/history/cfr/index.html|title=About CFR|website=Council on Foreign Relations}}</ref> The [[Trilateral Commission]] was founded in July 1973, at the initiative of American banker [[David Rockefeller]], who was chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations at that time. It is a private organization established to foster closer cooperation among the United States, Europe and Japan. The Trilateral Commission is widely seen as a counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] individuals and groups with a [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] worldview, such as members of the [[John Birch Society]], were the first to combine and spread a [[business nationalism|business nationalist]] critique of [[neoliberalism|corporate internationalists]] networked through think tanks such as the Council on Foreign Relations with a grand conspiracy theory casting them as [[front organization]]s for the Round Table of the \"Anglo-American [[the Establishment|Establishment]]\", which are financed by an \"international banking cabal\" that has supposedly been plotting from the late 19th century on to impose an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] new world order through a [[global financial system]].

Quigley also argued that, although the [[Round Table movement#Current organisation and membership|Round Table still exists today]], its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during [[World War I]] and slowly waned after the end of [[World War II]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Today the Round Table is largely a [[ginger group]], designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.<ref name=\"Scienta Press\"/>\n\n[[Larry McDonald]], the second president of the [[John Birch Society]] and a [[conservative Democrat]]ic member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who represented the 7th congressional district of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], wrote a foreword for [[Gary Allen|Allen]]'s 1976 book ''The Rockefeller File'', wherein he claimed that the Rockefellers and their allies were driven by a desire to create a one-world government that combined \"super-[[capitalism]]\" with [[communism]] and would be fully under their control.

In the past the conspirators were usually said to be [[crypto-communism|crypto-communists]] who were intent upon bringing the [[United States]] under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the USSR]] in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the [[United Nations]] as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American [[The Establishment|Establishment]] to give it anything but a limited role.<ref name=\"Domhoff 2005\"/>\n\nAlthough skeptical of New World Order conspiracism, political scientist [[David Rothkopf]] argues, in the 2008 book ''[[Superclass (book)|Superclass: The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making]]'', that the world population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the [[great power]]s provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]]) and entrepreneurs ([[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]], [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]]).

It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism\u2014as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Working Definition of Antisemitism \n |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf \n |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights \n |accessdate=24 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304162430/http://www.fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf\n |archivedate=4 March 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency.

Having analyzed Judeophobia as an hereditary form of demonopathy, peculiar to the human race, and represented Jew-hatred as based upon an inherited aberration of the human mind, we must draw the important conclusion, that we must give up contending against these hostile impulses, just as we give up contending against every other inherited predisposition.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Leon Pinsker|last1=Pinsker|first1=Leon|translator-last=Blondheim|translator-first=D.S.|title=Auto-Emancipation|date=1906|publisher=The Maccabaean Publishing Company|location=New York|pages=3, 4|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hw5rcs;view=1up;seq=15}}, [[s:Auto-Emancipation|English]] and [https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%98%D7%95-%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%94 Hebrew] translations.</ref> }}\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: \"The German people is anti-Semitic.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or \"Aryans\", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nRacial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nAccording to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" However, with racial antisemitism, \"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews...

The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly \"German\" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:<ref name=bismarck />\n\n{{quote|According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.<ref name=bismarck />}}\n\nAlthough originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.<ref name=bismarck />\n \nAntisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857.

[[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[\u00c9mile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him.

In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished.

Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.\nIn June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948\u20139, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand per year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:\nIn 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021224192927/http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm ]</ref> By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco.

In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.\nTunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.\nIn 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France.

He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Ant\u00e9bi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. \u2026 It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. \u2026 Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\"<ref name=\"kuperwasser\">{{cite news |title=Palestinian incitement continuing unabated|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos].\" ''National Review''. 4 August 2014.</ref>\n\n=====Saudi Arabia=====\n{{Main|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia|History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi-Arabian textbook controversy|Saudi textbooks]] vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in [[Jihad]] to vanquish Jews.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |authorlink=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, [[far-left antisemitism]] and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006.

The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, \"with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views.\" The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech.

His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums \u00fcber das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', \"antisemitism\".\n\nThe pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),<ref>{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}</ref> apparently named to follow the \"Anti-Kanzler-Liga\" (Anti-Chancellor League).<ref name=\"MZ1987\"/> The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.\n\nSo far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.\n\nThe [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, \"In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use (\"Allg.

It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism\u2014as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Working Definition of Antisemitism \n |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf \n |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights \n |accessdate=24 July 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304162430/http://www.fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf\n |archivedate=4 March 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> Late in 2013, the definition was removed from the website of the Fundamental Rights Agency.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or \"Aryans\", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nRacial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nAccording to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. \"The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism.\" However, with racial antisemitism, \"Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear.\"<ref>Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.</ref>\n\nIn the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.<ref>Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''.

Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853\u20135.

Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: \"I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]].

[[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.<ref>[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432</ref>\n\nAt the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.<ref>[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172</ref>\n\n===Secular or racial antisemitism===\n[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]\n[[File:L Agitation-Antisemite.jpg|thumb|Anti-Semitic agitators in Paris burn an effigy of Mathieu Dreyfus during the [[Dreyfus affair]]]]\nIn 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] \u2013 who has been called \"the inventor of modern antisemitism\"<ref name=bismarck /> \u2013 published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly \"Jewishness in Music\"<ref name=bismarck>[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388\u201390. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}</ref>) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly \"German\" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:<ref name=bismarck />\n\n{{quote|According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.<ref name=bismarck />}}\n\nAlthough originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.<ref name=bismarck />\n \nAntisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in \"The Good Bargain\" (\"''Der gute Handel\"'') and \"[[The Jew Among Thorns]]\" (''\"Der Jude im Dorn\"'').\n\nThe middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.<ref name=BDE>{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}</ref>\n\nIn America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews.

[[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[\u00c9mile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.<ref>Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe.

Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.<ref>{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&pg=PA72 72]}}</ref> The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.<ref>{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&nbsp;72]}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented modern incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]]s in Europe.

In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.<ref name=\"harris\">Harris, 2001, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\nUpon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews canceled.\n\n===== Morocco =====\n{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}\n[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years.

Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.\nIn June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948\u20139, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand per year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:\nIn 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021224192927/http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm ]</ref> By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.\nThe [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco.

In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.\nTunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.\nIn 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated.

He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Ant\u00e9bi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. \u2026 It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. \u2026 Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'</ref>]]\n\nIn March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that \"Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books,\" to the extent that they are \"an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is \"going on all the time\" and that it is \"worrying and disturbing.\" At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: \"that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews.\"<ref name=\"kuperwasser\">{{cite news |title=Palestinian incitement continuing unabated|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].<ref>[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos].\" ''National Review''. 4 August 2014.</ref>\n\n=====Saudi Arabia=====\n{{Main|Antisemitism in Saudi Arabia|History of the Jews in Saudi Arabia}}\n\n[[Saudi-Arabian textbook controversy|Saudi textbooks]] vilify Jews, call Jews apes; demand that students avoid and not befriend Jews; claim that Jews worship the devil; and encourage Muslims to engage in [[Jihad]] to vanquish Jews.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shea |first=Nina |authorlink=Nina Shea |title=This is a Saudi textbook.

The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, \"with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views.\" The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]].

Cohen beginning in the mid-1980s. It is a philosophical variant of [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT), which was developed by psychologist [[Albert Ellis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Raabe|first=Peter B.|title=Philosophical Counseling: Theory and Practice|year=2001|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schuster|first=Schlomit|title=Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy|year=1999|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The Use of Syllogism in Rational-Emotive Therapy|journal=[[Journal of Counseling & Development]]|year=1987|volume=66|issue=1|pages=37\u201339|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1987.tb00779.x}}</ref> However, there have been no independent, controlled studies to measure its therapeutic value or advantages over classical REBT.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAccording to the theory of LBT, people decide to make themselves upset emotionally and behaviorally by deducing self-defeating emotional and behavioral conclusions from irrational premises.<ref name=robertson>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Donald|title=REBT, Philosophy, and Philosophical Counseling|journal=Practical Philosophy |year=2000|volume=3|series=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title='Philosophical Counseling: Some Roles of Critical Thinking'. In Ran Lahav & Maria Da Venza Tillmans (ed.) Essays in Philosophical Counseling|year=1995|publisher=University Presses of America|location=New York|pages=121\u2013131}}</ref> LBT retains the theoretical base of the cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, insofar as it contends emotional and behavioral problems to be rooted in malignant and maladaptive thought processes and patterns. LBT considers itself not only a type of philosophical counseling, but a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. At the same time, LBT remains firmly planted in philosophy by way of the use of [[formal logic]], [[informal logic]], phenomenological [[intentionality]], and philosophical antidotes in conceptualizing and treating [[mental disorder]]s and psychosocial difficulties.\n\nIn contrast to classical REBT, LBT recasts REBT's [[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Theoretical assumptions|A-B-C model]] of psychological disturbance into [[Syllogism|syllogistic logic]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Syllogizing RET: Applying Formal Logic in Rational-Emotive Therapy|journal=Journal of Rational-Emotive & Cognitive Behavior Therapy|year=1992|volume=10|series=1|pages=235\u2013252|doi=10.1007/BF01062377|issue=4}}</ref> According to classical REBT, there are three psychological points: Point A (Activating event), Point B (Belief system), and Point C (behavioral and emotional Consequence). Ellis argued that the Activating event itself does not cause people to be upset (C); they require also a set of Beliefs that, in conjunction with the event, causes a self-defeating behavioral and emotional Consequence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors|url=https://archive.org/details/overcomingdestru00albe|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amherst, NY}}</ref> For example, it is not just having recently been divorced (Point A) that causes a depression (point C), but also the belief that this event is awful and the worst thing that could have happened. Thus, according to Ellis, by finding the particular Activating event and Belief, one can find out what is causing one's depression (C). Clients can then work on changing their Belief system and their behavior to overcome the depression.\n\nLBT translates the A-B-C model of psychological disturbance into a form of [[deductive logic]], in particular, syllogistic logic. According to its logic-based approach, the causal model Ellis advanced is not accurate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Principles of Logic-Based Therapy|journal=Practical Philosophy |year=2006|volume=6|series=2}}</ref> The depression is not caused by events that occur inside (Point B) and outside (Point A) one's subjective world. Instead, one decides to feel depressed by deducing a conclusion from a set of premises.<ref name=robertson/> For example, one may depress oneself by setting up this syllogism:\n\n# If I was divorced, then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n# I was divorced.\n# So, what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n\n== Syllogistic logic ==\n\nA [[syllogism]] is a [[deductive]] form of reasoning having two premises and a conclusion. The idea that the reasoning behind our [[emotions]] and behavior can be so ordered in terms of a syllogism was in fact an insight of Aristotle, who called this kind of syllogism a \"[[practical syllogism]].\" The distinctive feature of this type of deductive reasoning is that the conclusion prescribes something. That is, it evaluates or rates the thing in question instead of merely describing it. For example, in concluding that something is terrible, a person is negatively rating it, and therefore will act or tend to act and feel negatively toward it. In fact, Aristotle went so far as to claim that the conclusion of a practical syllogism was always an action.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKeon|first=Richard|title=The Basic Works of Aristotle|url=https://archive.org/details/basicworksofaris00aris|url-access=registration|year=1941|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nAccording to LBT, by syllogizing one's behavioral and [[emotional reasoning]] in terms of the practical syllogism, one is in a better position to find one's irrational premises, refute them, and replace the unsound reasoning with sound \"antidotal\" reasoning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=What Would Aristotle Do? Self-Control Through the Power of Reason|year=2003|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amherst, NY}}</ref> For example, the first premise in the above syllogism is irrational because one is exaggerating just how bad the divorce is (thinking of it as though it were on the level of a catastrophic disease or natural disaster).\n\n== Intentional objects and their ratings ==\n\nLBT also accepts the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] thesis that every mental state, including emotions, has a so-called \"intentional object\" or \"[[object of the mind]].\" That is, there is always an object to which a mental state refers or is about. Thus, if one is depressed, then one is depressed ''about'' something. This intentional object is represented in the descriptive minor premise of the emotional reasoning, for example, the premise \"I was divorced\" in the aforementioned syllogism.<ref name=cohen>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Critical Thinking Unleashed|year=2009|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Landham, MD}}</ref> In addition, the syllogisms comprising emotional reasoning always rate the emotional object or some aspect of it.<ref name=cohen /> For example, in the aforementioned syllogism, one rates one's divorce as being \"terrible\". This rating element is represented in the consequent (then clause) of the major premise of the syllogism, as in the premise \"If I was divorced, then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\" Accordingly, the syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be constructed by first finding the intentional object (O) of one's emotion; and second, by finding the rating (R) of the emotion. As such, the valid, hypothetical structure of a syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be symbolized as follows:\n\n# If O then R\n# O\n# Therefore R\n\nFurther, according to LBT, all emotions can be uniquely identified by their specific object (O) and rating (R) elements.<ref name=cohen /> For example, the O of anger is always an action; and the rating is a strong negative evaluation of the action itself or the individual performing the action. In depression, the O is an event or state of affairs; and the R is a strong negative rating of the said event or state of affairs, on the basis of which one strongly negatively rates one's own existence. Thus, one may rate one's divorce as terrible, on the basis of which one gives one's own existence a strongly negatively evaluation.\n\n== Higher order premises <!--Section linked from [[Coherence therapy]] and [[List of maladaptive schemas]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--> ==\n{{See also|Coherence therapy#Hierarchical organization of constructs}}\nLBT permits clients to trace their inferences to higher order premises that might be at the root of an emotional and behavioral disturbance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The Process of Logic-Based Therapy|journal=Pratiche Filosofiche|year=2003|volume=2}}</ref> For example, by questioning why having been divorced is so bad, another higher level syllogism can be uncovered:\n\n# If I was divorced, then that makes me a worthless loser.\n# If that makes me a worthless loser then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n# So, if I was divorced, what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n\nEven higher order premises at the root of the behavioral and emotional disturbance can be uncovered, for example, by asking why being divorced makes one a worthless loser. For example, this higher order syllogism might be uncovered:\n\n# I must always be perfect and never fail at anything.\n# If I must always be perfect and never fail at anything, then if I was divorced, that makes me a worthless loser.\n# So, if I was a divorced then that makes me a worthless loser.\n\nIn this way, the [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can be traced back to a demand for perfection from which a person is deducing their own worthlessness, from which they are in turn deducing the horribleness of what happened.\n\nIn contrast to classical REBT, LBT identifies positive [[virtue]]s that can be used to guide a person in overcoming his or her irrational beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tukiainen|first=Arto|title=Philosophical Counselling as a Process of Fostering Wisdom in the Form of Virtues|url=http://www.practical-philosophy.org.uk/journal/pdf/10-1%20047%20Tukiainen%20-%20Fostering%20Virtues.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=rational>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The New Rational Therapy: Thinking Your Way to Serenity, Success, and Profound Happiness|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Landham, MD}}</ref> According to LBT, all basic irrational beliefs (\"cardinal fallacies\") identified by REBT theorists and philosophers are related to \"transcendent virtues\" that can overcome them.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Mike w.|title=Happiness, Virtue, and Truth in Cohen's Logic-Based Therapy|journal=[[International Journal of Applied Philosophy]]|year=2007|volume=21|series=1|pages=129\u2013133|doi=10.5840/ijap200721122}}</ref> The following chart displays each such irrational belief and its respective trumping virtue:<ref name=rational />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:70%;\"\n|-\n! Cardinal fallacy !! Transcendent virtue\n|-\n| Demanding perfection|| Metaphysical security (security about reality)\n|-\n| Awfulizing|| Courage (in face of evil)\n|-\n| Damnation (of self, others, and the universe)|| Respect (for self, others, and the universe)\n|-\n| Jumping on the bandwagon|| Authenticity (being one's own person)\n|-\n| Can'tstipation|| Temperance (self-control)\n|-\n| Dutiful worrying|| Moral creativity (in confronting and resolving problems)\n|-\n| Manipulation|| Empowerment of others\n|-\n| The world revolves around me|| Empathy (connecting with others)\n|-\n| Oversimplifying reality|| Good judgment (in making objective, unbiased discernments in practical affairs)\n|-\n| Distorting probabilities|| Foresightedness (in assessing probabilities)\n|-\n| Blind conjecture|| Scientificity (in providing explanations)\n|}\n\n== LBT's positive psychology ==\n\nLBT thereby includes a \"[[positive psychology]]\" in addition to the classical REBT emphasis on refuting irrational beliefs. As a philosophical counseling approach, LBT also applies philosophical antidotes derived from the philosophies of antiquity to help clients strive toward their transcendent virtues.<ref name=rational /> For example, the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]] that says to \"treat oneself and others as ends in themselves and not as mere means\" can be used as an antidote to damnation of self or others, and thus as a sort of recipe to attaining the transcendent virtue of respect for self and others. Similarly, [[Frederich Nietzsche]]'s theory about human suffering, which says that suffering can make one stronger and nobler, can be used as an antidote to catastrophic thinking (\"Awfulizing\") about personal loss, thereby building courage in confronting the loss and using it to create new positive meanings and values in one's existence.\n\n== Cultivation of willpower ==\n\nLBT also emphasizes willpower in changing and redirecting beliefs and actions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Logic-Based Therapy: The New Philosophical Frontier for REBT|url=http://www.rebtnetwork.org/essays/logic.html/|accessdate=9 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830075901/http://www.rebtnetwork.org/essays/logic.html|archive-date=30 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> While it makes no commitment to the existence of free will in any metaphysical sense, it recognizes the practical value of building \"willpower muscle\" as a means to overcoming [[cognitive dissonance]] and working towards one's transcendent virtues. LBT emphasizes and promotes the power one has to change the way in which an event or situation is interpreted by altering one's thought patterns.\n\n== Logic-based therapy and psychotherapy ==\n\nWhile LBT is a form of philosophical counseling, since it addresses client's emotional problems and provides systematic ways of resolving them it can also be considered a form of [[psychotherapy]]. More specifically, because its focus on the client's cognitions and behaviors in relation to emotional functioning and relationship with REBT it is also a type of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). However, LBT differentiates itself from some other forms of CBT by emphasizing how premises about emotions are deduced and inferred from experiences in the world: LBT suggests that all emotional responses have a logical structure to them. The fact that emotions contain logical structures which can be subject to investigation and revision was also supported in the philosopher [[Robert C. Solomon]]'s cognitivist theory of emotions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=R. C.|title=The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life|url=https://archive.org/details/passions00robe|url-access=registration|origyear=1976|year=1993|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN}}</ref>\n \nLBT further differs from other forms of psychotherapy. For example, [[psychoanalytic]] or psychodynamic traditions will look for the underlying causes of emotional problems. These approaches will explore the client's early relationships with significant others (e.g., parental figures) and their effect on current relationships and resultant emotional and behavioral disturbances. Interpretation is utilized to provide the client with insights into their psychic organization. In contrast (but like other types of CBT), LBT does not place any particular emphasis on past relationships or the causes of problems and is even less concerned with interpretation. Instead, LBT remains philosophical insofar as it examines reasoning and logical structures created by client. The emphasis is not on the \"why\" of a problem, but on the \"how\"; that is, how the person deduces their emotional position and ways in which to alter it for more adaptive thinking and functioning.\n\nLBT's emphasis on the \"willpower muscle\" suggests the ability of agency and choice in regard to therapeutic change. Based upon the rejection of a [[deterministic]] causative framework in favor of a nondeterministic perspective, LBT maintains compatibility with [[existentialism]] and [[existential psychotherapy]].

Cohen beginning in the mid-1980s. It is a philosophical variant of [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT), which was developed by psychologist [[Albert Ellis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Raabe|first=Peter B.|title=Philosophical Counseling: Theory and Practice|year=2001|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schuster|first=Schlomit|title=Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy|year=1999|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The Use of Syllogism in Rational-Emotive Therapy|journal=[[Journal of Counseling & Development]]|year=1987|volume=66|issue=1|pages=37\u201339|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1987.tb00779.x}}</ref> However, there have been no independent, controlled studies to measure its therapeutic value or advantages over classical REBT.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAccording to the theory of LBT, people decide to make themselves upset emotionally and behaviorally by deducing self-defeating emotional and behavioral conclusions from irrational premises.<ref name=robertson>{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Donald|title=REBT, Philosophy, and Philosophical Counseling|journal=Practical Philosophy |year=2000|volume=3|series=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title='Philosophical Counseling: Some Roles of Critical Thinking'. In Ran Lahav & Maria Da Venza Tillmans (ed.) Essays in Philosophical Counseling|year=1995|publisher=University Presses of America|location=New York|pages=121\u2013131}}</ref> LBT retains the theoretical base of the cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, insofar as it contends emotional and behavioral problems to be rooted in malignant and maladaptive thought processes and patterns. LBT considers itself not only a type of philosophical counseling, but a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy. At the same time, LBT remains firmly planted in philosophy by way of the use of [[formal logic]], [[informal logic]], phenomenological [[intentionality]], and philosophical antidotes in conceptualizing and treating [[mental disorder]]s and psychosocial difficulties.\n\nIn contrast to classical REBT, LBT recasts REBT's [[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Theoretical assumptions|A-B-C model]] of psychological disturbance into [[Syllogism|syllogistic logic]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Syllogizing RET: Applying Formal Logic in Rational-Emotive Therapy|journal=Journal of Rational-Emotive & Cognitive Behavior Therapy|year=1992|volume=10|series=1|pages=235\u2013252|doi=10.1007/BF01062377|issue=4}}</ref> According to classical REBT, there are three psychological points: Point A (Activating event), Point B (Belief system), and Point C (behavioral and emotional Consequence). Ellis argued that the Activating event itself does not cause people to be upset (C); they require also a set of Beliefs that, in conjunction with the event, causes a self-defeating behavioral and emotional Consequence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors|url=https://archive.org/details/overcomingdestru00albe|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amherst, NY}}</ref> For example, it is not just having recently been divorced (Point A) that causes a depression (point C), but also the belief that this event is awful and the worst thing that could have happened. Thus, according to Ellis, by finding the particular Activating event and Belief, one can find out what is causing one's depression (C). Clients can then work on changing their Belief system and their behavior to overcome the depression.\n\nLBT translates the A-B-C model of psychological disturbance into a form of [[deductive logic]], in particular, syllogistic logic. According to its logic-based approach, the causal model Ellis advanced is not accurate.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Principles of Logic-Based Therapy|journal=Practical Philosophy |year=2006|volume=6|series=2}}</ref> The depression is not caused by events that occur inside (Point B) and outside (Point A) one's subjective world. Instead, one decides to feel depressed by deducing a conclusion from a set of premises.<ref name=robertson/> For example, one may depress oneself by setting up this syllogism:\n\n# If I was divorced, then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n# I was divorced.\n# So, what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n\n== Syllogistic logic ==\n\nA [[syllogism]] is a [[deductive]] form of reasoning having two premises and a conclusion. The idea that the reasoning behind our [[emotions]] and behavior can be so ordered in terms of a syllogism was in fact an insight of Aristotle, who called this kind of syllogism a \"[[practical syllogism]].\" The distinctive feature of this type of deductive reasoning is that the conclusion prescribes something. That is, it evaluates or rates the thing in question instead of merely describing it. For example, in concluding that something is terrible, a person is negatively rating it, and therefore will act or tend to act and feel negatively toward it. In fact, Aristotle went so far as to claim that the conclusion of a practical syllogism was always an action.<ref>{{cite book|last=McKeon|first=Richard|title=The Basic Works of Aristotle|url=https://archive.org/details/basicworksofaris00aris|url-access=registration|year=1941|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nAccording to LBT, by syllogizing one's behavioral and [[emotional reasoning]] in terms of the practical syllogism, one is in a better position to find one's irrational premises, refute them, and replace the unsound reasoning with sound \"antidotal\" reasoning.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=What Would Aristotle Do? Self-Control Through the Power of Reason|year=2003|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amherst, NY}}</ref> For example, the first premise in the above syllogism is irrational because one is exaggerating just how bad the divorce is (thinking of it as though it were on the level of a catastrophic disease or natural disaster).\n\n== Intentional objects and their ratings ==\n\nLBT also accepts the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] thesis that every mental state, including emotions, has a so-called \"intentional object\" or \"[[object of the mind]].\" That is, there is always an object to which a mental state refers or is about. Thus, if one is depressed, then one is depressed ''about'' something. This intentional object is represented in the descriptive minor premise of the emotional reasoning, for example, the premise \"I was divorced\" in the aforementioned syllogism.<ref name=cohen>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Critical Thinking Unleashed|year=2009|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Landham, MD}}</ref> In addition, the syllogisms comprising emotional reasoning always rate the emotional object or some aspect of it.<ref name=cohen /> For example, in the aforementioned syllogism, one rates one's divorce as being \"terrible\". This rating element is represented in the consequent (then clause) of the major premise of the syllogism, as in the premise \"If I was divorced, then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\" Accordingly, the syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be constructed by first finding the intentional object (O) of one's emotion; and second, by finding the rating (R) of the emotion. As such, the valid, hypothetical structure of a syllogism comprising one's emotional reasoning can be symbolized as follows:\n\n# If O then R\n# O\n# Therefore R\n\nFurther, according to LBT, all emotions can be uniquely identified by their specific object (O) and rating (R) elements.<ref name=cohen /> For example, the O of anger is always an action; and the rating is a strong negative evaluation of the action itself or the individual performing the action. In depression, the O is an event or state of affairs; and the R is a strong negative rating of the said event or state of affairs, on the basis of which one strongly negatively rates one's own existence. Thus, one may rate one's divorce as terrible, on the basis of which one gives one's own existence a strongly negatively evaluation.\n\n== Higher order premises <!--Section linked from [[Coherence therapy]] and [[List of maladaptive schemas]]: do not rename without fixing incoming link (see [[MOS:HEAD]])--> ==\n{{See also|Coherence therapy#Hierarchical organization of constructs}}\nLBT permits clients to trace their inferences to higher order premises that might be at the root of an emotional and behavioral disturbance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The Process of Logic-Based Therapy|journal=Pratiche Filosofiche|year=2003|volume=2}}</ref> For example, by questioning why having been divorced is so bad, another higher level syllogism can be uncovered:\n\n# If I was divorced, then that makes me a worthless loser.\n# If that makes me a worthless loser then what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n# So, if I was divorced, what happened to me is so terrible that I might as well be dead.\n\nEven higher order premises at the root of the behavioral and emotional disturbance can be uncovered, for example, by asking why being divorced makes one a worthless loser. For example, this higher order syllogism might be uncovered:\n\n# I must always be perfect and never fail at anything.\n# If I must always be perfect and never fail at anything, then if I was divorced, that makes me a worthless loser.\n# So, if I was a divorced then that makes me a worthless loser.\n\nIn this way, the [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can be traced back to a demand for perfection from which a person is deducing their own worthlessness, from which they are in turn deducing the horribleness of what happened.\n\nIn contrast to classical REBT, LBT identifies positive [[virtue]]s that can be used to guide a person in overcoming his or her irrational beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tukiainen|first=Arto|title=Philosophical Counselling as a Process of Fostering Wisdom in the Form of Virtues|url=http://www.practical-philosophy.org.uk/journal/pdf/10-1%20047%20Tukiainen%20-%20Fostering%20Virtues.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref><ref name=rational>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=The New Rational Therapy: Thinking Your Way to Serenity, Success, and Profound Happiness|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|location=Landham, MD}}</ref> According to LBT, all basic irrational beliefs (\"cardinal fallacies\") identified by REBT theorists and philosophers are related to \"transcendent virtues\" that can overcome them.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Mike w.|title=Happiness, Virtue, and Truth in Cohen's Logic-Based Therapy|journal=[[International Journal of Applied Philosophy]]|year=2007|volume=21|series=1|pages=129\u2013133|doi=10.5840/ijap200721122}}</ref> The following chart displays each such irrational belief and its respective trumping virtue:<ref name=rational />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:70%;\"\n|-\n!

As a philosophical counseling approach, LBT also applies philosophical antidotes derived from the philosophies of antiquity to help clients strive toward their transcendent virtues.<ref name=rational /> For example, the [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[categorical imperative]] that says to \"treat oneself and others as ends in themselves and not as mere means\" can be used as an antidote to damnation of self or others, and thus as a sort of recipe to attaining the transcendent virtue of respect for self and others. Similarly, [[Frederich Nietzsche]]'s theory about human suffering, which says that suffering can make one stronger and nobler, can be used as an antidote to catastrophic thinking (\"Awfulizing\") about personal loss, thereby building courage in confronting the loss and using it to create new positive meanings and values in one's existence.\n\n== Cultivation of willpower ==\n\nLBT also emphasizes willpower in changing and redirecting beliefs and actions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Elliot D.|title=Logic-Based Therapy: The New Philosophical Frontier for REBT|url=http://www.rebtnetwork.org/essays/logic.html/|accessdate=9 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830075901/http://www.rebtnetwork.org/essays/logic.html|archive-date=30 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> While it makes no commitment to the existence of free will in any metaphysical sense, it recognizes the practical value of building \"willpower muscle\" as a means to overcoming [[cognitive dissonance]] and working towards one's transcendent virtues. LBT emphasizes and promotes the power one has to change the way in which an event or situation is interpreted by altering one's thought patterns.\n\n== Logic-based therapy and psychotherapy ==\n\nWhile LBT is a form of philosophical counseling, since it addresses client's emotional problems and provides systematic ways of resolving them it can also be considered a form of [[psychotherapy]]. More specifically, because its focus on the client's cognitions and behaviors in relation to emotional functioning and relationship with REBT it is also a type of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). However, LBT differentiates itself from some other forms of CBT by emphasizing how premises about emotions are deduced and inferred from experiences in the world: LBT suggests that all emotional responses have a logical structure to them. The fact that emotions contain logical structures which can be subject to investigation and revision was also supported in the philosopher [[Robert C. Solomon]]'s cognitivist theory of emotions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=R. C.|title=The Passions: Emotions and the Meaning of Life|url=https://archive.org/details/passions00robe|url-access=registration|origyear=1976|year=1993|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN}}</ref>\n \nLBT further differs from other forms of psychotherapy. For example, [[psychoanalytic]] or psychodynamic traditions will look for the underlying causes of emotional problems. These approaches will explore the client's early relationships with significant others (e.g., parental figures) and their effect on current relationships and resultant emotional and behavioral disturbances. Interpretation is utilized to provide the client with insights into their psychic organization. In contrast (but like other types of CBT), LBT does not place any particular emphasis on past relationships or the causes of problems and is even less concerned with interpretation. Instead, LBT remains philosophical insofar as it examines reasoning and logical structures created by client. The emphasis is not on the \"why\" of a problem, but on the \"how\"; that is, how the person deduces their emotional position and ways in which to alter it for more adaptive thinking and functioning.\n\nLBT's emphasis on the \"willpower muscle\" suggests the ability of agency and choice in regard to therapeutic change. Based upon the rejection of a [[deterministic]] causative framework in favor of a nondeterministic perspective, LBT maintains compatibility with [[existentialism]] and [[existential psychotherapy]]. This position of choice is central to existentialist philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s thinking on human freedom and responsibility, which is one of existential psychotherapist [[Irvin Yalom]]'s \"existential givens\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Yalom|first=I.|title=Existential Psychotherapy|url=https://archive.org/details/existentialpsych00yalorich|url-access=registration|year=1980|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}</ref> Here, clients are encouraged to confront their inherent freedom by way of choosing how to interpret situations.

Benedictines NG Prague, 150683.jpg|thumb|Inkhorn with [[ivory]] case ([[Prague]], 9th\u201313th century)]]\nAn '''inkhorn term''' is a [[loanword]] (or a word coined from existing roots) borrowed into English, which is deemed to be unnecessary or overly pretentious.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAn inkhorn is an [[inkwell]] made of [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]. It was an important item for many scholars which soon became symbolic of writers in general. Later, it became a byword for fussy or pedantic writers.\n\n{{ quote\n| And ere that we will suffer such a prince,<br />So kind a father of the commonweal,<br />To be disgrac\u00e8d by an inkhorn mate\n| ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]\n}}\n\n== Adoption ==\nControversy over inkhorn terms was rife from the mid-16th to the mid-17th century, during the transition from [[Middle English]] to [[Modern English]].  It was also a time when English competed with Latin as the main language of science and learning in England, having already displaced French.<ref>(227) ''A Biography of the English Language'', 2nd. Ed. C.M. Millward</ref> Many new words were being introduced into the language by writers, often self-consciously borrowing from [[Classical literature]]. Critics regarded these words as useless, usually requiring knowledge of Latin or [[Greek language|Greek]] to be understood.  They also contended that there were words with the same meaning already in English.  Some borrowed terms did indeed seem to fill a [[semantic gap]] in English (often technical and scientific words) whereas others coexisted with native ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) words and often displaced them. The phrase \"inkhorn term\" appeared as early as 1553.<ref>[[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]], ''The Arte of Rhetorique'', 1553: \"Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that wee neuer affect any straunge ynkehorne termes, but to speake as is commonly receiued:\" (modernized spelling: \"Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that we never affect any strange inkhorn terms, but to speak as is commonly received:\"),[http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/inkhorn.html Original texts from the inkhorn debate]</ref>\n\nWriters such as [[Thomas Elyot]] and [[George Pettie]] were enthusiastic borrowers of new words whereas [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]] and [[John Cheke]] argued against them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-time/early-modern-english-an-overview/|title=Early modern English \u2013 an overview|website=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref> Cheke wrote:\n\n{{ quote\n| I am of this opinion that [[Anglish|our own tung should be written cleane and pure]], unmixt and unmangeled with borowing of other tunges; wherein if we take not heed by tiim, ever borowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt.\n}}\n\nMany of these so-called inkhorn terms, such as ''dismiss'', ''celebrate'', ''encyclopedia'', ''commit'', ''capacity'' and ''ingenious'', stayed in the language and are commonly used. Many other [[neologism]]s faded soon after they were first used; for example ''expede'', which is now obsolete, although the synonym ''expedite'' and the similar word ''impede'' survive.

Benedictines NG Prague, 150683.jpg|thumb|Inkhorn with [[ivory]] case ([[Prague]], 9th\u201313th century)]]\nAn '''inkhorn term''' is a [[loanword]] (or a word coined from existing roots) borrowed into English, which is deemed to be unnecessary or overly pretentious.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAn inkhorn is an [[inkwell]] made of [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]. It was an important item for many scholars which soon became symbolic of writers in general. Later, it became a byword for fussy or pedantic writers.\n\n{{ quote\n| And ere that we will suffer such a prince,<br />So kind a father of the commonweal,<br />To be disgrac\u00e8d by an inkhorn mate\n| ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]\n}}\n\n== Adoption ==\nControversy over inkhorn terms was rife from the mid-16th to the mid-17th century, during the transition from [[Middle English]] to [[Modern English]].  It was also a time when English competed with Latin as the main language of science and learning in England, having already displaced French.<ref>(227) ''A Biography of the English Language'', 2nd. Ed. C.M. Millward</ref> Many new words were being introduced into the language by writers, often self-consciously borrowing from [[Classical literature]]. Critics regarded these words as useless, usually requiring knowledge of Latin or [[Greek language|Greek]] to be understood.  They also contended that there were words with the same meaning already in English.  Some borrowed terms did indeed seem to fill a [[semantic gap]] in English (often technical and scientific words) whereas others coexisted with native ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) words and often displaced them. The phrase \"inkhorn term\" appeared as early as 1553.<ref>[[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]], ''The Arte of Rhetorique'', 1553: \"Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that wee neuer affect any straunge ynkehorne termes, but to speake as is commonly receiued:\" (modernized spelling: \"Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that we never affect any strange inkhorn terms, but to speak as is commonly received:\"),[http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/inkhorn.html Original texts from the inkhorn debate]</ref>\n\nWriters such as [[Thomas Elyot]] and [[George Pettie]] were enthusiastic borrowers of new words whereas [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]] and [[John Cheke]] argued against them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-time/early-modern-english-an-overview/|title=Early modern English \u2013 an overview|website=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref> Cheke wrote:\n\n{{ quote\n| I am of this opinion that [[Anglish|our own tung should be written cleane and pure]], unmixt and unmangeled with borowing of other tunges; wherein if we take not heed by tiim, ever borowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt.\n}}\n\nMany of these so-called inkhorn terms, such as ''dismiss'', ''celebrate'', ''encyclopedia'', ''commit'', ''capacity'' and ''ingenious'', stayed in the language and are commonly used. Many other [[neologism]]s faded soon after they were first used; for example ''expede'', which is now obsolete, although the synonym ''expedite'' and the similar word ''impede'' survive. Faced with the influx of loanwords, some writers, as well known as [[Charles Dickens]] tried to either resurrect older English words (''gleeman'' for ''musician'' \u2013 see [[Glee (music)|glee]], ''sicker'' for ''certainly'', ''inwit'' for ''conscience'', ''yblent'' for ''confused'') or to coin brandnew words from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] roots (''endsay'' for ''conclusion'', ''yeartide'' for ''anniversary'', ''foresayer'' for ''prophet'').\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{see|Linguistic purism in English}}\nFew of these words, coined in opposition to inkhorn terms remained in common usage, and the writers who disdained the use of [[Latinate]] words often could not avoid using other loanwords.

AIR\u2019s home service comprises 420 stations located across the country, reaching nearly 92% of the country\u2019s area and 99.19% of the total population.

In [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], Akashvanis are often featured in stories as a medium of communication from heaven to mankind.\n\n'Akashvani' was first used in the context of radio by M. V. Gopalaswami in 1936 after setting up India's first private radio station in his residence, \"Vittal Vihar\" (about two hundred yards from AIR\u2019s current [[Mysore]] radio station).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/mysore-akashavani-is-now-75-years-old/408172/ |title=Mysore Akashavani is now 75 years old |newspaper=[[Business Standard]]}}</ref> ''Akashvani'' was later adopted as All India Radio's on-air name in 1957.\n\n==History==\nBroadcasting began in June 1923 during the [[British Raj]] with programs by the [[Bombay Presidency Radio Club]] and other radio clubs. According to an agreement on 23 July 1927, the private Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd (IBC) was authorized to operate two radio stations: the [[Bombay]] station which began on 23 July 1927, and the [[Calcutta]] station which followed on 26 August 1927. The company went into liquidation on 1 March 1930. The government took over the broadcasting facilities and began the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) on 1 April 1930 on an experimental basis for two years, and permanently in May 1932 it then went on to become All India Radio on 8 June 1936.<ref name=Milestones/>\n\nOn 1 October 1939, the External Service began with a broadcast in [[Pashto language|Pushtu]]. It was intended to counter radio [[propaganda]] from Germany directed at Afghanistan, Persia and Arab nations. 1939 also saw the opening of the [[Dhaka]] station of Eastern India, in what is now [[Bangladesh]]. This station catered and nurtured the pioneers of Bengali intellectuals. The foremost among them, [[Natyaguru]] [[Nurul Momen]], became the trail-blazer of the talk-show in 1939. He wrote and directed the first modern radio-play for this station in 1942. When India became independent in 1947, the AIR network had only six stations ([[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Calcutta]], [[Chennai]], [[Lucknow]], and [[Tiruchirappalli]]). The three radio stations at [[Lahore]], [[Peshawar]] and [[Dhaka]] remained in what became Pakistan after the division. The total number of radio sets in India at that time was about 275,000. On 3 October 1957, the ''[[Vividh Bharati]]'' Service was launched, to compete with [[Radio Ceylon]]. Television broadcasting began in Delhi in 1959 as part of AIR, but was split off from the radio network as ''[[Doordarshan]]'' on 1 April 1976.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://allindiaradio.org/Misc/AIR-Manual1/Chapter1.pdf |title=AIR Manual, Chapter 1: History of All India Radio |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917064450/http://allindiaradio.org/Misc/AIR-Manual1/Chapter1.pdf |archivedate=17 September 2010 }}</ref> FM broadcasting began on 23 July 1977 in [[Chennai]], and expanded during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allindiaradio.org/milestone.html |title=Milestones of AIR |publisher=All India Radio |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612212622/http://allindiaradio.org/milestone.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Deccan Radio (Nizam Radio 1932)]], the first radio station in [[Hyderabad State]] (now [[Hyderabad, India]]), went live on air on 3 February 1935.

In each language service, the program consists of news, commentary, a press review, talks on matters of general or cultural interest, feature programmes, documentaries and music from India and the target region. Most programs originate at New Broadcasting House on Parliament Street in New Delhi, with a few originating at SPT Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jalandhar, Kolkata, HPT Malad Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram and Tuticorin.\n\nThe External Services Division of AIR is a link between India and rest of the world, especially in countries with Indian emigrants and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|people of Indian origin]]. It broadcasts the Indian point of view on matters of national and international importance, and demonstrates the Indian way of life through its programs. [[QSL cards]] (which are sought-after by international radio hobbyists) are issued to radio hobbyists by AIR in New Delhi for [[reception report]]s of their broadcasts.\n\n==Direct-To-Home==\nDirect-to-home (DTH) service is a satellite broadcast service in which a large number of radio channels are digitally beamed down over a territory from a high-power satellite. AIR broadcasts various national and regional stations available to listen on [[DD Free Dish]]. The DTH signals can be received directly at homes using a small-sized dish receiver unit containing a dish antenna installed on a building\u2019s rooftop or on a wall facing clear south and one indoors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddindia.gov.in/Technical/Pages/DD-Free-Dish-(DTH).aspx|title=DD Free Dish (DTH)|website=ddindia.gov.in|access-date=2016-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719233025/http://www.ddindia.gov.in/Technical/Pages/DD-Free-Dish-(DTH).aspx|archive-date=19 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> DTH service is offered on twenty one channels via [[Indian National Satellite System|Insat]].\n\n===List of DTH channels===\n====National====\n* [[Vividh Bharati]] - Hindi Music Radio\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|AIR FM Rainbow India]] - Hindi & English Music Radio\n* [[AIR FM Gold|AIR FM Gold Delhi]] - Classic Hindi Music & News Radio\n* [[AIR Live News 24\u00d77]] - Hindi & English News Radio\n* [[AIR Urdu]] - Urdu Entertainment Radio\n* [[Raagam (radio channel)|Raagam]] - Indian Classical Music Radio\n* [[Gyan Vani]] - Hindi & English Educational Radio\n\n===Regional===\n* AIR Assamese\n* AIR Bangla\n* AIR Gujarati\n* AIR Hindi\n* AIR Kannada\n* AIR Malayalam\n* AIR Marathi\n* AIR Odia\n* AIR Punjabi\n* AIR Tamil\n* AIR Telugu\n* AIR Agartala - [[Bengali language|Bengali]] & [[Kokborok]]\n* AIR Aizawl - [[Mizo language|Mizo]]\n* AIR Bhopal - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Dehradun - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Imphal - [[Manipuri language|Manipuri]]\n* AIR Itanagar - [[Hindi]] & [[Nyishi language|Nyishi]]\n* AIR Jaipur - [[Hindi]] & [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]]\n* [[Radio Kashmir Jammu|AIR Jammu]] - [[Dogri]] & [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Lucknow - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR North East - [[Hindi]] & [[English language|English]]\n* AIR Patna - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Raipur - [[Hindi]] & [[Chhattisgarhi]]\n* AIR Ranchi - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Rohtak - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Shillong - [[Khasi language|Khasi]] & [[English language|English]]\n* AIR Shimla - [[Hindi]]\n* [[Radio Kashmir Jammu|AIR Srinagar]] - [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] & [[Urdu]]\n* AIR Vijayawada - [[Telugu language|Telugu]]\n\n====Regional FM====\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|AIR FM Rainbow Mumbai]] - [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Hindi]] & [[English language|English]] Music Radio\n* [[AIR FM Tragopan|AIR FM Tragopan Kohima]] - [[Nagamese]], [[English language|English]] & [[Hindi]] Music & News Radio\n\n====Test====\n* MH VBS 1\n* MH VBS 2\n* DWDS Service 1\n* DWDS Service 2\n* DWDS Service 3\n* DWDS Service 4\n\n==Online services==\n* AIR Live News\n* KASHMIR ONLINE RADIO\n* [[Vividh Bharati]]\n* [[AIR FM Gold|FM Gold Delhi]]\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|FM Rainbow Delhi]]\n* AIR Urdu\n* [[Raagam (radio channel)|Raagam]]\n* AIR Gujarati\n* AIR Marathi\n* AIR Punjabi\n* AIR Malayalam\n* AIR Tamil\n* AIR Telugu\n* AIR Kannada\n* AIR Bangla\n* AIR Jammu\n* AIR Odia\n* AIR Assamese\n* AIR North East\n* [[AIR FM Tragopan|FM Tragopan Kohima]]\n* [[FM Rainbow Goa]]\n* AIR Shimla\n* AIR Bhuj\n* AIR Indore\n* AIR Mysuru\n* AIR Jodhpur\n* [[Amrutvarshini]]\n* [[Vividh Bharati Bengaluru]]\n* [[FM Rainbow Kannada Kaamaanbilu]]\n* AIR Bengaluru\n* [[Sun City FM Jodhpur]]\n* AIR Pune\n* AIR Rohtak\n* [[FM Rainbow Lucknow]]\n* AIR Jabalpur\n* AIR Bhopal\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|FM Rainbow Mumbai]]\n* [[AIR FM Gold|FM Gold Mumbai]]\n* [[Samvadita Mumbai]]\n* AIR Aadilabad\n* AIR Jaipur\n* AIR Varanasi\n* AIR Raipur\n* AIR Sangli\n* AIR Rajkot\n* AIR Nagpur\n* AIR Prayagraj\n* AIR Patna\n* AIR Patiala\n* AIR Mhadei Panaji\n* AIR Gorakhpur\n* AIR Hassan\n* AIR Dehradun\n* AIR Solapur\n* AIR Kota\n* AIR Madurai\n* AIR Kolhapur\n* AIR Suratgarh\n* [[FM Rainbow Visakhapatnam]]\n* AIR Kurnool\n* AIR Bikaner\n* AIR Kochi\n* AIR Calicut\n* AIR Mathura\n* AIR Agra\n* [[FM Rainbow Vijayawada]]\n* AIR Vijayawada\n* AIR Kannur\n* [[FM Ananthapuri]]\n* AIR Lucknow\n* AIR Mount Abu\n* AIR Dharwad\n* AIR Chandigarh\n* AIR Chitradurga\n* [[AIR Manjeri FM|AIR Manjeri]]\n* AIR Aurangabad\n* AIR Surat\n* AIR Tirupati\n* AIR Kodaikanal\n* AIR Alwar\n\n== {{anchor|Other services and units}}Other services ==\n\n=== Digital Radio Mondiale ===\nDetails of the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) transmissions and frequencies are as follows:\n\n* 0130 - 0230 UTC on 11715&nbsp;kHz Nepali (Nepal)\n* 0315-0415 UTC on 15185&nbsp;kHz Hindi, (E.Africa, Mauritius)\n* 0415-0430 UTC on 15185&nbsp;kHz Gujarati, (E.Africa, Mauritius)\n* 0430-0530 UTC on 15185&nbsp;kHz Hindi(E.Africa, Mauritius)\n* 1300 - 1500 UTC on 15050&nbsp;kHz Sinhala (Sri Lanka)\n* 1615-1715 UTC on 15140&nbsp;kHz Russian (E.

AIR news bulletins are available in nine regional languages: Tamil, Kannada, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, North East, Punjabi, Telugu and Urdu.\n\n==={{anchor|Documentaries and features}}Documentaries===\nThere is a long tradition of broadcasting documentary features on AIR. There is great interest in radio documentaries, particularly in countries like India, Iran, South Korea and Malaysia. The most prominent broadcaster of English Features was [[Melville de Mellow]], and of Hindi Features, Shiv Sagar Mishra. This format has been revived by AIR producers across India because of its flexibility, its relative low cost to produce, its messaging potential and its creative potential.\n\n===Central Drama Unit===\nAIR's Central Drama Unit (CDU) is responsible for the national broadcast of plays. Plays produced by the CDU are translated and produced by regional stations. Since its inception in the 1960s, the unit has produced more than 1,500 plays, and the CDU houses a repository of old scripts and productions. The National Programme of Plays is broadcast by the CDU on the fourth Thursday of each month at 9.30&nbsp;pm. Each play included in the National Programme of Plays is produced in 22 Indian languages and broadcast at the same time by all regional and national network stations. The CDU also produces Chain Plays, half-hour dramas broadcast in succession by a chain of stations.\n\n===Social Media Cell===\nThe News Service Division's Social Media Cell was established on 20 May 2013 and is responsible for providing AIR news on new media platforms such as websites, Twitter, Facebook, and SMS.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:AIR FM Tower Mangalore 0203.jpg|alt=White, multistory building with tall red-and-white tower in front|AIR tower in [[Mangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\nFile:Akashvani Bhavan, Kolkata.jpg|alt=Massive, pinkish-gray building with columns|[[Kolkata]] Centre of All India Radio\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Telecommunication|India}}\n* [[Vividh Bharati]]\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow]]\n* [[AIR FM Gold]]\n* [[106.4 FM Radio Gold]]\n* [[Telugu Radio]]\n* [[Radio Kashmir]]\n* [[Telecommunications in India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|All India Radio}}\n{{wiktionary|Akashvani}}\n* [http://allindiaradio.gov.in/ All India Radio Official web-site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111031004449/http://www.listenradios.com/vividh-bharati-online/ All India Radio Commercial Broadcasting Service Vividh Bharati On Line]\n* [http://www.voicevibes.net/ All India Radio Commercial Broadcasting Service Vividh Bharati On Line]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140728232823/http://webcast.gov.in/Vividhbharti/ All India Radio General Overseas Service / External Services Division 1-4 On Line]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120505053343/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/radio.php Know India: Radio]\n* [http://onlinetps.com/resources/AIR_radio_frequency_list.htm All India Radio (AIR) Station Frequencies (National/International)]\n* [http://childrensection.tripod.com/ Children's wing of All India Radio]\n\n{{MIBI}}\n{{World Radio Network}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Media of India}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:International broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in India]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language radio stations]]\n[[Category:Tibetan-language radio stations]]\n[[Category:All India Radio| ]]\n[[Category:Public radio]]\n[[Category:Multilingual broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1936]]\n[[Category:1936 establishments in India]]\n[[Category:State media]]\n[[Category:Radio broadcasting companies of India]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Assam]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the electronic band|All India Radio (band)}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2012}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2014}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox broadcasting network\n|name           = All India Radio\n|logo           = [[File:Logo of AIR.svg|200px]]\n|type           = Government Organisation\n|branding       =\n|airdate        =\n|country        = [[India]]\n|available      = National\n|founded        =\n|founder        = [[Government of India]]\n|slogan         =\n|motto          = Bahujanahitaya Bahujanasukhaya / \u092c\u0939\u0941\u091c\u0928\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092f \u092c\u0939\u0941\u091c\u0928\u0938\u0941\u0916\u093e\u092f<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Profile/Mission |title=Mission Of AIR}}</ref>\n|market_share   =\n|license_area   =\n|broadcast_area =\n|area           =\n|erp            =\n|owner          = [[Prasar Bharati]]\n|key_people     =\n|foundation     =\n|launch_date    = {{start date and age|1927|7|23|df=yes}}\n|dissolved      =\n|former_names   =\n|digital        = \n|analog         =\n|servicename1   =\n|service1       =\n|servicename2   =\n|service2       =\n|servicename3   =\n|service3       =\n|servicename4   =\n|service4       =\n|callsigns      =\n|callsign_meaning =\n|former_callsigns =\n|affiliation    =\n|affiliates     =\n|groups         =\n|former_affiliations =\n|headquarters = [[Sansad Marg]], [[New Delhi]] - 110001, [[India]]\n|website        =  [http://allindiaradio.gov.in All India Radio], [http://www.newsonair.nic.in/ News on AIR]\n|webcast = [http://allindiaradio.gov.in AIR]\n|footnotes      =\n}}\n[[File:Akashvani Bhavan in New Delhi.jpg|right|thumb|AIR headquarters in [[New Delhi]]|alt=Distant photo of building complex with tower]]\n\n'''All India Radio''' ('''AIR'''), officially known since 1956 as '''Akashvani''' (\"Voice from the Sky\"), is the national [[public broadcasting|public]] radio broadcaster of [[India]] and is a division of [[Prasar Bharati]].

AIR\u2019s home service comprises 420 stations located across the country, reaching nearly 92% of the country\u2019s area and 99.19% of the total population.

In [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], Akashvanis are often featured in stories as a medium of communication from heaven to mankind.\n\n'Akashvani' was first used in the context of radio by M. V. Gopalaswami in 1936 after setting up India's first private radio station in his residence, \"Vittal Vihar\" (about two hundred yards from AIR\u2019s current [[Mysore]] radio station).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/mysore-akashavani-is-now-75-years-old/408172/ |title=Mysore Akashavani is now 75 years old |newspaper=[[Business Standard]]}}</ref> ''Akashvani'' was later adopted as All India Radio's on-air name in 1957.\n\n==History==\nBroadcasting began in June 1923 during the [[British Raj]] with programs by the [[Bombay Presidency Radio Club]] and other radio clubs. According to an agreement on 23 July 1927, the private Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd (IBC) was authorized to operate two radio stations: the [[Bombay]] station which began on 23 July 1927, and the [[Calcutta]] station which followed on 26 August 1927. The company went into liquidation on 1 March 1930. The government took over the broadcasting facilities and began the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) on 1 April 1930 on an experimental basis for two years, and permanently in May 1932 it then went on to become All India Radio on 8 June 1936.<ref name=Milestones/>\n\nOn 1 October 1939, the External Service began with a broadcast in [[Pashto language|Pushtu]]. It was intended to counter radio [[propaganda]] from Germany directed at Afghanistan, Persia and Arab nations. 1939 also saw the opening of the [[Dhaka]] station of Eastern India, in what is now [[Bangladesh]]. This station catered and nurtured the pioneers of Bengali intellectuals. The foremost among them, [[Natyaguru]] [[Nurul Momen]], became the trail-blazer of the talk-show in 1939. He wrote and directed the first modern radio-play for this station in 1942. When India became independent in 1947, the AIR network had only six stations ([[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Calcutta]], [[Chennai]], [[Lucknow]], and [[Tiruchirappalli]]). The three radio stations at [[Lahore]], [[Peshawar]] and [[Dhaka]] remained in what became Pakistan after the division. The total number of radio sets in India at that time was about 275,000. On 3 October 1957, the ''[[Vividh Bharati]]'' Service was launched, to compete with [[Radio Ceylon]]. Television broadcasting began in Delhi in 1959 as part of AIR, but was split off from the radio network as ''[[Doordarshan]]'' on 1 April 1976.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://allindiaradio.org/Misc/AIR-Manual1/Chapter1.pdf |title=AIR Manual, Chapter 1: History of All India Radio |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917064450/http://allindiaradio.org/Misc/AIR-Manual1/Chapter1.pdf |archivedate=17 September 2010 }}</ref> FM broadcasting began on 23 July 1977 in [[Chennai]], and expanded during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allindiaradio.org/milestone.html |title=Milestones of AIR |publisher=All India Radio |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612212622/http://allindiaradio.org/milestone.html |archivedate=12 June 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Deccan Radio (Nizam Radio 1932)]], the first radio station in [[Hyderabad State]] (now [[Hyderabad, India]]), went live on air on 3 February 1935.

[[Medium wave]] is also used to reach neighbouring countries. In addition to broadcasts targeted at specific countries by language, there is a General Overseas Service broadcasting in English with 8\u00bc hours of programming each day aimed at a general international audience. The external broadcasts were begun on 1 October 1939 by the British government to counter the propaganda of the Nazis directed at the Afghan people. The first broadcasts were in Pushto, beamed to Afghanistan and the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]]. Broadcasts soon began in other languages including: Dari, Persian, Arabic, English, Burmese, Japanese, Chinese, Malay and French. The external services broadcast in 16 foreign and 11 Indian languages, with a total program output of 70\u00bc hours per day on medium and shortwave frequencies.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ External service transmitter sites\n!

The foreign languages are: Arabic, Baluchi, Burmese, Chinese, Dari, French, Indonesian, Persian, Pushtu, Russian, Sinhala, Swahili, Thai, Tibetan and English (General Overseas Service). The Indian languages are Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Konkani, Kashmiri, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Nepali, Punjabi, Saraiki, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.\n\nThe longest daily broadcast is the Urdu Service to Pakistan, around the clock on DTH ([[direct-broadcast satellite]]) and on short- and medium wave for 12\u00bc hrs. The English-language General Overseas Service is broadcast 8\u00bc hours daily. During [[Hajj]], there are special broadcasts beamed to Saudi Arabia in Urdu. AIR is planning to produce programmes in the [[Baluchi language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/all-india-radio-to-revamp-baluchi-language-programme-116083101302_1.html|title=All India Radio to revamp Baluchi language programme|first=|last=IANS|date=31 August 2016|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}</ref>\n\nThe external services of AIR are also broadcast to Europe in DRM ([[Digital Radio Mondiale]]) on 9950&nbsp;kHz between 1745\u20132230 UTC. These external transmissions are broadcast by high-power transmitters located at Aligarh, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Gorakhpur, Guwahati, Mumbai and Panaji on shortwave and from Jalandhar, Kolkata, Nagpur, Rajkot and Tuticorin on medium wave. Soon All India Radio Amritsar will also start a booster service on the FM band. Some of these transmitters are 1000&nbsp;kW (1&nbsp;MW) or 500&nbsp;kW. Programs are beamed to different parts of the world except for the Americas and the reception quality is very good in the target areas. In each language service, the program consists of news, commentary, a press review, talks on matters of general or cultural interest, feature programmes, documentaries and music from India and the target region. Most programs originate at New Broadcasting House on Parliament Street in New Delhi, with a few originating at SPT Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jalandhar, Kolkata, HPT Malad Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram and Tuticorin.\n\nThe External Services Division of AIR is a link between India and rest of the world, especially in countries with Indian emigrants and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|people of Indian origin]]. It broadcasts the Indian point of view on matters of national and international importance, and demonstrates the Indian way of life through its programs. [[QSL cards]] (which are sought-after by international radio hobbyists) are issued to radio hobbyists by AIR in New Delhi for [[reception report]]s of their broadcasts.\n\n==Direct-To-Home==\nDirect-to-home (DTH) service is a satellite broadcast service in which a large number of radio channels are digitally beamed down over a territory from a high-power satellite. AIR broadcasts various national and regional stations available to listen on [[DD Free Dish]]. The DTH signals can be received directly at homes using a small-sized dish receiver unit containing a dish antenna installed on a building\u2019s rooftop or on a wall facing clear south and one indoors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddindia.gov.in/Technical/Pages/DD-Free-Dish-(DTH).aspx|title=DD Free Dish (DTH)|website=ddindia.gov.in|access-date=2016-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719233025/http://www.ddindia.gov.in/Technical/Pages/DD-Free-Dish-(DTH).aspx|archive-date=19 July 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> DTH service is offered on twenty one channels via [[Indian National Satellite System|Insat]].\n\n===List of DTH channels===\n====National====\n* [[Vividh Bharati]] - Hindi Music Radio\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|AIR FM Rainbow India]] - Hindi & English Music Radio\n* [[AIR FM Gold|AIR FM Gold Delhi]] - Classic Hindi Music & News Radio\n* [[AIR Live News 24\u00d77]] - Hindi & English News Radio\n* [[AIR Urdu]] - Urdu Entertainment Radio\n* [[Raagam (radio channel)|Raagam]] - Indian Classical Music Radio\n* [[Gyan Vani]] - Hindi & English Educational Radio\n\n===Regional===\n* AIR Assamese\n* AIR Bangla\n* AIR Gujarati\n* AIR Hindi\n* AIR Kannada\n* AIR Malayalam\n* AIR Marathi\n* AIR Odia\n* AIR Punjabi\n* AIR Tamil\n* AIR Telugu\n* AIR Agartala - [[Bengali language|Bengali]] & [[Kokborok]]\n* AIR Aizawl - [[Mizo language|Mizo]]\n* AIR Bhopal - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Dehradun - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Imphal - [[Manipuri language|Manipuri]]\n* AIR Itanagar - [[Hindi]] & [[Nyishi language|Nyishi]]\n* AIR Jaipur - [[Hindi]] & [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]]\n* [[Radio Kashmir Jammu|AIR Jammu]] - [[Dogri]] & [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Lucknow - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR North East - [[Hindi]] & [[English language|English]]\n* AIR Patna - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Raipur - [[Hindi]] & [[Chhattisgarhi]]\n* AIR Ranchi - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Rohtak - [[Hindi]]\n* AIR Shillong - [[Khasi language|Khasi]] & [[English language|English]]\n* AIR Shimla - [[Hindi]]\n* [[Radio Kashmir Jammu|AIR Srinagar]] - [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] & [[Urdu]]\n* AIR Vijayawada - [[Telugu language|Telugu]]\n\n====Regional FM====\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|AIR FM Rainbow Mumbai]] - [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Hindi]] & [[English language|English]] Music Radio\n* [[AIR FM Tragopan|AIR FM Tragopan Kohima]] - [[Nagamese]], [[English language|English]] & [[Hindi]] Music & News Radio\n\n====Test====\n* MH VBS 1\n* MH VBS 2\n* DWDS Service 1\n* DWDS Service 2\n* DWDS Service 3\n* DWDS Service 4\n\n==Online services==\n* AIR Live News\n* KASHMIR ONLINE RADIO\n* [[Vividh Bharati]]\n* [[AIR FM Gold|FM Gold Delhi]]\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|FM Rainbow Delhi]]\n* AIR Urdu\n* [[Raagam (radio channel)|Raagam]]\n* AIR Gujarati\n* AIR Marathi\n* AIR Punjabi\n* AIR Malayalam\n* AIR Tamil\n* AIR Telugu\n* AIR Kannada\n* AIR Bangla\n* AIR Jammu\n* AIR Odia\n* AIR Assamese\n* AIR North East\n* [[AIR FM Tragopan|FM Tragopan Kohima]]\n* [[FM Rainbow Goa]]\n* AIR Shimla\n* AIR Bhuj\n* AIR Indore\n* AIR Mysuru\n* AIR Jodhpur\n* [[Amrutvarshini]]\n* [[Vividh Bharati Bengaluru]]\n* [[FM Rainbow Kannada Kaamaanbilu]]\n* AIR Bengaluru\n* [[Sun City FM Jodhpur]]\n* AIR Pune\n* AIR Rohtak\n* [[FM Rainbow Lucknow]]\n* AIR Jabalpur\n* AIR Bhopal\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow|FM Rainbow Mumbai]]\n* [[AIR FM Gold|FM Gold Mumbai]]\n* [[Samvadita Mumbai]]\n* AIR Aadilabad\n* AIR Jaipur\n* AIR Varanasi\n* AIR Raipur\n* AIR Sangli\n* AIR Rajkot\n* AIR Nagpur\n* AIR Prayagraj\n* AIR Patna\n* AIR Patiala\n* AIR Mhadei Panaji\n* AIR Gorakhpur\n* AIR Hassan\n* AIR Dehradun\n* AIR Solapur\n* AIR Kota\n* AIR Madurai\n* AIR Kolhapur\n* AIR Suratgarh\n* [[FM Rainbow Visakhapatnam]]\n* AIR Kurnool\n* AIR Bikaner\n* AIR Kochi\n* AIR Calicut\n* AIR Mathura\n* AIR Agra\n* [[FM Rainbow Vijayawada]]\n* AIR Vijayawada\n* AIR Kannur\n* [[FM Ananthapuri]]\n* AIR Lucknow\n* AIR Mount Abu\n* AIR Dharwad\n* AIR Chandigarh\n* AIR Chitradurga\n* [[AIR Manjeri FM|AIR Manjeri]]\n* AIR Aurangabad\n* AIR Surat\n* AIR Tirupati\n* AIR Kodaikanal\n* AIR Alwar\n\n== {{anchor|Other services and units}}Other services ==\n\n=== Digital Radio Mondiale ===\nDetails of the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) transmissions and frequencies are as follows:\n\n* 0130 - 0230 UTC on 11715&nbsp;kHz Nepali (Nepal)\n* 0315-0415 UTC on 15185&nbsp;kHz Hindi, (E.Africa, Mauritius)\n* 0415-0430 UTC on 15185&nbsp;kHz Gujarati, (E.Africa, Mauritius)\n* 0430-0530 UTC on 15185&nbsp;kHz Hindi(E.Africa, Mauritius)\n* 1300 - 1500 UTC on 15050&nbsp;kHz Sinhala (Sri Lanka)\n* 1615-1715 UTC on 15140&nbsp;kHz Russian (E.

The service is accessible through [[Subscriber trunk dialing]] (STD), [[International Direct Dialing]] (ISD) and local calls. There are plans to establish the service in 11 additional cities including: Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Guwahati, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Ranchi, Shimla and Thiruvananthapuram. English and Hindi hourly news bulletins may be heard live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsonair.com |title=Prasar Bharati |accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref> News in [[MP3]] format may be directly played from the site, and filenames are time-stamped. AIR news bulletins are available in nine regional languages: Tamil, Kannada, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, North East, Punjabi, Telugu and Urdu.\n\n==={{anchor|Documentaries and features}}Documentaries===\nThere is a long tradition of broadcasting documentary features on AIR. There is great interest in radio documentaries, particularly in countries like India, Iran, South Korea and Malaysia. The most prominent broadcaster of English Features was [[Melville de Mellow]], and of Hindi Features, Shiv Sagar Mishra. This format has been revived by AIR producers across India because of its flexibility, its relative low cost to produce, its messaging potential and its creative potential.\n\n===Central Drama Unit===\nAIR's Central Drama Unit (CDU) is responsible for the national broadcast of plays. Plays produced by the CDU are translated and produced by regional stations. Since its inception in the 1960s, the unit has produced more than 1,500 plays, and the CDU houses a repository of old scripts and productions. The National Programme of Plays is broadcast by the CDU on the fourth Thursday of each month at 9.30&nbsp;pm. Each play included in the National Programme of Plays is produced in 22 Indian languages and broadcast at the same time by all regional and national network stations. The CDU also produces Chain Plays, half-hour dramas broadcast in succession by a chain of stations.\n\n===Social Media Cell===\nThe News Service Division's Social Media Cell was established on 20 May 2013 and is responsible for providing AIR news on new media platforms such as websites, Twitter, Facebook, and SMS.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:AIR FM Tower Mangalore 0203.jpg|alt=White, multistory building with tall red-and-white tower in front|AIR tower in [[Mangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\nFile:Akashvani Bhavan, Kolkata.jpg|alt=Massive, pinkish-gray building with columns|[[Kolkata]] Centre of All India Radio\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Telecommunication|India}}\n* [[Vividh Bharati]]\n* [[AIR FM Rainbow]]\n* [[AIR FM Gold]]\n* [[106.4 FM Radio Gold]]\n* [[Telugu Radio]]\n* [[Radio Kashmir]]\n* [[Telecommunications in India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|All India Radio}}\n{{wiktionary|Akashvani}}\n* [http://allindiaradio.gov.in/ All India Radio Official web-site]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111031004449/http://www.listenradios.com/vividh-bharati-online/ All India Radio Commercial Broadcasting Service Vividh Bharati On Line]\n* [http://www.voicevibes.net/ All India Radio Commercial Broadcasting Service Vividh Bharati On Line]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140728232823/http://webcast.gov.in/Vividhbharti/ All India Radio General Overseas Service / External Services Division 1-4 On Line]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120505053343/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/radio.php Know India: Radio]\n* [http://onlinetps.com/resources/AIR_radio_frequency_list.htm All India Radio (AIR) Station Frequencies (National/International)]\n* [http://childrensection.tripod.com/ Children's wing of All India Radio]\n\n{{MIBI}}\n{{World Radio Network}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Media of India}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:International broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in India]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language radio stations]]\n[[Category:Tibetan-language radio stations]]\n[[Category:All India Radio| ]]\n[[Category:Public radio]]\n[[Category:Multilingual broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1936]]\n[[Category:1936 establishments in India]]\n[[Category:State media]]\n[[Category:Radio broadcasting companies of India]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Assam]]\n", "name_user": "Mykhal", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e{{anchor|Etymology}}Etymology:san translit. typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio"}

He subsequently gained selection for Australia at the [[1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships|1999 Pan Pacific Championships]] in Sydney. At his first Olympics in Sydney, Norris made a poor start, missing the final of the 400-metre individual medley.  However, he qualified for the final of the 200-metre butterfly, where he was considered an outsider. Norris attacked from the start, contesting the lead over the first 100-metre. Willed on by a partisan home crowd, he managed to hang on to the third position as the favourites surged for the finish line.  While being interviewed on the pool deck, a bewildered Norris repeatedly used what has become his winning catchphrase - \"I'm stoked.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=FUN AND GAMES: COVER STORY|last=Jameson|first=Neil|date=11 September 2010|work=The Newcastle Herald|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Norris claimed another bronze medal at the [[2001 World Aquatics Championships|2001 FINA World Championships]] in Fukuoka, Japan, this time in the 200-metre individual medley, and in 2002 collected triple gold in the 200-metre and 400-metre individual medley and the 200-metre butterfly at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester.  However, in 2003, he had no success in his three events, failing to medal at the [[2003 World Aquatics Championships|2003 FINA World Championships]] in Barcelona, Spain. He fared even worse at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, failing to reach a single final.\n\nOn arrival back in Australia, Norris departed the AIS to return to Newcastle, and thereafter announced that he would be taking a year out of swimming in 2005.\n\nNorris\u2019s children have a YouTube channel \u201cThe Norris Nuts\u201d.

While being interviewed on the pool deck, a bewildered Norris repeatedly used what has become his winning catchphrase - \"I'm stoked.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=FUN AND GAMES: COVER STORY|last=Jameson|first=Neil|date=11 September 2010|work=The Newcastle Herald|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Norris claimed another bronze medal at the [[2001 World Aquatics Championships|2001 FINA World Championships]] in Fukuoka, Japan, this time in the 200-metre individual medley, and in 2002 collected triple gold in the 200-metre and 400-metre individual medley and the 200-metre butterfly at the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester.  However, in 2003, he had no success in his three events, failing to medal at the [[2003 World Aquatics Championships|2003 FINA World Championships]] in Barcelona, Spain. He fared even worse at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, failing to reach a single final.\n\nOn arrival back in Australia, Norris departed the AIS to return to Newcastle, and thereafter announced that he would be taking a year out of swimming in 2005.\n\nNorris\u2019s children have a YouTube channel \u201cThe Norris Nuts\u201d. They have gained over 4 million subscribers. It sometimes includes him as well as his wife. His 6 children, Sabre (15), Sockie (13), Biggy (11), Naz (9), Disco (1) and his youngest child Charm (3 months) run it.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming (men)]]\n* [[List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.justinnorrisswimacademy.com/ Justin Norris Swim Academy]\n<br>\n{{Footer Commonwealth Champions 200m Butterfly Men}}\n{{Footer Commonwealth Champions 200m Medley Men}}\n{{Footer Commonwealth Champions 400m Medley Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Norris, Justin}}\n[[Category:1980 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Olympic swimmers of Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian male swimmers]]\n[[Category:Male butterfly swimmers]]\n[[Category:Male medley swimmers]]\n[[Category:Swimmers at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Swimmers at the 2004 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Australia]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth Games gold medallists for Australia]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Olympic bronze medalists in swimming]]\n[[Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming]]\n[[Category:Australian Institute of Sport swimmers]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m)]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in swimming]]\n[[Category:Swimmers at the 2002 Commonwealth Games]]\n", "name_user": "2605:e000:7e83:a600:5d25:f24f:93fc:5c48", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Norris"}
