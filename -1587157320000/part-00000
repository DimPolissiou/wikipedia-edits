Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n{{Main|History of the Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)}}\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nThe Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) originated from a forecast in 1967 by the planners of the State and City Planning Project,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--no by line; staff writer(s)--> |title='Unique nation State' plan |date=20 September 1967 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |page=6 |via=[[National Library Board]] |url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19670920-1.2.22 |access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore by 1992.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seah C.

Coloured red on the rail map, the line is {{convert|45|km|mi}} long and serves 27 stations, 11 of which, between the [[Bishan MRT station|Bishan]] and [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier]] stations, are underground. It runs from [[Jurong East MRT station|Jurong East station]], located in [[West Region, Singapore|western Singapore]], to Marina South Pier station in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], via [[Woodlands MRT station|Woodlands station]] in [[North Region, Singapore|northern Singapore]]. The line operates for 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:30 am to around midnight), with [[Headway|headways]] of up to 3 minutes during peak hours and 7 minutes during off-peak hours. All the trains on the NSL run with a six-car formation. \n\nIt is the first MRT line to be built in Singapore, with the first section from [[Yio Chu Kang MRT station|Yio Chu Kang station]] to [[Toa Payoh MRT station|Toa Payoh station]] beginning service on 7 November 1987, followed by an extension southwards to [[Raffles Place MRT station|Raffles Place station]] on 12 December the same year and northwards to [[Yishun MRT station|Yishun station]] on 20 December 1988. After the southern extension to [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay station]] on 4 November 1989, the North South line was formed and split from the [[East West MRT line|East West line]]. In the 1990s, the line extended to the north and west connecting to the [[Branch MRT line|Branch line]] via [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]] through the Woodlands line extension. \n\nSince the 2010s, due to the ageing infrastructure of the NSL (being the oldest and heavily utilised MRT line), significant improvements have been made on the line, such as the replacement of sleepers, third-rail replacement and the introduction of new rolling stocks (the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151B|C151B]] and the [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries & CSR Sifang C151C|C151C]]) to replace the older rolling stocks and increase passenger capacity. The NSL is also the first line to have undergone a major re-signalling project, converting from semi-automatic to fully automated operations in 2019. Other recent developments of the line include a new extension to [[Marina South Pier MRT station|Marina South Pier station]] on 23 November 2014 and a new infill station, [[Canberra MRT station|Canberra station]], on 2 November 2019. Two more infill stations ([[Brickland MRT station|Brickland]] and [[Sungei Kadut MRT station|Sungei Kadut]] stations) on the line are being planned and are set to be opened in the 2030s.\n\n==History==\n===Initial developments===\n{{Main|History of the Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)}}\n[[File:NS19 Toa Payoh Plaque unveiled.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Toa Payoh station commemorating the opening of the first phase of the Singapore MRT]]\nThe Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) originated from a forecast in 1967 by the planners of the State and City Planning Project,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--no by line; staff writer(s)--> |title='Unique nation State' plan |date=20 September 1967 |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |page=6 |via=[[National Library Board]] |url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19670920-1.2.22 |access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system in Singapore by 1992.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Seah C.

The newspaper's star reporter was [[Ben Bradlee]], who was also an alumnus of St. Mark's and Harvard and would later become executive editor of the [[Washington Post]]. Within two years, the ''Sunday News'' had the highest circulation in New Hampshire.

Patton Jr.]]'s 3rd Army.<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n===CBS===\nIn 1953, he joined [[CBS News]] in Paris, and later became producer and anchor of ''The World Tonight'' on the [[CBS Radio Network]], now known as the nighttime edition of the ''[[CBS World News Roundup]].'' In 1961, President Kennedy offered Clark the ambassadorship to Mexico, but instead he became general manager and vice president of CBS News. He expanded the radio and television coverage of CBS News by hiring additional correspondents in the United States and abroad.  He worked with [[Edward R. Murrow]], and among those he hired at CBS were [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Mike Wallace]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Roger Mudd]] and [[Bill Plante]].<ref name=Princeton/><ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nAfter leaving CBS, Clark was associate publisher of the ''[[New York Post]]'', editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, and a fellow of the New York Institute for Humanities at [[New York University]]. He was an influential early supporter of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Subsequently, he taught at [[New York University]] and [[Princeton University]].<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n=== Career in politics ===\n\nClark first met Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1965 at a party at [[Walter Lippmann]]'s house in [[Washington, D.C.]] Two years later, when McCarthy announced that he would challenge President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the 1968 Democratic primaries as an anti-war candidate, Clark wrote to McCarthy from London to express his support. With his friend [[Theodore H. White]], Clark traveled to Chicago in December 1967 to hear McCarthy address the Conference of Concerned Democrats, a group of antiwar activists. Soon after meeting in Chicago, McCarthy asked Clark to be his campaign manager.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nIn his new position within the campaign, Clark set about convincing McCarthy to enter the [[New Hampshire]] [[New Hampshire primary|primary]]. McCarthy had initially planned to skip New Hampshire and begin campaigning in [[Wisconsin]]. The case to run in New Hampshire was laid out by two members of the New Hampshire delegation of the Conference of Concerned Democrats: [[Dartmouth College]] official [[David C. Hoeh]] and [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] teacher (and future congressman) [[Gerry Studds]]. After more convincing from Clark, McCarthy decided that he would declare his entry to the New Hampshire primary. Hoeh and Studds took the titles of New Hampshire campaign director and coordinator, and Clark recruited the journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] to be McCarthy's press secretary.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nMcCarthy's surprisingly strong showing in New Hampshire led to the rapid growth of his supporters, but the campaign was in increasing disarray. When Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] entered the race as a second anti-war candidate, Clark and other McCarthy advisers initially tried to broker an agreement with Kennedy to meet head-to-head only in the California primary, with both campaigns supporting the winner of that primary, but McCarthy flatly rejected the proposal. Bitterness between the McCarthy and Kennedy campaigns only deepened after Johnson announced that he would not seek re-election and [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged as the choice of the Democratic establishment. In the wake of Kennedy's assassination the night that he won the California primary, many Kennedy delegates to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] refused to support McCarthy. McCarthy publicly conceded that Humphrey had enough delegates to win the nomination, a move that enraged Clark and other McCarthy supporters who felt that the candidate still had a chance of defeating Humphrey.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nClark's sister [[Anne Clark Martindell]] also attended the Democratic National Convention as a McCarthy supporter, launching her career in politics and public service.

He was Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s national campaign manager for the [[1968 United States presidential election|1968 presidential nomination]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\nClark was born in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, New York]] in 1917, the son of [[William Clark (judge)|Wiliam Clark]] (1891\u20131957) and Marjory ([[n\u00e9e]] Blair) Clark (1893\u20131975).<ref name=\"MBCObit1975\">{{cite news|title=MARJORY B.

At [[St. Mark's School (Massachusetts)|St. Mark's School]], Clark became friends with poet [[Robert Lowell]].  At Harvard he befriended classmate [[John F. Kennedy]]; they remained in touch throughout Kennedy's political career, and Clark and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] corresponded for decades. Journalist [[Theodore H. White]] was also a long-time contact.\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1941 to 1946, Clark reported for the [[Joseph Pulitzer Jr.]]-owned ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' before serving in the [[United States Army]].<ref name=Princeton>{{Cite web | url=http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/eadGetDoc.xq?id=/ead/mudd/publicpolicy/MC195.EAD.xml | title=Blair Clark Papers, 1921-1997 (bulk 1950s-1990s): Finding Aid | accessdate=2008-03-20 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410105250/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/eadGetDoc.xq?id=%2Fead%2Fmudd%2Fpublicpolicy%2FMC195.EAD.xml | archivedate=2008-04-10 }}</ref>\n\n===New Hampshire Sunday News===\nIn 1946, Clark used a $60,000 inheritance from his grandmother to found ''The New Hampshire Sunday News''. The newspaper's star reporter was [[Ben Bradlee]], who was also an alumnus of St. Mark's and Harvard and would later become executive editor of the [[Washington Post]]. Within two years, the ''Sunday News'' had the highest circulation in New Hampshire. When the ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'' threatened to compete with its own Sunday paper, Clark sold the ''Sunday News'' to Union-Leader Corporation in 1948 for a substantial profit.<ref name=Kaiser>Kaiser, Charles.

Patton Jr.]]'s 3rd Army.<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n===CBS===\nIn 1953, he joined [[CBS News]] in Paris, and later became producer and anchor of ''The World Tonight'' on the [[CBS Radio Network]], now known as the nighttime edition of the ''[[CBS World News Roundup]].'' In 1961, President Kennedy offered Clark the ambassadorship to Mexico, but instead he became general manager and vice president of CBS News. He expanded the radio and television coverage of CBS News by hiring additional correspondents in the United States and abroad.  He worked with [[Edward R. Murrow]], and among those he hired at CBS were [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Mike Wallace]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Roger Mudd]] and [[Bill Plante]].<ref name=Princeton/><ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nAfter leaving CBS, Clark was associate publisher of the ''[[New York Post]]'', editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine, and a fellow of the New York Institute for Humanities at [[New York University]]. He was an influential early supporter of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Subsequently, he taught at [[New York University]] and [[Princeton University]].<ref name=\"Bernstein2000\"/>\n\n=== Career in politics ===\n\nClark first met Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1965 at a party at [[Walter Lippmann]]'s house in [[Washington, D.C.]] Two years later, when McCarthy announced that he would challenge President [[Lyndon Johnson]] in the 1968 Democratic primaries as an anti-war candidate, Clark wrote to McCarthy from London to express his support. With his friend [[Theodore H. White]], Clark traveled to Chicago in December 1967 to hear McCarthy address the Conference of Concerned Democrats, a group of antiwar activists. Soon after meeting in Chicago, McCarthy asked Clark to be his campaign manager.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nIn his new position within the campaign, Clark set about convincing McCarthy to enter the [[New Hampshire]] [[New Hampshire primary|primary]]. McCarthy had initially planned to skip New Hampshire and begin campaigning in [[Wisconsin]]. The case to run in New Hampshire was laid out by two members of the New Hampshire delegation of the Conference of Concerned Democrats: [[Dartmouth College]] official [[David C. Hoeh]] and [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] teacher (and future congressman) [[Gerry Studds]]. After more convincing from Clark, McCarthy decided that he would declare his entry to the New Hampshire primary. Hoeh and Studds took the titles of New Hampshire campaign director and coordinator, and Clark recruited the journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] to be McCarthy's press secretary.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nMcCarthy's surprisingly strong showing in New Hampshire led to the rapid growth of his supporters, but the campaign was in increasing disarray. When Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] entered the race as a second anti-war candidate, Clark and other McCarthy advisers initially tried to broker an agreement with Kennedy to meet head-to-head only in the California primary, with both campaigns supporting the winner of that primary, but McCarthy flatly rejected the proposal. Bitterness between the McCarthy and Kennedy campaigns only deepened after Johnson announced that he would not seek re-election and [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged as the choice of the Democratic establishment. In the wake of Kennedy's assassination the night that he won the California primary, many Kennedy delegates to the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] refused to support McCarthy. McCarthy publicly conceded that Humphrey had enough delegates to win the nomination, a move that enraged Clark and other McCarthy supporters who felt that the candidate still had a chance of defeating Humphrey.<ref name=Kaiser/>\n\nClark's sister [[Anne Clark Martindell]] also attended the Democratic National Convention as a McCarthy supporter, launching her career in politics and public service. She would go on to serve in the [[New Jersey Senate]] and as [[United States Ambassador to New Zealand]].\n\nClark later became treasurer of the New Democratic Coalition, a group of disaffected liberals from the 1968 campaign. When the [[Watergate]] break-in occurred, Clark was the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s communications director.<ref name=Princeton/>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1941,<ref name=\"1941Wedding\">{{cite news|title=Miss Jessie Philbin Married in Boston To L.

Historically considered part of the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] region,<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> it was ruled by the [[Vengi]] kingdom and the [[Pallava Dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Eastern Ganga]] dynasties during medieval times.<ref name=\"history3\" /> Archaeological records suggest that the present city was built around the 11th and 12th centuries C.E. by the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] king [[Kulothunga Chola I|Kulothunga I]]. Control over the city fluctuated between the [[Chola Empire|Chola Dynasty]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and the [[Gajapati Kingdom]] of [[Odisha]]<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" /> until its conquest by the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] in the 15th century.<ref name=\"history3\" /> In the 16th century it was conquered by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe city was ruled by Andhra Kings of Vengi and Pallavas. The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765. European powers eventually set up trading interests in the city and Visakhapatnam came under [[French India|French]] rule at the end of the 18th century.<ref name=\"history1\" /><ref name=\"history2\" />\n\nThe British captured Visakhapatnam after the 1804 [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] and it remained under [[British Raj|British colonial rule]] until [[Independence of India|India's independence in 1947]] which was a part of the [[Northern Circars]].\n\n=== Buddhist influence ===\n\nHindu texts state that during the fifth century BC, the Visakhapatnam region was part of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] territory, which extended to the [[Godavari River]]. Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

Located {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} south of Visakhapatnam, it is known locally as [[Bojjannakonda]] and is a significant Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh. The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves.

Here the Buddhist habitation is noticed on a 16&nbsp;ha flat terraced area. The Hinayana school of Buddhism was practised at the monastery between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. Bavikonda has remains of an entire Buddhist complex, comprising 26 structures belonging to three phases. A piece of bone stored in an urn recovered here is believed to belong to the mortal remains of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].

It is located {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam and is a significant Buddhist site.\nExcavation carried out from 1982 to 1987 revealed a Buddhist establishment including a mahachaitya embedded with relic caskets,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} a large vihara complex, numerous votive stupas, a stone-pillared congregation and rectangular halls and a refectory. Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]]. The Bavikonda site is considered one of the oldest Buddhist sites in Asia. It is a reminder of the Buddhist civilisation which once existed in southern India, and also reminiscent of [[Borobudur]] in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web|title=bavikonda|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html/|publisher=www.buddhist-tourism.com|accessdate=7 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222172341/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/buddhist-sites/bavikonda-andhra-pradesh.html|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Thotlakonda ====\n[[File:Mahastupa in Thotlakonda, Visakhapatnam (2).jpg|thumbnail|left|Third-century BC Buddhist ruins of [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]]|alt=Corner of light-coloured, angular stone ruins]]\nAbout {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam is [[Thotlakonda]], a [[Buddhist]] complex situated on top of a hill. The Buddhist complex on the Mangamaripeta hilltop, locally known as [[Thotlakonda|Totlakonda]], lies about 16&nbsp;km from Visakhapatnam on Visakhapatnam-Bheemili Beach Road. After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978. Excavations in 1988 to 1992 exposed structural remains and artefacts, classified as Religious, Secular and Civil. These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh. Excavations have revealed three kinds of structural remains: religious, secular and civil. Structures include a mahastupa, sixteen votive [[stupa]]s, a stone-pillared congregation hall, eleven rock-cut cisterns, well-paved stone pathways, an [[Apse|apsidal]] [[chaitya]]-griha, three round chaitgya-grihas, two votive platforms, ten [[vihara]]s and a kitchen complex with three halls and a refectory (dining hall). Apart from the structures, Buddhist treasures excavated include nine [[Satavahana]] and five Roman silver coins, [[terracotta]] tiles, stucco decorative pieces, sculptured panels, miniature [[stupa]] models in stone, Buddha [[Pada (foot)|padas]] depicted with [[ashtamangala]] symbols (i.e. the eight auspicious symbols of Swastika, Shrivasta, Nandhyavarta, Vardhamanaka, Bhadrasana, Kalasha, Minyugala and Darpan) and early pottery.<ref>{{cite web |title=thotlakonda |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/thotlakonda-as-heritage-tourism-destination/article7329607.ece?ref=slideshow#im-image-3| publisher= The Hindu|accessdate= 18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\n\nThe territory of Visakhapatnam then came under the Andhra rulers of [[Vengi]], and [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] ruled the land. The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple. Although it no longer exists (possibly washed away about 100 years ago by a cyclonic storm), elderly residents of Visakhapatnam remember visits to the ancient shrine by their grandparents (although author Ganapatiraju Atchuta Rama Raju denies this).<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |title=Vi\u015bakha traces its name to Buddhist princess |publisher=The Hindu |date=15 July 2002 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030913214905/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/07/15/stories/2002071501150200.htm |archive-date=13 September 2003 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century Visakhapatnam was part of the [[Northern Circars]], a region comprising [[coastal Andhra]] and southern coastal Odisha which was first under French control and later British. Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.

The city is named after Sri Vishaka Varma. Legend has it that [[Radha]] and [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]] were born on the same day and were equally beautiful. Sri Vishaka Sakhi is the second most important [[gopi]] of the eight main gopis. She carries messages between Radha and Krishna and is the most expert gopi messenger. Local residents believe that an Andhra king built a temple to pay homage to his family deity Vi\u015bakha. This is now inundated under sea water near R K Beach. Another theory is that it is named after a woman disciple of Buddha named [[Visakha|Vi\u015bakha]]. Later it was ruled by [[Qutb Shahi]]s, [[Mughal Empire]] (between 1689 and 1724), [[Nizam]] (1724\u20131757) and France (1757\u20131765) before being captured by the British in 1765.

Relics found in the area also prove the existence of a Buddhist empire in the region. Kalinga later lost the territory to [[Ashoka the Great|King Ashoka]] in the bloodiest battle of its time, which prompted Ashoka to embrace [[Buddhism]]. Visakhapatnam is surrounded by ancient Buddhist sites, most of which have been excavated recently and illustrate the legacy of Buddhism in the region.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\n==== Pavurallakonda ====\n[[File:Yaksha Sculpture Relief at Pavurallakonda Buddhist Remnant Site near Bheemunipatnam.jpg|thumb|Yaksha Relief at [[Pavurallakonda]] near [[Bheemunipatnam]]|alt=eramic sculptures of guardian Yakshas]]\n[[Pavurallakonda]] (\"pigeon hill\") is a [[hillock]] west of Bhimli, about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} from Visakhapatnam.

The three major schools of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana) flourished here. The complex is known for its monolithic [[stupa]]s, rock-cut caves and brick structures. The primary stupa was initially carved out of rock and covered with bricks. Excavations yielded historic pottery and Satavahana coins from the first century AD. At Lingalakonda, there are also rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows spread over the hill. The vihara was active for about 1,000 years.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}\n\nNearby is another Buddhist site, Bojjannakonda, with a number of images of the Buddha carved on the rock face of the caves.

Artifacts recovered from the site include Roman and [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] coins and pottery dating from the third century BC to the second century AD. A significant finding was a piece of bone (with a large quantity of ash) in an urn, which is believed to be the remains of the [[Buddha]].

After its discovery (during an aerial survey), the Government of Andhra Pradesh declared the 48&nbsp;ha site as a protected monument in 1978.

These structures include the Stupa, Chaityagrihas, pillared congregation halls, bhandagaras, refectory (bhojanasala), drainage and stone pathways. The site covers an area of {{convert|120|acre|ha|abbr=off}}, and has been declared a protected area by the government of Andhra Pradesh.

The region was ruled by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Eastern Ganga king]]- SuryaVamsa Kshatriyas and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati kings]] of [[Odisha]] from the 10th century to the 16th centuries AD (when the region came under the Visakhapatnam rulers). Based on archaeological evidence, the [[Prabhakar]] and the Eastern Ganga Kings of Odisha built temples in the city in the 11th and 12th centuries. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] ruled the area under the Visakhapatnam [[Nizam]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. European merchants from France, Holland and the [[East India Company]] used the natural port to export tobacco, [[Paddy (unmilled rice)|paddy]], coal, iron ore, ivory, [[muslin]] and other textile products.\n\nLocal legend tells that an [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] king, on his way to [[Varanasi|Benares]], rested at Visakhapatnam and was so enchanted by its beauty that he ordered a temple to be built in honour of his family deity, Vi\u015bakha. Archaeological sources, however, reveal that the temple was probably built between the 11th and 12th centuries by the Cholas. A shipping merchant, Shankarayya Chetty, built one of the mandapams (pillared halls) of the temple.

Visakhapatnam became a district in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. In September 1804, British and French squadrons fought the naval [[Battle of Vizagapatam]] near the harbour. After India's independence it was the largest district in the country and was subsequently divided into the districts of [[Srikakulam]], [[Vizianagaram]] and Visakhapatnam.\n\nPart of the city is known by its colonial British name, Waltair; during the colonial era, the city's hub was the Waltair railway station and a part of the city is still called Waltair.\n\n<gallery caption=\"\" widths=\"220px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:Passage Exercise (PASSEX) during International Fleet Review 2016 (01).JPG|International Fleet Review 2016\n</gallery>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Boats in Kondakarla ava 2.jpg|thumb|[[Kondakarla Ava]], a bird sanctuary near Visakhapatnam]]\nThe city is situated between the [[Eastern Ghats]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].<ref name=\"location\" /> The city coordinates lies between 17.7041 N and 83.2977 E.<ref name=\"geo\" /><ref name=\"climate\" />\n\n=== Climate ===\nVisakhapatnam has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Aw'').<ref name=\"climate\" /> The annual mean temperatures ranges between {{Convert|24.7|\u2013|30.6|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, with the maximum in the month of May and the minimum in January; the minimum temperatures ranges between {{Convert|20|\u2013|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}.
