The screenplay by Wilder and [[I. A. L. Diamond|I.A.L. Diamond]] is based on the 1920 [[Jean Schopfer|Claude Anet]] novel ''[[Ariane, jeune fille russe (novel)|Ariane, jeune fille russe]]'' (''Ariane, Young Russian Girl''). The story explores the relationship between an older, philandering American [[business magnate]] and the young, sexually inexperienced daughter of a private detective. At first the older man seduces the girl without any intention of continuing the relationship after he leaves Paris. But when they meet again in Paris a year later, the girl pretends that she, too, has had a long list of lovers, arousing the older man's jealousy and ultimately causing him to admit his real feelings for her. The film was shot on location in [[Paris]].\n\n==Plot==\nYoung  [[cello]] student Ariane Chavasse ([[Audrey Hepburn]]) eavesdrops on a conversation between her father, Claude Chavasse ([[Maurice Chevalier]]), a widowed private detective who specialises in tracking unfaithful husbands and wives, and his client, \"Monsieur X\" ([[John McGiver]]). After Claude gives his client proof of his wife's daily trysts with American [[business magnate]] Frank Flanagan ([[Gary Cooper]]) in Room 14 at the [[Paris Ritz]], Monsieur X announces he will shoot Flanagan later that evening. Claude is nonchalant, regretting only the business he will lose, since Flanagan is a well-known international playboy with a long history of casual affairs. When Ariane cannot get the Ritz to put her through to Flanagan on the phone, and the police decline to intervene until after a crime has been committed, she decides to warn him herself.\n\nAriane is in time. When Monsieur X breaks into Flanagan's hotel suite, he finds Flanagan with Ariane, not his wife, who is cautiously making her escape via an outside ledge. Flanagan is intrigued by the mysterious girl, who refuses to give him any information about herself, even her name. He starts guessing her name from the initial \"A\" on her purse, and when she declines to tell him he resorts to calling her \"thin girl\". She has no romantic history but pretends to be a ''[[femme fatale]]'' to interest him, and soon falls in love with the considerably older man. She agrees to meet him the next afternoon, because her orchestral practice is in the evenings (although she does not admit that is the reason). She comes with mixed feelings, but ends up becoming his lover for the evening until his plane leaves (though later Flanagan says he did not make it to first base with her).\n\nAriane's father, who has tried unsuccessfully to protect her from knowing about the tawdry domestic-surveillance details in his files, notices her change of mood but has no idea that it proceeds from one of his cases.\n\nA year later, Flanagan returns to Paris and the Ritz. Ariane, who has kept track of Flanagan's womanizing exploits through the news media, meets him again when she sees him at an opera while surveying the crowd from a balcony. She puts herself in his path in the lobby, and they start seeing each other again. This time, when he persists in his questioning, she makes up a long list of prior imaginary lovers based on her father's files (Flanagan is number 20 on the list). Flanagan gradually goes from being amused to being tormented by the possible comparisons, but is unsure whether they are real. When he encounters a still-apologetic Monsieur X, the latter recommends Claude to him, and thus Flanagan hires Ariane's own father to investigate.\n\nIt does not take Claude long to realize the mystery woman is Ariane. He informs his client that his daughter fabricated her love life. He tells Flanagan that she is a \"little fish\" that he should throw back, since she is serious and he wants to avoid serious relationships.\n\nWhen Ariane comes to his hotel suite that afternoon, Flanagan is hurriedly packing to leave Paris, pretending to be on his way to meet former lovers (\"two crazy Swedish twins\") in Cannes. At the train station, both keep up their act of not caring deeply for each other, although Ariane sheds a few tears that she blames on the soot.

Throne notes that the character of Ariane is surrounded by men\u2014including her father\u2014who all affirm and support the prerogative of men to philander and flirt, while women are expected to remain chaste. The sexual double standard is seen for what it is when Ariane's father confronts Flanagan and both realize their wrong, as the detective-father who has made his wealth from investigating this playboy now realizes the playboy has seduced his own daughter, and the playboy who has mocked and eluded cuckolded husbands comes face to face with the father of the girl he seduced. Flanagan's decision at the end to scoop up Ariane into the moving train, and later marry her, puts an unrealistic romantic stamp on the story, considering Flanagan's long philandering past and Ariane's total inexperience with men and money.

The screenplay by Wilder and [[I. A. L. Diamond|I.A.L. Diamond]] is based on the 1920 [[Jean Schopfer|Claude Anet]] novel ''[[Ariane, jeune fille russe (novel)|Ariane, jeune fille russe]]'' (''Ariane, Young Russian Girl''). The story explores the relationship between an older, philandering American [[business magnate]] and the young, sexually inexperienced daughter of a private detective. At first the older man seduces the girl without any intention of continuing the relationship after he leaves Paris. But when they meet again in Paris a year later, the girl pretends that she, too, has had a long list of lovers, arousing the older man's jealousy and ultimately causing him to admit his real feelings for her. The film was shot on location in [[Paris]].\n\n==Plot==\nYoung  [[cello]] student Ariane Chavasse ([[Audrey Hepburn]]) eavesdrops on a conversation between her father, Claude Chavasse ([[Maurice Chevalier]]), a widowed private detective who specialises in tracking unfaithful husbands and wives, and his client, \"Monsieur X\" ([[John McGiver]]). After Claude gives his client proof of his wife's daily trysts with American [[business magnate]] Frank Flanagan ([[Gary Cooper]]) in Room 14 at the [[Paris Ritz]], Monsieur X announces he will shoot Flanagan later that evening. Claude is nonchalant, regretting only the business he will lose, since Flanagan is a well-known international playboy with a long history of casual affairs. When Ariane cannot get the Ritz to put her through to Flanagan on the phone, and the police decline to intervene until after a crime has been committed, she decides to warn him herself.\n\nAriane is in time. When Monsieur X breaks into Flanagan's hotel suite, he finds Flanagan with Ariane, not his wife, who is cautiously making her escape via an outside ledge. Flanagan is intrigued by the mysterious girl, who refuses to give him any information about herself, even her name. He starts guessing her name from the initial \"A\" on her purse, and when she declines to tell him he resorts to calling her \"thin girl\". She has no romantic history but pretends to be a ''[[femme fatale]]'' to interest him, and soon falls in love with the considerably older man. She agrees to meet him the next afternoon, because her orchestral practice is in the evenings (although she does not admit that is the reason). She comes with mixed feelings, but ends up becoming his lover for the evening until his plane leaves (though later Flanagan says he did not make it to first base with her).\n\nAriane's father, who has tried unsuccessfully to protect her from knowing about the tawdry domestic-surveillance details in his files, notices her change of mood but has no idea that it proceeds from one of his cases.\n\nA year later, Flanagan returns to Paris and the Ritz. Ariane, who has kept track of Flanagan's womanizing exploits through the news media, meets him again when she sees him at an opera while surveying the crowd from a balcony. She puts herself in his path in the lobby, and they start seeing each other again. This time, when he persists in his questioning, she makes up a long list of prior imaginary lovers based on her father's files (Flanagan is number 20 on the list). Flanagan gradually goes from being amused to being tormented by the possible comparisons, but is unsure whether they are real. When he encounters a still-apologetic Monsieur X, the latter recommends Claude to him, and thus Flanagan hires Ariane's own father to investigate.\n\nIt does not take Claude long to realize the mystery woman is Ariane. He informs his client that his daughter fabricated her love life. He tells Flanagan that she is a \"little fish\" that he should throw back, since she is serious and he wants to avoid serious relationships.\n\nWhen Ariane comes to his hotel suite that afternoon, Flanagan is hurriedly packing to leave Paris, pretending to be on his way to meet former lovers (\"two crazy Swedish twins\") in Cannes. At the train station, both keep up their act of not caring deeply for each other, although Ariane sheds a few tears that she blames on the soot. As the train departs, and Ariane runs along the platform as Flanagan stands in the door of the coach, her ''femme-fatale'' facade cracks as her love shows through. Flanagan changes his mind, sweeps her up in his arms onto the coach, and before kissing her he calls her by her name, Ariane. Then, as voice over, Claude informs us that the couple were married in Cannes and now live together in New York.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}\n* [[Gary Cooper]] as Frank Flanagan\n* [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Ariane Chavasse\n* [[Maurice Chevalier]] as Claude Chavasse\n* [[John McGiver]] as Monsieur X\n* Van Doude as Michel\n* [[Lise Bourdin]] as Madame X\n* Olga Valery as Hotel guest with dog\n* The Gypsies as themselves\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Music==\nSongs and music in the film include:\n\n* \"[[Fascination (1932 song)|Fascination]]\" by [[Fermo Dante Marchetti]] with lyrics (1905) by [[Maurice de F\u00e9raudy]] and English lyrics by Dick Manning; Performed by The Gypsies\n* \"[[C'est si bon]]\" by [[Henri Betti]]; Lyrics by [[Andr\u00e9 Hornez]]; Performed by The Gypsies \n* \"L'ame de Po\u00e8tes\" by [[Charles Trenet]]; Performed by The Gypsies \n* \"Love in the Afternoon,\" \"Ariane\" and \"Hot Paprika\" by [[Matty Malneck]]<ref name=afi />\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''Love in the Afternoon'' was the first of twelve screenplays by Billy Wilder and [[I.

In his 2007 essay on the two directors for ''Stop Smiling'' magazine, [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] wrote that ''Love in the Afternoon'' was \"the most obvious and explicit and also, arguably, the clunkiest of his tributes to Lubitsch, partially inspired by Lubitsch's 1938 ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' (which Wilder and [Charles] Brackett also helped to script, and which also starred Gary Cooper, again playing a womanizing American millionaire in France)\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sweet and Sour: Lubitsch and Wilder in Old Hollywood |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |work=Stop Smiling |issue=32 |year=2007 |url=http://www.stopsmilingonline.com/story_detail.php?id=926 }} This essay is collected in: {{cite book |title=Goodbye Cinema, Hello Cinephilia: Film Culture in Transition |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |page=114 |year=2010 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226726656 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X-4lPDhkKwC&pg=PA114}}</ref> John Fawell wrote in 2008 that \"Lubitsch was at his most imaginative when he lingered outside of doorways, particularly when something promiscuous was going on behind the door, a habit his pupil Billy Wilder picked up.

Throne notes that the character of Ariane is surrounded by men\u2014including her father\u2014who all affirm and support the prerogative of men to philander and flirt, while women are expected to remain chaste. The sexual double standard is seen for what it is when Ariane's father confronts Flanagan and both realize their wrong, as the detective-father who has made his wealth from investigating this playboy now realizes the playboy has seduced his own daughter, and the playboy who has mocked and eluded cuckolded husbands comes face to face with the father of the girl he seduced. Flanagan's decision at the end to scoop up Ariane into the moving train, and later marry her, puts an unrealistic romantic stamp on the story, considering Flanagan's long philandering past and Ariane's total inexperience with men and money. Throne concludes, \"One rather wishes he'd adopted the girl instead of marrying her\".<ref name=throne>{{cite journal|title=Love in the Afternoon: A Cinematic Exposure of a 1950s Myth|first=Marilyn|last=Throne|journal=Literature/Film Quarterly|volume=16|issue=1|year=1988|pages=65-73|jstor=43796339}}</ref>\n\n==Accolades==\nScreenwriters Wilder and Diamond won the award for \"Best American Comedy\" at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 1957|1957 Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=afi/> \n\nWilder was nominated for [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film|Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]] by the [[Directors Guild of America]].<ref name=afi/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1957]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uohNoRFkwIC&pg=PT242|first=Gene D.|last=Phillips|authorlink=Gene D.

The Natural Sciences Campus was established in 1978. This campus is 45&nbsp;km south of Seoul on a 250-acre site.\n\nEach campus's major is divided according to the distinction between liberal arts and science departments.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Sungkyunkwan}}\n[[Image:Sungkyunkwan 600.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 600th Anniversary Building]]\n[[Sungkyunkwan]] was established in 1398 as the Joseon Dynasty's highest educational institution.  Its name means, \"Sung (\u6210, to make), Kyun (\u5747, harmonious society), Kwan (\u9928, institute).\"  It focused on in-depth study of the [[Chinese classics|Chinese Classics]], [[Four Books and Five Classics|Confucian canon]], and literature of the era, and how to apply the knowledge to governing the nation and understanding the nature of humanity.  It also served as a shrine (see [[Munmyo]]) to the Confucian sages where rituals were held regularly to honor them and their teachings.\n\nIt was located within the [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|city walls]] of the capital during the Joseon period, [[Seoul|Hanseong]], or modern-day Seoul. It followed the example of the [[Goryeo]]-period [[Gukjagam]], which in its latter years was also known by the name \"Sungkyunkwan\".\n\nNumerous Korean historical figures, including [[Yi Hwang]] and [[Yi I]], studied at and graduated from Sungkyunkwan.  A considerable amount of Korean literature and works of [[hanja]] calligraphy were created and archived by Sungkyunkwan scholars over the centuries.\n\nDuring the period of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] in the first half of the twentieth century, Sungkyunkwan was downgraded and almost closed by the [[Governor-General of Korea]] in favor of the [[Keij\u014d Imperial University|imperial university]]. At the end of [[World War II]], however, it was officially reopened as a college by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]]. Before long, it was reinstated by the ex-rector of Sungkyunkwan, [[:ko:\uae40\ucc3d\uc219|Kim Changsook]].\n\nAfter the [[Korean War]], as the nation modernized and underwent social, political, and economic reforms, SKKU played an important role in academic freedom in higher education and also kept traditional ethics and morality alive in Korean society.\n\n===Timeline===\n*'''1398''': Sungkyunkwan founded.\n*'''1400\u20131418''': King [[Taejong]] initiates a tradition for royal princes to enter Sungkyunkwan.\n*'''1475''': Jongyeonggak, Korea's first library, is established.\n*'''1519''': Planting of the pair of [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]] trees ([[Natural monuments of South Korea|Natural Monument No. 59]]) that became SKKU's symbol.\n*'''1592''': [[Munmyo]], the Confucian Shrine, is destroyed in a fire.\n*'''1601''': Munmyo is reconstructed.\n*'''1895''': Sungkyunkwan is reformed as a modern three-year university.\n*'''1911''': The university is renamed Kyonghagwon by the Japanese Government-General.\n*'''1946''': Sungkyunkwan receives accreditation from [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] on September 25 as Sunkyunkwan College (\uc131\uade0\uad00\ub300\ud559).<ref>[http://www.skkok.com/?_page=11 \uc790\ub791\uc2a4\ub7f0 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uaf43\ud53c\uc6b0\ub294 \uc720\uad50\ubb38\ud654 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc778\uc131\uad50\uc721 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uc608\uc808\uad50\uc2e4].

These four cardinal virtues express humankind's four inherent elements of spirit, action, conscience, and intellect. Humanity abides in the heart that loves, righteousness abides in the heart that knows right from wrong, propriety abides in the heart that knows forbearance, and wisdom abides in the heart that perceives. Confucian philosophy attests to man's innate goodness, and at the same time recognizes that this quality must nevertheless be awakened and nurtured. These four principles, which comprise SKKU's educational philosophy, are the basis for higher education's goals of the search for truth and the establishment of social justice, which are, in turn, based on humanity.[https://www.skku.edu/skku/about/pr/greeting.do]\n\n==University symbol==\n\nThe university's symbol is the gingko leaf which comes from the giant [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]] trees at SKKU's old campus ([[Natural monuments of South Korea|Natural Monument]] No. 59).

SLI is managed separately from the university and the management follows different systems of organisation on the two campuses, yet they both fall under an umbrella level of administrative management.\n\n====Courses====\nCredit and non-credit classes are taught. The English credit courses are chiefly in [[academic writing]] and academic presentation. There are also ESP (English for Specific Purposes) classes in [[business English]], English for scientific purposes, English Literature and current English at the [[Suwon]] campus. Non-credit classes are less specialised and are, therefore, more typical of [[English language learning and teaching|ESL]] environments. These are open to people who are not registered as students at Sungkyunkwan University. It is not uncommon for members of staff or local residents to attend such classes.  For the main courses ([[academic writing]] and presentations), SLI produces its own books, which are published by Sungkyunkwan University Press and which have thus far been revised yearly.\n\n====Facilities====\nSLI has a \"Global Zone\" \u2014 a room where students may relax, study, read, browse the web, view [[online lecture]]s, attend conferences, watch international TV, or seek English assistance from the lecturers on each site.\n\n==Notable international programs==\n\nSungkyunkwan University has a high number of international students, making up over 10% of the total undergraduate student body.

The nearest subway station is [[Hyehwa Station]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 4]].\n\nThe Natural Sciences Campus in [[Suwon]] is in walking distance from [[Sungkyunkwan University Station]], in the northwest of the city. The Natural Sciences Campus was established in 1978. This campus is 45&nbsp;km south of Seoul on a 250-acre site.\n\nEach campus's major is divided according to the distinction between liberal arts and science departments.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Sungkyunkwan}}\n[[Image:Sungkyunkwan 600.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 600th Anniversary Building]]\n[[Sungkyunkwan]] was established in 1398 as the Joseon Dynasty's highest educational institution.  Its name means, \"Sung (\u6210, to make), Kyun (\u5747, harmonious society), Kwan (\u9928, institute).\"  It focused on in-depth study of the [[Chinese classics|Chinese Classics]], [[Four Books and Five Classics|Confucian canon]], and literature of the era, and how to apply the knowledge to governing the nation and understanding the nature of humanity.  It also served as a shrine (see [[Munmyo]]) to the Confucian sages where rituals were held regularly to honor them and their teachings.\n\nIt was located within the [[Fortress Wall of Seoul|city walls]] of the capital during the Joseon period, [[Seoul|Hanseong]], or modern-day Seoul. It followed the example of the [[Goryeo]]-period [[Gukjagam]], which in its latter years was also known by the name \"Sungkyunkwan\".\n\nNumerous Korean historical figures, including [[Yi Hwang]] and [[Yi I]], studied at and graduated from Sungkyunkwan.  A considerable amount of Korean literature and works of [[hanja]] calligraphy were created and archived by Sungkyunkwan scholars over the centuries.\n\nDuring the period of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] in the first half of the twentieth century, Sungkyunkwan was downgraded and almost closed by the [[Governor-General of Korea]] in favor of the [[Keij\u014d Imperial University|imperial university]]. At the end of [[World War II]], however, it was officially reopened as a college by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]]. Before long, it was reinstated by the ex-rector of Sungkyunkwan, [[:ko:\uae40\ucc3d\uc219|Kim Changsook]].\n\nAfter the [[Korean War]], as the nation modernized and underwent social, political, and economic reforms, SKKU played an important role in academic freedom in higher education and also kept traditional ethics and morality alive in Korean society.\n\n===Timeline===\n*'''1398''': Sungkyunkwan founded.\n*'''1400\u20131418''': King [[Taejong]] initiates a tradition for royal princes to enter Sungkyunkwan.\n*'''1475''': Jongyeonggak, Korea's first library, is established.\n*'''1519''': Planting of the pair of [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]] trees, ([[Natural monuments of South Korea|Natural Monument No. 59]]) that became SKKU's symbol.\n*'''1592''': Munmyo, the Confucian Shrine, is destroyed in a fire.\n*'''1601''': Munmyo is reconstructed.\n*'''1895''': Sungkyunkwan is reformed as a modern three-year university.\n*'''1911''': The university is renamed Kyonghagwon by the Japanese Government-General.\n*'''1946''': Sungkyunkwan receives accreditation from [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] on September 25 as Sunkyunkwan College (\uc131\uade0\uad00\ub300\ud559).<ref>[http://www.skkok.com/?_page=11 ::: \uc790\ub791\uc2a4\ub7f0 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uaf43\ud53c\uc6b0\ub294 \uc720\uad50\ubb38\ud654 \uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc778\uc131\uad50\uc721 \uc131\uade0\uad00 \uc608\uc808\uad50\uc2e4 :::].

These four cardinal virtues express humankind's four inherent elements of spirit, action, conscience, and intellect. Humanity abides in the heart that loves, righteousness abides in the heart that knows right from wrong, propriety abides in the heart that knows forbearance, and wisdom abides in the heart that perceives. Confucian philosophy attests to man's innate goodness, and at the same time recognizes that this quality must nevertheless be awakened and nurtured. These four principles, which comprise SKKU's educational philosophy, are the basis for higher education's goals of the search for truth and the establishment of social justice, which are, in turn, based on humanity.[https://www.skku.edu/skku/about/pr/greeting.do]\n\n==University symbol==\n\nThe university's symbol is the gingko leaf which comes from the giant [[Ginkgo biloba|ginkgo]] trees at SKKU's old campus ([[Natural monuments of South Korea|Natural Monument]] No. 59).

[[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] are taught, though [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is not taught at the [[Suwon]] campus. [[Korean language|Korean]] is taught at six levels from beginner to advanced. There are 18 lecturers of Korean and 16 foreign lecturers of [[English language|English]] at the campus in [[Seoul]], with 14 foreign English lecturers in [[Suwon]], while the two Japanese lecturers based in [[Suwon]] are Korean. There are several foreign lecturers of other languages in Seoul and Korean lecturers of English on both campuses. SLI is managed separately from the university and the management follows different systems of organisation on the two campuses, yet they both fall under an umbrella level of administrative management.\n\n====Courses====\nCredit and non-credit classes are taught. The English credit courses are chiefly in [[academic writing]] and academic presentation. There are also ESP (English for Specific Purposes) classes in [[business English]], English for scientific purposes, English Literature and current English at the [[Suwon]] campus. Non-credit classes are less specialised and are, therefore, more typical of [[English language learning and teaching|ESL]] environments. These are open to people who are not registered as students at Sungkyunkwan University. It is not uncommon for members of staff or local residents to attend such classes.  For the main courses ([[academic writing]] and presentations), SLI produces its own books, which are published by Sungkyunkwan University Press and which have thus far been revised yearly.\n\n====Facilities====\nSLI has a \"Global Zone\" \u2014 a room where students may relax, study, read, browse the web, view [[online lecture]]s, attend conferences, watch international TV, or seek English assistance from the lecturers on each site.\n\n==Notable international programs==\n\nSungkyunkwan University has a high number of international students, making up over 10% of the total undergraduate student body.

ASLE-Korea [http://www.aslekorea.org/] hosts two conferences a year (Spring and Fall) and publishes ''Literature and Environment (\ubb38\ud559\uacfc\ud658\uacbd),''a journal dedicated to extending ecocritical scholarship, with articles written primarily in Korean and English.\n\n==SKKU in popular culture==\n\nThe old campus of Sungkyunkwan was the setting for the fusion [[Sageuk|historical drama]] ''[[Sungkyunkwan Scandal]]'', which also starred alumnus [[Song Joong-ki]], about a student who disguises herself as a male to attend the boys-only Confucian academy. The setting resulted in increased interest in SKKU from international audiences who watched the drama.\n\nSKKU is the founding place, and was the primary practice venue of Korean National Cricket Team.<ref>{{Citation|last=ARIRANG TV|title=Arirang Prime Ep214 Bowling for Gold|date=2013-09-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo_c9AI-ghA|accessdate=2017-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n\nCurrent Library Holdings: 1,830,806 (bound volumes) \n:Central Library: 914,228 / Samsung Library: 610,023\n:Jongyeonggak Library: 146,187 / Library of Medicine: 11,330  / Law Library: 56,438  / Library of Architecture: 2,600\n\nUniversity Area: 3,593,341 m\u00b2\n:Humanities and Social Sciences Campus: 1,394,154 m\u00b2 / Natural Sciences Campus: 2,199,187 m\u00b2\n:(including Tobong Varsity Teams Training Center: 61,339 m\u00b2 / Botanical Gardens: 329,222 m\u00b2 /\n:Samchuk Seaside Retreat: 2,390 m\u00b2)\n\nBuilding Area: 344,510 m\u00b2\n:Humanities and Social Sciences Campus: 141,803 m\u00b2\n:Natural Sciences Campus: 202,707 m\u00b2\n\n===Sports facilities===\nUnder the College of Sports Science, several student sports clubs at Sungkyunkwan University are active including baseball club, floor ball club, tennis club, basketball club, soccer club, Volleyball club, and cricket club.

[[Cuticula]]]]\n\nThe shape of an egg resembles a [[prolate spheroid]] with one end larger than the other and has cylindrical symmetry along the long axis.\n\nAn egg is surrounded by a thin, hard shell. Thin membranes exist inside the shell. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the [[chalaza]]e (from the Greek word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1, meaning 'hailstone' or 'hard lump').\n\n=== Air cell ===\nThe larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell, measured during [[candling]]. A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite book | last = McGee | first = H.| title = On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |location=New York|publisher= Scribners|year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-684-80001-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell ===\n{{Main|Eggshell}}\nEggshell color is caused by [[pigment]] deposition during egg formation in the [[oviduct]] and may vary according to [[species]] and [[breed]], from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green.

Clear initially, upon cooking it turns white. In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen [[oviduct]] during the passage of the egg.<ref>Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361</ref> It forms around both [[Fertilisation#Fertilisation in animals|fertilized]] and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the [[embryo]].\n\nEgg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent [[protein]]s (including [[albumin]]s, [[mucoprotein]]s, and [[globulin]]s). Unlike the yolk, which is high in [[lipid]]s (fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the [[carbohydrate]] content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of [[vaccine]]s, such as [[Influenza vaccine|those for influenza]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121200238/http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|archive-date=21 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Yolk ===\n{{Main|Egg yolk}}\nThe [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the [[vitelline membrane]] (the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape.\n\nYolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant [[pigments]] known as [[xanthophyll]]s, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. [[Lutein]] is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk.<ref>F.

This cleans the shell, but erodes its [[wikt:cuticle|cuticle]].<ref name=\"Anatomy\">{{cite web|title=Anatomy of an Egg|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/eggs/eggcomposition.html|website=Science of Cooking|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news|last1=Arumugam|first1=Nadia|title=Why American Eggs Would Be Illegal In A British Supermarket, And Vice Versa|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2012/10/25/why-american-eggs-would-be-illegal-in-a-british-supermarket-and-vice-versa/3/#368c25d752cf|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=Forbes|date=25 October 2012}}</ref> The USDA thus recommends refrigerating eggs to prevent the growth of ''Salmonella''.<ref name=\"usda-eggs\"/>\n\nRefrigeration also preserves the taste and texture, however, intact eggs (unwashed and unbroken) may be left unrefrigerated for several months without spoiling.<ref>[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Sustainable-Farming/1977-11-01/Fresh-Eggs.aspx How to Store Fresh Eggs] Mother Earth News, November/December (1977)</ref> In Europe, eggs are not usually washed, and the shells are dirtier, however the cuticle is undamaged, and they do not require refrigeration.<ref name=Forbes/> In the UK in particular, hens are immunized against salmonella and generally, their eggs are safe for 21 days.<ref name=Forbes/>\n\n=== Preservation ===\n[[File:Salty egg.JPG|thumb|upright|220px|Salted duck egg.]]\nThe simplest method to preserve an egg is to treat it with [[salt]].

After the process is completed, the yolk becomes a dark green, cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia, while the white becomes a dark brown, transparent jelly with a comparatively mild, distinct flavor.

[[Tofu]] also acts as a partial binding agent, since it is high in lecithin due to its [[soy]] content. [[Applesauce]] may be used, as well as [[arrowroot]] and [[banana]]. Extracted [[lecithin|soybean lecithin]], in turn, often is used in packaged foods as an inexpensive substitute for egg-derived lecithin. [[Legumes|Leguminous]] broths, such as [[chickpea]] brine or [[green pea|green pea canning liquid]], also known as [[aquafaba]], can replace egg whites in desserts such as meringues and mousses.\n\nOther [[egg substitute]]s are made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. These products usually have added vitamins and minerals, as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners, such as [[xanthan gum]] or [[guar gum]]. These allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs, making possible foods such as [[Hollandaise sauce]], [[custard]], [[mayonnaise]], and most baked goods with these substitutes.\n\n== Nutritional value ==\n{{nutritional value\n| name           = Chicken egg<br />whole, hard-boiled\n| kJ             = 647\n| water          = 75 g\n| protein        = 12.6 g\n| fat            = 10.6 g\n| carbs          = 1.12 g\n| iron_mg        = 1.2\n| calcium_mg     = 50\n| magnesium_mg   = 10\n| phosphorus_mg  = 172\n| potassium_mg   = 126\n| sodium_mg      = 124\n| zinc_mg        = 1.0\n| vitA_ug        = 149\n| pantothenic_mg = 1.4\n| folate_ug      = 44\n| thiamin_mg     = 0.066\n| riboflavin_mg  = 0.5\n| niacin_mg      = 0.064\n| vitB6_mg       = 0.121\n| vitB12_ug      = 1.11\n| vitK_ug        = 0.3\n| tryptophan     = 0.153 g\n| threonine      = 0.604 g\n| isoleucine     = 0.686 g\n| leucine        = 1.075 g\n| lysine         = 0.904 g\n| methionine     = 0.392 g\n| cystine        = 0.292 g\n| phenylalanine  = 0.668 g\n| tyrosine       = 0.513 g\n| valine         = 0.767 g\n| arginine       = 0.755 g\n| histidine      = 0.298 g\n| alanine        = 0.700 g\n| aspartic acid  = 1.264 g\n| glutamic acid  = 1.644 g\n| glycine        = 0.423 g\n| proline        = 0.501 g\n| serine         = 0.936 g\n| vitD_iu        = 87\n| vitE_mg        = 1.03\n| choline_mg     = 294\n| opt2n          = [[Cholesterol]]\n| opt2v          = 373 mg\n| right          = 1\n| source_usda    = 1\n| note           = For edible portion only.<br />Refuse: 12% (shell).<br />An egg just large enough to be classified as \"large\" in the U.S. yields 50 grams of egg without shell.

[[Cuticula]]]]\n\nThe shape of an egg resembles a [[prolate spheroid]] with one end larger than the other and has cylindrical symmetry along the long axis.\n\nAn egg is surrounded by a thin, hard shell. Thin membranes exist inside the shell. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the [[chalaza]]e (from the Greek word \u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1, meaning 'hailstone' or 'hard lump').\n\n=== Air cell ===\nThe larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell, measured during [[candling]]. A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases, the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg: as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost, the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{cite book | last = McGee | first = H.| title = On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |location=New York|publisher= Scribners|year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-684-80001-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Shell ===\n{{Main|Eggshell}}\nEggshell color is caused by [[pigment]] deposition during egg formation in the [[oviduct]] and may vary according to [[species]] and [[breed]], from the more common white or brown to pink or speckled blue-green.

Clear initially, upon cooking it turns white. In chickens, it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the hen [[oviduct]] during the passage of the egg.<ref>Ornithology, Volume 1994 By Frank B. Gill p. 361</ref> It forms around both [[Fertilisation#Fertilisation in animals|fertilized]] and unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of the [[embryo]].\n\nEgg white consists primarily of approximately 90 percent water into which is dissolved 10 percent [[protein]]s (including [[albumin]]s, [[mucoprotein]]s, and [[globulin]]s). Unlike the yolk, which is high in [[lipid]]s (fats), egg white contains almost no fat and the [[carbohydrate]] content is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications, including the preparation of [[vaccine]]s, such as [[Influenza vaccine|those for influenza]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Influenza (Flu) Vaccines Are Made|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=30 April 2017|date=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121200238/http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/how-fluvaccine-made.htm|archive-date=21 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Yolk ===\n{{Main|Egg yolk}}\nThe [[Egg yolk|yolk]] in a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages, it absorbs water from the albumen, which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken the [[vitelline membrane]] (the clear casing enclosing the yolk). The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape.\n\nYolk color is dependent on the diet of the hen. If the diet contains yellow or orange plant [[pigments]] known as [[xanthophyll]]s, then they are deposited in the yolk, coloring it. [[Lutein]] is the most abundant pigment in egg yolk.<ref>F.

This cleans the shell, but erodes its [[wikt:cuticle|cuticle]].<ref name=\"Anatomy\">{{cite web|title=Anatomy of an Egg|url=https://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/eggs/eggcomposition.html|website=Science of Cooking|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=30 October 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite news|last1=Arumugam|first1=Nadia|title=Why American Eggs Would Be Illegal In A British Supermarket, And Vice Versa|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2012/10/25/why-american-eggs-would-be-illegal-in-a-british-supermarket-and-vice-versa/3/#368c25d752cf|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=Forbes|date=25 October 2012}}</ref> The USDA thus recommends refrigerating eggs to prevent the growth of ''Salmonella''.<ref name=\"usda-eggs\"/>\n\nRefrigeration also preserves the taste and texture, however, intact eggs (unwashed and unbroken) may be left unrefrigerated for several months without spoiling.<ref>[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Sustainable-Farming/1977-11-01/Fresh-Eggs.aspx How to Store Fresh Eggs] Mother Earth News, November/December (1977)</ref> In Europe, eggs are not usually washed, and the shells are dirtier, however the cuticle is undamaged, and they do not require refrigeration.<ref name=Forbes/> In the UK in particular, hens are immunized against salmonella and generally, their eggs are safe for 21 days.<ref name=Forbes/>\n\n=== Preservation ===\n[[File:Salty egg.JPG|thumb|upright|220px|Salted duck egg.]]\nThe simplest method to preserve an egg is to treat it with [[salt]].

After the process is completed, the yolk becomes a dark green, cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia, while the white becomes a dark brown, transparent jelly with a comparatively mild, distinct flavor.

[[Tofu]] also acts as a partial binding agent, since it is high in lecithin due to its [[soy]] content. [[Applesauce]] may be used, as well as [[arrowroot]] and [[banana]]. Extracted [[lecithin|soybean lecithin]], in turn, often is used in packaged foods as an inexpensive substitute for egg-derived lecithin. [[Legumes|Leguminous]] broths, such as [[chickpea]] brine or [[green pea|green pea canning liquid]], also known as [[aquafaba]], can replace egg whites in desserts such as meringues and mousses.\n\nOther [[egg substitute]]s are made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. These products usually have added vitamins and minerals, as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners, such as [[xanthan gum]] or [[guar gum]]. These allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs, making possible foods such as [[Hollandaise sauce]], [[custard]], [[mayonnaise]], and most baked goods with these substitutes.\n\n== Nutritional value ==\n{{nutritional value\n| name           = Chicken egg<br />whole, hard-boiled\n| kJ             = 647\n| water          = 75 g\n| protein        = 12.6 g\n| fat            = 10.6 g\n| carbs          = 1.12 g\n| iron_mg        = 1.2\n| calcium_mg     = 50\n| magnesium_mg   = 10\n| phosphorus_mg  = 172\n| potassium_mg   = 126\n| sodium_mg      = 124\n| zinc_mg        = 1.0\n| vitA_ug        = 149\n| pantothenic_mg = 1.4\n| folate_ug      = 44\n| thiamin_mg     = 0.066\n| riboflavin_mg  = 0.5\n| niacin_mg      = 0.064\n| vitB6_mg       = 0.121\n| vitB12_ug      = 1.11\n| vitK_ug        = 0.3\n| tryptophan     = 0.153 g\n| threonine      = 0.604 g\n| isoleucine     = 0.686 g\n| leucine        = 1.075 g\n| lysine         = 0.904 g\n| methionine     = 0.392 g\n| cystine        = 0.292 g\n| phenylalanine  = 0.668 g\n| tyrosine       = 0.513 g\n| valine         = 0.767 g\n| arginine       = 0.755 g\n| histidine      = 0.298 g\n| alanine        = 0.700 g\n| aspartic acid  = 1.264 g\n| glutamic acid  = 1.644 g\n| glycine        = 0.423 g\n| proline        = 0.501 g\n| serine         = 0.936 g\n| vitD_iu        = 87\n| vitE_mg        = 1.03\n| choline_mg     = 294\n| opt2n          = [[Cholesterol]]\n| opt2v          = 373 mg\n| right          = 1\n| source_usda    = 1\n| note           = For edible portion only.<br />Refuse: 12% (shell).<br />An egg just large enough to be classified as \"large\" in the U.S. yields 50 grams of egg without shell.

For example, in most regions of the [[United States]], chicken eggs generally are white. In some parts of the [[Northeastern United States|northeast]] of that country, particularly [[New England]], where a television jingle for years proclaimed \"brown eggs are local eggs, and local eggs are fresh!\", brown eggs are more common. Local chicken breeds, including the [[Rhode Island Red]], lay brown eggs. Brown eggs are preferred in [[China]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. In [[Brazil]] and [[Poland]], white chicken eggs are generally regarded as industrial, and brown or reddish ones are preferred. Small farms and [[smallholdings]], particularly in economically advanced nations, may sell eggs of widely varying colors and sizes, with combinations of white, brown, speckled (red), green, and blue (as laid by certain breeds, including araucanas,<ref>Blue eggs, sometimes thought a joke, are a reality, as reported here [https://web.archive.org/web/20111103173514/http://www.costacalidachronicle.com/articles/food-and-drink/blue-hen-eggs.html], for example.</ref> heritage skyline, and cream leg bar) eggs in the same box or carton, while the supermarkets at the same time sell mostly eggs from the larger producers, of the color preferred in that nation or region.\n\n[[File:7oeufs.JPG|thumb|upright|Very dark brown eggs of [[Marans]], a [[France|French]] breed of [[chicken]].]]\nThese cultural trends have been observed for many years.

MJ asks Carlie to help Lily, who has gone into labor, but they are held captive by Doctor Octopus.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref> Spider-Man manages to save them and rescue Lily's newborn infant from the supervillains.

When [[Michele Gonzales]] moves back to Chicago, Peter considers moving in with Carlie but she decides that it is too early in the relationship. It is at this time that Peter discovers Carlie is a [[roller derby]] participant, using the sport to help her unleash any pent up anger. Her [[roller derby name]] is \"Crusher Carlie\".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648</ref>\n\nWhen Peter is called out on a mission with the [[Future Foundation]], he tells Carlie he is going away on a business trip for his new job at Horizon Labs. Carlie is very angry when she finds out that there was no trip. She takes her rage out in the rink which results in her being sent off mid-game for a vicious assault on \"Iron Mavis\" from the other side. Noticing her bad mood, two of her teammates offer to take her out for a night on the town. After [[Alcohol intoxication|getting drunk]], Carlie decides to get a [[tattoo]] of the [[Green Goblin]]'s [[Green Goblin#Goblin Gangs|insignia]] to spite Peter, knowing his opinion of Norman Osborn (as he had murdered Peter's first girlfriend Gwen Stacy).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #659</ref> However, she changes her mind and gets a tattoo of Spider-Man. She is worried that the tattoo will make things awkward between herself and Peter, but he assures her that it is not the case.<ref name=\"ASM660\"/>\n\nDuring the \"Return of Anti-Venom\" storyline, Carlie correctly deduces that the new Wraith is her police captain Yuri Watanabe using a mask [[Mysterio]] created that could impersonate the face of the late Jean Dewolff since only they and Spider-Man knew about it. This becomes more obvious when she visits evidence storage and learns of a mysterious incident that supposedly destroyed the mask with Watanabe being the last visitor beforehand. Having secretly placed her cell phone into Watanabe's pocket earlier and following her, Carlie's suspicions are confirmed. Rather than turn Watanabe in like she previously did to Vin and her father, Carlie agrees to keep it secret and suggests that Watanabe needs to improve on covering her tracks for her own safety.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663-664</ref>\n\n===\"Spider-Island\"===\n{{Main|Spider-Island}}\nDuring the events that lead to the \"Spider-Island\" storyline, Carlie confronts Peter about his connection to Spider-Man, and accepts his explanation that he designs all of Spider-Man's technology,<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #664</ref> (which was essentially the truth). She later gains spider-powers due to the Jackal's genetically-altered bedbugs, with the addition of organic webs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #667</ref> However, her mutation, like the millions of others in New York City, turns her into a monstrous spider-being.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #669</ref> She and the rest of the civilian population were eventually cured when Spider-Man uses Doctor Octopus' octo-bots to disperse the antidote.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #672</ref> When she returns to normal, Carlie breaks up with Peter after deducing that he is Spider-Man, furious that she has been lied to once again.<ref name=\"ASM673\"/> She and Peter are on a sort of truce as she requires Spider-Man's help in order to investigate the death of a gothic teen who died from falling from a great height and was ruled as a suicide.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #674</ref> Carlie works the case without police approval, putting her at odds with Chief Pratchett. Shortly after the case is resolved, Carlie, still conflicted over her feelings for Peter, confides in Peter's best friend and ex Mary Jane despite her initial anger over MJ also knowing Peter's identity.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #675</ref>\n\n===\"Superior Spider-Man\"===\n{{Main|The Superior Spider-Man}}\nAround the end of the ''[[Dying Wish]]'' storyline, Carlie Cooper catches [[Doctor Octopus]] breaking into the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] to reclaim his golden Octobot. She tries to stop him, not knowing that Doctor Octopus is really Peter Parker's mind in Otto's body. Peter/\"Otto\" tries to calm her down, but she shoots him, causing him to defend himself with a tentacle, the bullet ricocheting off his arm and shooting through Carlie's shoulder, to his shock. She is taken to the hospital, where she recovers.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700</ref>\n\nLater, Mary Jane and Carlie are surprised by some footage showing the Superior Spider-Man shaking hands with Mayor [[J. Jonah Jameson]], who came to thank Spider-Man, for stopping the Sinister Six. They both agree that things are weird. Carlie mentions that things have been weird since her run in with Doctor Octopus, but does not explain why. Mary Jane confides in her that she and Peter seem to be getting back together, shocking Carlie. When Mary Jane tells Carlie that the Superior Spider-Man broke it off with her just when they were getting back together, Carlie decides to \"go back to work\", wanting to know what really happened to \"Peter\".<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #2</ref>\n\nIt is heavily implied that Carlie knows who Superior Spider-Man really is, but she is keeping it to herself until she can find proof.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #8</ref> Soon while lurking in the shadows while [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Yuri Watanabe|Captain Wantanabe]] interviews police witnesses to Superior Spider-Man killing Massacre at point blank, Carlie appears to have also confided in one mysterious person about her speculation, this person was later revealed to be [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Yuri Watanabe|Wraith]].<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #9</ref>\n\nCarlie and the Wraith, later follow a lead how the new Spider-Squad is being funded, as it is not being financed by Mayor Jameson's initiatives.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #18</ref> After investigating the foreign bank accounts of Super villains, it is revealed that Carlie has stumbled upon proof that an account belonging to Doctor Octopus is funding the new Spider Squad. Therefore, she has made the connection of her suspicions that Superior Spider-Man is Doctor Octopus in Peter Parker's body.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #19</ref>\n\nLater, Carlie mourns Peter being buried under Doctor Octopus' headstone. She respects and apologizes for not believing him and makes Doctor Octopus pay for what he had done. The grave collapses to discover that [[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|Doctor Octopus' grave is empty]]. Before continuing, Carlie is kidnapped by [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]] and brought to the [[Green Goblin|Goblin King]]'s lair. She grabs Carlie's journal and gives it to the Goblin King where he learns about Superior Spider-Man's secret.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #21</ref> With all the evidence of Doctor Octopus' mind being in Spider-Man's body, the Goblin King still tries to interrogate Carlie about why she left Spider-Man's true identity out of her journal. He tries to take it out of her, but she refuses to reply, prompting Menace to take over the interrogation.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #23</ref> The Goblin King sprays the Goblin Formula on Carlie after she still refuses to divulge the true identity of Superior Spider-Man, causing her to writhe in agony.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #24</ref> The Goblin Formula used on Carlie begins to take effect transforming her into one of them and the Goblin King nicknamed her \"Monster\". When prompted to reveal the Spider Man's identity by the Goblin King, Carlie questioned who Goblin King was to which he replied that he is Norman Osborn. Carlie did not believe him and asked him to remove his mask to prove the fact. The Goblin King however wanted Carlie to prove that she was a real member of the Goblin Nation first before doing so. Monster joins Menace into attacking [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]]'s henchmen [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], [[Steeplejack (Marvel Comics)|Steeplejack]], and [[Tumbler (comics)|Tumbler]]. Steeplejack ends up shooting Monster only to be viciously attacked by her in response earning her place in the Goblin Nation after Goblin Knight kills Steeplejack.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25</ref>\n\nAt the time when the Goblin Nation was causing havoc in Manhattan, Monster attacks Parker Industries where Otto gets her away from the other people inside. Superior Spider-Man was shocked to discover that Monster is Carlie. Superior Spider-Man deploys [[Living Brain]] to fight Monster while he and Sajani Jaffrey flee inside. He tells Sajani to split up wanting to direct Monster's attention to him. He succeeds and Otto fights Monster in a closed room. He lands a kick which breaks the earpiece on Monster and she informs him that because of this, the Goblin King would not be able to listen to them. She states that she needs Otto or Peter's brains to fix this situation and fix her as well before she loses control. Telling Otto to hurry, she says that Otto has no idea what the Goblin King has planned for him and this world. Carlie also mentioned that she is unsure of the Goblin King's claim of being Norman Osborn.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28</ref> Sajani continues to work on the cure for the Goblin Serum when Carlie gets loses control while waiting for it, Wraith breaks free from the grip of Living Brain and makes her way to where Sajani and Carlie are. In the brief fight, Wraith is unable to see Carlie as her technology has been hacked by the Goblin King to render any goblin undetectable, Sajani completes the cure as Wraith restrains Carlie long enough for Sajani to inject the cure into her to change back into human form, with Carlie falling unconscious afterwards. Wraith leaves Carlie in Sajani's care as she heads off.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man Annual'' #2</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath, as she was still recovering from the effects of the Goblin serum, Carlie has one last talk with Mary Jane where she has decided to leave New York since she realized that she will always remain a target as long as she remains close to Peter Parker or Spider-Man and wants to move to a less dangerous place where she could work as a police forensic officer without having to deal with any supervillains.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #31</ref>\n\n===\"Fresh Start\"===\nCarlie returned to New York during Marvel's \"Fresh Start\" relaunch. She catches up with Mary Jane in a coffee shop and reveals she did lab work down in New Orleans before deciding to returning to New York.

Monster joins Menace into attacking [[Roderick Kingsley|Hobgoblin]]'s henchmen [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], [[Steeplejack (Marvel Comics)|Steeplejack]], and [[Tumbler (comics)|Tumbler]]. Steeplejack ends up shooting Monster only to be viciously attacked by her in response earning her place in the Goblin Nation after Goblin Knight kills Steeplejack.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #25</ref>\n\nAt the time when the Goblin Nation was causing havoc in Manhattan, Monster attacks Parker Industries where Otto gets her away from the other people inside. Superior Spider-Man was shocked to discover that Monster is Carlie. Superior Spider-Man deploys [[Living Brain]] to fight Monster while he and Sajani Jaffrey flee inside. He tells Sajani to split up wanting to direct Monster's attention to him. He succeeds and Otto fights Monster in a closed room. He lands a kick which breaks the earpiece on Monster and she informs him that because of this, the Goblin King would not be able to listen to them. She states that she needs Otto or Peter's brains to fix this situation and fix her as well before she loses control. Telling Otto to hurry, she says that Otto has no idea what the Goblin King has planned for him and this world. Carlie also mentioned that she is unsure of the Goblin King's claim of being Norman Osborn.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #28</ref> Sajani continues to work on the cure for the Goblin Serum when Carlie gets loses control while waiting for it, Wraith breaks free from the grip of Living Brain and makes her way to where Sajani and Carlie are. In the brief fight, Wraith is unable to see Carlie as her technology has been hacked by the Goblin King to render any goblin undetectable, Sajani completes the cure as Wraith restrains Carlie long enough for Sajani to inject the cure into her to change back into human form, with Carlie falling unconscious afterwards. Wraith leaves Carlie in Sajani's care as she heads off.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man Annual'' #2</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath, as she was still recovering from the effects of the Goblin serum, Carlie has one last talk with Mary Jane where she has decided to leave New York since she realized that she will always remain a target as long as she remains close to Peter Parker or Spider-Man and wants to move to a less dangerous place where she could work as a police forensic officer without having to deal with any supervillains.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #31</ref>\n\n===\"Fresh Start\"===\nCarlie returned to New York during Marvel's \"Fresh Start\" relaunch.

took place on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula ([[Gelibolu]] in modern Turkey), from 17 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in February 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the declaration of the [[Republic of Turkey]] eight years later, with  [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who rose to prominence as a commander at [[Gallipoli]], as [[List of national founders#Turkey|founder]] and president.\n\nThe campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand [[national consciousness]]; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as [[ANZAC Day]], the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing [[Remembrance Day]] ([[Armistice Day]]).{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=32, 38}}{{sfn|Lewis|Balderstone|Bowan|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=198}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n\nOn 27 October 1914, two former German warships, the Ottoman {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, still under the command of German officers, conducted the [[Black Sea Raid]], in which they bombarded the Russian port of [[Odessa]] and sank several ships.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=44}} On 31 October, the Ottomans entered the war and began the [[Caucasus campaign]] against Russia.

Alexandretta was an area with a Christian population and was the strategic centre of the Empire's railway network\u2014its capture would have cut the empire in two. Vice Admiral Sir [[Richard Peirse (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Peirse]], [[Commander-in-Chief, East Indies]], ordered Captain Frank Larkin of {{HMS|Doris|1896|6}} to Alexandretta on 13 December 1914. The {{ship|Russian cruiser|Askold|1900|6}} and the French [[cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Requin||2}} were also there. Kitchener was working on the plan as late as March 1915 and was the beginning of the British attempt to incite an [[Arab Revolt]]. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912.{{sfn|Tauber|1993|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nBy late 1914, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the Franco-British counter-offensive of the [[First Battle of the Marne]] had ended and the Belgians, British and French had suffered many casualties in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in Flanders. The [[Maneuver warfare|war of manoeuvre]] had ended and been replaced by [[trench warfare]].{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|p=224}} The [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] closed the overland trade routes between Britain and France in the west and Russia in the east. The [[White Sea]] in the arctic north and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the Far East were icebound in winter and distant from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]; the [[Baltic Sea]] was blockaded by the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial German Navy) and the entrance to the [[Black Sea]] through the Dardanelles was controlled by the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Corbett|2009|pp=158, 166}} While the Ottomans remained neutral, supplies could still be sent to Russia through the Dardanelles but prior to the Ottoman entry into the war, the straits had been closed; in November the Ottomans began to [[Naval mine|mine]] the waterway.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=6}}{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=34}}\n\nThe French Minister of Justice, [[Aristide Briand]], proposed in November to attack the Ottoman Empire but this was rejected and an attempt by the British to bribe the Ottomans to join the Allied side also failed.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|p=115}} Later that month, [[Winston Churchill]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], proposed a naval attack on the Dardanelles, based in part on erroneous reports of Ottoman troop strength. Churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships, which could not operate against the German [[High Seas Fleet]], in a Dardanelles operation, with a small occupation force provided by the army. It was hoped that an attack on the Ottomans would also draw [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] (formerly Ottoman possessions) into the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=27\u201328}} On 2 January 1915, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottomans, who were conducting an [[Caucasus campaign|offensive in the Caucasus]].{{sfn|Tamworth Daily Observer|1915|p=2}} Planning began for a naval [[Demonstration (military)|demonstration]] in the Dardanelles, to divert Ottoman troops from Caucasia.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=20}}\n\n==Naval campaign==\n{{main|Naval operations in the Dardanelles campaign}}\n\n===Attempt to force the Straits===\n[[File:Graphic map of the Dardanelles (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Graphic map of the Dardanelles]]\nOn 17 February 1915, a British seaplane from {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|6}} flew a reconnaissance sortie over the Straits.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=40}} Two days later, the first attack on the Dardanelles began when a strong Anglo-French task force, including the British dreadnought {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}}, began a long-range bombardment of Ottoman [[coastal artillery|coastal artillery batteries]]. The British had intended to use eight aircraft from ''Ark Royal'' to spot for the bombardment but harsh conditions rendered all but one of these, a [[Short Admiralty Type 136|Short Type 136]], unserviceable.{{sfn|Gilbert|2013|pp=42\u201343}} A period of bad weather slowed the initial phase but by 25 February the outer forts had been reduced and the entrance cleared of mines.{{sfn|Hart|2013a|pp=9\u201310}} After this, [[Royal Marines]] were landed to destroy guns at Kum Kale and Sedd\u00fclbahir, while the naval bombardment shifted to batteries between Kum Kale and [[Kepez, \u00c7anakkale|Kephez]].{{sfn|Hart|2013a|p=10}}\n\nFrustrated by the mobility of the Ottoman batteries, which evaded the Allied bombardments and threatened the [[minesweeper]]s sent to clear the Straits, Churchill began pressuring the naval commander, Admiral [[Sackville Carden]], to increase the fleet's efforts.{{sfn|Hart|2013a|pp=11\u201312}} Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in  [[Istanbul]] within 14 days.{{sfn|Fromkin|1989|p=135}} A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition.{{sfn|Fromkin|1989|p=135}} When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed the main attack would be launched on or around 17 March.

Despite some damage to the Allied ships engaging the forts by Ottoman return fire, minesweepers were ordered along the straits. In the Ottoman official account, by 2:00&nbsp;p.m. \"all telephone wires were cut, all communications with the forts were interrupted, some of the guns had been knocked out&nbsp;... in consequence the artillery fire of the defence had slackened considerably\".{{sfn|James|1995|p=61}} The {{ship|French battleship|Bouvet||2|up=yes}} struck a mine, causing her to capsize in two minutes, with just 75 survivors out of a total crew of&nbsp;718.{{sfn|Hart|2013a|p=12}} Minesweepers, manned by civilians, retreated under Ottoman artillery fire, leaving the minefields largely intact. {{HMS|Irresistible|1898|6}} and {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|6}} struck mines and ''Irresistible'' was sunk, with most of her surviving crew rescued; ''Inflexible'' was badly damaged and withdrawn. There was confusion during the battle about the cause of the damage; some participants blamed torpedoes. {{HMS|Ocean|1898|6}} was sent to rescue ''Irresistible'' but was disabled from an artillery shell, struck a mine, and was abandoned, eventually to sink.{{sfn|Fromkin|1989|p=151}}\n\nThe French battleships {{ship|French battleship|Suffren||2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Gaulois||2}} sailed through a new line of mines placed secretly by the Ottoman minelayer ''[[Ottoman minelayer Nusret|Nusret]]'' ten days before and were also damaged.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=33\u201334}} The losses forced de Robeck to sound the \"general recall\" to protect what remained of his force.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=35}} During the planning of the campaign, naval losses had been anticipated and mainly obsolete battleships, unfit to face the German fleet, had been sent. Some of the senior naval officers like the commander of ''Queen Elizabeth'', Commodore [[Roger Keyes]], felt that they had come close to victory, believing that the Ottoman guns had almost run out of ammunition but the views of de Robeck, the [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] and others prevailed. Allied attempts to force the straits using naval power were terminated, due to the losses and bad weather.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=35}}{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=60}}{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=15}} Planning to capture the Turkish defences by land, to open the way for the ships began.

While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.{{sfn|Brenchley|Brenchley|2001|pp=113\u201314}}\n\nGallipoli marked the end for Hamilton and Stopford, but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps on the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=233, 270}}{{sfn|Neillands|2004|p= 259}} The competence of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and [[Harry Chauvel]] ([[1st Light Horse Brigade]], New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=100, 107}}{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=14}} The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest.{{sfn|Cassar|2004|pp=202\u201303, 259, 263}} The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} In [[Mesopotamia]], the Turks surrounded a British expedition at [[Siege of Kut|Kut Al Amara]], forcing their surrender in April 1916.{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=94}} Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt.{{sfn|Pick|1990|pp=181, 209}} Defeat at the [[Battle of Romani]], however, and lack of the materials to complete the military railway necessary for such an operation, marked the end of that ambition.{{sfn|Pick|1990|p=210}} The optimism gained from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense of despair, and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Erickson|2001a|p=127}}{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Gallipoli ANZAC Cove Sphinx 2.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The Sphinx, one of the battlefield's most distinctive physical landmarks]]\n\nThe lessons of the campaign were studied by military planners prior to amphibious operations such as the [[Normandy Landings]] in 1944 and during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} The lessons of the campaign influenced US Marine Corps amphibious operations during the [[Pacific War]] and continue to influence US amphibious doctrine.{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 1996, Theodore Gatchel wrote that [[interwar period|between the wars]], the campaign \"became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare\" in Britain and United States.{{sfn|Gatchel|1996|p=10}} In 2008, Glenn Wahlert wrote that Gallipoli involved \"all four types of amphibious operations: the raid, demonstration, assault and withdrawal\".{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=29}}\n\n[[Russell Weigley]] wrote that analysis of the campaign before the Second World War led to \"a belief among most of the armed forces of the world\" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that despite landings in [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilberts]], arguably this perception continued until Normandy in June 1944.{{sfn|Weigley|2005|pp=393\u201396}} Hart wrote that despite the pessimistic analyses after 1918, the situation after 1940 meant that landings from the sea were unavoidable, and it was only after Normandy that the belief that opposed landings were futile was overcome.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|pp=460\u201362}} The memory of Gallipoli weighed heavily upon the Australians during the planning of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] in late 1943.

It remains widely popular and is considered by some to be the iconic anti-war song.{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|p=426}}{{sfn|Keane|2015|nopp=y}}\n\n[[File:Wagga Wagga Anzac Day 2015 march (2).jpg|thumb|[[Anzac Day]] march in [[Wagga Wagga]], Australia in 2015]]\nIn Turkey, the battle is thought of as a significant event in the state's emergence, although it is primarily remembered for the fighting that took place around the port of [[\u00c7anakkale]], where the Royal Navy was repulsed in March 1915.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|pp=6\u20137}} For the Turks, 18 March has a similar significance as 25 April to Australians and New Zealanders, it is not a public holiday but is commemorated with special ceremonies.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=7}} The campaign's main significance to the Turkish people lies in the role it played in the emergence of Mustafa Kemal, who became the first president of the [[Republic of Turkey]] after the war.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=8}} ''\"\u00c7anakkale ge\u00e7ilmez\"'' (\u00c7anakkale is impassable) became a common phrase to express the state's pride at repulsing the attack and the song \"\u00c7anakkale i\u00e7inde\" (''[[A Ballad for Chanakkale]]'') commemorates the Turkish youth who fell during the battle.{{sfn|Eren|2003|p=5}} Turkish filmmaker Sinan Cetin, created a movie called \"''Children of Canakkale\".''{{sfn|Hammer|2017|}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the Gallipoli Campaign]]\n* ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'', a 1981 Australian film directed by [[Peter Weir]]\n* ''[[\u00c7anakkale 1915]]'', a 2012 Turkish film based on some of the major political events of the Gallipoli campaign\n* [[The Water Diviner]]'', a 2014 Australian film directed by [[Russell Crowe]]\n* ''Topical song ''Suvla Bay'' collected 1949 by British publishers{{sfn|The Sunday Herald 1949|p=3}}\n* ''Blamey's Boys'' by Pte.

took place on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula ([[Gelibolu]] in modern Turkey), from 17 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], sought to weaken the [[Ottoman Empire]], one of the [[Central Powers]], by taking control of the straits that provided a supply route to Russia. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] attack on Ottoman forts at the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] in February 1915 failed and was followed by an [[Amphibious warfare#World War I era|amphibious landing]] on the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula in April 1915 to capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ([[Istanbul]]).{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nIn January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a costly defeat for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and for the sponsors, especially [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] (1911\u20131915), [[Winston Churchill]]. The campaign was considered a great [[List of Ottoman conquests, sieges and landings|Ottoman victory]]. In Turkey, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the declaration of the [[Republic of Turkey]] eight years later, with  [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who rose to prominence as a commander at [[Gallipoli]], as [[List of national founders#Turkey|founder]] and president.\n\nThe campaign is often considered to be the beginning of Australian and New Zealand [[national consciousness]]; 25 April, the anniversary of the landings, is known as [[ANZAC Day]], the most significant commemoration of military casualties and veterans in the two countries, surpassing [[Remembrance Day]] ([[Armistice Day]]).{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=32, 38}}{{sfn|Lewis|Balderstone|Bowan|2006|p=110}}{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=198}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Ottoman entry into World War I}}\n\nOn 27 October 1914, two former German warships, the Ottoman {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Midilli||2}}, still under the command of German officers, conducted the [[Black Sea Raid]], in which they bombarded the Russian port of [[Odessa]] and sank several ships.{{sfn|Fewster|Basarin|Basarin|2003|p=44}} On 31 October, the Ottomans entered the war and began the [[Caucasus campaign]] against Russia. The British briefly bombarded forts in Gallipoli, invaded [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]] and studied the possibility of forcing the Dardanelles.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=19\u201323}}{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=40}}\n\n===Allied strategy and the Dardanelles===\n\n[[File:Turkish Strait disambig.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|thumb|left|Sea access to Russia through the Dardanelles (in yellow)]]\nBefore the Dardanelles operation was conceived, the British had planned to conduct an amphibious invasion near [[Alexandretta]] on the Mediterranean, an idea originally presented by [[Boghos Nubar]] in 1914.{{sfn|Erickson|2013|p=159}} This plan was developed by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Field Marshal]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Earl Kitchener]] to sever the capital from Syria, Palestine and Egypt. Alexandretta was an area with a Christian population and was the strategic centre of the Empire's railway network\u2014its capture would have cut the empire in two. Vice Admiral Sir [[Richard Peirse (Royal Navy officer)|Richard Peirse]], [[Commander-in-Chief, East Indies]], ordered Captain Frank Larkin of {{HMS|Doris|1896|6}} to Alexandretta on 13 December 1914. The {{ship|Russian cruiser|Askold|1900|6}} and the French [[cruiser]] {{ship|French cruiser|Requin||2}} were also there. Kitchener was working on the plan as late as March 1915 and was the beginning of the British attempt to incite an [[Arab Revolt]]. The Alexandretta landing was abandoned because militarily it would have required more resources than France could allocate and politically France did not want the British operating in their sphere of influence, a position to which Britain had agreed in 1912.{{sfn|Tauber|1993|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nBy late 1914, on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], the Franco-British counter-offensive of the [[First Battle of the Marne]] had ended and the Belgians, British and French had suffered many casualties in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in Flanders. The [[Maneuver warfare|war of manoeuvre]] had ended and been replaced by [[trench warfare]].{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|p=224}} The [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] closed the overland trade routes between Britain and France in the west and Russia in the east. The [[White Sea]] in the arctic north and the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the Far East were icebound in winter and distant from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]; the [[Baltic Sea]] was blockaded by the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial German Navy) and the entrance to the [[Black Sea]] through the Dardanelles was controlled by the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Corbett|2009|pp=158, 166}} While the Ottomans remained neutral, supplies could still be sent to Russia through the Dardanelles but prior to the Ottoman entry into the war, the straits had been closed; in November the Ottomans began to [[Naval mine|mine]] the waterway.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=6}}{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=34}}\n\nThe French Minister of Justice, [[Aristide Briand]], proposed in November to attack the Ottoman Empire but this was rejected and an attempt by the British to bribe the Ottomans to join the Allied side also failed.{{sfn|Strachan|2001|p=115}} Later that month, [[Winston Churchill]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], proposed a naval attack on the Dardanelles, based in part on erroneous reports of Ottoman troop strength. Churchill wanted to use a large number of obsolete battleships, which could not operate against the German [[High Seas Fleet]], in a Dardanelles operation, with a small occupation force provided by the army. It was hoped that an attack on the Ottomans would also draw [[History of Independent Bulgaria#World War I|Bulgaria]] and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] (formerly Ottoman possessions) into the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=27\u201328}} On 2 January 1915, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] of Russia appealed to Britain for assistance against the Ottomans, who were conducting an [[Caucasus campaign|offensive in the Caucasus]].{{sfn|Tamworth Daily Observer|1915|p=2}} Planning began for a naval [[Demonstration (military)|demonstration]] in the Dardanelles, to divert Ottoman troops from Caucasia.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=20}}\n\n==Naval campaign==\n{{main|Naval operations in the Dardanelles campaign}}\n\n===Attempt to force the Straits===\n[[File:Graphic map of the Dardanelles (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Graphic map of the Dardanelles]]\nOn 17 February 1915, a British seaplane from {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|6}} flew a reconnaissance sortie over the Straits.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=40}} Two days later, the first attack on the Dardanelles began when a strong Anglo-French task force, including the British dreadnought {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}}, began a long-range bombardment of Ottoman [[coastal artillery|coastal artillery batteries]]. The British had intended to use eight aircraft from ''Ark Royal'' to spot for the bombardment but harsh conditions rendered all but one of these, a [[Short Admiralty Type 136|Short Type 136]], unserviceable.{{sfn|Gilbert|2013|pp=42\u201343}} A period of bad weather slowed the initial phase but by 25 February the outer forts had been reduced and the entrance cleared of mines.{{sfn|Hart|2013a|pp=9\u201310}} After this, [[Royal Marines]] were landed to destroy guns at Kum Kale and Sedd\u00fclbahir, while the naval bombardment shifted to batteries between Kum Kale and [[Kepez, \u00c7anakkale|Kephez]].{{sfn|Hart|2013a|p=10}}\n\nFrustrated by the mobility of the Ottoman batteries, which evaded the Allied bombardments and threatened the [[minesweeper]]s sent to clear the Straits, Churchill began pressuring the naval commander, Admiral [[Sackville Carden]], to increase the fleet's efforts.{{sfn|Hart|2013a|pp=11\u201312}} Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in  [[Istanbul]] within 14 days.{{sfn|Fromkin|1989|p=135}} A sense of impending victory was heightened by the interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition.{{sfn|Fromkin|1989|p=135}} When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed the main attack would be launched on or around 17 March. It transpired that Carden, suffering from stress, was placed on the sick list by the medical officer and command was taken over by Admiral [[John de Robeck]].{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=60}}\n\n=== 18 March 1915 ===\n[[File:Dardanelles fleet-2.jpg|thumb|400px|Panoramic view of the Allied fleet in the Dardanelles]]\n\nOn 18 March 1915, the Allied fleet, comprising {{nowrap|18 battleships}} with an array of cruisers and destroyers began the main attack against the narrowest point of the Dardanelles, where the straits are {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide. Despite some damage to the Allied ships engaging the forts by Ottoman return fire, minesweepers were ordered along the straits. In the Ottoman official account, by 2:00&nbsp;p.m. \"all telephone wires were cut, all communications with the forts were interrupted, some of the guns had been knocked out&nbsp;... in consequence the artillery fire of the defence had slackened considerably\".{{sfn|James|1995|p=61}} The {{ship|French battleship|Bouvet||2|up=yes}} struck a mine, causing her to capsize in two minutes, with just 75 survivors out of a total crew of&nbsp;718.{{sfn|Hart|2013a|p=12}} Minesweepers, manned by civilians, retreated under Ottoman artillery fire, leaving the minefields largely intact. {{HMS|Irresistible|1898|6}} and {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|6}} struck mines and ''Irresistible'' was sunk, with most of her surviving crew rescued; ''Inflexible'' was badly damaged and withdrawn. There was confusion during the battle about the cause of the damage; some participants blamed torpedoes. {{HMS|Ocean|1898|6}} was sent to rescue ''Irresistible'' but was disabled from an artillery shell, struck a mine, and was abandoned, eventually to sink.{{sfn|Fromkin|1989|p=151}}\n\nThe French battleships {{ship|French battleship|Suffren||2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Gaulois||2}} sailed through a new line of mines placed secretly by the Ottoman minelayer ''[[Ottoman minelayer Nusret|Nusret]]'' ten days before and were also damaged.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=33\u201334}} The losses forced de Robeck to sound the \"general recall\" to protect what remained of his force.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=35}} During the planning of the campaign, naval losses had been anticipated and mainly obsolete battleships, unfit to face the German fleet, had been sent. Some of the senior naval officers like the commander of ''Queen Elizabeth'', Commodore [[Roger Keyes]], felt that they had come close to victory, believing that the Ottoman guns had almost run out of ammunition but the views of de Robeck, the [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] and others prevailed. Allied attempts to force the straits using naval power were terminated, due to the losses and bad weather.{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=35}}{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=60}}{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=15}} Planning to capture the Turkish defences by land, to open the way for the ships began.

Kitchener appointed General [[Ian Hamilton (British Army officer)|Sir Ian Hamilton]] to command the {{nowrap|78,000 men}} of the [[Mediterranean Expeditionary Force]] (MEF).{{sfn|Baldwin|1962|p=60}}{{sfn|History.com|2017|}} Soldiers from the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) and [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (NZEF) were encamped in [[Egypt]], undergoing training prior to being sent to France.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=92}} The Australian and New Zealand troops were formed into the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC), commanded by [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Sir William Birdwood]], comprising the volunteer [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Australian Division]] and the [[New Zealand and Australian Division]]. The ANZAC troops were joined by the [[Standing army|regular]] [[29th Division (United Kingdom)|29th Division]] and the [[Royal Naval Division]].{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=40}} The French ''[[Corps exp\u00e9ditionnaire d'Orient]]'' (Orient Expeditionary Corps), consisting of [[Metropolitan France|metropolitan]] and colonial troops, was subsequently placed under Hamilton's command.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=25}}{{sfn|Wahlert|2008|p=16}}{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=14}}{{efn|The operation would be complicated by having only five divisions, the rugged terrain of the peninsula, the small number of landing beaches and great difficulty in providing supplies.{{sfn|Holmes|2001|p=343}} Later on, the MEF was supported by about 2,000 civilian labourers from the Egyptian and Maltese Labour Corps.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|p=395}}}}\n\nOver the following month, Hamilton prepared his plan and the British and French divisions joined the Australians in Egypt.

An actual white flag should be regarded with the utmost suspicion as a Turkish soldier is unlikely to possess anything of that colour.{{sfn|Reagan|1992|p=166}}}}\n\nThe underestimation of Ottoman military potential stemmed from a \"sense of superiority\" among the Allies, because of the decline of the Ottoman Empire and its poor performance in [[Libya]] in during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] of 1911-12 and the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912 and 1913. Allied intelligence failed to adequately prepare for the campaign, in some cases relying on information gained from Egyptian travel guides.{{sfn|Erickson|2001b|p=983}}{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The troops for the assault were loaded on transports in the order they were to disembark, causing a long delay which meant that many troops, including the French at [[Mudros]], were forced to detour to Alexandria to embark on the ships that would take them into battle.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|p=52}} A five-week delay until the end of April ensued, during which the Ottomans strengthened their defences on the peninsula; although bad weather during March and April might have delayed the landings anyway, preventing supply and reinforcement.{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|p=226}} Following preparations in Egypt, Hamilton and his headquarters staff arrived at Mudros on 10 April.{{sfn|Travers|2001|p=48}} The ANZAC Corps departed Egypt in early April and assembled on the island of [[Lemnos]] in Greece on 12 April, where a small garrison had been established in early March and practice landings were undertaken.{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|p=226}} The British 29th Division departed for Mudros on 7 April and the Royal Naval Division rehearsed on the island of [[Skyros]], after arriving there on 17 April.{{sfn|Hart|2013b|p=54}} That day, the British submarine {{HMS|E15||6}} tried to run the straits but hit a submarine net, ran aground and was shelled by a Turkish fort, killing its commander, Lieutenant Commander Theodore S.

All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges of the peninsula. There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces. [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of the peninsula) and [[Kabatepe|Gaba Tepe]] were the likely areas for landing.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=31}}{{sfn|Butler|2011|p=121}}\n\nMustafa Kemal believed that the British would use their naval power to command the land from every side at the tip of the peninsula; at Gaba Tepe, the short distance to the eastern coast meant that the Allies could easily reach the Narrows (the right-angled bend in the middle of the Dardanelles).{{sfn|Kinross|1995|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Bean|1941a|p=179}} Sanders considered [[Be\u015fik Bay, \u00c7anakkale|Besika Bay]] on the Asiatic coast to be the most vulnerable to invasion, since the terrain was easier to cross and was convenient to attack the most important Ottoman batteries guarding the straits and a third of the 5th Army was assembled there.{{sfn|James|1995|p=74}} Two divisions were concentrated at [[Bolay\u0131r|Bulair]] at the north end of the Gallipoli peninsula, to protect supply and communication lines to the defences further down the peninsula.{{sfn|James|1995|p=75}} The [[19th Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|19th Division]] (Kemal) and the 9th Division were placed along the Aegean coast and at Cape Helles on the tip of the peninsula. Sanders kept the bulk of the Ottoman forces inland in reserve, leaving a minimum of troops guarding the coast.{{sfn|Aspinall-Oglander|1929|p=154}} The 3rd Division and a cavalry brigade arrived from Istanbul in early April, bringing the front line strength of the Ottomans to {{nowrap|60,000\u201362,077 men,}} which Sanders concentrated in three groups.

On 23 August, after news of the failure at Scimitar Hill, Hamilton went onto the defensive as Bulgarian entry into the war, which would allow the Germans to rearm the Turkish army, was imminent and left little opportunity for the resumption of offensive operations.

Broadbent describes the campaign as \"a close-fought affair\" that was a defeat for the Allies,{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|pp=268, 269}} while [[Les Carlyon|Carlyon]] views the overall result as a stalemate.{{sfn|Carlyon|2001|p=518}} [[Peter Hart (military historian)|Peter Hart]] disagrees, arguing that the Ottoman forces \"held the Allies back from their real objectives with relative ease\",{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=12}} while [[Philip Haythornthwaite|Haythornthwaite]] calls it a \"disaster for the Allies\".{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}} The campaign did cause \"enormous damage to&nbsp;...

While it diverted Ottoman forces away from other areas of conflict in the Middle East, the campaign also consumed resources the Allies could have employed on the Western Front,{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=15}} and also resulted in heavy losses on the Allied side.{{sfn|Haythornthwaite|2004|p=90}}\n\nThe Allied campaign was plagued by ill-defined goals, poor planning, insufficient artillery, inexperienced troops, inaccurate maps, poor intelligence, overconfidence, inadequate equipment, and logistical and tactical deficiencies at all levels.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Broadbent|2005|p=268}} Geography also proved a significant factor. While the Allied forces possessed inaccurate maps and intelligence and proved unable to exploit the terrain to their advantage, the Ottoman commanders were able to utilise the high ground around the Allied landing beaches to position well-sited defences that limited the ability of Allied forces to penetrate inland, confining them to narrow beaches.{{sfn|Doyle|Bennett|1999|p=12}} The campaign's necessity remains the subject of debate,{{sfn|Stevenson|2007|p=189}} and the recriminations that followed were significant, highlighting the schism that had developed between military strategists who felt the Allies should focus on fighting on the Western Front and those who favoured trying to end the war by attacking Germany's \"soft underbelly\", its allies in the east.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=10}}\n\nBritish and French submarine operations in the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five [[gunboat]]s, 11 [[troop transport]]s, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels at a cost of eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|pp=76\u201378}} During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=73}} ''E2'' left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles.{{sfn|O'Connell|2010|p=78}} By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease operations in the area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed.

Mobile devices are proving to increase political participation and are now even being portrayed as a voting gadget in even the [[least developed countries]].

In the 2019 London election, of 18-25 year olds 56% voted Labour and 21% Conservative. Although this cannot ever be wholly contributed to the backing of Corbyn by UK artists, the effect cannot be underestimated.

For example, the most developed regions of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, have the highest [[Global Internet usage|Internet penetration rates]] at over 80% each, while the least developed countries such as in Africa and South Asia have less than 30% each.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269329/penetration-rate-of-the-internet-by-region/|title=Global regional internet penetration rate 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> On the other hand, the reduced cost and increasing availability of mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s throughout less developed regions is helping to reduce this disparity at an exponential rate. In just two years, between 2013 and 2015, the number of Internet users in developing nations has risen by 9%, according to the [[Pew Research Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/smartphone-ownership-and-internet-usage-continues-to-climb-in-emerging-economies/|title=Smartphone Ownership and Internet Usage Continues to Climb in Emerging Economies|date=2016-02-22|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}</ref> Other research has shown, though, that even within more developed countries like the United States, the digital divide continues to persist between upper and lower socioeconomic classes<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/broadband-adoption-rates-and-gaps-in-u-s-metropolitan-areas/|title=Broadband adoption rates and gaps in U.S. metropolitan areas|last=Tomer|first=Adie|date=2015|work=Brookings|access-date=2018-07-01|last2=Kane|first2=Joseph|language=en-US}}</ref> and between different education levels.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/05/some-americans-dont-use-the-internet-who-are-they/|title=11% of Americans don't use the internet.

The largest use of bots is in web spidering, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. More than half of all web traffic is made up of bots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/web_crawler.htm|title=Web crawler|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> This aids in the detection of bots as through qualitative coding, softwares can confirm the presence of bots. An example would be the Bot-a-meter developed by Indiana University, where they evaluate 7 different factors to determine whether or not an accounts is a bot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/|title=Botometer by OSoMe|website=botometer.iuni.iu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\nA Sock Puppet is an online identity used for purposes of deception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127107-sock-puppet-accounts-unmasked-by-the-way-they-write-and-post/|title=Sock puppet accounts unmasked by the way they write and post|website=www.newscientist.com|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> The term originally referred to a false identity assumed by a member of an Internet community who is pretending to be another person.

Like many physical experiences, they also have a digital counterpart. In areas such as the United States, [[Electronic voting|online voting]] have been developing in the form of smartphone applications or secure websites. Online voting allows more citizens to exercise their right to vote by breaking down the physical barrier that may keep a voter from voting.\n\nAs an unwanted result, online voting is easier to manipulate. Social media apps such as [[Instagram]] or [[Facebook]] have taken the initiative to get people registered and motivated to go and vote. Despite their efforts, there are social media account engineered to misinform the public causing a jaded perspective in electable candidates or understanding of policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/05/13/publics-think-technology-impacts-the-political-environment-in-both-positive-and-negative-ways/|title=People think technology impacts politics positively and negatively|last=NW|first=1615 L.

In the 2016 U.S. election, [[Alex Halderman|J.

Official users of the application suffered from reporting issues, leading to incomplete data, and a bottleneck during transmission. President of [[Verified Voting Foundation|Verified Voting]], Marian Schneider released a statement that says,<blockquote>\"The situation with Iowa's caucus reveals the risks associated with technology, in this case with a mobile app, but more importantly that there needs to be a low-tech solution in order to recover from technological failures -- no matter the cause, There needs to be a way to monitor, detect, respond and recover.

It was a term first used at the Personal Democracy Forum in 2014. The basic concept of [[leapfrogging]] is that small and incremental innovations lead allow radical innovations with new firms or countries to \"leapfrog\" old and ancient ones, including with different governmental institutions and ideas. Countries that have huge developments that more typically advanced countries might only have much later.\n\n==== Tunisia ====\nAn example of this is the new [[Tunisia|Tunsia]] constitution. Learning from America and other countries, Tunisia developed a constitution that provides more rights that typical constitutions with issues concerning climate change, healthcare, women's rights, and workers' rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/4-ways-tunisia-is-now-more-progressive-than-the-united-states-9879ae93d105/|title=4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> They have provided rights that the United States' government does not cover for its citizens. Tunisia has set the stage for many other countries to follow in their footsteps including Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Although these countries' attempts at democracies have not been nearly as successful as Tunisia's constitution.\n\n==== Estonia ====\nAnother example of a Leapfrog democracy is Estonia being one of the first countries to use online voting. Nearly 99% of their public services are available online, and a reported 44% of Estonia citizens use the online services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/i-voting/|title=i-Voting|website=e-Estonia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> [[Electronic voting in Estonia|Electronic Voting in Estonia]] has been occurring since 2005 and can cast votes through an app on their mobile device.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/06/07/how-estonias-e-voting-system-could-be-the-future/|title=How Estonia's E-Voting System Could Be The Future|last=Leetaru|first=Kalev|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Through Estonia's national ID infrastructure, National ID cards have the ability to perform cryptographic functions to authenticate their access to different websites and make legally binding signatures on documents if needed. These cards work through the use of two different RSA key pairs.

It's clear that mobile apps are not ready for prime time, but thankfully Iowa has paper records of their vote totals and will be able to release results from those records.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2350669680|title=Gov Tech Lessons Learned from Iowa's Caucus App Debacle|last=Westrope|first=Andrew|date=February 4, 2020|website=Proquest.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>Since the Iowa Caucus, other state's Democratic Parties have declined their use of [[Shadow Inc.]] application for their state's primaries.\n\n== Leapfrog Democracies ==\n[[File:Estonian municipal elections 2013.png|thumb|This is the divide of the different political parties in Estonia where in the 2013 elections, over 133,000 people (roughly 21.2% of participating voters) voted over the Internet.

It was a term first used at the Personal Democracy Forum in 2014. The basic concept of [[leapfrogging]] is that small and incremental innovations lead allow radical innovations with new firms or countries to \"leapfrog\" old and ancient ones, including with different governmental institutions and ideas. Countries that have huge developments that more typically advanced countries might only have much later.\n\n==== Tunisia ====\nAn example of this is the new [[Tunisia|Tunsia]] constitution. Learning from America and other countries, Tunisia developed a constitution that provides more rights that typical constitutions with issues concerning climate change, healthcare, women's rights, and workers' rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/4-ways-tunisia-is-now-more-progressive-than-the-united-states-9879ae93d105/|title=4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> They have provided rights that the United States' government does not cover for its citizens. Tunisia has set the stage for many other countries to follow in their footsteps including Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Although these countries' attempts at democracies have not been nearly as successful as Tunisia's constitution.\n\n==== Estonia ====\nAnother example of a Leapfrog democracy is Estonia being one of the first countries to use online voting. Nearly 99% of their public services are available online, and a reported 44% of Estonia citizens use the online services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/i-voting/|title=i-Voting|website=e-Estonia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> [[Electronic voting in Estonia|Electronic Voting in Estonia]] has been occurring since 2005 and can cast votes through an app on their mobile device.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/06/07/how-estonias-e-voting-system-could-be-the-future/|title=How Estonia's E-Voting System Could Be The Future|last=Leetaru|first=Kalev|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Through Estonia's national ID infrastructure, National ID cards have the ability to perform cryptographic functions to authenticate their access to different websites and make legally binding signatures on documents if needed. These cards work through the use of two different RSA key pairs. However, there are still some drawbacks of this voting process as there are inadequate procedural controls that change several times or are not followed, lax operational security, and insufficient transparency. These weaknesses can allow for client side attacks on the voting system.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Springall|first=Drew|chapter=Security Analysis of the Estonian Internet Voting System|title= CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security |year=2014|pages=703\u2013715|doi=10.1145/2660267.2660315|isbn=9781450329576}}</ref>\n\n== Presence of online tools for political participation ==\n\nWith the increasing use of technology in the political sphere, many new platforms have emerged in an attempt to provide unbiased information to the general public in a manner that is accessible  to all. The idea of spreading unbiased information has become a popular platform for many apps to get started on. Many of these apps hope to be able to spread this information so that voters may be more educated about the political sphere and make more of an informed decisions when voting.<ref name=\"Armstrong\"/> Some more examples include Liquid.us, Countable,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.countable.us/|title=Contact your Reps, Influence Congress, Vote on Bills|website=www.countable.us|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Capitol Bells,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitolbells.com/splash/|title=Capitol Bells|website=www.capitolbells.com|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Fiscalnote,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fiscalnote.com/|title=Homepage|website=FiscalNote|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> and Councilmatic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://councilmatic.org/|title=Councilmatic - Your local city council, demystified|last=|website=Councilmatic|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Technology is progressing rapidly to making a significant impact on our future campaigns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iop.harvard.edu/get-involved/study-groups/technology-innovation-and-politics-led-sonal-shah|title=Technology, Innovation and Politics led by Sonal Shah|website=The Institute of Politics at Harvard University|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> A [[comparison of civic technology platforms]] highlights the similarities and differences between different online tools used for political participation.\n\n==== PopVox ====\nAn example of this is PopVox, as they provide a holistic view of every bill and resolution that has passed or is currently in discussion with our government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popvox.com/|title=Your direct connection to lawmakers|website=www.popvox.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> Popvox also provides a platform for voters to share their opinions on different bills being discussed in Congress at the moment, and from the start of the app over 350,000 people have used the app from across the country to share their opinions on bills and become more informed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahmckinney/2014/02/01/the-future-of-political-engagement-is-here-and-its-called-popvox/|title=The Future Of Political Engagement Is Here (And It's Called POPVOX)|last=McKinney|first=Sarah|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>\n\n==== iSideWith ====\niSideWith is an application that seeks to provide voters with a more educated guess of who they would politically side with.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isidewith.com/|title=America's most popular voting guide for elections, political issues, candidates, and poll data|website=iSideWith|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> They have an in-depth survey on their website that asks about the users' political opinion on common issues discussed or debated within the government currently to give the voter a ranking of which politician best aligns with what stance they have on the current political sphere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz|title=2019 Political Quiz|website=iSideWith|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> This gives voters more of an educated guess of who they should be casting their vote for.

Specifically having a section about Internet Voting, they speak about the dangers and information leaks that come with using the internet or anything digital to cast votes, even with blockchain. Verified Voting defines internet voting to even include email or fax voting or any voting through an online portal. This is due to the fact that any form of electronic voting can cause the vote to be susceptible to a large number of security threats including cyber-attacks that can skew voting results and preferences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/internet-voting/|title=Internet Voting {{!}} Verified Voting|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> According to NIST, it is difficult to make sure that votes are coming from verified and registered voters and it has not been changed in transit.

The bungalow is looked after by caretaker Parameswaran and his Tamil wife Kannamma. Parameswaran has a son Gopan who stays away from the place and does guide work for foreigners. Parameswaran has told both of them that Jaysree is Das' wife to avoid ill-fame to the family name. Das feels he owns Jaysree and does not waste a single opportunity to ridicule her profession. Other than sex, there is no emotional bond between them. A family friend of Das' late father, Panikkar and family drop by to meet Das' wife which makes Das uncomfortable. Though Jaysree refuses at first to play the role, she then acts as a dutiful wife before them. Panikkar's family consists of his wife Chinnammu Amma, father-in-law Rao Bahadur Shankaramenon, and two daughters, elder one being Nirmala married to engineer Ramakrishnan and younger one Sridevi who is separated from her husband. Two relations build up simultaneously. On one side, Sridevi is able to bring back the fondness of music in Das and they spent time understanding each other. On the other side, Jaysree feels Gopan is like herself, a victim of helplessness and she becomes attached to him. Things take a turn when, after a moment of passion, Jaysree tells the truth about herself to Gopan and he feels a revulsion towards her. Meanwhile, Das confesses his womanising nature to Sridevi and then proposes to her but she is unable to commit to him. Finally, Jaysree leaves the house and Gopan joins her in her journey. Sridevi's separated husband Vijayshankar apologises to her for his insensitive behaviour and she goes back to him.

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing, or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposite to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing, or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer \u2013 C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, amount of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customers wants and needs. B2C demand is primary because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants. This orientation seeks to attain the highest possible sales through promotion and direct sales techniques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Kotler|first=Philip|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1980|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}</ref> The sales orientation \"is typically practiced with unsought goods.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29</ref> One study found that industrial companies are more likely to hold a sales orientation than consumer goods companies.<ref>Avlonitis, G.J. and Gounaris, S.P., \"Marketing Orientation and Company Performance: Industrial vs. Consumer Goods Companies,\" ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 26, 1997, pp. 385\u2013402</ref> The approach may also suit scenarios in which a firm holds dead stock, or otherwise sells a product that is in high demand, with little likelihood of changes in consumer tastes diminishing demand.\n\nA 2011 meta analyses<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11747-010-0211-8|title = Drivers of sales performance: A contemporary meta-analysis.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market.

A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}</ref><ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, Christian. \"From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing,\" ''Management Decision,'' vol. 32, no. 2, 1994, pp. 4\u201320.</ref>\n[[File:Marketing Mix 4P.svg|alt=The 4Ps of the marketing mix stand for product, price, place and promotion|thumb|278x278px|One version of the marketing mix is the 4Ps method.]]\n\n==== Outline ====\n\n;[[Product (business)|Product]]\n:The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the [[end-user]]'s needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing, or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposite to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing, or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer \u2013 C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, amount of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customers wants and needs. B2C demand is primary because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants. This orientation seeks to attain the highest possible sales through promotion and direct sales techniques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Kotler|first=Philip|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1980|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}</ref> The sales orientation \"is typically practiced with unsought goods.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29</ref> One study found that industrial companies are more likely to hold a sales orientation than consumer goods companies.<ref>Avlonitis, G.J. and Gounaris, S.P., \"Marketing Orientation and Company Performance: Industrial vs. Consumer Goods Companies,\" ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 26, 1997, pp. 385\u2013402</ref> The approach may also suit scenarios in which a firm holds dead stock, or otherwise sells a product that is in high demand, with little likelihood of changes in consumer tastes diminishing demand.\n\nA 2011 meta analyses<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11747-010-0211-8|title = Drivers of sales performance: A contemporary meta-analysis.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.
