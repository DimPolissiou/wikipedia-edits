The club's new chairman was Karl Junker took over the presidency from Carl Burkhardt at the AGM on 8 July 1927. However Junker only remained as president until 15 September, then [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]] took over for his third period. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nBasel played a total of 27 matches in their 1927\u201328 season. 16 of these were in the domestic league, one was in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 10 were friendly matches. Of these 10 friendlies four were played at home in the [[Landhof]] and six were away games. Apart from the away game against [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]] all other matches were in Switzerland.\n\nProbably one of the biggest highlights during these friendly games, was the fixture in the [[Landhof]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who had just won the [[English Football League]] championship that season. The game attracted 8,000 supporters, but Basel lost the comparison against the english champions by two goals to nil. Both goals were scored by [[Dixie Dean]].<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-everton-1927/28\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=29381 | title = FC Basel - Everton FC 0:2 (0:1) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 16 November 2019}}</ref> Dean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season and [[1927-28 in English football|this (1927\u201328)]] was the season in that he accomplished this record.<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web | first = | last = James M.

The club's new chairman was Karl Junker took over the presidency from Carl Burkhardt at the AGM on 8 July 1927. However Junker only remained as president until 15 September, then [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]] took over for his third period. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nBasel played a total of 27 matches in their 1927\u201328 season. 16 of these were in the domestic league, one was in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 10 were friendly matches. Of these 10 friendlies four were played at home in the [[Landhof]] and six were away games. Apart from the away game against [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]] all other matches were in Switzerland.\n\nProbably one of the biggest highlights during these friendly games, was the fixture in the [[Landhof]] against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who had just won the [[English Football League]] championship that season. The game attracted 8,000 supporters, but Basel lost the comparison against the english champions by two goals to nil. Both goals were scored by [[Dixie Dean]].<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-everton-1927/28\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=29381 | title = FC Basel - Everton FC 0:2 (0:1) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 16 November 2019}}</ref> Dean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season and [[1927-28 in English football|this (1927\u201328)]] was the season in that he accomplished this record..<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web | first = | last = James M.

The club's new chairman was Hans Rupprecht who took over the presidency from [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]] at the AGM on 7 July 1928. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe former  [[Hungary national football team|Hungarian]] international footballer [[Gyula Kert\u00e9sz]] was appointed as coach/manager at the beginning of the [[1928\u201329 Swiss Serie A|1928\u201329 Serie A season]]. After [[Percy Humphreys]] (1913\u201314) and [[Max Breunig]] (1922\u201323), Kert\u00e9sz was just the third professional trainer that the club had engaged up until this point. Basel played a total of 29 matches in their 1928\u201329 season. 16 of these were in the domestic league, three were in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 10 were friendly matches. Of these 10 friendlies three were played at home in the [[Landhof]] and seven were away games. Apart from the away game against [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]] all other matches were in Switzerland.\n\nThe [[1928\u201329 Swiss Serie A]] was divided into three regional groups, each group with nine teams. The teams that won each group continue to the finals and the last placed team in each group had to play a barrage against relegation. Basel were allocated to the Central group together with the other three local clubs [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]], [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]] and [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys Basel]]. The other five teams allocated to this group were [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]], [[FC Bern]], [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], [[FC Grenchen|Grenchen]] and [[FC Solothurn|Solothurn]]. This season was a very competetive one. The top five teams ended the season within four points of each other and each team won eight of their 16 matches. Of Basel's other games four were drawn and four were lost. Basel scored 48 goals and conceeded 32. With 20 points they ended the season in second position, just one point behind group winners [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. [[Karl Bielser]] was the teams top goalscorer with 15 goals, [[Alfred Schlecht]] was second top scorer with 14 goals.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-bilanz-Saison 1928/29\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1928/29 | title = Bilanz - Saison 1928/29 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel were drawn against [[FC Baden|Baden]] in the preleminary round, against [[FC B\u00fclach|B\u00fclach]] in the first round, but were eliminated by [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]] in the second round.

The club's new chairman was Hans Rupprecht who took over the presidency from [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]] at the AGM on 7 July 1928. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe former  [[Hungary national football team|Hungarian]] international footballer [[Gyula Kert\u00e9sz]] was appointed as coach/manager at the beginning of the [[1928\u201329 Swiss Serie A|1928\u201329 Serie A season]]. After [[Percy Humphreys]] (1913\u201314) and [[Max Breunig]] (1922\u201323), Kert\u00e9sz was just the third professional trainer that the club had engaged up until this point. Basel played a total of 29 matches in their 1928\u201329 season. 16 of these were in the domestic league, three were in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 10 were friendly matches. Of these 10 friendlies three were played at home in the [[Landhof]] and seven were away games. Apart from the away game against [[FC Mulhouse|Mulhouse]] all other matches were in Switzerland.\n\nThe [[1928\u201329 Swiss Serie A]] was divided into three regional groups, each group with nine teams. The teams that won each group continue to the finals and the last placed team in each group had to play a barrage against relegation. Basel were allocated to the Central group together with the other three local clubs [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]], [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]] and [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys Basel]]. The other five teams allocated to this group were [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]], [[FC Bern]], [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], [[FC Grenchen|Grenchen]] and [[FC Solothurn|Solothurn]]. This season was a very competetive one. The top five teams ended the season within four points of each other and each team won eight of their 16 matches. Of Basel's other games four were drawn and four were lost. Basel scored 48 goals and conceeded 32. With 20 points they ended the season in second position, just one point behind group winners [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. [[Karl Bielser]] was the teams top goalscorer with 15 goals, [[Alfred Schlecht]] was second top scorer with 14 goals.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-bilanz-Saison 1928/29\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1928/29 | title = Bilanz - Saison 1928/29 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel were drawn against [[FC Baden|Baden]] in the preleminary round, against [[FC B\u00fclach|B\u00fclach]] in the first round, but were eliminated by [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]] in the second round.
