[[Mayor of San Diego]]. Incumbent [[Kevin Faulconer]] was ineligible to run for a third term due to [[term limit]]s.\n\nThe non-partisan primary election was held on March 3, 2020. The top two finishers, California State Assemblymember [[Todd Gloria]] and San Diego City Council president pro tem [[Barbara Bry]] advanced to the general election. This guaranteed that a Democrat would be elected mayor of San Diego for only the third time since 1971. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though some candidates do receive funding and support from various political parties.\n\nThe general election between Gloria and Bry will take place on November 3, 2020. \n\n==Candidates==\n* Note: Municipal elections in California are officially nonpartisan.

Laurie held this role for 50 years, in which time he greatly improved the education of teachers in Scotland. He vigorously campaigned to have all teachers educated at university, with the teacher training colleges providing professional training only after that. It took until 1873 for the Scottish board of education to give the training colleges the right to send their best students, at least, to universities to gain full degrees.

The Merchant Company's schools were known as \"hospitals\" and were run in monastic style. His report was critical of these schools, observing that while a larger amount was spent on them than all the parish schools of Scotland, they were not providing adequate moral and intellectual education. Laurie recommended sending the boys to his alma mater, the Edinburgh High School, while a new high school should be opened for day girls. His recommendations were embodied in an 1869 [[Act of Parliament]] which abolished the monastic and alms-giving nature of the former \"hospitals\".<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1872, Laurie was appointed secretary to the royal commission on Scottish endowed schools.

It was dissolved in 1880 when it achieved its goal with the passing of the [[Endowed Institutions (Scotland) Act 1878]].<ref name=DNB/>\n\nIn 1891, as president of the Teachers' Guild of Great Britain and Ireland, Laurie gave evidence before a select parliamentary committee, arguing for the registration and organisation of all state school teachers to improve the quality of teaching. At the same time, he was strongly opposed to centralised bureaucratic control by the board of education, favouring freedom for local education authorities.<ref name=DNB/>\n\n===Writings===\nHe wrote widely on education and on philosophical topics.

He used the position to improve pedagogy in the whole of Britain, not only in Scotland.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nAlso in 1876, he became honorary secretary of the Association for Promoting Secondary Education in Scotland, a voluntary campaigning organisation.

At the same time, he was strongly opposed to centralised bureaucratic control by the board of education, favouring freedom for local education authorities.<ref name=DNB/>\n\n===Writings===\nHe wrote widely on education and on philosophical topics. Josipa Petrunic describes his philosophical writings as \"often nebulous and obscure\", in contrast to his more practical work on education.<ref name=Petrunic>Petrunic, 2012.</ref>\n\nLaurie resigned his chair in 1903, and retired from his work with the Dick Bequest in 1907.<ref name=Petrunic/>\nIn 1905\u20136, he gave the Gifford Lectures in natural theology, in Edinburgh. He wrote up the lectures in ''Synthetica'' (1905\u201306), which \"gave Laurie high rank among speculative writers\".

The goal is to encourage economic revitalization and historic preservation. TIFA remains established to continue efforts in elevating the standard of living for all residents of the district.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n'''Property availability list'''<br />A property availability list (PAL) is regularly updated on the TIFA website. It is a comprehensive list of all commercial and industrial parcels for sale in the district, which provides the browser with property specifications and contact information for the appropriate real estate agent. The goal of the PAL is not to promote or advocate businesses, but rather to avoid vacancies and assist in the occupancy of commercial buildings in the district, in turn stimulating the local economy.\n\n'''Recent programs'''<br />The Business Improvement Program was launched in June 2008. It is a grant program designed to assist business owners in the TIFA district who wish to repair structural or exterior deterioration of their buildings.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n====Public schools====\n[[Image:Robichaud high school dearborn heights michigan.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Robichaud High School]]]]\nDearborn Heights is divided into five school districts.

The Dearborn Heights Tax Increment Finance Authority is a community service office branched out of the State of Michigan and the City of Dearborn Heights. The goal is to encourage economic revitalization and historic preservation. TIFA remains established to continue efforts in elevating the standard of living for all residents of the district.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n'''Property availability list'''<br />A property availability list (PAL) is regularly updated on the TIFA website. It is a comprehensive list of all commercial and industrial parcels for sale in the district, which provides the browser with property specifications and contact information for the appropriate real estate agent. The goal of the PAL is not to promote or advocate businesses, but rather to avoid vacancies and assist in the occupancy of commercial buildings in the district, in turn stimulating the local economy.\n\n'''Recent programs'''<br />The Business Improvement Program was launched in June 2008. It is a grant program designed to assist business owners in the TIFA district who wish to repair structural or exterior deterioration of their buildings.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\n====Public schools====\n[[Image:Robichaud high school dearborn heights michigan.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Robichaud High School]]]]\nDearborn Heights is divided into five school districts.

''[[Pixie Hollow (video game)|Pixie Hollow]]'', and ''Club Penguin'', with ''[[The World of Cars Online|World of Cars]]'' set to follow soon.

Local government officials would then collect all ''terauke'', bind them in ledgers called {{nihongo|''sh\u016bmon ninbetsu aratamech\u014d'' |\u5b97\u9580\u4eba\u5225\u6539\u5e33}}<ref name=\"hur\"/> and submit them to higher authorities.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> The purpose was to force Christians to become affiliated to a Buddhist temple, while making the monitoring of suspected Christians easier.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>\n\nThe very first registries in existence are dated between 1638 and 1640 and, unsurprisingly, are found in areas where the Christian religion was strong, for example [[Kyoto]], its province and [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]].<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> Registries in other areas aren't found until the second half of the 17th century, but individual ''terauke'', which clearly served the same purpose, are.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>\n\nBecause in 1664 the bakufu ordered to all [[daimy\u014d]]s the establishment in their domain of an officer of religious investigation called {{nihongo|magistrate of religion|\u5b97\u9580\u5949\u884c|sh\u016bmon bugy\u014d}} or {{nihongo|magistrate of temples and shrines|\u5bfa\u793e\u5949\u884c|jisha bugy\u014d}}, from the following year registries of religious affiliation started being produced nationwide.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> \n\nIn 1671 the registry's format was standardized. The document had to record all peasant households, state the number of men and women of each town, plus the totals for all districts and the province.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> The intendant had to keep the registry and send a one-page summary to higher authorities.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> Further, all departures from the community due to marriage, work or death were to be recorded. This registry format was maintained unchanged until 1870, three years into the [[Meiji era]].<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> Since the order explicitly states that \"''Naturally, it is appropriate to investigate many things, and not only at the time of inquiry into religion''\",<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> the system clearly had from the beginning purposes that went beyond religion. The result was an [[Edo]] equivalent of today's household registry, set apart only by the temple's obligation to specify a family temple and the citizens' to obtain a ''terauke''.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> In some regions, the right to issue certificates was called {{nihongo|''sh\u016bhanken''|\u5b97\u5224\u6a29}}\uff0ca right which gradually became a source of great power for the temples.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> Not only was a certificate issued after payment of a fee, but it gave religious authorities the power of life and death over parishioners.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>\n\nThis document had to be obtained every year after an inspection at one's temple of affiliation.<ref name=\"hur\"/> Those who for some reason couldn't obtain a temple certification were recorded as [[hinin]] (''non-persons'') and thereafter subject to discrimination,<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> or simply executed as Christians.<ref name=\"hur\"/> Not only peasants, but even samurai and Shint\u014d priests could not live or function within society without a ''terauke'',<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> which had assumed a role similar to that of identity papers now. It was necessary to marry, to travel, to gain access to certain jobs.<ref name=\"Sheid\"/> After 1729 the breaking of ties between a temple and a ''danka'' (or {{nihongo|''ridan''|\u96e2\u58c7}}) was formally outlawed, making the link between a ''danka'' and a temple impossible to break.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> This eliminated competition for parishioners between temples, giving a man and his family no possibility to change temple of affiliation. By the late 17th century the system had become an integral part of the Tokugawa state apparatus.<ref name=\"hur\"/> It also contributed to the enforcement of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] orthodoxy; the ''danka'' system was used to stamp out ''[[Ikk\u014d-sh\u016b]]'' and other schools of Buddhism deemed \"deviant\" in the Tokugawa era.<ref>{{cite book|last=Josephson |first=Jason |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=39|location = Chicago|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxzuzIszO60C}}</ref>\n\n== The appearance of the ''Goj\u014dmoku'' ==\nThe life of the ''dankas'' were later made even more difficult by a document that greatly expanded a temple's powers over those affiliated to it. Purporting to be a ''bakufu'' law regulating in great detail the certification of religious affiliation process, it appeared around 1735 and had thereafter large circulation all over Japan.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> Dated 1613 and called \"Individual Rules Concerning the Certification of Religious Affiliation for Danka\"(''Goj\u014dmoku Sh\u016bmon Danna Ukeai No Okite'' (\u5fa1\u6761\u76ee\u5b97\u9580\u65e6\u90a3\u8acb\u5408\u4e4b\u639f), usually abbreviated in just ''Goj\u014dmoku''), it is demonstrably a forgery, probably created by the temples themselves, whose interests it serves.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> \n\nThat the document is a fake is proven beyond doubt by the fact that it lists among the forbidden religions not only Christianity, but also the {{nihongo|[[Fuju-fuse]]|\u4e0d\u53d7\u4e0d\u65bd}} and {{nihongo|Hiden|\u60b2\u7530}} subschools of the [[Nichiren]] [[sect]]. Since the two schools were outlawed respectively in 1669 and 1691, the date of issue must have been deliberately misstated.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> The likely reason this particular date was chosen is that it is the year in which Tokugawa Ieyasu's {{nihongo|\"Order to Expel Christian Priests\"|\u4f34\u5929\u9023\u8ffd\u653e\u4ee4|Bateren Tsuih\u014drei}} was issued, and because the following year temples were ordered to start issuing ''terauke''.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>\n\nThe document is often found in temples and collections all over the country and it appears to have been believed genuine even by most [[Meiji period]] historians.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> The Goj\u014dmoku, which gives temples additional power over parishioners, is mentioned occasionally by temple registries and, when a ''danka'' did not meet its conditions, the temple certification wasn't issued.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> Its provisions caused considerable problems between ''danka'' and temples.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>\n\nThe document first defined four duties of the ''danka''. \n* Duty to visit the temple on several yearly occasion. Failure to make the visits could cause the removal of the ''danka'''s name from the registry.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> \n* Duty to perform two services on the day of the ancestor memorial service. Failure to provide adequate entertainment for the priest meant being branded as a Christian.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> \n* Duty to make the family temple perform all memorial and funerary services.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> \n* Duty of anyone capable of walking to be present at memorial services for ancestors.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>   \n\nIt then gave five rights to its temple.\n\n* A ''danka'' had to perform certain acts in favor of the temple, including making offerings and providing free labor. Failure to do so meant being branded as a Fuju-fuse sect member.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>\n* A ''danka'' had to obey its temple and give money to its priests.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>  \n* Regardless of how long a ''danka'' group had been faithful, it was always to be subject to religious investigation to determine the possible emergence of heresy.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> \n* After someone's death, just looking at the corpse the priest could determine what the defunct's true religion had been.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/> \n* The ''danka'' was always to follow his temple's orders.<ref name=\"tamamuro\"/>\n\n== Consequences of the ''danka'' system==\nThe consequences of two centuries and a half of ''terauke'' use and of the bureaucratization of Buddhism were numerous and profound, first of all for Buddhism itself.\n\n=== Structural distortions ===\nThe chasm between allowed and forbidden sects became much deeper than it had been.<ref name=\"Sheid\"/> If on the one hand Buddhism allowed a diversification of its authorized sects, on the other it punished tendencies that put into question the political status quo.<ref name=\"Sheid\"/> A ''danka'' was registered at the closest temple regardless of its religious affiliations, so these became gradually less important.<ref name=\"Sheid\"/> As a consequence of all these factors, differences among sects allowed by the government got watered down and Buddhism became more uniform, not least because the Shogunate had a say in matters of religious orthodoxy.<ref name=\"Sheid\"/> \n\nDuring the Edo period, Buddhism therefore offered few new ideas (with the possible exception of the reform of [[Zen]] sects).<ref name=\"Sheid\"/> On the contrary, the development during the same period of Japanese Confucianism and Shinto, and the birth of the so-called \"New Religions\" produced interesting ideas.<ref name=\"Sheid\"/>\n\n=== The advent of \"funerary Buddhism\" ===\nEven though the original intent of Buddhism was the spreading of the teachings of Buddha, Buddhist temples in Japan today are primarily cemeteries.<ref name=\"heine\"/><ref name=\"Tamura214\">Tamura (2000:214)</ref> The so-called {{nihongo|''s\u014dshiki bukky\u014d''|\u846c\u5f0f\u4ecf\u6559}} or ''Funerary Buddhism'' of today, lampooned for example in [[Juzo Itami]]'s film [[The Funeral (1984 movie)|The Funeral]], where Japanese Buddhism's essential function has become confined to the performance of funerals and memorial services, is a direct consequence of the ''danka'' system, as is the sale of posthumous names (or {{nihongo|''[[kaimy\u014d]]''|\u6212\u540d}}).<ref name=\"Sheid\"/> As far as Buddhism was concerned, the defining feature of the ''danka'' system during the Edo period was the fact that it guaranteed a steady stream of profits thanks to the mandatory funerary rites.<ref name=\"heine\">Heine</ref> This cash flow is what paid for the majority of the temples in Japan and guaranteed their proliferation, and is inseparable from the ''danka'' system.<ref name=\"heine\"/> Hence the tight association between Buddhism and death that continues to this day. When the formal dissolution of the whole ''danka'' system arrived after World War II, it meant for Buddhism a great loss of income, and therefore financial insecurity.<ref name=\"Tamura214\"/>\n\n=== The ''Haibutsu kishaku'' movement ===\nThe use of ''terauke'' and the widespread resentment it created are considered to be one of the primary causes of the ''[[haibutsu kishaku]]'', a violent and spontaneous movement that at the beginning of the [[Meiji era]] caused the destruction of a high number of temples all over Japan. The government's official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]'') of the time, while not directly responsible for this destruction, provided the trigger that released pent-up energy. Considering Buddhism's close association with the Tokugawa, it can't be a surprise that Buddhist monks were regarded as state agents and that several sectors of the Edo society began trying to find alternate ways to satisfy their spiritual needs.<ref name=\"Sheid\">Bernhard Scheid</ref> \n\nIn spite of its history, Buddhism had however decisive advantages over both [[Shinto]] and [[Confucianism]] that during the Meiji era made it impossible to replace it with either.<ref name=\"leiden\">Paul B. Watt</ref> With its many rituals (the ''j\u016bsan butsuji'', or thirteen Buddhist rituals), Buddhism could better help people cope with death.<ref name=\"leiden\"/> Moreover, Shinto associates death and pollution, so it is intrinsically less suitable to funerary ceremonies, while Confucianism in Japan did not concern itself much with funerals.<ref name=\"leiden\"/> Lastly, Buddhism had a country-wide infrastructure that neither Shinto nor Confucianism could match.<ref name=\"leiden\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Religion in Japan]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal\n  |last=Marcure\n  |first=Kenneth\n  |date=Spring 1985\n  |title=The Danka System\n  |journal=Monumenta Nipponica\n  |publisher=Sophia University\n  |location=Tokyo\n  |volume=40\n  |issue=1\n  |pages=39\u201367\n  |doi=10.2307/2385001\n  |jstor=2385001\n}}\n* Nam-Lin Hur, Death and social order in Tokugawa Japan: Buddhism, anti-Christianity, and the danka system, Harvard University Asia Center, 2007; pp. 1-30 (The Rise of Funerary Buddhism in Tokugawa Japan).

When the formal dissolution of the whole ''danka'' system arrived after World War II, it meant for Buddhism a great loss of income, and therefore financial insecurity.<ref name=\"Tamura214\"/>\n\n=== The ''Haibutsu kishaku'' movement ===\nThe use of ''terauke'' and the widespread resentment it created are considered to be one of the primary causes of the ''[[haibutsu kishaku]]'', a violent and spontaneous movement that at the beginning of the [[Meiji era]] caused the destruction of a high number of temples all over Japan. The government's official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism (''[[Shinbutsu bunri]]'') of the time, while not directly responsible for this destruction, provided the trigger that released pent-up energy. Considering Buddhism's close association with the Tokugawa, it can't be a surprise that Buddhist monks were regarded as state agents and that several sectors of the Edo society began trying to find alternate ways to satisfy their spiritual needs.<ref name=\"Sheid\">Bernhard Scheid</ref> \n\nIn spite of its history, Buddhism had however decisive advantages over both [[Shinto]] and [[Confucianism]] that during the Meiji era made it impossible to replace it with either.<ref name=\"leiden\">Paul B. Watt</ref> With its many rituals (the ''j\u016bsan butsuji'', or thirteen Buddhist rituals), Buddhism could better help people cope with death.<ref name=\"leiden\"/> Moreover, Shinto associates death and pollution, so it is intrinsically less suitable to funerary ceremonies, while Confucianism in Japan did not concern itself much with funerals.<ref name=\"leiden\"/> Lastly, Buddhism had a country-wide infrastructure that neither Shinto nor Confucianism could match.<ref name=\"leiden\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Religion in Japan]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal\n  |last=Marcure\n  |first=Kenneth\n  |date=Spring 1985\n  |title=The Danka System\n  |journal=Monumenta Nipponica\n  |publisher=Sophia University\n  |location=Tokyo\n  |volume=40\n  |issue=1\n  |pages=39\u201367\n  |doi=10.2307/2385001\n  |jstor=2385001\n}}\n* Nam-Lin Hur, Death and social order in Tokugawa Japan: Buddhism, anti-Christianity, and the danka system, Harvard University Asia Center, 2007; pp. 1-30 (The Rise of Funerary Buddhism in Tokugawa Japan).

The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic. Firefighters then retreated from within the attic. Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported [[Notre-Dame de Paris#Bells|eight very large bells]]. Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.

By the time it was extinguished, the building's [[Fl\u00e8che|spire]] collapsed, and most of its roof had been destroyed and its upper walls severely damaged; extensive damage to the interior was prevented by its stone [[sexpartite vault|vaulted ceiling]], which largely contained the burning roof as it collapsed. Many works of art and religious relics were moved to safety early in the emergency, but others suffered some smoke damage, and some exterior art was damaged or destroyed. The cathedral's [[altar]], two [[pipe organ]]s, and its three 13th-century [[rose window]]s suffered little to no damage. Three emergency workers were injured.

The spire of the cathedral collapsed at 19:50, creating a draft that slammed all the doors and sent a fireball through the attic. Firefighters then retreated from within the attic. Shortly before the spire fell, the fire had spread to the wooden framework inside the north tower, which supported [[Notre-Dame de Paris#Bells|eight very large bells]]. Had the bells fallen, it was thought that the damage done as they fell could have collapsed the towers, and with them the entire cathedral.
