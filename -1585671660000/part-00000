She was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 2 February 1884 to be employed by the expedition to relieve the polar exploration party under the command of Lt. [[Adolphus W. Greely]]. She sailed from Dundee under the command of Lt. L. L. Reamey and arrived in New York on 23 March 1884.\n\n==Rescue==\n[[File:Greely relief expedition - labelled.jpg|thumb|left|The six survivors of the U.S. Army's Greely Arctic expedition with their U.S. Navy rescuers, at Upernavik, Greenland, 2\u20133 July 1884. Probably photographed on board ''Thetis''.]]\n\nAfter more than a month of preparations, ''Thetis''\u2014now under the command of Commander [[Winfield Scott Schley]], who also headed the relief squadron\u2014departed New York on 1 May. Ice flows and heavy weather hampered the search all along the way. ''Thetis'' did not even reach [[Upernavik, Greenland]], her jumping-off point, until the latter part of the month. She departed that port on the 29th in company with {{USS|Bear|1874|2}} and headed north. Along the way, she made stops at the [[Duck Islands]], [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], and [[Littleton Island (Arctic)|Littleton Island]], arriving at the latter on 21 June. At Littleton Island, her search parties found evidence that Lt. Greely's expedition had stopped there but moved on. They were on the right track. The next day, she moved on to [[Payer's Harbor]] and landed search parties on [[Brevoort Island]]. More evidence that Greely's party had passed that way also indicated the dire straits in which the expedition found itself. Later that day, the two ships rounded [[Cape Sabine]] and, while fighting a howling gale, found Lt. Greely and six companions-alive, but weak from exposure and malnutrition. The other 20 members of the expedition had perished. The following day, the two ships headed south with their precious cargo. After stops at Upernavik, [[Godhavn]], and [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], the relief expedition arrived in Portsmouth, N.H., on 1 August. During the five-day stay, rescuers and rescued alike received a tumultuous welcome by the assembled North Atlantic Squadron and enjoyed a warm reception given by the people of Portsmouth. On 6 August, the rescue ships continued south toward New York where they arrived on the 8th. On 20 November 1884, ''Thetis'' was placed out of commission and was laid up at New York.\n\n==Pacific service==\nAfter more than two years of inactivity, ''Thetis'' was recommissioned at New York on 15 January 1887, Lt. William H. Emory, Jr., in command. Between mid January and mid March, the ship was fitted out as a gunboat and prepared for a cruise around [[Cape Horn]] to the west coast. She departed New York on 24 March and began an eight-month voyage during which she stopped at [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]; [[Montevideo, Uruguay]]; [[Valpara\u00edso, Chile]]; and [[Callao, Peru]].\n\nOn 13 October, ''Thetis'' sailed into San Francisco for voyage repairs prior to a brief cruise to Alaskan waters. She departed the Mare Island Navy Yard on 16 November and arrived at [[Sitka, Alaska]], on 4 December. She returned to Mare Island on 9 January 1888 and remained there until 8 April when she embarked upon an extended cruise in Alaskan waters. She returned to Sitka on 18 May and, for the next five months, conducted survey work as far north as [[Point Barrow]], visiting [[Unalaska]], [[St. Michael, Alaska|St. Michael]], [[Buldir Island|East Cape]], and [[Cape Sabine]]. On 1 November, she headed south from Sitka and entered San Francisco Bay on the 25th. She spent the following five months at the Mare Island Navy Yard, undergoing repairs and preparing for another Alaska survey assignment. ''Thetis'' steamed out from the Golden Gate on 20 April and shaped a course north to Sitka, where she arrived on 2 June. Another five months of survey work along the Alaskan coast followed, punctuated again with visits to Unalaska and Point Barrow. She returned to San Francisco on 7 December.\n\n''Thetis'' remained at the Mare Island Navy Yard until July 1890, when she sailed for Central America. A revolution had recently broken out in San Salvador, and the insurgents quickly seized power. However, forces of the old government retired to Guatemala which they used as a base for counter-revolutionary operations. This precipitated war between the two countries. By 27 July, ''Thetis'' was at [[Puerto San Jos\u00e9|San Jos\u00e9, Guatemala]], beginning a four-month cruise along the coasts of Guatemala and San Salvador to protect American lives and property during the war. During that period, she called several times at [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]] and [[Acajulta]] in San Salvador and at [[La Union]] and [[Amapala, Honduras]], in addition to San Jos\u00e9, Guatemala. By October, conditions in Central America had quieted sufficiently to allow ''Thetis'' to return to San Francisco, where she arrived on the 27th. Two days later, she reentered the Mare Island Navy Yard and remained there until the following June\n\nAt mid-month, she departed San Francisco on a four-month assignment in Alaskan waters conducting survey work and patrolling to protect fur seals from poachers. She returned south to San Francisco late in 1891 and remained until the beginning of 1892. In the late spring, she made a brief voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, returning to San Francisco on 18 June. In January 1893, ''Thetis'' began survey work along the coast of the Baja California peninsula. For the next four years, she conducted those operations in waters between [[Magdalena Bay]] and the southern tip of the California peninsula. She returned periodically to San Diego and San Francisco for repairs and supplies. She concluded that duty in the spring of 1897 and arrived back in San Francisco on 24 April. In July 1897, the ship was placed \"in ordinary\" at [[Mare Island]].\n\nAlthough the information above states that ''Thetis'' was equipped with one howitzer, a {{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss Revolving Cannon]] (mislabeled as a \"55mm\") is on display at Mare Island with an inscription indicating that it came from ''Thetis''.\n\n==Revenue Cutter Service==\n''Thetis'' never again served the Navy. In the spring of 1899, she was transferred temporarily to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] for special duty transporting Siberian [[reindeer]] to Alaska. This project was instituted through the cooperation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Department of the Interior]] in an attempt to help [[Alaskan Natives]] to learn to herd the animals for food rather than to rely upon hunting for food. Between June and October 1899, she transported 81 reindeer from [[Siberia]] to Alaska. In October 1899, she was returned to the Navy briefly but was soon transferred back to the Revenue Cutter Service permanently.\n\nAs a commissioned [[revenue cutter]] in the Revenue Cutter Service, she spent the next 16 years cruising Alaskan waters on law-enforcement duties and carrying supplies to the frontier fringes. During that time, she was based both at [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. In the spring of 1904, she made a voyage to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] to transport illegal [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants from [[Lisianski Island]] to [[Honolulu]]. In 1908, she rescued 11 members of the crew of the Japanese [[Seal hunting|sealing schooner]] ''Satsuma Maru'' who had been stranded at [[Point Manby]] ({{coord|59|41|30|N|140|18|15|W|name=Point Manby}}) on the south-central coast of Alaska below the [[Malaspina Glacier]] since their ship's [[anchor]] cable had broken during a [[gale]] and she had been driven ashore and wrecked there on 5 November 1907.<ref>[https://alaskashipwreck.com/shipwrecks-a-z/alaska-shipwrecks-s/ alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (S)]</ref> Late in 1909, she returned to Honolulu. From then until the end of her career, she alternated duty in the Hawaiian Islands with annual cruises to Alaskan waters.\n\nOn 27 April 1916, ''Thetis'' ended her last voyage in [[United States Government]] service at San Francisco. On 30 April 1916, she was placed out of commission. On 3 June 1916, she was sold to W. & S. Job & Co. of [[New York City]]. Ironically after years of service on the patrol against [[Pinniped|seal]] [[Poaching|poachers]] in the Pacific, she was converted into a [[Seal hunting|sealer]] herself and operated out of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the next 44 years.

She was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 2 February 1884 to be employed by the expedition to relieve the polar exploration party under the command of Lt. [[Adolphus W. Greely]]. She sailed from Dundee under the command of Lt. L. L. Reamey and arrived in New York on 23 March 1884.\n\n==Rescue==\n[[File:Greely relief expedition - labelled.jpg|thumb|left|The six survivors of the U.S. Army's Greely Arctic expedition with their U.S. Navy rescuers, at Upernavik, Greenland, 2\u20133 July 1884. Probably photographed on board ''Thetis''.]]\n\nAfter more than a month of preparations, ''Thetis''\u2014now under the command of Commander [[Winfield Scott Schley]], who also headed the relief squadron\u2014departed New York on 1 May. Ice flows and heavy weather hampered the search all along the way. ''Thetis'' did not even reach [[Upernavik, Greenland]], her jumping-off point, until the latter part of the month. She departed that port on the 29th in company with {{USS|Bear|1874|2}} and headed north. Along the way, she made stops at the [[Duck Islands]], [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]], and [[Littleton Island (Arctic)|Littleton Island]], arriving at the latter on 21 June. At Littleton Island, her search parties found evidence that Lt. Greely's expedition had stopped there but moved on. They were on the right track. The next day, she moved on to [[Payer's Harbor]] and landed search parties on [[Brevoort Island]]. More evidence that Greely's party had passed that way also indicated the dire straits in which the expedition found itself. Later that day, the two ships rounded [[Cape Sabine]] and, while fighting a howling gale, found Lt. Greely and six companions-alive, but weak from exposure and malnutrition. The other 20 members of the expedition had perished. The following day, the two ships headed south with their precious cargo. After stops at Upernavik, [[Godhavn]], and [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], the relief expedition arrived in Portsmouth, N.H., on 1 August. During the five-day stay, rescuers and rescued alike received a tumultuous welcome by the assembled North Atlantic Squadron and enjoyed a warm reception given by the people of Portsmouth. On 6 August, the rescue ships continued south toward New York where they arrived on the 8th. On 20 November 1884, ''Thetis'' was placed out of commission and was laid up at New York.\n\n==Pacific service==\nAfter more than two years of inactivity, ''Thetis'' was recommissioned at New York on 15 January 1887, Lt. William H. Emory, Jr., in command. Between mid January and mid March, the ship was fitted out as a gunboat and prepared for a cruise around [[Cape Horn]] to the west coast. She departed New York on 24 March and began an eight-month voyage during which she stopped at [[Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]]; [[Montevideo, Uruguay]]; [[Valpara\u00edso, Chile]]; and [[Callao, Peru]].\n\nOn 13 October, ''Thetis'' sailed into San Francisco for voyage repairs prior to a brief cruise to Alaskan waters. She departed the Mare Island Navy Yard on 16 November and arrived at [[Sitka, Alaska]], on 4 December. She returned to Mare Island on 9 January 1888 and remained there until 8 April when she embarked upon an extended cruise in Alaskan waters. She returned to Sitka on 18 May and, for the next five months, conducted survey work as far north as [[Point Barrow]], visiting [[Unalaska]], [[St. Michael, Alaska|St. Michael]], [[Buldir Island|East Cape]], and [[Cape Sabine]]. On 1 November, she headed south from Sitka and entered San Francisco Bay on the 25th. She spent the following five months at the Mare Island Navy Yard, undergoing repairs and preparing for another Alaska survey assignment. ''Thetis'' steamed out from the Golden Gate on 20 April and shaped a course north to Sitka, where she arrived on 2 June. Another five months of survey work along the Alaskan coast followed, punctuated again with visits to Unalaska and Point Barrow. She returned to San Francisco on 7 December.\n\n''Thetis'' remained at the Mare Island Navy Yard until July 1890, when she sailed for Central America. A revolution had recently broken out in San Salvador, and the insurgents quickly seized power. However, forces of the old government retired to Guatemala which they used as a base for counter-revolutionary operations. This precipitated war between the two countries. By 27 July, ''Thetis'' was at [[Puerto San Jos\u00e9|San Jos\u00e9, Guatemala]], beginning a four-month cruise along the coasts of Guatemala and San Salvador to protect American lives and property during the war. During that period, she called several times at [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]] and [[Acajulta]] in San Salvador and at [[La Union]] and [[Amapala, Honduras]], in addition to San Jos\u00e9, Guatemala. By October, conditions in Central America had quieted sufficiently to allow ''Thetis'' to return to San Francisco, where she arrived on the 27th. Two days later, she reentered the Mare Island Navy Yard and remained there until the following June\n\nAt mid-month, she departed San Francisco on a four-month assignment in Alaskan waters conducting survey work and patrolling to protect fur seals from poachers. She returned south to San Francisco late in 1891 and remained until the beginning of 1892. In the late spring, she made a brief voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, returning to San Francisco on 18 June. In January 1893, ''Thetis'' began survey work along the coast of the Baja California peninsula. For the next four years, she conducted those operations in waters between [[Magdalena Bay]] and the southern tip of the California peninsula. She returned periodically to San Diego and San Francisco for repairs and supplies. She concluded that duty in the spring of 1897 and arrived back in San Francisco on 24 April. In July 1897, the ship was placed \"in ordinary\" at [[Mare Island]].\n\nAlthough the information above states that ''Thetis'' was equipped with one howitzer, a {{convert|47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss Revolving Cannon]] (mislabeled as a \"55mm\") is on display at Mare Island with an inscription indicating that it came from ''Thetis''.\n\n==Revenue Cutter Service==\n''Thetis'' never again served the Navy. In the spring of 1899, she was transferred temporarily to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] for special duty transporting Siberian [[reindeer]] to Alaska. This project was instituted through the cooperation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Department of the Interior]] in an attempt to help [[Alaskan Natives]] to learn to herd the animals for food rather than to rely upon hunting for food. Between June and October 1899, she transported 81 reindeer from [[Siberia]] to Alaska. In October 1899, she was returned to the Navy briefly but was soon transferred back to the Revenue Cutter Service permanently.\n\nAs a commissioned [[revenue cutter]] in the Revenue Cutter Service, she spent the next 16 years cruising Alaskan waters on law-enforcement duties and carrying supplies to the frontier fringes. During that time, she was based both at [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. In the spring of 1904, she made a voyage to the [[Hawaiian Islands]] to transport illegal [[Japanese people|Japanese]] immigrants from [[Lisianski Island]] to [[Honolulu]]. In 1908, she rescued 11 members of the crew of the Japanese [[Seal hunting|sealing schooner]] ''Satsuma Maru'' who had been stranded at [[Point Manby]] ({{coord|59|41|30|N|140|18|15|W|name=Point Manby}}) on the south-central coast of Alaska below the [[Malaspina Glacier]] since their ship's [[anchor]] cable had broken during a [[gale]] and she had been driven ashore and wrecked there on 5 November 1907.<ref>[https://alaskashipwreck.com/shipwrecks-a-z/alaska-shipwrecks-s/ alaskashipwreck.com Alaska Shipwrecks (S)]</ref> Late in 1909, she returned to Honolulu. From then until the end of her career, she alternated duty in the Hawaiian Islands with annual cruises to Alaskan waters.\n\nOn 27 April 1916, ''Thetis'' ended her last voyage in [[United States Government]] service at San Francisco. On 30 April 1916, she was placed out of commission. On 3 June 1916, she was sold to W. & S. Job & Co. of [[New York City]]. Ironically after years of service on the patrol against [[Pinniped|seal]] [[Poaching|poachers]] in the Pacific, she was converted into a [[Seal hunting|sealer]] herself and operated out of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] for the next 44 years. In 1960, her hulk was purposely grounded off [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], Newfoundland, and she remained there until she broke up.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/thetis-i.html}}\n*[http://www.thegunzone.com/hotchkiss.html Speir, Dean.

Minimal until the 18th century, the size of the Jewish population increased after around 1850, and more especially after the establishment of ''[[Greater Romania]]'' in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. A diverse community, albeit an overwhelmingly urban one, Jews were a target of [[religious persecution]] and [[racism]] in Romanian society \u2013 from the late-19th century debate over the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" and the Jewish residents' right to [[citizenship]], to the [[genocide]] carried out in the lands of Romania as part of [[the Holocaust]]. The latter, coupled with successive waves of ''[[aliyah]]'', has accounted for a dramatic decrease in the overall size of Romania's present-day Jewish community.\n\nJewish communities existed in Romanian territory in the 2nd century AD. During the reign of [[Petru \u0218chiopul|Peter the Lame]] (1574\u20131579) the Jews of Moldavia, mainly traders from Poland who were competing with locals, were taxed and ultimately expelled.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\">Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61</ref> The authorities decided in 1650 and 1741 required Jews to wear clothing evidencing their status and ethnicity.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p. 239\">Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p. 239</ref> The first [[Blood libel|blood accusation]] in Moldavia (and, as such, in Romania) was made in 1710, when the Jews of [[T\u00e2rgu Neam\u021b]] were charged with having killed a [[Christianity|Christian]] child for ritual purposes.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003 p.2\">Oi\u0219teanu (2003), p.2; Rezachevici, October 1995, p.66</ref> An anti-Jewish riot occurred in Bucharest in the 1760s.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.27\">Cernovodeanu, p. 27</ref>\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]] the Jews in the [[Danubian Principalities]] had to endure great hardships. Massacres and pillages were perpetrated in almost every town and village in the country. During the [[Greek War of Independence]], which signalled the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]], Jews were victims of [[pogrom]]s and [[Persecution of Jews|persecutions]]. In the 1860s, there was another riot motivated by blood libel accusations.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003, p.2\">Oi\u0219teanu (2003), p.2</ref>\n\nAntisemitism was officially enforced under the [[Prime Minister of Romania|premierships]] of [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]]. During his first years in office (1875) Br\u0103tianu reinforced and applied old discrimination laws, insisting that Jews were not allowed to settle in the countryside (and relocating those that had done so), while declaring many Jewish urban inhabitants to be [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and expelling them from the country. The emigration of Romanian Jews on a larger scale commenced soon after 1878. By 1900 there were 250,000 Romanian Jews: 3.3% of the population, 14.6% of the city dwellers, 32% of the Moldavian urban population and 42% of [[Ia\u0219i]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">A History of the Balkans 1804-1945, p.129</ref>\n\nBetween the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]] (September 1940) and 1942, 80 anti-Jewish regulations were passed. Starting at the end of October, 1940, the [[Iron Guard]] began a massive antisemitic campaign, torturing and beating Jews and looting their shops (''see [[Dorohoi Pogrom]]''), culminating in [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|the failed coup and a pogrom in Bucharest]], in which 125 Jews were killed.<ref name=\"Veiga, p.301\">Veiga, p.301</ref> [[Ion Antonescu]] eventually stopped the violence and chaos created by the Iron Guard by brutally suppressing the rebellion, but continued the policy of oppression and massacre of Jews, and, to a lesser extent, of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]]. After Romania entered the war at the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] atrocities against the Jews became common, starting with the [[Ia\u0219i pogrom]]. According to the [[Wiesel Commission]] report released by the Romanian government in 2004, between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews were murdered or died during the Holocaust in Romania, but also in the occupied [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territories under Romanian control ([[Transnistria Governorate]]). An additional 135,000 Jews living under [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] control in [[Northern Transylvania]] also perished in the Holocaust, as did some 5,000 Romanian Jews in other countries.<ref name=\"washingtontimes.com\">Ilie Fugaru, ''[http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041111-023944-6848r.htm Romania clears doubts about Holocaust past]'', [[United Press International|UPI]], November 11, 2004</ref><ref name=\"Commission\">\n{{cite web\n  |author=International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania\n  |title=Executive Summary: Historical Findings and Recommendations\n  |work=Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania\n  |publisher=Yad Vashem (The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority)\n  |date=2012-01-28\n  |url=http://www.inshr-ew.ro/ro/files/Raport%20Final/Final_Report.pdf\n  |format=PDF\n  |doi=\n  |accessdate=2012-01-28\n  |authorlink=\n  Wiesel Commission }}\n</ref>\n\nOn the current territory of Romania, between 290,000 and 360,000 Romanian Jews survived World War II (355,972 persons, according to statistics from the end of the war).<ref name=\"contrafort\">{{cite web |url=http://www.contrafort.md/old/2008/165-166/1520.html |author= Alexandru Florin-Platon |title=O necesar\u0103 restitu\u0163ie biografic\u0103 (Carol Iancu, Alexandru \u015eafran: o via\u0163\u0103 de lupt\u0103, o raz\u0103 de lumin\u0103) |accessdate=2019-01-28 |publisher=[[Contrafort|Revista Contrafort]] }}</ref> During the [[Communist Romania|communist regime in Romania]], there was a mass emigration to [[Israel]], and in 1987, only 23,000 Jews lived in Romania.\n\nToday, the majority of [[Romanian Jews in Israel|Romanian Jews live in Israel]], while modern-day Romania continues to host a modest Jewish population. In the [[2011 Romanian Census|2011 census]], 3,271 declared to be Jewish.\n\n==Early history==\nJewish communities on what would later become Romanian territory were attested as early as the 2nd century AD, at a time when the [[Roman Empire]] had established its rule over [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]]. Inscriptions and coins have been found in such places as [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] and [[Or\u0219ova]].\n\nThe existence of the [[Crimean Karaites]], an ethnic group adherent of [[Karaite Judaism]], suggests that there was a steady Jewish presence around the [[Black Sea]], including in parts of today's Romania, in the trading ports from the mouths of the Danube and the [[Dniester]] (''see [[Cumania]]''); they may have been present in some Moldavian fairs by the 16th century or earlier.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.60\">Rezachevici, September 1995, p. 60</ref> The earliest Jewish (most likely [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]]) presence in what would become [[Moldavia]] was recorded in [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]] (1330); in [[Wallachia]], they were first attested in the 1550s, living in [[Bucharest]].<ref>Djuvara, p. 179; Giurescu, p. 271</ref> During the second half of the 14th century, the future territory of Romania became an important place of refuge for Jews expelled from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Poland]] by [[List of rulers of Hungary|King]] [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]].

Also in Moldavia, [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504) treated Jews with consideration. [[Isaac ben Benjamin Shor]] of [[Ia\u0219i]] (''Isak [[Bey]]'', originally employed by [[Uzun Hassan]]) was appointed ''[[stolnic]]'', being subsequently advanced to the rank of ''[[logof\u0103t]]''; he continued to hold this office under [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Bogdan the Blind]] (1504\u20131517), the son and successor of Stephen.\n\nAt this time both [[Danubian Principalities]] came under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and a number of Sephardim living in [[Istanbul]] migrated to Wallachia, while Jews from Poland and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] settled in Moldavia. Although they took an important part in [[State organisation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] and formed a large part of a community of foreign creditors and traders,<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.60\"/> Jews were harassed by the ''[[hospodars]]'' of the two Principalities. Moldavia's Prince [[\u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103]] (1522) deprived the Jewish merchants of almost all the rights given to them by his two predecessors; [[Petru Rare\u0219]] confiscated Jewish wealth in 1541, after alleging that Jews in the cattle trade had engaged in [[tax evasion]].<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.60\"/> [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] (first rule: 1552-61) [[Persecution of Jews|persecuted]] the community alongside other social categories, until he was dethroned by [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid|Jacob Heraclides]], a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], who was lenient to his Jewish subjects; L\u0103pu\u0219neanu did not renew his persecutions after his return on the throne in 1564. The role of [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Ottoman]] and local Jews in financing various princes increased as Ottoman economic demands were mounting after 1550 (in the 1570s, the influential Jewish [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Duke of the Archipelago]], [[Joseph Nasi]], backed both Heraclides and L\u0103pu\u0219neanu to the throne); several violent incidents throughout the period were instigated by princes unable to repay their debts.<ref>Rezachevici, September 1995, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nDuring the first short reign of [[Petru \u0218chiopul|Peter the Lame]] (1574\u20131579) the Jews of Moldavia, mainly traders from Poland who were competing with locals, were taxed and ultimately expelled.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\"/> In 1582, he succeeded in regaining his rule over the country with the help of the Jewish physician Benveniste, who was a friend of the influential [[Solomon Ashkenazi]];<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\"/> the latter then exerted his influence with the Prince in favor of his coreligionists.\n\nIn Wallachia, [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Alexandru II Mircea]] (1567\u20131577) engaged as his private secretary and counselor [[Isaiah ben Joseph]], who used his influence on behalf of the Jews. In 1573 Isaiah was dismissed, owing to court intrigues, but he was not harmed any further, and subsequently left for Moldavia (where he entered the service of [[Muscovy]]'s [[Grand Prince of Moscow|Grand Prince]] [[Ivan the Terrible]]). Through the efforts of Solomon Ashkenazi, [[Aron Tiranul]] was placed on the throne of Moldavia; nevertheless, the new ruler persecuted and executed nineteen Jewish creditors in [[Ia\u0219i]], who were [[Decapitation|decapitated]] without process of law.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\"/> At around the same time, in Wallachia, the violent repression of creditors peaked under [[Michael the Brave]], who, after killing Turkish creditors in [[Bucharest]] (1594), probably engaged in violence against Jews settled south of the [[Danube]] during his campaign in [[Rumelia]] (while maintaining good relations with Transylvanian Jews).<ref>Rezachevici, September 1995, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n==Early Modern Age==\nIn 1623, the Jews in [[Transylvania]] were awarded certain [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s by [[List of rulers of Transylvania|Prince]] [[Gabriel Bethlen]], who aimed to attract entrepreneurs from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] lands into his country; the grants were curtailed during following decades, when Jews were only allowed to settle in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ([[Alba Iulia]]).<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p.61-62; 64-65</ref> Among the privileges granted was one allowing Jews to wear traditional dress; eventually, the authorities in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r decided (in 1650 and 1741) to allow Jews to wear only clothing evidencing their status and ethnicity.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p. 239\"/>\n\nThe status of Jews who had [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was established in [[Wallachia]] by [[Matei Basarab]]'s ''[[Pravila de la Govora]]'' and in Moldavia by [[Vasile Lupu]]'s ''[[Pravila lui Vasile Lupu|Carte rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 de \u00eenv\u0103\u021b\u0103tur\u0103]]''.<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p.62</ref> The latter ruler (1634\u20131653) treated the Jews with consideration until the appearance of the [[Cossacks]] (1648), who marched against the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and who, while crossing the region, killed many Jews; the violence, led many [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from Poland took refuge in [[Moldavia]] and Wallachia, establishing small but stable communities.<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p.62-63</ref> Massacres and forced conversions by the Cossacks occurred in 1652, when the latter came to [[Ia\u0219i]] on the occasion of the Vasile Lupu's daughter marriage to [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Timush]], the son of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and during the rule of [[Gheorghe \u0218tefan]].<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p. 63</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Anton Maria Del Chiaro]], secretary of the Wallachian princes between 1710\u20131716, the Jewish population of Wallachia was required to respect a certain [[Social aspects of clothing|dresscode]]. Thus, they were prohibited from wearing clothes of other color than black or violet, or to wear yellow or red boots.<ref>Del Chiaro; Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p.239-240</ref> Nevertheless, the Romanian scholar [[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]] argued that such ethnic and religious [[social stigma]] was uncommon in Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as throughout the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] areas of Europe.<ref>Oi\u0219teanu (1998), pp. 242\u2013244</ref>\n\nThe first [[Blood libel|blood accusation]] in Moldavia (and, as such, in Romania) was made April 5, 1710, when the Jews of [[T\u00e2rgu Neam\u021b]] were charged with having killed a [[Christianity|Christian]] child for ritual purposes\u00b4.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003 p.2\"/> The instigator was a baptized Jew who had helped to carry the body of a child, murdered by Christians, into the courtyard of the [[synagogue]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. On the next day five Jews were killed, others were maimed, and every Jewish house was pillaged, while the representatives of the community were imprisoned and tortured. Meanwhile, some influential Jews appealed to Prince [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] (the first [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] ruler) in Ia\u0219i, who ordered an investigation resulting in the freeing of those arrested. This was the first time that the Orthodox clergy participated in attacks on Jews. It was due to the clergy's instigations that in 1714 a similar charge was brought against the Jews of the city of [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] - the murder by a group of [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholics]] of a Christian girl-servant to Jewish family was immediately blamed on Jews; every Jewish house was plundered, and two prominent Jews were hanged, before the real criminals were discovered by the authorities.\n\n[[File:iasi shul.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Synagogue (Ia\u0219i)]], built c. 1670]]\nUnder [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]], Wallachian Jews were recognized as a special [[guild]] in Bucharest, led by a ''[[starost]]''.<ref>Cernovodeanu, p. 25; Giurescu, p. 271</ref> Jews in both Wallachia and Moldavia were subject to the ''[[Hakham Bashi]]'' in Ia\u0219i, but soon the Bucharest ''starost'' assumed several religious duties.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.25\">Cernovodeanu, p.25</ref> Overtaxed and persecuted under [[\u0218tefan Cantacuzino]] (1714\u20131716),<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p. 66</ref> Wallachian Jews obtained valuable privileges during Nicholas Mavrocordatos' rule (1716\u20131730) in that country (the Prince notably employed the Jewish savant [[Daniel de Fonseca]] at his court).<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\">Cernovodeanu, p.26</ref> Another anti-Jewish riot occurred in Bucharest in the 1760s, and was encouraged by the visit of [[Ephram II of Jerusalem|Ephram II]], [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.27\"/>\n\nIn 1726, in the Moldavian borough of [[Oni\u021bcani]], four Jews were accused of having kidnapped a five-year-old child, of killing him on [[Easter]] and of collecting his blood in a barrel. They were tried at Ia\u0219i under the supervision of Moldavian Prince [[Mihai Racovi\u021b\u0103]], and eventually acquitted following diplomatic protests. The event was echoed in several contemporary chronicles and documents &mdash; for example, the [[France|French]] [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire|ambassador to the Porte]], [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Picon]], remarked that such an accusation was no longer accepted in \"civilized countries\".<ref>Oi\u0219teanu (1998), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> The most obvious effects on the condition of the Jewish inhabitants of Moldavia were witnessed during the reign of [[John Mavrocordatos]] (1744\u20131747): a Jewish farmer in the vicinity of [[Suceava]] reported the prince to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] for allegedly using his house to [[rape]] a number of [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] Jewish women; Mavrocordatos had his accuser hanged. This act aroused the anger of [[Mahmud I]]'s ''[[kapucu]]'' in Moldavia, and the prince paid the penalty with the loss of his throne.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.27\"/>\n\n==Russo-Turkish Wars==\n{{Main|History of the Russo-Turkish wars}}\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774]], Jews in the Danubian Principalities endured great hardships. Massacres and pillages were perpetrated in almost every town and village in the country. When peace was restored, both princes, [[Alexandru Mavrocordat|Alexander Mavrocordatos]] of Moldavia and [[Nicholas Mavrogheni]] of Wallachia, pledged their special protection to Jews, whose condition remained favorable until 1787, when both [[Janissary|Janissaries]] and the [[Imperial Russia]]n [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Army]] took part in [[pogrom]]s.\n\nThe community was also subject to persecutions by the locals. Jewish children were seized and forcibly baptized. Ritual-murder accusations became widespread, with one made at [[Gala\u021bi]] in 1797 leading to exceptionally severe results - with Jews being attacked by a large mob, driven from their homes, robbed, waylaid on the streets, and many killed on the spot, while some were forced into the [[Danube]] and drowned, and others who took refuge in the synagogue were burned to death in the building; a few escaped after being given protection and refuge by a priest. In 1803, shortly before his death, the [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Wallachian Metropolitan]] [[Iacob Stamati]] instigated attacks on the Bucharest community by publishing his ''\u00cenfruntarea jidovilor'' (\"Facing the Jews\"), which pretended to be the confession of a former [[rabbi]]; however, Jews were offered refuge by Stamati's replacement, [[Veniamin Costachi]].<ref>Cernovodeanu, p. 27; Oi\u0219teanu (2003), p .3</ref> A seminal event occurred in 1804, when ruler [[Constantine Ypsilanti]] dismissed accusations of ritual murder as \"the unfounded opinion\" of \"stupid people\", and ordered that their condemnation be read in churches throughout Wallachia; the allegations no longer surfaced during the following period.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.28\">Cernovodeanu, p. 28</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812|Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812]], the Russian invasion was again accompanied by massacres of Jews. [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] irregular soldiers in Ottoman service, who appeared in Bucharest at the close of the Russo-Turkish War, terrorised the city's Jewish population. At around the same time, a conflict emerged in Wallachia between Jews under foreign protection (''[[sudi\u021bi]]'') and local ones (''hrisovoli\u021bi''), after the latter tried to impose a single administration for the community, a matter which was finally settled in favor of the ''hrisovoli\u021bi'' by Prince [[Jean Georges Caradja]] (1813).<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.25\"/>\n\nIn [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]]-ruled Transylvania, the reforms carried out by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] allowed Jews to settle in towns directly subject to the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen|Hungarian Crown]]. However, pressure placed on the community remained stringent for the following decades.\n\n==Early 19th century==\n[[File:AKauffmannJReyIasiFair.PNG|thumb|Lithograph of a cosmopolitan fair in [[Ia\u0219i]] (c. 1845); two [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] are visible to the right]]\n[[File:Templul Coral 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Bucharest Synagogue]] (restored after [[World War II]]), originally built 1857{{snds}}1867]]\n\nBy 1825, the Jewish population in Wallachia was estimated at between 5,000 and 10,000 people, almost all [[Sephardi]]. Of these, the larger part resided in [[Bucharest]] (probably as many as 7,000 in 1839); and at around the same time, Moldavia was home to about 12,000 Jews.<ref>Djuvara, p.179; Giurescu, p.272</ref> In parallel, the Jewish population in [[Bukovina]] rose from 526 in 1774 to 11,600 in 1848.<ref>Hitchins, p.226-227</ref> In the early 19th century, Jews who sought refuge from [[Osman Pazvanto\u011flu]]'s campaign in the [[Balkans]] established communities in Wallachian-ruled [[Oltenia]].<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\"/> In Moldavia, [[Scarlat Callimachi]]'s ''Code'' (1817) allowed Jews to purchase urban property, but prevented them from settling in the countryside (while purchasing town property became increasingly difficult due to popular prejudice).<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Greek War of Independence]], which signaled the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]] and the [[Danubian Principalities]]' occupation by [[Filiki Eteria]] troops under [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilantis]], Jews were victims of [[pogrom]]s and [[Persecution of Jews|persecutions]] in places such as [[F\u0103lticeni]], [[Hertsa]], [[Piatra Neam\u021b]], the [[Secu Monastery]], [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]], and [[T\u00e2rgu Frumos]]. Jews in [[Gala\u021bi]] managed to escape over the [[Prut River]] with assistance from [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] diplomats.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.28\"/> Weakened by the clash between Ypsilantis and [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], the Eterists were massacred by the Ottoman intervention armies, and during this episode, Jewish communities engaged in reprisals in Secu and [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]].<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.28\"/>\n\nFollowing the 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (which allowed the two principalities to freely engage in foreign trade), Moldavia, where commercial [[Niche market|niches]] had been largely left unoccupied, became a target for migration of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] persecuted in [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. By 1838, their number seems to have reached 80,000,<ref>Cernovodeanu, p. 28; Djuvara, pp. 179\u2013180</ref> and over 195,000, or almost 12% of the country's population, in 1859 (with an additional 50,000 passing through to Wallachia between the two estimates).<ref>Ornea, p. 387</ref>\n\nDespite initial interdictions under the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russian occupation of 1829]] (when it was first regulated that non-Christians were not to be regarded as citizens), many of the new immigrants became [[Leasehold estate|leaseholders of estates]] and [[tavern]]-keepers, serving to increase both the revenue and demands of [[boyars]], and leading in turn to an increase in economic pressures over those working the land or buying products<ref>Djuvara, p.180-182</ref> (usual prejudice against Jews accused tavern-keepers of encouraging [[alcoholism]]). At the same time, several Jews rose to prominence and high social status, with most families involved in Moldavian banking around the 1850s being of Jewish origin.<ref>Djuvara, p.182</ref> After 1832, following adoption of the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'', Jewish children were accepted in schools in the two Principalities only if they wore the same clothing as others. In Moldavia, the 1847 decree of Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] compelled Jews to abandon the traditional dress code.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.241\">Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p.241</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Revolutions of 1848]], which found their parallel in the [[1848 Wallachian revolution|Wallachian revolution]], many restrictive laws against Jews were enacted; although they had some destructive effects, they were never strictly enforced. In various ways, Jews took part in the Wallachian revolt; for example, [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]], the painter, distinguished himself in the revolutionary cause, and paid for his activity with his life (being tortured to death in Budapest by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] authorities). The major document to be codified by the 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, the ''[[Islaz Proclamation]]'', called for \"the emancipation of [[Israelite]]s and [[political rights]] for all compatriots of different faiths\".<ref>''Islaz Proclamation'', art.21</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Crimean War]], the struggle for the union of the two principalities began. Both parties, [[Partida Na\u021bional\u0103|Unionists]] and anti-Unionists sought support of Jews, with each promising full equality; and proclamations to this effect were issued between 1857 and 1858. In 1857, the community published its first [[magazine]], ''[[Israelitul Rom\u00e2n]]'', edited by the Romanian [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[Iuliu Barasch]]. This process of gradual integration resulted in the creation of an informal Jewish Romanian identity, while [[Religious conversion|conversion to Christianity]], despite encouragement by the authorities,<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\"/> remained confined to exceptional cases.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.28\"/>\n\n==Under Alexandru Ioan Cuza==\n[[File:Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat.jpg|thumb|[[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]] in [[Bucharest]]]]\n[[File:Jewish cemetery of Brasov Romania.jpg|thumb|An ornately decorated Jewish Cemetery building, [[Brasov, Romania]]]]\nFrom the beginning of the reign of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] (1859\u20131866), the first ruler (''[[Domnitor]]'') of the united principalities, the Jews became a prominent factor in the politics of the country. This period was, however, inaugurated by another riot motivated by blood libel accusations, begun during [[Easter]] 1859 in [[Gala\u021bi]].<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003, p.2\"/>\n\nRegulations on clothing were confirmed inside Moldavia by two orders of [[Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu]], Minister of Internal Affairs (issues in 1859 and 1860 respectively).<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.241\"/> Following adoption of the 1859 regulation, soldiers and civilians would walk the streets of Ia\u0219i and some other Moldavian towns, assaulting Jews, using scissors to shred their clothing, but also to cut their beards or their [[Payot|sidelocks]]; drastic measures applied by the Army Headquarters put a stop to such turmoil.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.241\"/>\n\nIn 1864, Prince Cuza, owing to difficulties between his government and the general assembly, dissolved the latter and decided to submit a draft of a constitution granting [[universal suffrage]]. He proposed creating [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] (of [[Senate of Romania|senators]] and [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|deputies]] respectively), to extend the franchise to all citizens, and to emancipate the peasants from forced labor (expecting to nullify the remaining influence of the landowners - no longer [[boyar]]s after the [[land reform]]). In the process, Cuza also expected financial support from both the Jews and the [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]] - it appears that he kept the latter demand reduced, asking for only 40,000 ''[[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Austrian guilder]]'' (the standard [[gold coin]]s; about [[United States dollar|US$]] 90,000 at the exchange rate of the time) from the two groups. The Armenians discussed the matter with the Jews, but they were not able to come to a satisfactory agreement in the matter.\n\nWhile Cuza was pressing in his demands, the Jewish community debated the method of assessment. The rich Jews, for unclear reasons, refused to advance the money, and the [[middle class]] argued that the sum would not lead to tangible enough results; [[Orthodox Judaism|Religious Jews]] insisted that such rights would only interfere with the exercise of their religion. Cuza, on being informed that the Jews hesitated to pay their share, inserted in his draft of a constitution a clause excluding from the right of suffrage all who did not profess Christianity.\n\n==1860s and 1870s==\nWhen Charles von Hohenzollern succeeded Cuza in 1866 as [[Carol I of Romania]], the first event that confronted him in the capital was a riot against the Jews. A draft of a constitution was then submitted by the government, Article 6 of which declared that \"religion is no obstacle to [[citizenship]]\"; but, \"with regard to the Jews, a special law will have to be framed in order to regulate their admission to [[naturalization]] and also to [[civil rights]]\".<ref>Ornea, p.389; Veiga, p.58-59</ref> On June 30, 1866, the [[Bucharest Synagogue]] was desecrated and demolished (it was rebuilt in the same year, then restored in 1932 and 1945). Many Jews were beaten, maimed, and robbed. As a result, Article 6 was withdrawn and Article 7 was added to the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]]; it read that \"only such aliens as are of the Christian faith may obtain citizenship\".\n\n[[File:Nicolae Grigorescu 026.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicolae Grigorescu]]: ''Jew with Goose'' (c. 1880) - a [[Jew|Romanian Jew]] holding a [[petition]] and a goose for [[bribery]].]]\nFor the following decades, the issue of Jewish rights occupied the forefront of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Regat]]'s political scene. With few notable exceptions (including some of ''[[Junimea]]'' affiliates<ref>Panu, p.223-233</ref> &mdash; [[Petre P. Carp]], [[George Panu]], and [[I.L. Caragiale]]), most Romanian [[intellectual]]s began professing [[antisemitism]]; its most virulent form was the one present with advocates of [[Liberalism in Romania|Liberalism]] (in contradiction to their 1848 political roots), especially Moldavians, who argued that Jewish immigration had prevented the rise of an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] [[middle class]]. The first examples of modern prejudice were the Moldavian ''[[Frac\u021biunea liber\u0103 \u0219i independent\u0103]]'' (later blended into the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], PNL) and the [[Bucharest]] group formed around [[Cezar Bolliac]].<ref>Ornea, p.389; Panu, p.224</ref> Their discourse saw Jews as [[Cultural assimilation|non-assimilated]] and perpetually foreign - this claim was, however, challenged by some contemporary sources,<ref>For example, Panu (p.226) stated that \"the issue of [the Jews'] assimilation or the mere possibility of their assimilation were never mentioned [by antisemites], being considered an impossible occurrence altogether [...]\"; in the 1890s, Caragiale evidenced the paradox in his editorial ''Tr\u0103darea rom\u00e2nismului! Triumful str\u0103inismului!! Consumatum est!!!'', mimicking the tone of Liberals in opposition to the [[Petre P. Carp]] government: \"Yesterday, February 5, '93, yesterday, fateful and cursed day! was voted that anti-social, anti-economical, anti-patriotic, anti-national, anti-Romanian law, that law through which poverty-stricken Jews may no longer be prevented from training in certain careers!\"</ref> and by the eventual acceptance of all immigrants other than Jews.\n\nAntisemitism was carried into the PNL's mainstream, and was officially enforced under the [[Prime Minister of Romania|premierships]] of [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]]. During his first years in office, Br\u0103tianu reinforced and applied old discrimination laws, insisting that Jews were not allowed to settle in the countryside (and relocating those that had done so), while declaring many Jewish urban inhabitants to be [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and expelling them from the country. According to the 1905 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'': \"A number of such Jews who proved their Romanian birth were forced across the Danube, and when [the [[Ottoman Empire]]] refused to receive them, were thrown into the river and drowned. Almost every country in Europe was shocked at these barbarities. The Romanian government was warned by the powers; and Br\u0103tianu was subsequently dismissed from office\". Cabinets formed by the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservative Party]], although including ''Junimea'''s leaders, did not do much to improve the Jews' condition - mainly due to PNL opposition.\n\nNonetheless, during this same era, Romania was the cradle of [[Yiddish theatre]]. The Russian-born [[Abraham Goldfaden]] started the first professional Yiddish theatre company in Ia\u0219i in 1876 and for several years, especially during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] Romania was the home of Yiddish theatre. While its center of gravity would move first to Russia, then [[London]], then [[New York City]], both Bucharest and Ia\u0219i would continue to figure prominently in its history over the next century.<ref>[[Israil Bercovici]], ''O sut\u0103 de ani de teatru evreiesc \u00een Rom\u00e2nia'' (\"One hundred years of Yiddish/Jewish theater in Romania\"), 2nd Romanian-language edition, revised and augmented by Constantin M\u0103ciuc\u0103.

The war was concluded by the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878), which stipulated (Article 44) that the non-Christians in Romania (including both Jews and [[Islam in Romania|Muslims]] in the newly acquired region of [[Northern Dobruja]]) should receive full citizenship. After a prolonged debate at home and diplomatic negotiations abroad, the Romanian government ultimately agreed (1879) to abrogate Article 7 of its constitution. This was, however, reformulated to make procedures very difficult: \"the naturalization of aliens not under foreign protection should in every individual case be decided by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]\" (the action involved, among others, a ten-year term before the applicant was given an evaluation).<ref>Ornea, p.390; Veiga, p.60</ref> The gesture was doubled by a show of compliance - 883 Jews, participants in the war, were naturalized in a body by a vote of both chambers.\n\nFifty-seven persons voted upon as individuals were naturalized in 1880; 6, in 1881; 2, in 1882; 2, in 1883; and 18, from 1886 to 1900; in all, 85 Jews in twenty-one years, 27 of whom in the meantime died; c. 4,000 people had obtained citizenship by 1912.<ref name=\"Ornea, p.391\">Ornea, p.391</ref> Various laws were passed until the pursuit of virtually all careers was made dependent on the possession of political rights, which only Romanians could exercise; more than 40% of Jewish working men, including [[manual labour]]ers, were forced into [[unemployment]] by such legislation. Similar laws were passed in regard to Jews exercising liberal professions.<ref>Ornea, p.396; Veiga, p.58-59</ref>\n\nIn 1893, a piece of legislation was voted to deprive Jewish children of the right to be educated in the [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] - they were to be received only if and where children of citizens had been provided for, and their parents were required to pay preferential [[tuition]] fees{{Quotation needed|date=January 2016}}. In 1898, it was passed into law that Jews were to be excluded from [[secondary school]]s and the universities. Another notable measure was the expulsion of vocal Jewish activists as \"objectionable aliens\" (under the provisions of an 1881 law), including those of [[Moses Gaster]] and [[Elias Schwarzfeld]].<ref>Ornea, p.396</ref>\n\nThe courts exacted the ''[[Oath More Judaico]]'' in its most offensive form - it was only abolished in 1904, following criticism in the [[France|French]] press. In 1892, when the [[United States]] addressed a note to the signatory powers of the Berlin treaty on the matter, it was attacked by the Romanian press. The [[Lasc\u0103r Catargiu]] government was, however, concerned - the issue was debated among ministers, and, as a result, the Romanian government issued [[pamphlet]]s in [[French language|French]], reiterating its accusations against the Jews and maintaining that persecutions were deserved in exchange for the community's alleged exploitation of the rural population.\n\n==20th century==\n\n===Before and after World War I===\n[[File:1901 Sinagogue Brasov.jpg|thumb|The Synagogue of [[Bra\u0219ov]] (built 1901)]]The emigration of Romanian Jews on a larger scale commenced soon after 1878; numbers rose and fell, with a major wave of [[History of the Jews in Bessarabia|Bessarabian Jews]] after the [[Kishinev pogrom]] in [[Imperial Russia]] (1905). The ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' wrote in 1905, shortly before the pogrom, \"It is admitted that at least 70 per cent would leave the country at any time if the necessary traveling expenses were furnished\". There are no official statistics of emigration; but it is safe to place the minimum number of Jewish emigrants from 1898 to 1904 at 70,000. By 1900 there were 250,000 Romanian Jews: 3.3% of the population, 14.6% of the city dwellers, 32% of the Moldavian urban population and 42% of [[Ia\u0219i]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLand issues and predominantly Jewish presence among [[Leasehold estate|estate leaseholders]] accounted for the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt]], partly antisemitic in message.<ref>Veiga, p.24-25</ref> During the same period, the anti-Jewish message first expanded beyond its National Liberal base (where it was soon an insignificant attitude),<ref>Veiga, p.56</ref> to cover the succession of more radical and Moldavian-based organizations founded by [[A.C. Cuza]] (his [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]], created in 1910, had the first antisemitic program in Romanian political history).<ref>Ornea, p.395</ref> No longer present in the PNL's ideology by the 1920s, antisemitism also tended to surface in on the [[left-wing]] of the political spectrum, in currents originating in ''[[Poporanism]]'' - which favoured the claim that peasants were being systematically exploited by Jews.<ref>The Jewish-Romanian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]] criticised Poporanist claims in his work on 1907 revolt, ''Neoiob\u0103gia'' (\"Neo-[[Serfdom]]\"), arguing that, as favorite victims of prejudice (and most likely to be retaliated against), Jews were least likely to exploit: \"[The Jewish tenant's] position is inferior to that of the exploited, for he is not a [[boyar]], a gentleman, but a Yid, as well as to the administration, whose subordinate bodies he may well be able to satisfy, but whose upper bodies remain hostile towards him. His position is also rendered difficult by the antisemitic trend, strong as it gets, and by the hostile [[public opinion]], and by the press, overwhelmingly antisemitic, but mostly by the r\u00e9gime itself - which, while awarding him all the advantages of neo-serfdom on one hand, uses, on the other, his position as a Yid to make of him a distraction and a [[scapegoat]] for the r\u00e9gime's sins.\"</ref>\n\n[[World War I]], during which 882 Jewish soldiers died defending Romania (825 were decorated), brought about the creation of [[Greater Romania]] after the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] and subsequent treaties. The enlarged state had an increased Jewish population, corresponding with the addition of communities in [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]], and [[Transylvania]]. On signing the treaties, Romania agreed to change its policy towards the Jews, promising to award them both citizenship and [[minority rights]], the effective [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation of Jews]].<ref name=\"Ornea, p.391\"/> The [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] sanctioned these requirements, meeting opposition from Cuza's [[National-Christian Defense League]] and rioting by [[far right]] students in [[Ia\u0219i]];<ref>Veiga, p.62-64</ref> [[Land reform in Romania|the land reform]] carried out by the [[Ion I.

During the same period, a division in ritual became apparent between [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]] in Transylvania and usually [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] ones in the rest of the country<ref>Veiga, p.61-62</ref> (while Bessarabia was the most open to [[Zionism]] and especially the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Labor Zionism]]).\n[[File:EvRoMare1930.PNG|thumb|Jewish population per county in [[Greater Romania]], according to the Wiesel Commission report, pp. 81, which counted 728,115 Jews by ethnicity and 756,930 Jews by religion]]\nThe popularity of anti-Jewish messages was, nevertheless, on the rise, and merged itself with the appeal of [[fascism]] in the late 1920s - both contributed to the creation and success of [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]'s [[Iron Guard]] and the appearance of new types of anti-Semitic discourses (''[[Tr\u0103irism]]'' and ''[[G\u00e2ndirism]]''). The idea of a ''[[Jewish quota]]'' in [[higher education]] became highly popular among Romanian students and teachers.<ref>Ornea, p.396-397</ref> According to [[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]]'s analysis, a relevant number of [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] intellectuals refused to adopt overt anti-Semitism, which was ill-reputed through its association with A. C. Cuza's violent discourse; nevertheless, a few years later, such cautions were cast aside, and anti-Semitism became displayed as \"spiritual health\".<ref>Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p.252-253; [[Nichifor Crainic]] declared in 1931 \"We were not, are not and will not be anti-Semites\"; nevertheless, only two years later, in 1933, he wrote \"The new spirit is healthy because is anti-Semitic, anti-Semitic in doctrine and anti-Semitic in practice\". [[Barbu Theodorescu]], the secretary and bibliographer of historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], wrote in 1938: \"Romanian anti-Semitism is 100 years old. To fight against the Jew is to walk the straight line of the Romanian nation's normal development. Anti-Semitism animated the heart of the Romanian intellectual elite. Anti-Semitism is the most vital problem of Romanian prosperity.\" (Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p.253)</ref>\n\nThe first motion to exclude Jews from professional associations came on May 16, 1937, when the Confederation of the Associations of Professional Intellectuals (''Confedera\u021bia Asocia\u021biilor de Profesioni\u0219ti Intelectuali din Rom\u00e2nia'') voted to exclude all Jewish members from its affiliated bodies, calling for the state to withdraw their licenses and reassess their citizenship.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.254\">Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p.254</ref> Although illegal, the measure was popular and it was commented that, in its case, legality had been supplanted by a \"heroic decision\".<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.254\"/> According to Oi\u0219teanu, the initiative had a direct influence on antisemitic regulations passed during the following year.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.254\"/>\n\nThe threat posed by the Iron Guard, the emergence of [[Nazi Germany]] as a European power, and his own fascist sympathies {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, made [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], who was still largely identified as a [[Philo-Semitism|philo-Semite]],<ref>Ornea, p.397; Veiga, p.246, 264</ref> adopt [[Racism|racial discrimination]] as the norm. In the recent election, over 25% of the electorate had voted for explicitly antisemitic groups (either the Goga-Cuza alliance (9%) or the Iron Guard's political mouthpiece, TPT(16.5%)), and as a result, Carol was forced to let one of the two into his cabinet- he instantly chose the Goga-Cuza alliance over the rabid fascism of the Iron Guard (according to modern historian of the Balkans, Misha Glenny, he also thought that this would \"take the sting out of the Guard's tail\").{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} On January 21, 1938, Carol's executive (led by Cuza and [[Octavian Goga]]) passed a law aimed at reviewing criteria for citizenship (after it cast allegations that previous cabinets had allowed [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jews]] to obtain it illegally),<ref name=\"Ornea, p.391\"/> and requiring all Jews who had received citizenship in 1918-1919 to reapply for it (while providing a very short term in which this could be achieved - 20 days);<ref>''Royal Decree'', 1938, art.6</ref>\n\nHowever, Carol II himself was highly hostile to antisemitism. His lover, Elena Lupescu, was Jewish, as were a number of his friends in government, and he soon reverted to his original policies (that is, fiercely opposing the antisemites and fascists), but with a newly violent sting. On February 12, 1938, he used the rising violence between political groups as context to seize absolute power (a move which was tacitly supported by the liberals who had come to view him as a lesser evil in comparison to Codreanu's fascist movement). As an authentic Romanian nationalist (albeit, one who had a view of a Westernized, forcefully industrialized Romania at the expense of the peasants whom he viewed with disdain; making him completely the antithesis of the views of Codreanu), Carol was determined that Romania should not fall into the near-absolute economic and political control that many of its neighbors already had, and moved to theatrical resistance against Nazi ideology.\n\n{{Confusing|reason = Were these fascist leaders brutally killed?|date=January 2016}}The King then arrested the entire leadership of the Iron Guard, on the grounds that they were in the pay of the Nazis, and began using the same accusation against various political opponents, both to solidify his absolute control of the country as well as negatively stigmatize Germany. In November, the fourteen most important fascist leaders (the first of which being Codreanu) were \"rinsed\" in acid.<ref>Glenny, Misha.

It is estimated that, in July\u2013September 1941, the number of Jews killed, in Bukovina and Bessarabia, by the Romanian Army and the [[Romanian Gendarmerie]] in cooperation with the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German Army]] and the [[Einsatzgruppen]], is more than 45,000 people but probably closer to 60,000.<ref name=\"Commission\"/> Of those who escaped the initial [[ethnic cleansing]] in Bukovina and Bessarabia, only very few managed to survive \"trains\" and the [[concentration camp]]s set up in the Transnistria Governorate. In 1941-1942, the total number of deportees from Bessarabia, Bukovina, Dorohoi and the Regat was between 154,449 and 170,737 people.<ref name=\"Commission\"/>\n\nFurther killings perpetrated by Antonescu's death squads (documents prove his direct orders{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}) in collaboration with the German [[Einsatzkommando]], the SS squads of local [[Black Sea Germans|Ukrainian Germans]] ([[Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle#Role in the Holocaust|Sonderkommando Russland]] and [[Selbstschutz]]), and the Ukrainian militia targeted the local Jewish population that the Romanian Army managed to round up when occupying Transnistria. Over one hundred thousand of these were killed in massacres staged in such places as [[Odessa]] (see [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]]), [[Bogdanovka]], [[Akmechetka]], [[Pechora concentration camp|Pechora]] in 1941 and 1942.\n\nAntonescu's government also made plans for mass deportations of the Romanian Jews community from the rest of the country (the Regat and southern Transylvania), numbering 292,149 people (according to a May 1942 census), to Transnistria region, or, in collaboration with the German government, to the [[Belzec extermination camp]], but these had never been carried out.<ref name=\"Commission\"/>\n\nThe change in policy toward the Jews began in October 1942, and by March\u2013April 1943, Antonescu permanently stopped all deportations despite German pressure,<ref>Chapter 11 - Solidarity and Rescue, [[Wiesel Commission]] - \"Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania\" [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Romania/eleven.pdf]</ref> as he began to seek peace with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], although at the same time he levied heavy taxes and forced labor on the remaining Jewish communities. Also, sometimes with the encouragement of Antonescu's regime, thirteen boats left Romania for the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] during the war, carrying 13,000 Jews (two of these ships were sunk by the Soviets (see [[Struma disaster]]), and the effort was discontinued after German pressure was applied).\n\nDiscussions regarding the repatriation of deported Jews followed, and in January 1943, the leader of the Romanian-Jewish community [[Wilhelm Filderman]] began talks with the Romanian government in order to start repatriating Romanian Jews deported to Transnistria. On November 15, 1943, an official report of the Romanian government indicated that 49,927 Romanian Jews were alive in Transnistria (of which 6,425 were originally from the Regat). In December 1943, partial repatriation began, and in March 1944, Antonescu government ordered general repatriation for all Romanian Jews deportees from Transnistria. Between December 20, 1943 and March 30, 1944, almost 11,000 people (including orphans) were repatriated from different camps and ghettos in Transnistria. However, the decision came too late to organize the repatriation of the last large number of deportees, and the fate of tens of thousands of deportees remaining in Transnistria became unknown.<ref name=\"Commission\"/>\n\n====Results====\nHistorical and political situations have determined the destinies of the Romanian Jews in different ways, depending on the regions in which they were living, and proximity to the front being the most important variable.<ref name=\"Commission\"/> The total number of deaths is not certain, but even the lowest respectable estimates run to about 250,000 Jews (plus 25,000 deported [[Romani people|Romani]], of which approximately 11,000 perished).<ref name=\"Commission\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[Wiesel Commission]] report released by the Romanian government in 2004, between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews were murdered or died in various forms on Romanian soil, in the war zones of [[Bessarabia]], [[Bukovina]], and in the occupied [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territories under Romanian's control ([[Transnistria Governorate]]).<ref name=\"washingtontimes.com\"/><ref name=\"Commission\"/>\n\nAt least 15,000 Jews from the Regat were murdered in the Ia\u0219i pogrom and as a result of other anti-Jewish measures. Half of the estimated 270,000 to 320,000 Jews living in Bessarabia, Bukovina, and the former [[Dorohoi County]] in Romania were murdered or died between June 1941 and November 1943. Between 45,000 and 60,000 Jews were killed in Bessarabia and Bukovina by Romanian and German troops in 1941. Between 104,522 and 120,810 deported Romanian Jews died as a result of the expulsions to Transnistria. After a wave of random initial killings, Jews in Moldavia were subject to [[pogrom]]s, while those in Bessarabia, Bukovina and Dorohoi were concentrated into [[ghetto]]s from which they were deported to concentration camps in the Transnistria Governorate, including camps built and run by Romanians. Romanian soldiers and gendarmes also worked with the German Einsatzkommando, the Ukrainian militia, and the SS squads of local Ukrainian Germans to massacre Jews in conquered territories east of the Romania's 1940 border. In Transnistria, between 115,000 and 180,000 indigenous Ukrainian Jews were killed, especially in Odessa and the counties of Golta and Berezovka.<ref name=\"Commission\" />\n\nAt the same time, 135,000 Jews living under [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian control]] in [[Northern Transylvania]] were deported to and died in concentration and extermination camps. In addition, 5,000 Romanian Jews perished in the Holocaust in other countries.<ref name=\"Commission\" />\n\nA majority of the Romanian Jews living within the 1940 borders did survive the war. The change in the Romanian government policy during 1942-1943 led to the survival of at least 290,000 Romanian Jews (although they were subject to a wide range of harsh conditions, including [[Penal labour|forced labor]], financial penalties, and discriminatory laws), and to the subsequent repatriation of thousands of people. Also, thousands of Romanian Jews living abroad were able to survive thanks to renewed Romanian diplomatic protection.

According to Sachar, for the first two post-war years, tens of thousands of Romanian Jews left for Israel; the Romanian government did not try to stop them, especially due to its desire to reduce its historically suspect and now impoverished Jewish minority. Afterwards, Jewish emigration began to encounter obstacles. In 1948, the year of Israeli independence, Zionism came under renewed suspicion, and the government began a campaign of liquidation against Zionist funds and training farms. However, emigration was not completely banned; Romanian Foreign Minister [[Ana Pauker]], herself a Jew with a father and brother in Israel, negotiated an agreement with Israeli ambassador [[Reuven Rubin]], a Romanian immigrant to Israel, under which the Romanian government would allow 4,000 Jews a month to emigrate to Israel; this decision was at least partially influenced by a large [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] bribe to the Romanian government. This agreement applied mainly to ruined businessmen and other economically \"redundant\" Jews. Around this time, Israel also secured another agreement with the Romanian government, under which Romania issued 100,000 exit visas for Jews and Israel supplied Romania with oil drills and pipes to aid the struggling Romanian oil industry.<ref name=forward>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/2923/the-cold-wares-strangest-bedfellows-how-romania/ |title=The Cold War's Strangest Bedfellows: How Romania Sold its Jews to Israel and What it got in Return |publisher=Forward.com |date=2005-02-11 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> By December 1951, about 115,000 Romanian Jews had emigrated to Israel.<ref>Sachar, Howard M.:''Israel and Europe: An Appraisal in History''</ref>\n\nDuring the period of transition towards a [[Communist Romania|communist regime in Romania]], following [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation (''see [[Soviet occupation of Romania]]''), Jewish society and culture were subject to the same increasingly tight control by the authorities.

As a result, from then until the Ceau\u0219escu regime fell in 1989, about 1,500 Jews a year were granted exit visas to Israel in exchange for a payment of cash for every Jew allowed to leave, in addition to other Israeli aid. The exact payments were determined by the age, education, profession, employment, and family status of the emigrant.

Minimal until the 18th century, the size of the Jewish population increased after around 1850, and more especially after the establishment of ''[[Greater Romania]]'' in the aftermath of [[World War I]]. A diverse community, albeit an overwhelmingly urban one, Jews were a target of [[religious persecution]] and [[racism]] in Romanian society \u2013 from the late-19th century debate over the \"[[Jewish Question]]\" and the Jewish residents' right to [[citizenship]], to the [[genocide]] carried out in the lands of Romania as part of [[the Holocaust]]. The latter, coupled with successive waves of ''[[aliyah]]'', has accounted for a dramatic decrease in the overall size of Romania's present-day Jewish community.\n\nJewish communities existed in Romanian territory in the 2nd century AD. During the reign of [[Petru \u0218chiopul|Peter the Lame]] (1574\u20131579) the Jews of Moldavia, mainly traders from Poland who were competing with locals, were taxed and ultimately expelled.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\">Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61</ref> The authorities decided in 1650 and 1741 required Jews to wear clothing evidencing their status and ethnicity.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p. 239\">Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p. 239</ref> The first [[Blood libel|blood accusation]] in Moldavia (and, as such, in Romania) was made in 1710, when the Jews of [[T\u00e2rgu Neam\u021b]] were charged with having killed a [[Christianity|Christian]] child for ritual purposes.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003 p.2\">Oi\u0219teanu (2003), p.2; Rezachevici, October 1995, p.66</ref> An anti-Jewish riot occurred in Bucharest in the 1760s.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.27\">Cernovodeanu, p. 27</ref>\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774]] the Jews in the [[Danubian Principalities]] had to endure great hardships. Massacres and pillages were perpetrated in almost every town and village in the country. During the [[Greek War of Independence]], which signalled the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]], Jews were victims of [[pogrom]]s and [[Persecution of Jews|persecutions]]. In the 1860s, there was another riot motivated by blood libel accusations.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003, p.2\">Oi\u0219teanu (2003), p.2</ref>\n\nAntisemitism was officially enforced under the [[Prime Minister of Romania|premierships]] of [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]]. During his first years in office (1875) Br\u0103tianu reinforced and applied old discrimination laws, insisting that Jews were not allowed to settle in the countryside (and relocating those that had done so), while declaring many Jewish urban inhabitants to be [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and expelling them from the country. The emigration of Romanian Jews on a larger scale commenced soon after 1878. By 1900 there were 250,000 Romanian Jews: 3.3% of the population, 14.6% of the city dwellers, 32% of the Moldavian urban population and 42% of [[Ia\u0219i]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">A History of the Balkans 1804-1945, p.129</ref>\n\nBetween the establishment of the [[National Legionary State]] (September 1940) and 1942, 80 anti-Jewish regulations were passed. Starting at the end of October, 1940, the [[Iron Guard]] began a massive antisemitic campaign, torturing and beating Jews and looting their shops (''see [[Dorohoi Pogrom]]''), culminating in [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|the failed coup and a pogrom in Bucharest]], in which 125 Jews were killed.<ref name=\"Veiga, p.301\">Veiga, p.301</ref> [[Ion Antonescu]] eventually stopped the violence and chaos created by the Iron Guard by brutally suppressing the rebellion, but continued the policy of oppression and massacre of Jews, and, to a lesser extent, of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]]. After Romania entered the war at the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]] atrocities against the Jews became common, starting with the [[Ia\u0219i pogrom]]. According to the [[Wiesel Commission]] report released by the Romanian government in 2004, between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews were murdered or died during the Holocaust in Romania, but also in the occupied [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territories under Romanian control ([[Transnistria Governorate]]). An additional 135,000 Jews living under [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] control in [[Northern Transylvania]] also perished in the Holocaust, as did some 5,000 Romanian Jews in other countries.<ref name=\"washingtontimes.com\">Ilie Fugaru, ''[http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20041111-023944-6848r.htm Romania clears doubts about Holocaust past]'', [[United Press International|UPI]], November 11, 2004</ref><ref name=\"Commission\">\n{{cite web\n  |author=International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania\n  |title=Executive Summary: Historical Findings and Recommendations\n  |work=Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania\n  |publisher=Yad Vashem (The Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority)\n  |date=2012-01-28\n  |url=http://www.inshr-ew.ro/ro/files/Raport%20Final/Final_Report.pdf\n  |format=PDF\n  |doi=\n  |accessdate=2012-01-28\n  |authorlink=\n  Wiesel Commission }}\n</ref>\n\nOn the current territory of Romania, between 290,000 and 360,000 Romanian Jews survived World War II (355,972 persons, according to statistics from the end of the war).<ref name=\"contrafort\">{{cite web |url=http://www.contrafort.md/old/2008/165-166/1520.html |author= Alexandru Florin-Platon |title=O necesar\u0103 restitu\u0163ie biografic\u0103 (Carol Iancu, Alexandru \u015eafran: o via\u0163\u0103 de lupt\u0103, o raz\u0103 de lumin\u0103) |accessdate=2019-01-28 |publisher=[[Contrafort|Revista Contrafort]] }}</ref> During the [[Communist Romania|communist regime in Romania]], there was a mass emigration to [[Israel]], and in 1987, only 23,000 Jews lived in Romania.\n\nToday, the majority of [[Romanian Jews in Israel|Romanian Jews live in Israel]], while modern-day Romania continues to host a modest Jewish population. In the [[2011 Romanian Census|2011 census]], 3,271 declared to be Jewish.\n\n==Early history==\nJewish communities on what would later become Romanian territory were attested as early as the 2nd century AD, at a time when the [[Roman Empire]] had established its rule over [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]]. Inscriptions and coins have been found in such places as [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] and [[Or\u0219ova]].\n\nThe existence of the [[Crimean Karaites]], an ethnic group adherent of [[Karaite Judaism]], suggests that there was a steady Jewish presence around the [[Black Sea]], including in parts of today's Romania, in the trading ports from the mouths of the Danube and the [[Dniester]] (''see [[Cumania]]''); they may have been present in some Moldavian fairs by the 16th century or earlier.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.60\">Rezachevici, September 1995, p. 60</ref> The earliest Jewish (most likely [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]]) presence in what would become [[Moldavia]] was recorded in [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]] (1330); in [[Wallachia]], they were first attested in the 1550s, living in [[Bucharest]].<ref>Djuvara, p. 179; Giurescu, p. 271</ref> During the second half of the 14th century, the future territory of Romania became an important place of refuge for Jews expelled from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and [[Poland]] by [[List of rulers of Hungary|King]] [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]].

Also in Moldavia, [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504) treated Jews with consideration. [[Isaac ben Benjamin Shor]] of [[Ia\u0219i]] (''Isak [[Bey]]'', originally employed by [[Uzun Hassan]]) was appointed ''[[stolnic]]'', being subsequently advanced to the rank of ''[[logof\u0103t]]''; he continued to hold this office under [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Bogdan the Blind]] (1504\u20131517), the son and successor of Stephen.\n\nAt this time both [[Danubian Principalities]] came under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], and a number of Sephardim living in [[Istanbul]] migrated to Wallachia, while Jews from Poland and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] settled in Moldavia. Although they took an important part in [[State organisation of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] and formed a large part of a community of foreign creditors and traders,<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.60\"/> Jews were harassed by the ''[[hospodars]]'' of the two Principalities. Moldavia's Prince [[\u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103]] (1522) deprived the Jewish merchants of almost all the rights given to them by his two predecessors; [[Petru Rare\u0219]] confiscated Jewish wealth in 1541, after alleging that Jews in the cattle trade had engaged in [[tax evasion]].<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.60\"/> [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] (first rule: 1552-61) [[Persecution of Jews|persecuted]] the community alongside other social categories, until he was dethroned by [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid|Jacob Heraclides]], a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], who was lenient to his Jewish subjects; L\u0103pu\u0219neanu did not renew his persecutions after his return on the throne in 1564. The role of [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Ottoman]] and local Jews in financing various princes increased as Ottoman economic demands were mounting after 1550 (in the 1570s, the influential Jewish [[Duchy of the Archipelago|Duke of the Archipelago]], [[Joseph Nasi]], backed both Heraclides and L\u0103pu\u0219neanu to the throne); several violent incidents throughout the period were instigated by princes unable to repay their debts.<ref>Rezachevici, September 1995, pp. 60\u201361</ref>\n\nDuring the first short reign of [[Petru \u0218chiopul|Peter the Lame]] (1574\u20131579) the Jews of Moldavia, mainly traders from Poland who were competing with locals, were taxed and ultimately expelled.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\"/> In 1582, he succeeded in regaining his rule over the country with the help of the Jewish physician Benveniste, who was a friend of the influential [[Solomon Ashkenazi]];<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\"/> the latter then exerted his influence with the Prince in favor of his coreligionists.\n\nIn Wallachia, [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Alexandru II Mircea]] (1567\u20131577) engaged as his private secretary and counselor [[Isaiah ben Joseph]], who used his influence on behalf of the Jews. In 1573 Isaiah was dismissed, owing to court intrigues, but he was not harmed any further, and subsequently left for Moldavia (where he entered the service of [[Muscovy]]'s [[Grand Prince of Moscow|Grand Prince]] [[Ivan the Terrible]]). Through the efforts of Solomon Ashkenazi, [[Aron Tiranul]] was placed on the throne of Moldavia; nevertheless, the new ruler persecuted and executed nineteen Jewish creditors in [[Ia\u0219i]], who were [[Decapitation|decapitated]] without process of law.<ref name=\"Rezachevici, September 1995, p.61\"/> At around the same time, in Wallachia, the violent repression of creditors peaked under [[Michael the Brave]], who, after killing Turkish creditors in [[Bucharest]] (1594), probably engaged in violence against Jews settled south of the [[Danube]] during his campaign in [[Rumelia]] (while maintaining good relations with Transylvanian Jews).<ref>Rezachevici, September 1995, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n==Early Modern Age==\nIn 1623, the Jews in [[Transylvania]] were awarded certain [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s by [[List of rulers of Transylvania|Prince]] [[Gabriel Bethlen]], who aimed to attract entrepreneurs from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] lands into his country; the grants were curtailed during following decades, when Jews were only allowed to settle in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r ([[Alba Iulia]]).<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p.61-62; 64-65</ref> Among the privileges granted was one allowing Jews to wear traditional dress; eventually, the authorities in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r decided (in 1650 and 1741) to allow Jews to wear only clothing evidencing their status and ethnicity.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p. 239\"/>\n\nThe status of Jews who had [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was established in [[Wallachia]] by [[Matei Basarab]]'s ''[[Pravila de la Govora]]'' and in Moldavia by [[Vasile Lupu]]'s ''[[Pravila lui Vasile Lupu|Carte rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 de \u00eenv\u0103\u021b\u0103tur\u0103]]''.<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p.62</ref> The latter ruler (1634\u20131653) treated the Jews with consideration until the appearance of the [[Cossacks]] (1648), who marched against the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and who, while crossing the region, killed many Jews; the violence, led many [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from Poland took refuge in [[Moldavia]] and Wallachia, establishing small but stable communities.<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p.62-63</ref> Massacres and forced conversions by the Cossacks occurred in 1652, when the latter came to [[Ia\u0219i]] on the occasion of the Vasile Lupu's daughter marriage to [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Timush]], the son of [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and during the rule of [[Gheorghe \u0218tefan]].<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p. 63</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Anton Maria Del Chiaro]], secretary of the Wallachian princes between 1710\u20131716, the Jewish population of Wallachia was required to respect a certain [[Social aspects of clothing|dresscode]]. Thus, they were prohibited from wearing clothes of other color than black or violet, or to wear yellow or red boots.<ref>Del Chiaro; Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p.239-240</ref> Nevertheless, the Romanian scholar [[Andrei Oi\u0219teanu]] argued that such ethnic and religious [[social stigma]] was uncommon in Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as throughout the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] areas of Europe.<ref>Oi\u0219teanu (1998), pp. 242\u2013244</ref>\n\nThe first [[Blood libel|blood accusation]] in Moldavia (and, as such, in Romania) was made April 5, 1710, when the Jews of [[T\u00e2rgu Neam\u021b]] were charged with having killed a [[Christianity|Christian]] child for ritual purposes\u00b4.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003 p.2\"/> The instigator was a baptized Jew who had helped to carry the body of a child, murdered by Christians, into the courtyard of the [[synagogue]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. On the next day five Jews were killed, others were maimed, and every Jewish house was pillaged, while the representatives of the community were imprisoned and tortured. Meanwhile, some influential Jews appealed to Prince [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] (the first [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] ruler) in Ia\u0219i, who ordered an investigation resulting in the freeing of those arrested. This was the first time that the Orthodox clergy participated in attacks on Jews. It was due to the clergy's instigations that in 1714 a similar charge was brought against the Jews of the city of [[Roman, Romania|Roman]] - the murder by a group of [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholics]] of a Christian girl-servant to Jewish family was immediately blamed on Jews; every Jewish house was plundered, and two prominent Jews were hanged, before the real criminals were discovered by the authorities.\n\n[[File:iasi shul.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Synagogue (Ia\u0219i)]], built c. 1670]]\nUnder [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]], Wallachian Jews were recognized as a special [[guild]] in Bucharest, led by a ''[[starost]]''.<ref>Cernovodeanu, p. 25; Giurescu, p. 271</ref> Jews in both Wallachia and Moldavia were subject to the ''[[Hakham Bashi]]'' in Ia\u0219i, but soon the Bucharest ''starost'' assumed several religious duties.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.25\">Cernovodeanu, p.25</ref> Overtaxed and persecuted under [[\u0218tefan Cantacuzino]] (1714\u20131716),<ref>Rezachevici, October 1995, p. 66</ref> Wallachian Jews obtained valuable privileges during Nicholas Mavrocordatos' rule (1716\u20131730) in that country (the Prince notably employed the Jewish savant [[Daniel de Fonseca]] at his court).<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\">Cernovodeanu, p.26</ref> Another anti-Jewish riot occurred in Bucharest in the 1760s, and was encouraged by the visit of [[Ephram II of Jerusalem|Ephram II]], [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.27\"/>\n\nIn 1726, in the Moldavian borough of [[Oni\u021bcani]], four Jews were accused of having kidnapped a five-year-old child, of killing him on [[Easter]] and of collecting his blood in a barrel. They were tried at Ia\u0219i under the supervision of Moldavian Prince [[Mihai Racovi\u021b\u0103]], and eventually acquitted following diplomatic protests. The event was echoed in several contemporary chronicles and documents &mdash; for example, the [[France|French]] [[French Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire|ambassador to the Porte]], [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Picon]], remarked that such an accusation was no longer accepted in \"civilized countries\".<ref>Oi\u0219teanu (1998), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> The most obvious effects on the condition of the Jewish inhabitants of Moldavia were witnessed during the reign of [[John Mavrocordatos]] (1744\u20131747): a Jewish farmer in the vicinity of [[Suceava]] reported the prince to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] for allegedly using his house to [[rape]] a number of [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] Jewish women; Mavrocordatos had his accuser hanged. This act aroused the anger of [[Mahmud I]]'s ''[[kapucu]]'' in Moldavia, and the prince paid the penalty with the loss of his throne.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.27\"/>\n\n==Russo-Turkish Wars==\n{{Main|History of the Russo-Turkish wars}}\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u20131774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774]], Jews in the Danubian Principalities endured great hardships. Massacres and pillages were perpetrated in almost every town and village in the country. When peace was restored, both princes, [[Alexandru Mavrocordat|Alexander Mavrocordatos]] of Moldavia and [[Nicholas Mavrogheni]] of Wallachia, pledged their special protection to Jews, whose condition remained favorable until 1787, when both [[Janissary|Janissaries]] and the [[Imperial Russia]]n [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Army]] took part in [[pogrom]]s.\n\nThe community was also subject to persecutions by the locals. Jewish children were seized and forcibly baptized. Ritual-murder accusations became widespread, with one made at [[Gala\u021bi]] in 1797 leading to exceptionally severe results - with Jews being attacked by a large mob, driven from their homes, robbed, waylaid on the streets, and many killed on the spot, while some were forced into the [[Danube]] and drowned, and others who took refuge in the synagogue were burned to death in the building; a few escaped after being given protection and refuge by a priest. In 1803, shortly before his death, the [[Metropolitan of Hungro-Wallachia|Wallachian Metropolitan]] [[Iacob Stamati]] instigated attacks on the Bucharest community by publishing his ''\u00cenfruntarea jidovilor'' (\"Facing the Jews\"), which pretended to be the confession of a former [[rabbi]]; however, Jews were offered refuge by Stamati's replacement, [[Veniamin Costachi]].<ref>Cernovodeanu, p. 27; Oi\u0219teanu (2003), p .3</ref> A seminal event occurred in 1804, when ruler [[Constantine Ypsilanti]] dismissed accusations of ritual murder as \"the unfounded opinion\" of \"stupid people\", and ordered that their condemnation be read in churches throughout Wallachia; the allegations no longer surfaced during the following period.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.28\">Cernovodeanu, p. 28</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812|Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812]], the Russian invasion was again accompanied by massacres of Jews. [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] irregular soldiers in Ottoman service, who appeared in Bucharest at the close of the Russo-Turkish War, terrorised the city's Jewish population. At around the same time, a conflict emerged in Wallachia between Jews under foreign protection (''[[sudi\u021bi]]'') and local ones (''hrisovoli\u021bi''), after the latter tried to impose a single administration for the community, a matter which was finally settled in favor of the ''hrisovoli\u021bi'' by Prince [[Jean Georges Caradja]] (1813).<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.25\"/>\n\nIn [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]]-ruled Transylvania, the reforms carried out by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] allowed Jews to settle in towns directly subject to the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen|Hungarian Crown]]. However, pressure placed on the community remained stringent for the following decades.\n\n==Early 19th century==\n[[File:AKauffmannJReyIasiFair.PNG|thumb|Lithograph of a cosmopolitan fair in [[Ia\u0219i]] (c. 1845); two [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] are visible to the right]]\n[[File:Templul Coral 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Bucharest Synagogue]] (restored after [[World War II]]), originally built 1857{{snds}}1867]]\n\nBy 1825, the Jewish population in Wallachia was estimated at between 5,000 and 10,000 people, almost all [[Sephardi]]. Of these, the larger part resided in [[Bucharest]] (probably as many as 7,000 in 1839); and at around the same time, Moldavia was home to about 12,000 Jews.<ref>Djuvara, p.179; Giurescu, p.272</ref> In parallel, the Jewish population in [[Bukovina]] rose from 526 in 1774 to 11,600 in 1848.<ref>Hitchins, p.226-227</ref> In the early 19th century, Jews who sought refuge from [[Osman Pazvanto\u011flu]]'s campaign in the [[Balkans]] established communities in Wallachian-ruled [[Oltenia]].<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\"/> In Moldavia, [[Scarlat Callimachi]]'s ''Code'' (1817) allowed Jews to purchase urban property, but prevented them from settling in the countryside (while purchasing town property became increasingly difficult due to popular prejudice).<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Greek War of Independence]], which signaled the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]] and the [[Danubian Principalities]]' occupation by [[Filiki Eteria]] troops under [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792-1828)|Alexander Ypsilantis]], Jews were victims of [[pogrom]]s and [[Persecution of Jews|persecutions]] in places such as [[F\u0103lticeni]], [[Hertsa]], [[Piatra Neam\u021b]], the [[Secu Monastery]], [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]], and [[T\u00e2rgu Frumos]].

By 1838, their number seems to have reached 80,000,<ref>Cernovodeanu, p. 28; Djuvara, pp. 179\u2013180</ref> and over 195,000, or almost 12% of the country's population, in 1859 (with an additional 50,000 passing through to Wallachia between the two estimates).<ref>Ornea, p. 387</ref>\n\nDespite initial interdictions under the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)|Russian occupation of 1829]] (when it was first regulated that non-Christians were not to be regarded as citizens), many of the new immigrants became [[Leasehold estate|leaseholders of estates]] and [[tavern]]-keepers, serving to increase both the revenue and demands of [[boyars]], and leading in turn to an increase in economic pressures over those working the land or buying products<ref>Djuvara, p.180-182</ref> (usual prejudice against Jews accused tavern-keepers of encouraging [[alcoholism]]). At the same time, several Jews rose to prominence and high social status, with most families involved in Moldavian banking around the 1850s being of Jewish origin.<ref>Djuvara, p.182</ref> After 1832, following adoption of the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'', Jewish children were accepted in schools in the two Principalities only if they wore the same clothing as others. In Moldavia, the 1847 decree of Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] compelled Jews to abandon the traditional dress code.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.241\">Oi\u0219teanu (1998), p.241</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Revolutions of 1848]], which found their parallel in the [[1848 Wallachian revolution|Wallachian revolution]], many restrictive laws against Jews were enacted; although they had some destructive effects, they were never strictly enforced. In various ways, Jews took part in the Wallachian revolt; for example, [[Constantin Daniel Rosenthal]], the painter, distinguished himself in the revolutionary cause, and paid for his activity with his life (being tortured to death in Budapest by [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] authorities). The major document to be codified by the 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, the ''[[Islaz Proclamation]]'', called for \"the emancipation of [[Israelite]]s and [[political rights]] for all compatriots of different faiths\".<ref>''Islaz Proclamation'', art.21</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Crimean War]], the struggle for the union of the two principalities began. Both parties, [[Partida Na\u021bional\u0103|Unionists]] and anti-Unionists sought support of Jews, with each promising full equality; and proclamations to this effect were issued between 1857 and 1858. In 1857, the community published its first [[magazine]], ''[[Israelitul Rom\u00e2n]]'', edited by the Romanian [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[Iuliu Barasch]]. This process of gradual integration resulted in the creation of an informal Jewish Romanian identity, while [[Religious conversion|conversion to Christianity]], despite encouragement by the authorities,<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.26\"/> remained confined to exceptional cases.<ref name=\"Cernovodeanu, p.28\"/>\n\n==Under Alexandru Ioan Cuza==\n[[File:Teatrul Evreiesc de Stat.jpg|thumb|[[State Jewish Theater (Romania)|State Jewish Theater]] in [[Bucharest]]]]\n[[File:Jewish cemetery of Brasov Romania.jpg|thumb|An ornately decorated Jewish Cemetery building, [[Brasov, Romania]]]]\nFrom the beginning of the reign of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] (1859\u20131866), the first ruler (''[[Domnitor]]'') of the united principalities, the Jews became a prominent factor in the politics of the country. This period was, however, inaugurated by another riot motivated by blood libel accusations, begun during [[Easter]] 1859 in [[Gala\u021bi]].<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 2003, p.2\"/>\n\nRegulations on clothing were confirmed inside Moldavia by two orders of [[Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu]], Minister of Internal Affairs (issues in 1859 and 1860 respectively).<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.241\"/> Following adoption of the 1859 regulation, soldiers and civilians would walk the streets of Ia\u0219i and some other Moldavian towns, assaulting Jews, using scissors to shred their clothing, but also to cut their beards or their [[Payot|sidelocks]]; drastic measures applied by the Army Headquarters put a stop to such turmoil.<ref name=\"Oi\u0219teanu 1998, p.241\"/>\n\nIn 1864, Prince Cuza, owing to difficulties between his government and the general assembly, dissolved the latter and decided to submit a draft of a constitution granting [[universal suffrage]]. He proposed creating [[Bicameralism|two chambers]] (of [[Senate of Romania|senators]] and [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|deputies]] respectively), to extend the franchise to all citizens, and to emancipate the peasants from forced labor (expecting to nullify the remaining influence of the landowners - no longer [[boyar]]s after the [[land reform]]). In the process, Cuza also expected financial support from both the Jews and the [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]] - it appears that he kept the latter demand reduced, asking for only 40,000 ''[[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Austrian guilder]]'' (the standard [[gold coin]]s; about [[United States dollar|US$]] 90,000 at the exchange rate of the time) from the two groups. The Armenians discussed the matter with the Jews, but they were not able to come to a satisfactory agreement in the matter.\n\nWhile Cuza was pressing in his demands, the Jewish community debated the method of assessment. The rich Jews, for unclear reasons, refused to advance the money, and the [[middle class]] argued that the sum would not lead to tangible enough results; [[Orthodox Judaism|Religious Jews]] insisted that such rights would only interfere with the exercise of their religion. Cuza, on being informed that the Jews hesitated to pay their share, inserted in his draft of a constitution a clause excluding from the right of suffrage all who did not profess Christianity.\n\n==1860s and 1870s==\nWhen Charles von Hohenzollern succeeded Cuza in 1866 as [[Carol I of Romania]], the first event that confronted him in the capital was a riot against the Jews. A draft of a constitution was then submitted by the government, Article 6 of which declared that \"religion is no obstacle to [[citizenship]]\"; but, \"with regard to the Jews, a special law will have to be framed in order to regulate their admission to [[naturalization]] and also to [[civil rights]]\".<ref>Ornea, p.389; Veiga, p.58-59</ref> On June 30, 1866, the [[Bucharest Synagogue]] was desecrated and demolished (it was rebuilt in the same year, then restored in 1932 and 1945). Many Jews were beaten, maimed, and robbed. As a result, Article 6 was withdrawn and Article 7 was added to the [[1866 Constitution of Romania|1866 Constitution]]; it read that \"only such aliens as are of the Christian faith may obtain citizenship\".\n\n[[File:Nicolae Grigorescu 026.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicolae Grigorescu]]: ''Jew with Goose'' (c. 1880) - a [[Jew|Romanian Jew]] holding a [[petition]] and a goose for [[bribery]].]]\nFor the following decades, the issue of Jewish rights occupied the forefront of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Regat]]'s political scene. With few notable exceptions (including some of ''[[Junimea]]'' affiliates<ref>Panu, p.223-233</ref> &mdash; [[Petre P. Carp]], [[George Panu]], and [[I.L. Caragiale]]), most Romanian [[intellectual]]s began professing [[antisemitism]]; its most virulent form was the one present with advocates of [[Liberalism in Romania|Liberalism]] (in contradiction to their 1848 political roots), especially Moldavians, who argued that Jewish immigration had prevented the rise of an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] [[middle class]]. The first examples of modern prejudice were the Moldavian ''[[Frac\u021biunea liber\u0103 \u0219i independent\u0103]]'' (later blended into the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]], PNL) and the [[Bucharest]] group formed around [[Cezar Bolliac]].<ref>Ornea, p.389; Panu, p.224</ref> Their discourse saw Jews as [[Cultural assimilation|non-assimilated]] and perpetually foreign - this claim was, however, challenged by some contemporary sources,<ref>For example, Panu (p.226) stated that \"the issue of [the Jews'] assimilation or the mere possibility of their assimilation were never mentioned [by antisemites], being considered an impossible occurrence altogether [...]\"; in the 1890s, Caragiale evidenced the paradox in his editorial ''Tr\u0103darea rom\u00e2nismului! Triumful str\u0103inismului!! Consumatum est!!!'', mimicking the tone of Liberals in opposition to the [[Petre P. Carp]] government: \"Yesterday, February 5, '93, yesterday, fateful and cursed day! was voted that anti-social, anti-economical, anti-patriotic, anti-national, anti-Romanian law, that law through which poverty-stricken Jews may no longer be prevented from training in certain careers!\"</ref> and by the eventual acceptance of all immigrants other than Jews.\n\nAntisemitism was carried into the PNL's mainstream, and was officially enforced under the [[Prime Minister of Romania|premierships]] of [[Ion Br\u0103tianu]]. During his first years in office, Br\u0103tianu reinforced and applied old discrimination laws, insisting that Jews were not allowed to settle in the countryside (and relocating those that had done so), while declaring many Jewish urban inhabitants to be [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]] and expelling them from the country. According to the 1905 ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'': \"A number of such Jews who proved their Romanian birth were forced across the Danube, and when [the [[Ottoman Empire]]] refused to receive them, were thrown into the river and drowned. Almost every country in Europe was shocked at these barbarities. The Romanian government was warned by the powers; and Br\u0103tianu was subsequently dismissed from office\". Cabinets formed by the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880-1918)|Conservative Party]], although including ''Junimea'''s leaders, did not do much to improve the Jews' condition - mainly due to PNL opposition.\n\nNonetheless, during this same era, Romania was the cradle of [[Yiddish theatre]]. The Russian-born [[Abraham Goldfaden]] started the first professional Yiddish theatre company in Ia\u0219i in 1876 and for several years, especially during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]] Romania was the home of Yiddish theatre. While its center of gravity would move first to Russia, then [[London]], then [[New York City]], both Bucharest and Ia\u0219i would continue to figure prominently in its history over the next century.<ref>[[Israil Bercovici]], ''O sut\u0103 de ani de teatru evreiesc \u00een Rom\u00e2nia'' (\"One hundred years of Yiddish/Jewish theater in Romania\"), 2nd Romanian-language edition, revised and augmented by Constantin M\u0103ciuc\u0103.

The war was concluded by the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878), which stipulated (Article 44) that the non-Christians in Romania (including both Jews and [[Islam in Romania|Muslims]] in the newly acquired region of [[Northern Dobruja]]) should receive full citizenship. After a prolonged debate at home and diplomatic negotiations abroad, the Romanian government ultimately agreed (1879) to abrogate Article 7 of its constitution. This was, however, reformulated to make procedures very difficult: \"the naturalization of aliens not under foreign protection should in every individual case be decided by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]\" (the action involved, among others, a ten-year term before the applicant was given an evaluation).<ref>Ornea, p.390; Veiga, p.60</ref> The gesture was doubled by a show of compliance - 883 Jews, participants in the war, were naturalized in a body by a vote of both chambers.\n\nFifty-seven persons voted upon as individuals were naturalized in 1880; 6, in 1881; 2, in 1882; 2, in 1883; and 18, from 1886 to 1900; in all, 85 Jews in twenty-one years, 27 of whom in the meantime died; c. 4,000 people had obtained citizenship by 1912.<ref name=\"Ornea, p.391\">Ornea, p.391</ref> Various laws were passed until the pursuit of virtually all careers was made dependent on the possession of political rights, which only Romanians could exercise; more than 40% of Jewish working men, including [[manual labour]]ers, were forced into [[unemployment]] by such legislation.

In the recent election, over 25% of the electorate had voted for explicitly antisemitic groups (either the Goga-Cuza alliance (9%) or the Iron Guard's political mouthpiece, TPT(16.5%)), and as a result, Carol was forced to let one of the two into his cabinet- he instantly chose the Goga-Cuza alliance over the rabid fascism of the Iron Guard (according to modern historian of the Balkans, Misha Glenny, he also thought that this would \"take the sting out of the Guard's tail\").{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} On January 21, 1938, Carol's executive (led by Cuza and [[Octavian Goga]]) passed a law aimed at reviewing criteria for citizenship (after it cast allegations that previous cabinets had allowed [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jews]] to obtain it illegally),<ref name=\"Ornea, p.391\"/> and requiring all Jews who had received citizenship in 1918-1919 to reapply for it (while providing a very short term in which this could be achieved - 20 days);<ref>''Royal Decree'', 1938, art.6</ref>\n\nHowever, Carol II himself was highly hostile to antisemitism. His lover, Elena Lupescu, was Jewish, as were a number of his friends in government, and he soon reverted to his original policies (that is, fiercely opposing the antisemites and fascists), but with a newly violent sting. On February 12, 1938, he used the rising violence between political groups as context to seize absolute power (a move which was tacitly supported by the liberals who had come to view him as a lesser evil in comparison to Codreanu's fascist movement). As an authentic Romanian nationalist (albeit, one who had a view of a Westernized, forcefully industrialized Romania at the expense of the peasants whom he viewed with disdain; making him completely the antithesis of the views of Codreanu), Carol was determined that Romania should not fall into the near-absolute economic and political control that many of its neighbors already had, and moved to theatrical resistance against Nazi ideology.\n\n{{Confusing|reason = Were these fascist leaders brutally killed?|date=January 2016}}The King then arrested the entire leadership of the Iron Guard, on the grounds that they were in the pay of the Nazis, and began using the same accusation against various political opponents, both to solidify his absolute control of the country as well as negatively stigmatize Germany.

The Soviet Union attacked Romania and declared the annexation of Bukovina and Bessarabia (which was to be renamed Moldova), and when Carol turned to the only possible hope - that is, assistance from the former \"eternal foe\", Nazi Germany - he was angrily rejected by [[Hitler]] personally, who did not have to try hard to remember how Carol had previously humiliated the cause of his ideology.

By 1965, Israel was funding agricultural and industrial projects throughout Romania, and in exchange, Romania allowed limited numbers of Jews to emigrate to Israel.\n\nWhen [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] came to power in 1965, he initially ended the trade in deference to the Eastern bloc's Arab allies. However, Romania was the only [[Warsaw Pact]] nation not to break diplomatic relations with Israel after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967,<ref name=\"WP\"/> and by 1969, Ceau\u0219escu decided to exchange Jews for cash from Israel. He wanted economic independence from the [[Soviet Union]], which was content to keep Romania a backwater and as nothing more than a supplier of raw materials, but to fund economic projects, he needed hard cash. As a result, from then until the Ceau\u0219escu regime fell in 1989, about 1,500 Jews a year were granted exit visas to Israel in exchange for a payment of cash for every Jew allowed to leave, in addition to other Israeli aid. The exact payments were determined by the age, education, profession, employment, and family status of the emigrant. Israel paid a minimum of $2,000 per head for every emigrant, and paid prices in the range of $25,000 for doctors or scientists. In addition to these payments, Israel also secured loans for Romania and paid off the interest itself, and supplied the Romanian Army with military equipment.<ref name=forward/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19911024&id=Q4UwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GvwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4950,1122723 |title=Romania Sold Jews to Israel |publisher=News.google.com |date=1991-10-24 |accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref>\n[[File:Evrei Romania (2002).png|thumb|Jews in Romania (2002 census)]]\nAs a result of aliyah, the Romanian-Jewish community was gradually depleted.
