The contract specification defined a modest maximum construction cost and [[building volume]] (50 cubic metres) per student.<ref name=P335>Khan-Magomedov, p.335</ref> Any communal facilities, from staircases to libraries, counted towards the quota and decreased the actual living space. While all architects addressed these constraints by reducing available living space, Nikolaev's proposal was the most radical of all.\n\nNikolaev's principal design rule was a strict physical separation of common study space, public services (with cafeteria, showers and storage rooms) and the living space. Thus the building was H-shaped: a public services block connected a 200-metre long, 8-storey dormitory with a 3-story study block. Since all the students' possessions - from textbooks to day clothing - had to be stored in the lockers of the public services block, Nikolaev reduced dormitory rooms to sleeping space only. Initially, a standard sleeping cabin for two had a very small area, 2\u00d72 metres, but 3.2 metres tall. It had no windows and was connected by the door to a long corridor running along the exterior wall. Nikolaev attempted to compensate for the shortage of space with elaborate [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] system. This proposal seemed too radical even for the Soviet [[Russian avant-garde|avant-garde]], and the cabins were increased to 2,7\u00d72,3 metres with proper windows.<ref name=P336>Khan-Magomedov, p.336</ref> \n[[Image:Nikolaev commune 2008 window bands 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Windows of the dormitory building]]\nThese windows ran the full length of a 200-metre building - narrow continuous bands of glass without apparent structural support; they were only 90 cmhigh (110 cmafter 1968 reconstruction). The residential block relied on a [[steel frame]] structure. Initially Nikolaev designed all load-bearing in steel, but due to metal [[rationing]] he eventually replaced internal floor supports with wooden [[girder]]s. The building had [[elevator]]s, but they were reserved for cargo deliveries only. Instead, the students had to use three spacious staircases - two in the living block and one in the public services building. The latter had an unusual triangular shape, with smooth ramps instead of stairs, as in [[Tsentrosoyuz building|contemporaneous work]] by [[Le Corbusier]]. These staircases are sometimes compared to the spiral ramp of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]].<ref>Machulina</ref>\n\nAccording to Nikolaev, the lives of the students should have been regulated in a nearly military communal fashion. After a common wake-up call all the students proceeded to common physical exercise areas (either a gym in winter or an open area in summer); at this moment the residential block was to be locked until late evening. After exercise, the students took a shower and dressed up in the public service locker rooms; after a breakfast in the canteen they followed their college schedule - either in off-site auditoriums or in the study block facilities. Nikolaev suggested injecting [[ozone]] into ventilation ducts at night and even considered [[Sedative|sedating]] students to ensure they all fall asleep in due time ({{lang-ru|\"\u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0441\u044b\u043f\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043a\"}}, ''\"do not rule out the feasibility of sleepening additives\"'').<ref name=P337s>Khan-Magomedov, p.337, cites verbatim Nikolaev's article in Stroitelstvo Moskvy (''\u0421\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b''), N. 12, 1929</ref> Except for centralized sedation, this paramilitary order was actually maintained in the first years of operation, but later the regulations were eased up.<ref name=P337>Khan-Magomedov, p.337</ref>\n\n==Decay and rehabilitation==\n\nIn 1941 the Textile Institute faculty was evacuated in deep rear, and its classes dissolved; the vacant campus was used by the military. After World War II the campus was taken over by the [[Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys]]; students that returned in 1945 found the building heavily infested by [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbugs]]. Although contemporary architects regard the initial construction quality of the building as quite good for its period,<ref name=ME/> by the 1960s it was falling apart. In 1968 it was renovated by [[Yakov Belopolsky]] under Nikolaev's supervision.<ref name=ME>Merzhanov</ref> The project took care of real-world student needs but was constrained by the existing structure and costs. For example, common toilet rooms located in the extemities of a 200-meter long building were expanded with shower rooms. However, there were still only two such rooms on each floor, and the students living in the center of the building still had to run a hundred meters there and another hundred back. The living cubicles were marginally enlarged at the expense of corridors and acquired larger windows; the ventilation system was, on the contrary, downgraded to less demanding standards.<ref name=S>Sevryukova</ref>\n\nIn the next three decades the building fell into disrepair again. It lost the canopy over main entrance in 1980s and the wraparound balconies in 2006 were torn down for safety reasons.<ref>Zalivako, p.70</ref> The living block was shut down in 1996; all wooden ceilings and partitions inside it were eventually torn down, exposing the steel frame inside an empty concrete shell. The campus nominally still belongs to the Institute of Steel, but the space of the former study and public services blocks is leased piecemeal to unrelated organizations.<ref name=S/> Architectural professionals and the general public were and are well aware of the poor state of the landmark, partly because it is located near the Moscow Architectural Institute dormitory and so became a regular subject of academic studies.<ref name=ME/>\n\nA new rehabilitation plan, supervised by [[Vsevolod Kulish]], Professor of [[Moscow Architectural Institute]], was approved in 2007 with an estimated cost of 600 million [[russian rouble|roubles]] (25 million [[US dollar]]s). According to this plan, the rooms will be enlarged to at least 11 (single student) or 17 (double) square meters, with individual showers and toilets. The study block will be renovated back to the original plans and functions.<ref name=S/> As of March 2008, the rehabilitation is being financed through a specially appropriated federal budget fund.<ref name=ME/>\n\nBy 2017 the renovations have been completed. As of 2019, the public services wing houses a canteen, MISiS research labs, a lecture hall and exhibition space.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{in lang|ru|es}} Khan-Magomedov, S.

Instead, the students had to use three spacious staircases - two in the living block and one in the public services building. The latter had an unusual triangular shape, with smooth ramps instead of stairs, as in [[Tsentrosoyuz building|contemporaneous work]] by [[Le Corbusier]]. These staircases are sometimes compared to the spiral ramp of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]].<ref>Machulina</ref>\n\nAccording to Nikolaev, the lives of the students should have been regulated in a nearly military communal fashion. After a common wake-up call all the students proceeded to common physical exercise areas (either a gym in winter or an open area in summer); at this moment the residential block was to be locked until late evening. After exercise, the students took a shower and dressed up in the public service locker rooms; after a breakfast in the canteen they followed their college schedule - either in off-site auditoriums or in the study block facilities. Nikolaev suggested injecting [[ozone]] into ventilation ducts at night and even considered [[Sedative|sedating]] students to ensure they all fall asleep in due time ({{lang-ru|\"\u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0441\u044b\u043f\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043a\"}}, ''\"do not rule out the feasibility of sleepening additives\"'').<ref name=P337s>Khan-Magomedov, p.337, cites verbatim Nikolaev's article in Stroitelstvo Moskvy (''\u0421\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b''), N. 12, 1929</ref> Except for centralized sedation, this paramilitary order was actually maintained in the first years of operation, but later the regulations were eased up.<ref name=P337>Khan-Magomedov, p.337</ref>\n\n==Decay and rehabilitation==\n\nIn 1941 the Textile Institute faculty was evacuated in deep rear, and its classes dissolved; the vacant campus was used by the military. After World War II the campus was taken over by the [[Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys]]; students that returned in 1945 found the building heavily infested by [[Bed bug (insect)|bedbugs]]. Although contemporary architects regard the initial construction quality of the building as quite good for its period,<ref name=ME/> by the 1960s it was falling apart. In 1968 it was renovated by [[Yakov Belopolsky]] under Nikolaev's supervision.<ref name=ME>Merzhanov</ref> The project took care of real-world student needs but was constrained by the existing structure and costs. For example, common toilet rooms located in the extemities of a 200-meter long building were expanded with shower rooms. However, there were still only two such rooms on each floor, and the students living in the center of the building still had to run a hundred meters there and another hundred back. The living cubicles were marginally enlarged at the expense of corridors and acquired larger windows; the ventilation system was, on the contrary, downgraded to less demanding standards.<ref name=S>Sevryukova</ref>\n\nIn the next three decades the building fell into disrepair again. It lost the canopy over main entrance in 1980s and the wraparound balconies in 2006 were torn down for safety reasons.<ref>Zalivako, p.70</ref> The living block was shut down in 1996; all wooden ceilings and partitions inside it were eventually torn down, exposing the steel frame inside an empty concrete shell. The campus nominally still belongs to the Institute of Steel, but the space of the former study and public services blocks is leased piecemeal to unrelated organizations.<ref name=S/> Architectural professionals and the general public were and are well aware of the poor state of the landmark, partly because it is located near the Moscow Architectural Institute dormitory and so became a regular subject of academic studies.<ref name=ME/>\n\nA new rehabilitation plan, supervised by [[Vsevolod Kulish]], Professor of [[Moscow Architectural Institute]], was approved in 2007 with an estimated cost of 600 million [[russian rouble|roubles]] (25 million [[US dollar]]s). According to this plan, the rooms will be enlarged to at least 11 (single student) or 17 (double) square meters, with individual showers and toilets. The study block will be renovated back to the original plans and functions.<ref name=S/> As of March 2008, the rehabilitation is being financed through a specially appropriated federal budget fund.<ref name=ME/>\n\nBy 2017 the renovations have been completed. As of 2019, the public services wing houses a canteen, MISiS research labs, a lecture hall and exhibition space.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{in lang|ru|es}} Khan-Magomedov, S.

The CAA was formed in 1998 on the base of both the Frunze Military Academy and the Armored Forces Academy. Since 2006, on the basis of decree  No. 473 of the [[Government of Russia]], the Military Institute of the Engineering Troops was included as a structural unit in the reorganization of the V. V. Kuybyshev Military Engineering Academy. In December 2008, its name was expanded to reflect its status as an institution.

Organizationally, academy consists of a command with a management apparatus, a military institute for the engineering troops, 1 branch, faculties, departments, research groups and laboratories, academic courses, doctoral studies, postgraduate studies, units and educational process support services. In all full-time faculties, officers have been trained for 2 years to fill positions in the brigade level.\n\n===Foreign cadets===\nOfficers and cadets of foreign armies are trained at special faculties. The term of their training is the same as that of Russian students and cadets, but preliminary. During the year, some of them study the [[Russian language]] in a preparatory course. The training of foreign military personnel is carried out in Russian practically according to the same plans and programs as Russian military personnel with restrictions in accordance with the specific bilateral and multilateral agreements that are concluded.\n\n===Band===\nBand of the Combined Arms Academy was formed in 1998 from Frunze Military Academy Band and the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy Band. This gives the band an over 85-year history. By order of the Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 19 December 1931, a military band at the Frunze Military Academy was created. The first artistic director of the band was Colonel V. Gurfinkel. During the [[Great Patriotic War]], many musicians of the band as part of the front-line brigades went to the front with concerts for fighters and commanders of the [[Red Army]]. It has performed at the largest concert venues in the capital: including the [[Kremlin Palace of Congresses]], the [[House of the Unions]], and the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall.

The training of foreign military personnel is carried out in Russian practically according to the same plans and programs as Russian military personnel with restrictions in accordance with the specific bilateral and multilateral agreements that are concluded.\n\n===Band===\nBand of the Combined Arms Academy was formed in 1998 from Frunze Military Academy Band and the Malinovsky Military Armored Forces Academy Band. This gives the band an over 85-year history. By order of the Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 19 December 1931, a military band at the Frunze Military Academy was created. The first artistic director of the band was Colonel V. Gurfinkel. During the [[Great Patriotic War]], many musicians of the band as part of the front-line brigades went to the front with concerts for fighters and commanders of the [[Red Army]]. It has performed at the largest concert venues in the capital: including the [[Kremlin Palace of Congresses]], the [[House of the Unions]], and the Tchaikovsky Concert Hall.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley was forced to retreat. Thomas reported back to Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back in disarray, as they had been led to believe. Both Thomas and McCook were concerned about being spread so far apart. After consulting with Thomas, McCook started making plans to shift his corps northward and closer to Thomas\u2019 corps.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps were deployed across the brigade's route back to the mill. The Lightning Brigade was surrounded but the rebels were unsure of its size and strength and hesitated to attack.\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder had brigade build fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 7snd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nJust before the start of the battle, on 18 Spetember, the Lightning Brigade played a crucial role. At Alexander's Bridge to the south, the brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref>,ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Cozzens, p. 15; Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods. \n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]]). On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===[[Battle of Davis's Cross Roads|Davis's Cross Roads]]===\n(September 10\u201311, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Campaign Davis's Cross Roads.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863]]\nBragg intended to attack General James S. Negley's isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army at that location. He ordered the divisions of Thomas Hindman and Patrick Cleburne to concentrate together and launch a joint attack under Hindman's command. Due to delays in conveying orders, Cleburne's division failed to arrive in time on the 10th, while Thomas reinforced the isolated division with the rest of his corps including the Lightning Brigade. After the two divisions were united the next day, they failed to launch a coordinated attack on Thomas' positions and were repulsed.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nJust before the start of the battle, on 18 Spetember, the Lightning Brigade played a crucial role. At Alexander's Bridge to the south, the brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Presented by [[Anthony McPartlin]] and [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially known as [[Ant & Dec]]), it is produced by both [[Thames (production company)|Thames]] (formerly [[Talkback Thames]]) and [[Syco Entertainment]], distributed by [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] every year in late Spring to early Summer. The show premiered on 9 June 2007 following the success of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' the previous year; it was initially planned for 2005, but a dispute between the broadcaster and its originally intended host led to production being suspended for two years.\n\nEvery year, contestants of any age can audition for the televised contest with whatever talent they wish to demonstrate. Auditionees seek to impress a panel of judges - at present, consisting of Simon Cowell, [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], and [[David Walliams]] - in order to secure a place in the live rounds of the contest. Once in the live rounds, participants seek to impress the public and judges to secure votes, in order to reach the final and a chance to win a cash prize and a place within that year's performances for the [[Royal Variety Performance]] before members of the [[British Royal Family]]. {{As of|2019}}, the show has had thirteen winners, ranging from musicians and singers to variety acts, magicians and dancers.\n\nOn average, ''Britain's Got Talent'' draws viewing figures of 9.9&nbsp;million viewers per series \u2013 the show's live final in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|third series]] attracted a record 17.3&nbsp;million viewers, obtaining a 64.6% audience share at the time of its broadcast.<ref name=\"prioryforweeks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/susan-boyle/5434811/Susan-Boyle-could-be-in-Priory-clinic-for-weeks-says-doctor.html|title=Susan Boyle could be in Priory clinic for weeks, says doctor|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> Each series of the main programme is accompanied by a sister show, '''''Britain's Got More Talent''''', presented by [[Stephen Mulhern]]; until October 2019, the programme was aired on [[ITV2]], but has since been moved to online platforms.

To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, [[Fern Britton]] (at the time, presenter of ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''), as well as tabloid journalist [[Piers Morgan]].<ref name=\"Fern Britton\">{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|title=Fern Britton was supposed to be Britain's Got Talent judge|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=13 January 2012|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=28 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234208/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series titled ''[[The Talent Show Story]]'' in January 2012.<ref name=\"Fern Britton\"/>\n\nThe original plan for the show was for it to be aired within 2005\u20132006, before the broadcast of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', with [[Paul O'Grady]] presenting the programme under the title ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent'', after having hosted the pilot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a23450/ogrady-to-host-prime-time-talent-show.html|title=O'Grady to host prime-time talent show|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 August 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=13 August 2005}}</ref> However, complications arose when O'Grady was involved in a row with ITV and refused to appear on another of the broadcaster's programme, eventually defecting to [[Channel 4]] to continue hosting his teatime show and effectively putting plans for the show on hold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|title=Paul O'Grady Quits Simon Cowell's New ITV Show!|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=23 February 2006|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=23 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718090610/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|archivedate=18 July 2007}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, O'Grady commented about the row by stating:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-ogrady-i-gave-up-chance-1691840|title=Paul O'Grady: I gave up chance to host Britain's Got Talent|date=5 September 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I did the pilot for ''Britain's Got Talent'' \u2013 which was originally going to be called ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent''.

I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was no way I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can't be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn 12 February 2007, following the success of ''America's Got Talent'' the previous year, ITV announced their intentions for a British series of ''Got Talent''. Their announcement revealed changes to the original plan for the programme, with [[Ant & Dec]] revealed to be the hosts for the new programme. While Cowell remained as part of the judging panel, the new plan intended for [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Cheryl Cole]]. However, both resigned before the programme was due to air, leading to Morgan being part of the panel as originally planned, and actress [[Amanda Holden]] joining him and Cowell as a judge; Hasselhoff would later join the panel for the programme's [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]] after being a part of the panel for ''America's Got Talent'', while Cowell later employed Cole to be a replacement for [[Sharon Osbourne]] on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. At the same time, the broadcaster also announced that the show would be accompanied by a sister show on [[ITV2]], titled ''Britain's Got More Talent'', with [[Stephen Mulhern]] as its presenter.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nEach year's competition begins with two rounds of auditions. The first round, referred to as \"open auditions\", are held across several different cities around the UK during the Autumn months, within small venues that are attended by the producers. The second round, referred to as the \"Judges' Auditions\", are held the following year during January and February, within a select set of cities - these have commonly included [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]] - and take place within a theatre or convention hall, whose venue is chosen primarily for having the necessary facilities for handling large volumes of contestants - in particular the venue is arranged into three zones consisting of a waiting area for participants, the wings where they enter and leave, and the main stage area that they perform on. The second round's name is due to the fact that these auditions are attended to by the judges, alongside an audience who secure tickets to attend these sessions.\n\nEach participant that seeks to enter that year's competition must first submit an application to the programme, containing information about who is performing - whether a single person, a pair or trio of performers, or a small or large group - personal details regarding age, hometown, and background, what experience they have for their talent, and the nature of the act that will be performed. Eligibility for the contest is determined by what information is submitted for researchers to double-check - such information is required, per the programme's terms and conditions. Once an application is approved, the participant conducts a performance during an open audition close to where they reside (or can reach), whereupon if successful, they will be allocated a place in the second round, and at a venue that they can reach without issue. Once they arrive at the venue they are assigned to, the participant is then given a number, and remains within the venue's designated waiting area until called into the wings to prepare to perform. Once brought onto the main stage, they begin by engaging with the judges, asking a few small questions - subjects can include their name, background, and nature of their performance - whereupon they are given three minutes to conduct their performance; a backing track for their act is allowed if required.\n\nA performance ends when either the time is up, or all the judges use their buzzers - each judge has one that they can use to signal their dislike of the performance if they believe it to be unconvincing, boring, or completely unacceptable for the contest, though a buzzer can be retracted if the judge felt they used it mistakenly, such as if the participant's performance did something unexpected that changed their opinion of them. Once a performance is over, each judge will give an overview of what they thought about the act, before casting a vote. If the contestant(s) receives a majority vote of \"Yes\", they then proceed onto the next stage in the contest, otherwise they are eliminated at that point from the competition. Beginning with the eighth series, judges can also grant an automatic place in the live rounds through the use of the \"Golden Buzzer\" situated on their panel's desk - a feature first introduced on ''[[Germany's Got Talent]]'', which can be used by any of the judges for a participant whose audition was exceptional in their opinion, regardless of the views of the others,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/showbiz-news/2014/02/12/bgt-judges-feeling-a-golden-buzz/|title=BGT judges feeling a golden buzz|date=12 February 2014|work=[[Express & Star]]|publisher=[[Midland News Association]]|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref> although it may only be used once by each judge, and cannot be used again for any other participants yet to audition in that year's competition; the hosts of ''Britain's Got Talent'' may also press the Golden Buzzer for a participant, but must also adhere to the same rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s107/britains-got-talent/news/a544647/britains-got-talent-is-a-golden-buzzer-a-good-idea-vote.html|title=Britain's Got Talent: Is a golden buzzer a good idea? \u2013 vote|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=17 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/ant-and-dec-couldnt-bear-taking-cowells-place-on-bgt-622489.html|title=Ant and Dec 'couldn't bear' taking Cowell's place on BGT|date=12 February 2014|publisher=breakingnews.ie|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nFilming for each series begins during the Judges' Auditions, and always consists of recording taken from each venue of auditions and backstage scenes within the wings and waiting area. Footage taken by production staff is then edited into a series of episodes consisting of montages of scenes from multiple venues, consisting of the most notable auditions - the best, worst, and funniest made - along with interviews with some of the notable participants that auditioned, and recorded backstage scenes of the hosts overseeing the performances from the wings.\n\n===Judges' decisions===\nThis stage takes place after the auditions have been completed, and is also referred to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges look through the acts that have successfully made it to this stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they will progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.\n\nFor the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]], some acts were asked to perform again, as the judges had had difficulty coming to a final decision on the semi-finalist, and thus needed to see their performance again in order to make up their minds; it is the only time in the show's history that this has happened, and has not been repeated since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/253211-britains-got-talent-shock-as-acts-have-to-perform-again-to-get-into-semi-finals/ |title=Britain's Got Talent shock as acts have to perform again to get into semi-finals &#124; TV: Latest News &#124; STV Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.stv.tv |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-finals and Final===\nContestants who make it into the semi-finals by passing both stages of auditions (or receiving a Golden Buzzer, as of series 8), are divided into groups for each round, where they must perform before the audience and judges, as well as on live television. As with the audition stage, each semi-finalist must conduct a performance before the judges - a new routine of their act - with the judges' role being to watch what is conducted and give feedback towards the end of the performance; buzzers may still be used by each judge, and the performance can be ultimately terminated if all buzzers are used. Because all semi-finalists are performing live, they are given time to prepare in advance with rehearsals, while production staff can provide assistance to those in preparing their performance - in the case of those conducting routines that incorporate a level of risk, production staff will ensure precautions are in place, including paramedics, and sometimes set up off-site venues for performances to use either live or for a pre-recorded film for the episode's live broadcast.\n\nEach semi-final can only have two participants advance into the final, and these are determined by two votes. The first is public phone-in vote - via a special phone-number, in which the last two digits correspond to each semi-finalist - that takes place once all semi-finalists have performed and during a break in the semi-final to allow for votes to be made. Once the vote period is ended and the results counted and fully verified, the semi-finalist with the highest total of votes is announced as the winner of the semi-final and secures their place in the final. The second vote involves the judges and takes place after the result, in which they vote between the two semi-finalists placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the public vote, with the participant receiving the majority vote securing their place in the finals; in the case of a tied vote, as of series 5, the semi-finalist placed 2nd in the public vote advances into the final. In addition to these votes, semi-finalists can also secure a place in the finals if chosen as a \"Wildcard\" - introduced in the sixth series, the format allows the judges to choose any eliminated semi-finalist to be appointed as their Wildcard in the finals, through a private vote conducted once the semi-finals are completed; the result of this vote is announced prior to the final's broadcast. The format was later expanded to allow for a Wildcard to be chosen by the public from any eliminated semi-finalist they liked within in the ninth and tenth series respectively, though this format was dropped before the eleventh series.<!-- It is unclear if this will be brought back. Leave as is, and amend if the format returns.-->\n\nThe finals operate in a similar manner to the semi-finals, though all participants in this stage compete primarily to win votes from the public with a new routine; the judges can still buzz and give opinions on the performance they view, but have little impact on the public's voting intention. Once the public vote has been completed, once all finalists have performed, and the votes verified and counted, the hosts announce who is placed as the top two acts of the vote, before revealing the winner who received the most votes from the public. Finalists who win receive a cash prize, and a place in the [[Royal Variety Performance]] later that year.\n\nFor the show's scheduling, the live episodes are usually arranged to take place over the course of a week - semi-finals for each weekday, and the live final aired on the Sunday of the weekend. With the exception of the first two series, the broadcast schedule of live rounds is conducted over two episodes for each - the first focuses on performances, and includes montage clips regarding each participant's background; while the second focuses on the results of the public vote, and, for the semi-finals, the vote by judges, and often include a guest performance taking place prior to the announcement of the results. Until the tenth series, live episodes were broadcast from [[The Fountain Studios]] in [[Wembley]], the same site used for ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', but following its closure in 2016,<ref name=metro160116>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Rebecca |date=16 January 2016 |title=Fountain Studios, home to The X Factor and BGT, sold for \u00a31 |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/16/fountain-studios-home-to-the-x-factor-and-bgt-sold-for-16-million-5627286/ |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref> the show relocated its live episodes to [[Elstree Studios]] in 2017, before moving to [[Hammersmith Apollo]] the following year.\n\n==Judges==\n[[File:HoldenLondon.jpg|thumb|right|Holden is the longest serving judge on the show, only being absent in a few episodes in 2012 due to health reasons.]]\n[[File:David Hasselhof at re-publica May 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Hasselhoff previously worked as a judge on ''America's Got Talent'', before joining the show for the 2011 series.]]\nFor the first four series after the show began in June 2007, the judging panel consisted of music executive and television producer [[Simon Cowell]], television and West End star [[Amanda Holden]], and newspaper editor and journalist [[Piers Morgan]].

In subsequent series, the line-up remained as Cowell, Holden, Walliams and Dixon, with no further incidents except for the eighth series in 2014 - Cowell missed the first day of the Manchester auditions, leading to [[Ant & Dec]] filling in for him, and was also absent for the final day of the London auditions - and the tenth series in 2016 - Cowell was late for an audition, and was temporarily replaced by Walliam's mother Kathleen, who was attending it.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width: 50%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Series\n! colspan=\"4\"|Main Judge\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Guest Judge {{ref|1|1}}\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"  | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| rowspan=\"13\" | [[Simon Cowell]] {{ref|2|2}}\n| rowspan=\"13\" | [[Amanda Holden]]\n| rowspan=4| [[Piers Morgan]]\n| rowspan=4 {{N/A}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{N/A}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 2)|2]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|3]]\n| [[Kelly Brook]] {{ref|3|3}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Britain's Got Talent (series 4)|4]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Louis Walsh]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|5]]\n| rowspan=1| [[Michael McIntyre]]\n| rowspan=1| [[David Hasselhoff]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 6)|6]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" | [[Alesha Dixon]]\n| rowspan=\"8\" | [[David Walliams]]\n| [[Carmen Electra]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 7)|7]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 8)|8]]\n| [[Ant & Dec]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 9)|9]]\n| {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 10)|10]]\n| nowrap | Kathleen Williams\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 11)|11]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{N/A}}\n|-\t\n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 12)|12]]\n|- \n!scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 13)|13]]\n|}\n\t\n;Notes\t\n{{refbegin}}\n#{{note|1}} Guest Judges mainly took the place of another judge during auditions, who were absent during specific sessions for certain reasons (i.e. medical issue).\n#{{note|2}} Cowell was not present for auditions in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]]; he served as a judge for the live shows only.\n#{{note|3}} Brook was credited as a guest judge for this series for the Manchester auditions, after the producers dropped plans for her to be a fourth judge on the programme.\n{{refend}}\n\n==Series overview==\n{{See also|List of Britain's Got Talent episodes|List of Britain's Got Talent finalists}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align:center; font-size:100%; width: 90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:4%; | Series\n! style=\"width:8%; | Start\n! style=\"width:8%; | Finish\n! style=\"width:4%; | Winner's prize {{ref|1|1}} \n! style=\"width:13%; background:gold;\" align=\"center\" | Winner\n! style=\"width:13%; background:silver;\" align=\"center\"| Runner-up\n! style=\"width:13%; background:tan;\" align=\"center\" | Third place\n! style=\"width:10%; | Ave. UK viewers<br />(millions)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Britain's Got Talent (series 1)|1]]\n| {{nowrap|9 June 2007}}\n| {{nowrap|17 June 2007}}\n| rowspan=\"5\"| \u00a3100,000\n| [[Paul Potts]]\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" |{{TableTBA|N/A}}{{ref|2|2}} <!-- DO NOT place results for 2nd and 3rd place for this season - there is no evidence stating who got these positions for this season, other than the winner.

While the show retained the new features introduced in the previous series, the cash prize was reduced to \u00a3250,000, with the series featuring auditions within five cities - Birmingham, London, Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester. The series was won by shadow theatre troupe [[Attraction (shadow theatre group)|Attraction]], with comedian [[Jack Carroll (comedian)|Jack Carroll]] coming in second, and opera duo [[Richard & Adam]] placing third.\n\n===Series 8 (2014)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 8)}}\nThe eighth series aired during 2014, between 12 April to 7 June.

The series was won by boy band [[Collabro]], with opera singer Lucy Kay coming in second, and rapper duo [[Bars & Melody]] placing third.\n\n===Series 9 (2015)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 9)}}\nThe ninth series was aired during 2015, between 11 April to 31 May. This series saw the \"Wildcard\" feature updated; along with the judges being able to put forth an eliminated act from the semi-finals into the final (referred to as the Judges' Wildcard), the show now also allowed the public to vote between the three most popular eliminated acts, with the one with the highest number of votes going forward into the final - this act is referred to as the Public Wildcard. Audition took place within Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, and London, with the latter three cities holding open auditions in late 2014 along with Newcastle, Cardiff, [[Portsmouth]], [[Leeds]], [[Norwich]], and [[Bristol]]. The winner of the series was trainer and dog duo [[Jules O'Dwyer & Matisse]], with magician Jamie Raven coming second, and Welsh choir [[Ysgol Glanaethwy|C\u00f4r Glanaethwy]] placing third.\n\n===Series 10 (2016)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 10)}}\nThe tenth series was aired during 2016, between 9 April to 28 May.

In addition, the live episodes were now broadcast from [[Elstree Studios]], owing to the closure of the previous site. Auditions were held within [[City of Salford|Salford]], Birmingham, London, and Blackpool, with the latter two cities holding open auditions in late 2016, along with Peterborough, Cardiff, Edinburgh, [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], Manchester and [[Luton]].

Following the previous series, the Judges' vote was brought back into the show's format, while the live episodes were aired from [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and presented solely by Declan Donnelly; although Anthony McPartlin had stepped down from his TV commitments in March 2018, he still appeared in the series' audition episodes, which had been filmed during January and February that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-10/declan-donnelly-to-host-britains-got-talent-solo-as-ant-mcpartlin-temporarily-steps-down-from-his-tv-commitments/|title=Declan Donnelly to host Britain's Got Talent solo as Ant McPartlin temporarily 'steps down from his TV commitments'|publisher=}}</ref> Auditions were held within Manchester, Blackpool and London,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/britains-got-talent/344171-britains-got-talent-2018-auditions-judges-audition-dates-venues-tickets.html|title=Britain's Got Talent 2018 auditions: Judges' audition dates, venues, tickets|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> with two of these cities holding open auditions in 2017, alongside a number of locations within the United Kingdom and Ireland, including Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dublin, and Inverness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/britainsgottalent/south-coast-bgt-2018-open-auditions-are-coming-to-a-town-near-you|title=BGT Open Auditions are coming to a town near YOU!|website=ITV.com|date=7 October 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> The series was won by stand-up comedian [[Lee Ridley (comedian)|Lost Voice Guy]], with comedy singer/pianist Robert White coming second, and singer Donchez Dacres placing third.\n\n===Series 13 (2019)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 13)}}\nThe thirteenth series was aired during 2019, between 6 April to 2 June. Following his absence from the previous series' live episodes, Anthony McPartlin made his return to ''Britain's Got Talent'' this year. Auditions were held across the same cities as before, including London and Manchester. This series saw three notable events - the withdrawal of an act from the live semi-finals, despite securing a place through their audition; the surprise return of a participant from a previous series' contest, operating under a veiled alias; and the contest being won by the oldest participant to take part. The series was won by singer Colin Thackery, with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name of \"X\") coming second, and magician Ben Hart placing third.\n\n=== Series 14 (2020) ===\nThe fourteenth series is set to air in two parts, the first in April 2020 consisting of pre-recorded audition episodes, while the second containing the live rounds to be aired at a later date. The decision to split the series into two parts was a result of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] pandemic and the resulting lockdown issued by the British government, which made it inadvisable to host live rounds in a time of uncertainty over health and safety in response to the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/britains-got-talent|title=Britain's Got Talent|website=Press Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Related programmes==\n===''Britain's Got More Talent''===\n[[File:Stephen Mulhern.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Mulhern has been the host of the sister show to ''Britain's Got Talent'', since 2007.]]\n'''''Britain's Got More Talent''''' (often shortened to '''''BGMT''''') is a companion sister show that is aired after each episode of ''Britain's Got Talent'' since the main show began in June 2007. The programme is hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], features appearances by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly along with the judges for the respective year the companion show is aired in, and operates in a similar manner to the former spin off show ''[[The Xtra Factor (UK TV series)|The Xtra Factor]]'' (the companion show of ''The X Factor''). The format, however, depends on what stage of the competition the main show is on - on the auditions stage is being broadcast, its sister show focused on highlights of acts that couldn't be shown on the main show, with Mulhern operating in a similar manner to the main show's hosts, though with interviews with participants before and after their performance; on live episodes, the sister show conducts live \"after-show\" episodes, featuring interviews with the semi-finalists/finalists, as well as chatting with the judges.\n\nThe companion show used to be aired on [[ITV2]] after each episode of the main show's currently aired series, and also included a special set set of compilation episodes featuring the best and worst auditions from that year's contest, titled ''Britain's Got Talent: Best and Worst'', but on 7 October 2019, Simon Cowell announced that ''Britain's Got More Talent'' would be shifted onto online platforms and thus provide more focus towards ''Britain's Got Talent''. The decision was made due to changes in viewing habits from the sister show's target audience.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fans desperate to save Britain\u2019s Got More Talent after spin-off is pulled from TV |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-10-08/britains-got-more-talent-pulled-from-tv/ |accessdate=8 November 2019 |work=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n===''Britain's Got Talent: The Champions''===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent: The Champions}}\nIn 2019, Simon Cowell opted to create a spin-off edition of the contest, following the success of the spin-off for ''America's Got Talent''. His plan was to produce a contest under the same subtitle and format as the American spin-off, focusing on bringing the best talent from across the ''Got Talent'' franchise, many from the British edition, to compete for a cash prize and the title of \"World Champion\" in the British public's opinion. Both the contest and the production of the programme began in Spring of that year, with the spin-off's planned broadcast date announced in the 2019 series finale of ''Britain's Got Talent''.<ref name=\"2019 Spin-off\" /> The spin-off premiered on 31 August 2019, with the contest won by dance act [[Twist and Pulse]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Britain's Got Talent'' has been nominated for a number of [[National Television Awards]] in the category of 'Most Popular Talent Show' since 2007. But has lost out to its sister shows ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. [[Ant and Dec]] have won the award for 'Most Popular Entertainment Presenters' at the same awards for twelve consecutive years (as of January 2014). ''Britain's Got Talent'' has also been nominated for two [[British Academy Television Awards]] in 2008, but failed to win any awards. In 2007 and 2008, the show was nominated at the TV Quick and Choice Awards in the 'Best Talent Show' category, losing out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' respectively.\n\nIn 2008, it was a recipient of a [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Award for its technical achievements. It has also won four [[Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards]] from five nominations. In 2009, it won its first ever Digital Spy Reality Award for [[George Sampson]] for 'Favourite Reality Contestant'. The show was further nominated in the 'Reality Show' category, but lost out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the 'Reality TV Presenter' category for [[Ant & Dec]] and two nominations in the 'Reality TV Judge' category for Cowell and Morgan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2012, electropop band [[Superpowerless]] were approached to appear in the semi-finals. They attended the audition after assurances that the act would be portrayed in a positive light. On the day they felt that all interviews, especially those with Stephen Mulhern, were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light, reducing their act to a novelty/comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation.

The event consisted of several shows held across various UK cities during the Summer months, with site locations including [[Cardiff]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[Belfast]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Nottingham]], [[London]], and [[Manchester]]. When the first live tour, hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], was announced on 17 April 2008, demand for tickets for the thirteen dates set for it was high. This led to an extension in the number of performances for it, increasing the overall number from twelve - the ten finalists from that year's series and two of the semi-finalists, Tracey Lee Collins and Anya Sparks - to twenty two, including matin\u00e9es, and a duet with Faryl Smith and Andrew Johnston. In 2009, Mulhern hosted a new live tour, which initially featured four dates before it was later increased to run for eighteen shows, and included performances by Diversity, Flawless, Aidan Davis, Shaun Smith, Stavros Flatley, Hollie Steel, 2 Grand, Julian Smith, Shaheen Jafargholi, Susan Boyle, Darth Jackson, DJ Talent and the 2008 winner, George Sampson. In 2010, a third live tour was created, featuring a much larger schedule and taking place across 16 cities and 23 shows. It was hosted by comedian [[Paddy McGuinness (comedian)|Paddy McGuinness]], and featured performances by that year's finalists of ''Britain's Got Talent'' - [[Spelbound]], Twist & Pulse, Kieran Gaffney, Tobias Mead, Tina & Chandi, Paul Burling, Christopher Stone, Janey Cutler, Liam McNally and Connected.\n\nIn 2011, a fourth live tour was created. Hosted by Mulhern, it featured performances by the finalists of that year's ''Britain's Got Talent'' - Jai McDowall, Ronan Parke, New Bounce, Razy Gogonea, Michael Collings, Paul Gbegbaje, Steven Hall, James Hobley, Les Gibson and Jean Martyn.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLean |first=Amy |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/entertainment-in-newcastle/theatre/2011/06/13/preview-britain-s-got-talent-tour-opens-in-newcastle-72703-28868474/ |title=Preview: Britain's Got Talent Tour opens in Newcastle \u2013 Theatre & Arts \u2013 Entertainment |publisher=ChronicleLive |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> However ticket sales were drastically reduced due to low interest in the tour was as a result of the financial climate that year.

This means viewers are able to vote free of charge five times per voting window during the semi-finals and final rounds.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*{{itv.com|id=talent|title=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n*{{stv.tv|id=talent|title=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n*{{u.tv|id=talent|title=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n{{col-2}}\n*{{Twitter|name=''Britain's Got Talent''}}\n*{{IMDb title|1034201}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n{{Britain's Got Talent}}\n{{Got Talent}}\n\n[[Category:2000s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:2007 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:Britain's Got Talent| ]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:ITV reality television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n[[Category:Television programmes produced by Thames Television]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc}}\n{{About||the Got Talent international franchise|Got Talent|the spin-off|Britain's Got Talent: The Champions}}\n{{short description|Televised British talent competition series}}\n{{Use British English|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Britain's Got Talent\n| image                    = Britain's Got Talent logo.png\n| genre                    = [[Talent show]]\n| creator                  = [[Simon Cowell]]\n| director                 = Jonathan Bullen\n| presenter                = \n[[Anthony McPartlin]]<br>[[Declan Donnelly]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n| judges                   = {{plainlist| <!-- Please keep in Order of Appearance, and DO NOT include Guest Judges. -->\n* Simon Cowell <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Amanda Holden]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Piers Morgan]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[David Hasselhoff]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Michael McIntyre]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. -->\n* [[Alesha Dixon]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. --> \n* [[David Walliams]] <!-- Per [[Template:Infobox television]], do NOT include years. --> \n}}\n| voices                   = [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]]\n| country                  = United Kingdom\n| language                 = English\n| num_series               = 13\n| num_episodes             = 184 <!-- Amend when new episodes are broadcast.

Presented by [[Anthony McPartlin]] and [[Declan Donnelly]] (colloquially known as [[Ant & Dec]]), it is produced by both [[Thames (production company)|Thames]] (formerly [[Talkback Thames]]) and [[Syco Entertainment]], distributed by [[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]], and broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] every year in late Spring to early Summer. The show premiered on 9 June 2007 following the success of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' the previous year; it was initially planned for 2005, but a dispute between the broadcaster and its originally intended host led to production being suspended for two years.\n\nEvery year, contestants of any age can audition for the televised contest with whatever talent they wish to demonstrate. Auditionees seek to impress a panel of judges - at present, consisting of Simon Cowell, [[Amanda Holden]], [[Alesha Dixon]], and [[David Walliams]] - in order to secure a place in the live rounds of the contest. Once in the live rounds, participants seek to impress the public and judges to secure votes, in order to reach the final and a chance to win a cash prize and a place within that year's performances for the [[Royal Variety Performance]] before members of the [[British Royal Family]]. {{As of|2019}}, the show has had thirteen winners, ranging from musicians and singers to variety acts, magicians and dancers.\n\nOn average, ''Britain's Got Talent'' draws viewing figures of 9.9&nbsp;million viewers per series \u2013 the show's live final in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 3)|third series]] attracted a record 17.3&nbsp;million viewers, obtaining a 64.6% audience share at the time of its broadcast.<ref name=\"prioryforweeks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/susan-boyle/5434811/Susan-Boyle-could-be-in-Priory-clinic-for-weeks-says-doctor.html|title=Susan Boyle could be in Priory clinic for weeks, says doctor|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> Each series of the main programme is accompanied by a sister show, '''''Britain's Got More Talent''''', presented by [[Stephen Mulhern]]; until October 2019, the programme was aired on [[ITV2]], but has since been moved to online platforms.

To showcase his idea, a pilot episode was filmed in September 2005, with the judging panel consisting of Cowell, [[Fern Britton]] (at the time, presenter of ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''), as well as tabloid journalist [[Piers Morgan]].<ref name=\"Fern Britton\">{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|title=Fern Britton was supposed to be Britain's Got Talent judge|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=13 January 2012|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=28 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234208/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/britains-got-talent/fern-britton-was-supposed-to-be-britains-got-talent-judge/|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> The pilot was not broadcast on television until it was shown as part of a documentary series titled ''[[The Talent Show Story]]'' in January 2012.<ref name=\"Fern Britton\"/>\n\nThe original plan for the show was for it to be aired within 2005\u20132006, before the broadcast of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', with [[Paul O'Grady]] presenting the programme under the title ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent'', after having hosted the pilot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a23450/ogrady-to-host-prime-time-talent-show.html|title=O'Grady to host prime-time talent show|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=13 August 2005|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=13 August 2005}}</ref> However, complications arose when O'Grady was involved in a row with ITV and refused to appear on another of the broadcaster's programme, eventually defecting to [[Channel 4]] to continue hosting his teatime show and effectively putting plans for the show on hold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|title=Paul O'Grady Quits Simon Cowell's New ITV Show!|last=McGarry|first=Lisa|date=23 February 2006|publisher=Unreality TV|accessdate=23 February 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718090610/http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/reality-tv/paul-ogrady-quits-simon-cowells-new-itv-show/|archivedate=18 July 2007}}</ref> In a 2010 interview, O'Grady commented about the row by stating:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/paul-ogrady-i-gave-up-chance-1691840|title=Paul O'Grady: I gave up chance to host Britain's Got Talent|date=5 September 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I did the pilot for ''Britain's Got Talent'' \u2013 which was originally going to be called ''Paul O'Grady's Got Talent''.

I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was no way I could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can't be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn 12 February 2007, following the success of ''America's Got Talent'' the previous year, ITV announced their intentions for a British series of ''Got Talent''. Their announcement revealed changes to the original plan for the programme, with [[Ant & Dec]] revealed to be the hosts for the new programme. While Cowell remained as part of the judging panel, the new plan intended for [[David Hasselhoff]] and [[Cheryl Cole]]. However, both resigned before the programme was due to air, leading to Morgan being part of the panel as originally planned, and actress [[Amanda Holden]] joining him and Cowell as a judge; Hasselhoff would later join the panel for the programme's [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]] after being a part of the panel for ''America's Got Talent'', while Cowell later employed Cole to be a replacement for [[Sharon Osbourne]] on ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]''. At the same time, the broadcaster also announced that the show would be accompanied by a sister show on [[ITV2]], titled ''Britain's Got More Talent'', with [[Stephen Mulhern]] as its presenter.\n\n==Format==\n===Auditions===\nEach year's competition begins with two rounds of auditions. The first round, referred to as \"open auditions\", are held across several different cities around the UK during the Autumn months, within small venues that are attended by the producers. The second round, referred to as the \"Judges' Auditions\", are held the following year during January and February, within a select set of cities - these have commonly included [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]], [[Manchester]], [[Birmingham]] and [[London]] - and take place within a theatre or convention hall, whose venue is chosen primarily for having the necessary facilities for handling large volumes of contestants - in particular the venue is arranged into three zones consisting of a waiting area for participants, the wings where they enter and leave, and the main stage area that they perform on. The second round's name is due to the fact that these auditions are attended to by the judges, alongside an audience who secure tickets to attend these sessions.\n\nEach participant that seeks to enter that year's competition must first submit an application to the programme, containing information about who is performing - whether a single person, a pair or trio of performers, or a small or large group - personal details regarding age, hometown, and background, what experience they have for their talent, and the nature of the act that will be performed. Eligibility for the contest is determined by what information is submitted for researchers to double-check - such information is required, per the programme's terms and conditions. Once an application is approved, the participant conducts a performance during an open audition close to where they reside (or can reach), whereupon if successful, they will be allocated a place in the second round, and at a venue that they can reach without issue. Once they arrive at the venue they are assigned to, the participant is then given a number, and remains within the venue's designated waiting area until called into the wings to prepare to perform. Once brought onto the main stage, they begin by engaging with the judges, asking a few small questions - subjects can include their name, background, and nature of their performance - whereupon they are given three minutes to conduct their performance; a backing track for their act is allowed if required.\n\nA performance ends when either the time is up, or all the judges use their buzzers - each judge has one that they can use to signal their dislike of the performance if they believe it to be unconvincing, boring, or completely unacceptable for the contest, though a buzzer can be retracted if the judge felt they used it mistakenly, such as if the participant's performance did something unexpected that changed their opinion of them. Once a performance is over, each judge will give an overview of what they thought about the act, before casting a vote. If the contestant(s) receives a majority vote of \"Yes\", they then proceed onto the next stage in the contest, otherwise they are eliminated at that point from the competition. Beginning with the eighth series, judges can also grant an automatic place in the live rounds through the use of the \"Golden Buzzer\" situated on their panel's desk - a feature first introduced on ''[[Germany's Got Talent]]'', which can be used by any of the judges for a participant whose audition was exceptional in their opinion, regardless of the views of the others,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/entertainment/showbiz-news/2014/02/12/bgt-judges-feeling-a-golden-buzz/|title=BGT judges feeling a golden buzz|date=12 February 2014|work=[[Express & Star]]|publisher=[[Midland News Association]]|accessdate=17 February 2014}}</ref> although it may only be used once by each judge, and cannot be used again for any other participants yet to audition in that year's competition; the hosts of ''Britain's Got Talent'' may also press the Golden Buzzer for a participant, but must also adhere to the same rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s107/britains-got-talent/news/a544647/britains-got-talent-is-a-golden-buzzer-a-good-idea-vote.html|title=Britain's Got Talent: Is a golden buzzer a good idea? \u2013 vote|last=Wightman|first=Catriona|date=17 January 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/ant-and-dec-couldnt-bear-taking-cowells-place-on-bgt-622489.html|title=Ant and Dec 'couldn't bear' taking Cowell's place on BGT|date=12 February 2014|publisher=breakingnews.ie|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nFilming for each series begins during the Judges' Auditions, and always consists of recording taken from each venue of auditions and backstage scenes within the wings and waiting area. Footage taken by production staff is then edited into a series of episodes consisting of montages of scenes from multiple venues, consisting of the most notable auditions - the best, worst, and funniest made - along with interviews with some of the notable participants that auditioned, and recorded backstage scenes of the hosts overseeing the performances from the wings.\n\n===Judges' decisions===\nThis stage takes place after the auditions have been completed, and is also referred to as Deliberation Day, in which the judges look through the acts that have successfully made it to this stage, and begin whittling them down to those who would stand a fair chance in the live semi-finals. The amount that goes through has varied over the show's history, though usually consists of a number that can be divided equally over the semi-finals being held in a series. Once the judges have decided on who will go through, all contestants that have reached this stage are called back to discover if they will progress into the live semi-finals or not. After this has been done, the acts are divided up between the semi-finals that the series will have; usually eight in each series, except for the sixth to tenth series which had nine acts per semi-final.\n\nFor the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]], some acts were asked to perform again, as the judges had had difficulty coming to a final decision on the semi-finalist, and thus needed to see their performance again in order to make up their minds; it is the only time in the show's history that this has happened, and has not been repeated since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/253211-britains-got-talent-shock-as-acts-have-to-perform-again-to-get-into-semi-finals/ |title=Britain's Got Talent shock as acts have to perform again to get into semi-finals &#124; TV: Latest News &#124; STV Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.stv.tv |date=29 May 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Semi-finals and Final===\nContestants who make it into the semi-finals by passing both stages of auditions (or receiving a Golden Buzzer, as of series 8), are divided into groups for each round, where they must perform before the audience and judges, as well as on live television. As with the audition stage, each semi-finalist must conduct a performance before the judges - a new routine of their act - with the judges' role being to watch what is conducted and give feedback towards the end of the performance; buzzers may still be used by each judge, and the performance can be ultimately terminated if all buzzers are used. Because all semi-finalists are performing live, they are given time to prepare in advance with rehearsals, while production staff can provide assistance to those in preparing their performance - in the case of those conducting routines that incorporate a level of risk, production staff will ensure precautions are in place, including paramedics, and sometimes set up off-site venues for performances to use either live or for a pre-recorded film for the episode's live broadcast.\n\nEach semi-final can only have two participants advance into the final, and these are determined by two votes. The first is public phone-in vote - via a special phone-number, in which the last two digits correspond to each semi-finalist - that takes place once all semi-finalists have performed and during a break in the semi-final to allow for votes to be made. Once the vote period is ended and the results counted and fully verified, the semi-finalist with the highest total of votes is announced as the winner of the semi-final and secures their place in the final. The second vote involves the judges and takes place after the result, in which they vote between the two semi-finalists placed 2nd and 3rd respectively in the public vote, with the participant receiving the majority vote securing their place in the finals; in the case of a tied vote, as of series 5, the semi-finalist placed 2nd in the public vote advances into the final. In addition to these votes, semi-finalists can also secure a place in the finals if chosen as a \"Wildcard\" - introduced in the sixth series, the format allows the judges to choose any eliminated semi-finalist to be appointed as their Wildcard in the finals, through a private vote conducted once the semi-finals are completed; the result of this vote is announced prior to the final's broadcast. The format was later expanded to allow for a Wildcard to be chosen by the public from any eliminated semi-finalist they liked within in the ninth and tenth series respectively, though this format was dropped before the eleventh series.<!-- It is unclear if this will be brought back. Leave as is, and amend if the format returns.-->\n\nThe finals operate in a similar manner to the semi-finals, though all participants in this stage compete primarily to win votes from the public with a new routine; the judges can still buzz and give opinions on the performance they view, but have little impact on the public's voting intention. Once the public vote has been completed, once all finalists have performed, and the votes verified and counted, the hosts announce who is placed as the top two acts of the vote, before revealing the winner who received the most votes from the public. Finalists who win receive a cash prize, and a place in the [[Royal Variety Performance]] later that year.\n\nFor the show's scheduling, the live episodes are usually arranged to take place over the course of a week - semi-finals for each weekday, and the live final aired on the Sunday of the weekend. With the exception of the first two series, the broadcast schedule of live rounds is conducted over two episodes for each - the first focuses on performances, and includes montage clips regarding each participant's background; while the second focuses on the results of the public vote, and, for the semi-finals, the vote by judges, and often include a guest performance taking place prior to the announcement of the results.

Following the previous series, the Judges' vote was brought back into the show's format, while the live episodes were aired from [[Hammersmith Apollo]] and presented solely by Declan Donnelly; although Anthony McPartlin had stepped down from his TV commitments in March 2018, he still appeared in the series' audition episodes, which had been filmed during January and February that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2018-04-10/declan-donnelly-to-host-britains-got-talent-solo-as-ant-mcpartlin-temporarily-steps-down-from-his-tv-commitments/|title=Declan Donnelly to host Britain's Got Talent solo as Ant McPartlin temporarily 'steps down from his TV commitments'|publisher=}}</ref> Auditions were held within Manchester, Blackpool and London,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tellymix.co.uk/reality-tv/britains-got-talent/344171-britains-got-talent-2018-auditions-judges-audition-dates-venues-tickets.html|title=Britain's Got Talent 2018 auditions: Judges' audition dates, venues, tickets|date=16 December 2017|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> with two of these cities holding open auditions in 2017, alongside a number of locations within the United Kingdom and Ireland, including Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Dublin, and Inverness.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/britainsgottalent/south-coast-bgt-2018-open-auditions-are-coming-to-a-town-near-you|title=BGT Open Auditions are coming to a town near YOU!|website=ITV.com|date=7 October 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}</ref> The series was won by stand-up comedian [[Lee Ridley (comedian)|Lost Voice Guy]], with comedy singer/pianist Robert White coming second, and singer Donchez Dacres placing third.\n\n===Series 13 (2019)===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent (series 13)}}\nThe thirteenth series was aired during 2019, between 6 April to 2 June. Following his absence from the previous series' live episodes, Anthony McPartlin made his return to ''Britain's Got Talent'' this year. Auditions were held across the same cities as before, including London and Manchester. This series saw three notable events - the withdrawal of an act from the live semi-finals, despite securing a place through their audition; the surprise return of a participant from a previous series' contest, operating under a veiled alias; and the contest being won by the oldest participant to take part. The series was won by singer Colin Thackery, with mentalist Marc Spelmann (under the stage name of \"X\") coming second, and magician Ben Hart placing third.\n\n=== Series 14 (2020) ===\nThe fourteenth series is set to air in two parts, the first in April 2020 consisting of pre-recorded audition episodes, while the second containing the live rounds would be aired at a later date. The decision to split the series into two parts was a result of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] pandemic and the resulting lockdown issued on the United Kingdom by the British government, which made it inadvisable to host live rounds in a time of uncertainty over health and safety in response to the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/britains-got-talent|title=Britain's Got Talent|website=Press Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Related programmes==\n===''Britain's Got More Talent''===\n[[File:Stephen Mulhern.jpg|thumb|right|Stephen Mulhern has been the host of the sister show to ''Britain's Got Talent'', since 2007.]]\n'''''Britain's Got More Talent''''' (often shortened to '''''BGMT''''') is a companion sister show that is aired after each episode of ''Britain's Got Talent'' since the main show began in June 2007. The programme is hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], features appearances by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly along with the judges for the respective year the companion show is aired in, and operates in a similar manner to the former spin off show ''[[The Xtra Factor (UK TV series)|The Xtra Factor]]'' (the companion show of ''The X Factor''). The format, however, depends on what stage of the competition the main show is on - on the auditions stage is being broadcast, its sister show focused on highlights of acts that couldn't be shown on the main show, with Mulhern operating in a similar manner to the main show's hosts, though with interviews with participants before and after their performance; on live episodes, the sister show conducts live \"after-show\" episodes, featuring interviews with the semi-finalists/finalists, as well as chatting with the judges.\n\nThe companion show used to be aired on [[ITV2]] after each episode of the main show's currently aired series, and also included a special set set of compilation episodes featuring the best and worst auditions from that year's contest, titled ''Britain's Got Talent: Best and Worst'', but on 7 October 2019, Simon Cowell announced that ''Britain's Got More Talent'' would be shifted onto online platforms and thus provide more focus towards ''Britain's Got Talent''. The decision was made due to changes in viewing habits from the sister show's target audience.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fans desperate to save Britain\u2019s Got More Talent after spin-off is pulled from TV |url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-10-08/britains-got-more-talent-pulled-from-tv/ |accessdate=8 November 2019 |work=Radio Times}}</ref>\n\n===''Britain's Got Talent: The Champions''===\n{{main|Britain's Got Talent: The Champions}}\nIn 2019, Simon Cowell opted to create a spin-off edition of the contest, following the success of the spin-off for ''America's Got Talent''. His plan was to produce a contest under the same subtitle and format as the American spin-off, focusing on bringing the best talent from across the ''Got Talent'' franchise, many from the British edition, to compete for a cash prize and the title of \"World Champion\" in the British public's opinion. Both the contest and the production of the programme began in Spring of that year, with the spin-off's planned broadcast date announced in the 2019 series finale of ''Britain's Got Talent''.<ref name=\"2019 Spin-off\" /> The spin-off premiered on 31 August 2019, with the contest won by dance act [[Twist and Pulse]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Britain's Got Talent'' has been nominated for a number of [[National Television Awards]] in the category of 'Most Popular Talent Show' since 2007. But has lost out to its sister shows ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''. [[Ant and Dec]] have won the award for 'Most Popular Entertainment Presenters' at the same awards for twelve consecutive years (as of January 2014). ''Britain's Got Talent'' has also been nominated for two [[British Academy Television Awards]] in 2008, but failed to win any awards. In 2007 and 2008, the show was nominated at the TV Quick and Choice Awards in the 'Best Talent Show' category, losing out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' respectively.\n\nIn 2008, it was a recipient of a [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Award for its technical achievements. It has also won four [[Nickelodeon UK Kids' Choice Awards]] from five nominations. In 2009, it won its first ever Digital Spy Reality Award for [[George Sampson]] for 'Favourite Reality Contestant'. The show was further nominated in the 'Reality Show' category, but lost out to ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in the 'Reality TV Presenter' category for [[Ant & Dec]] and two nominations in the 'Reality TV Judge' category for Cowell and Morgan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Have a children's show, ''British Children Have Talent''.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Cowell responded to Forsyth, stating that: \"someone, Mr Grumpy, said we shouldn't have children your age on the show\", after the performance of dance troupe Youth Creation.<ref name=\"Jessie J\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-voice-judge-jessie-j-slams-britains-got-talent-for-allowing-children-to-audition-8640591.html |title=The Voice judge Jessie J slams Britain's Got Talent for allowing children to audition |last=O'Brien |first=Liam |date=1 June 2013 |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> [[Jessie J]] joined the debate, declaring: \"I cannot agree with kids having to go through three or four auditions when it's purely for ridicule.

In 2012, electropop band [[Superpowerless]] were approached to appear in the semi-finals. They attended the audition after assurances that the act would be portrayed in a positive light. On the day they felt that all interviews, especially those with Stephen Mulhern, were conducted in a manner intending to portray them in a negative light, reducing their act to a novelty/comedy routine intended for ridicule and humiliation. While many newspapers wrote articles on this topic, very few were published as the news outlets were told that running the story would cut that publication out of any advance coverage of the show in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2013/04/16/britains-got-bullies-bgts-war-on-nerds/|title=Britain's Got Bullies \u2013 BGT's War on Nerds|work=MCM BUZZ \u2013 Movies, TV, Comics, Gaming, Anime, Cosplay News & Reviews}}</ref>\n\n==Live tour==\nBetween 2008 and 2011, several of the show's semi-finalists, finalists, and winners from various series, took part in a live tour titled \"Britain's Got Talent Tour\". The event consisted of several shows held across various UK cities during the Summer months, with site locations including [[Cardiff]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[Belfast]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Nottingham]], [[London]], and [[Manchester]]. When the first live tour, hosted by [[Stephen Mulhern]], was announced on 17 April 2008, demand for tickets for the thirteen dates set for it was high. This led to an extension in the number of performances for it, increasing the overall number from twelve - the ten finalists from that year's series and two of the semi-finalists, Tracey Lee Collins and Anya Sparks - to twenty two, including matin\u00e9es, and a duet with Faryl Smith and Andrew Johnston. In 2009, Mulhern hosted a new live tour, which initially featured four dates before it was later increased to run for eighteen shows, and included performances by Diversity, Flawless, Aidan Davis, Shaun Smith, Stavros Flatley, Hollie Steel, 2 Grand, Julian Smith, Shaheen Jafargholi, Susan Boyle, Darth Jackson, DJ Talent and the 2008 winner, George Sampson. In 2010, a third live tour was created, featuring a much larger schedule and taking place across 16 cities and 23 shows. It was hosted by comedian [[Paddy McGuinness (comedian)|Paddy McGuinness]], and featured performances by that year's finalists of ''Britain's Got Talent'' - [[Spelbound]], Twist & Pulse, Kieran Gaffney, Tobias Mead, Tina & Chandi, Paul Burling, Christopher Stone, Janey Cutler, Liam McNally and Connected.\n\nIn 2011, a fourth live tour was created. Hosted by Mulhern, it featured performances by the finalists of that year's ''Britain's Got Talent'' - Jai McDowall, Ronan Parke, New Bounce, Razy Gogonea, Michael Collings, Paul Gbegbaje, Steven Hall, James Hobley, Les Gibson and Jean Martyn.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLean |first=Amy |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/entertainment-in-newcastle/theatre/2011/06/13/preview-britain-s-got-talent-tour-opens-in-newcastle-72703-28868474/ |title=Preview: Britain's Got Talent Tour opens in Newcastle \u2013 Theatre & Arts \u2013 Entertainment |publisher=ChronicleLive |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref> However ticket sales were drastically reduced due to low interest in the tour was as a result of the financial climate that year.

Biwott served as a civil servant, Member of Parliament and government minister, during which time he held eight senior ministerial positions during the presidency of [[Daniel arap Moi]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nBiwott was born in Chebior village, [[Keiyo District]], [[Rift Valley Province]], Kenya in 1940 to Cheserem Soti, a market trader and cattle herder in [[Eldoret]], and Maria Soti. He attended Tambach Intermediate School from 1951 to 1954, after which he joined [[Kapsabet High School]].\n\nAfter finishing secondary school in 1959, Biwott began working at the Department of Information in [[Eldoret]], after which he published the [[Kalenjin monthly]] newsletter with Kendagor Bett.\n\nHe attended the [[University of Melbourne]], [[Australia]], from 1962 to 1964, where he took a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[Economics]] and [[Political Science]], as well as a [[Diploma]] in [[Public Administration]].\n\nBiwott then served as a District Officer in [[Nkubu]] in the South Imenti Division of [[Meru District]] from 1964 to 1965, returning to the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1966 to study for a [[Masters Degree]] in [[Economics]] under a [[Commonwealth scholarship]].\n\n==Political career==\n\nBiwott was a member of parliament for 28 years. In 1974 he ran unsuccessfully as a prospective MP for the Keiyo South Constituency. At the next election in 1979 he was successful, standing on KANU ticket in Keiyo-Marakwet, retaining the seat in 1983 and 1988. In 1992, 1997, and 2002 he was elected the MP for Keiyo South Constituency. In the Parliamentary elections held on 27 December 2007, running on a KANU ticket, he lost his seat to Jackson Kiptanui arap Kamai of the Orange Democratic Party (ODM). The ODM swept to victory in all but one of KANU's seats on the Rift Valley.\n\nFollowing the 2002 election, Biwott served on the Devolution Committee of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission. Biwott was the only Member of Parliament who abstained on the Constitutional Referendum held in 2005, stating that the Draft Constitution 'would divide the country along ethnic lines'. The draft Constitution was rejected at the Referendum.\n\nMore recently, Biwott has fought an election for leadership of KANU, the former party of government and now the official opposition, following years of decline in KANU political fortunes but lost the post to Uhuru Kenyatta following a decision by the Kenyan High Court.\n\n==Service in government of Kenya==\n\n===District Officer===\n\nBiwott entered government service in 1965 as the District Officer in South [[Imenti]] and [[Tharaki]], [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]] District (Jan 1965\u201366). As District Officer Biwott instituted, on a 'harrambe' basis, community fund-raising programmes to aid the development of local irrigation projects and roads, to build a health centre at Nkwene and schools at [[Nkubu]] and [[Kanyakini]], develop employment at the [[Egoji]] quarries and promote the planting of coffee and tea. He was also actively involved in the resettlement of previously European owned land through the 'Land Transfer' programme, part of the 'Million Acres' scheme, and played a central role in the rehabilitation of the [[Mau Mau]], many of whom still remained in the Mau Forest four years after the end of the 'Emergency', helping to persuade them to give up violence and organising the resettlement of many on to their own land.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ministry of Agriculture===\n\nHaving completed his master's degree in Australia in 1968, Nicholas Biwott returned to public service in the Ministry of Agriculture, GOK, Personal Assistant to Minister Bruce MacKenzie (1968\u201370). He coordinated cereal production, the marketing of cereal crops and the management of the Ministry's fertiliser policy, and helped develop research into new strains of wheat and maize more suited to the growing conditions in Kenya. He played a similar co-ordinating role for the Ministry's work with the East African Council of Ministers (MacKenzie was also a member of the Council), guiding Kenya's policy in the region in the development of ports, railways and the East African Airways.\n\n===Treasury===\n\nIn 1971 Nicholas Biwott moved to the Treasury as Senior Secretary under the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Mwai Kibaki. In 1972 he created and headed the External Aid Division and technical assistance program dealing with external resources, bringing in experts and arranging cultural exchanges. Notably he helped facilitate the establishment of the French School in Nairobi (now called the Lycee Denis Diderot), the French Cultural Centre with the Alliance de Francais, and the German Friederich Ebert Stiftung Foundation in co-operation with the Goethe Institut.\n\n===Ministry of Home Affairs===\n\nIn late 1972 Nicholas Biwott transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs on the personal recommendation of President Kenyatta to work with his Vice-President and the Minister of Home Affairs, Daniel arap Moi.\n\nIn 1974 Biwott stood as a candidate for the Keiyo South constituency in the general election of that year but was narrowly defeated.\n\nFollowing the 1974 election Nicholas Biwott was recalled to the Ministry of Home Affairs as Under Secretary (1974\u201378) to Minister Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's Vice-President. With the ageing President Kenyatta unable to fulfil all the functions of the presidency, Moi took a leading role in the East African region with the result that Nicholas Biwott spent much of the next four years dealing with the [[Organisation of African Unity]], the Commonwealth, the 'non-aligned' states and promoting the 'good neighbourliness' policy with states bordering Kenya.\n\nKenyatta's death in 1978 saw Daniel arap Moi elevated to the presidency and Nicholas Biwott promoted to Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Office of the President<ref>[http://www.statehousekenya.go.ke/hist/1979.htm Statehousekenya.go.ke], Minister of State 1978\u201379</ref> (1978\u201379).\n\n===Minister of State===\n\nFollowing the election of 1979 (in which he was elected Member of Parliament for [[Keiyo South Constituency|1979 Keiyo South election]], a seat he retained until December 2007), Nicholas Biwott returned to the Office of the President but now promoted to Minister of State (1979\u201382) with responsibility for science and technology, cabinet affairs, land settlement and immigration.\n\nUnder his auspices the Kenya Medical Research Institute<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kemri.org/|title=HOME|website=www.kemri.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-12}}</ref> was established in the same year to carry out health science research in Kenya. (Now in its 31st year, KEMRI continues its work as \"a leading centre of excellence in the promotion of quality health\").\n\n===Minister of Regional Development, Science and Technology===\n\nIn September 1982 he was appointed Minister of Regional Development, Science and Technology. Learning from examples of other regional development policies, notably in Australia and Tennessee in the US, he created two regional development authorities, the Lake Basin Development Authority and the Kerio Valley Development Authority.\n\n===Minister of Energy===\n\nIn September 1983, Nicholas Biwott was made Minister of Energy and Regional Development and in March 1988 (following a reorganisation of ministry portfolios) he became Minister of Energy, a post he held until January 1991.\n\nOver the next seven years he was instrumental in establishing the National Oil Corporation, the building of National Oil storage facilities near Nairobi and connecting them to the Mombasa refinery, and extending the pipeline from Nairobi to [[Kisumu]] and [[Eldoret]]. This period that saw rapid advances in efforts to improve Kenya's electricity supply and delivery with a rural electrification programme, work beginning on the Sondu Miriu Dam, and the completions of the Masinga Multi Purpose Dam, the [[Kiambere]] Hydro Electric Dam and the Turkwell Hydro Electric Multi Purpose Dam.\n\n===Minister of East African and Regional Co-operation===\n\nAlthough he remained a member of parliament, Biwott held no position in the Government of Kenya from 1991 until he re-entered government as Minister of State in the Office of the President of East Africa in 1997 before, in January 1998, he established and was appointed Minister of the new Ministry of East African and Regional Co-operation (1998\u201399).\n\nNicholas Biwott played a central role in COMESA \u2014 the Common Market for East and Central Africa, co-ordinating with COMESA partner Ministers legislation for an East African Road network, legislation for an East African Legislative Assembly, and becoming Chairman of both COMESA and of the East Africa Council of Ministers.\n\n===Minister of Trade and Industry, Tourism and East African Cooperation===\n\nIn September 1999 Biwott's ministerial portfolio was expanded when he became Minister of Trade and Industry, Tourism and East African Cooperation (1999\u20132001), a post he held for the next three years during which he established a Tourist Trust Fund<ref>[http://www.ttfkenya.org Tourist Trust Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120919151835/http://www.ttfkenya.org/ |date=19 September 2012 }}</ref> with the [[European Union]], set up the Tourist Police and re-introduced the East Africa Safari Rallies.\n\nBiwott's promotion of Kenyan tourism met with some praise. He was variously described as \"the hardest working minister of tourism Kenya has ever had\"<ref>[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000604mag-kenya.html ''New York Times''] magazine, June 2004</ref> and as \"the best minister of tourism in 25 years\".<ref>[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000604mag-kenya.html Mahmud Jan Mohamed], Chairman of Kenya Tourism Federation, quoted in ''New York Times'' magazine, June 2004</ref>\n\nIn May 2001 (following a further reorganisation of Ministry responsibilities) Nicholas Biwott continued as the Minister of Trade and Industry and East African Tourism (2001\u201302). Over the next eighteen months he established the Small Medium Trade Trust Fund with the European Union, introduced an Intellectual Property bill which was passed as an Act, accomplished a free trade area with COMESA, established the Africa Trade Insurance Agency<ref>[http://www.issafrica.org/AF/RegOrg/unity_to_union/pdfs/comesa/11commay01.pdf African Trade Insurance Agency]</ref> to cover foreign investments against political risk, and served as Chairman of the African Caribbean Pacific Group (ACP) at the [[World Trade Organization]].\n\n==Businessman==\n\nBiwott led an active business life and was regarded as one of Kenya's most successful entrepreneurs.\n\nAs a teenager in the late 1950s Biwott worked alongside his father who had established a successful fruit and vegetable business in Eldoret. The young Biwott also borrowed small amounts of money from a local bank with which to expand his own business sideline selling meat products and eggs. Nicholas Biwott continued to expand his own business and in the late 1960s formed ABC Foods selling food and animal feed products.\n \nWithin a few years Nicholas Biwott was able to invest in farms and businesses, taking advantage of the post-independence banking policies at the time by which Kenyans were granted loans on favourable terms. In 1969, aged 29, Biwott purchased the Eldoret Town International Harvester (IH) dealership (now FMD trading as Lima Ltd). He also purchased a dairy farm in the same year, started an importer exporter business in 1972, purchased two wheat farms in 1974, invested in the sole agency for IH in Kenya for agricultural tractors and implements in 1975, and purchased a local air operator in 1977 (now Air Kenya).\n\nBiwott's business philosophy of purchasing small or failing businesses, investing and re-investing in them over many years, appears to have paid dividends. He is now regarded as one of Kenya's wealthiest businessmen.\n\nBiwott's businesses in Kenya employ thousands of people and one company of which he is the major shareholder, has for many years been listed among Kenya's top 10 corporate taxpayers.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nMr Biwott supported a number of projects in the areas of education, health and medicine, and assisting small businesses. In 2008 he established the Mbegu Trust 'to develop education and opportunity in Kenya'.<ref>[http://www.mbegutrust.org The Mbegu Trust]</ref>\n\nNicholas Biwott raised and contributed funds for the building of a number of schools, and hospitals in Keiyo.<ref>A full list can be found [http://www.nicholasbiwott.com/nicholas-biwott-biography/ here]</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\n\nNicholas Biwott's name has been raised, \u2018perhaps unfairly \u2019<ref>{{cite web|last=Phombeah |first=Gray |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4490163.stm |title=Africa &#124; Nicholas Biwott: Kenya's comeback king |publisher=BBC News |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> by his detractors both inside and outside Kenya regarding several controversies all which have date their origins to the years 1990\u201391. His supporters maintain that the allegations, none of which have ever been proved, arose from the campaign at the time to introduce multi-party democracy in Kenya coupled with Biwott's association with President Moi.\n\nBiwott was named by [[Scotland Yard]] detective [[John Troon]] as a person of interest in the 1990 murder of Kenya's Foreign Affairs minister [[Robert Ouko (politician)|Robert Ouko]]. Troon's theories and the basis for them as to the motives for the murder have since been criticised.\n\nTen government officials, including Biwott, were held in police custody for questioning for two weeks in November 1991<ref>{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=880|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko?..and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}</ref> but a Kenyan Police investigation concluded that there was no 'evidence to support the allegations that Biwott was involved in the disappearance and subsequent death of the late minister Dr. Robert John Ouko'.<ref>Kenya Police, Report on Further Investigations into the Disappearance and Subsequent Death of the Late Hon. Dr Robert John Ouko</ref>\n\nIn December 2003, Biwott issued a formal complaint against New Scotland Yard through his lawyer on the basis that Troon's investigation was 'fundamentally flawed and, in many cases erroneous' and called on New Scotland Yard 'to investigate Troon' and to issue an apology. The request was ultimately turned down in December 2004 by the Metropolitan Police as the original investigation 'did not involve any UK \"victim\", potential suspect, or even witnesses', and because 'the resources of the Metropolitan Police are limited'. Another reason given for the refusal by the Metropolitan Police to review the case was that the Kenyan Parliamentary Select Committee was investigating the death of Dr Robert Ouko and that it was 'open to Mr Biwott to make any representations he wishes to that Inquiry'. The Select Committee's proceedings, however, were abruptly terminated as Nicholas Biwott began to give his testimony.<ref>{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=901|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko?..and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}</ref>\n\nTo date, the allegation that Biwott was involved in the murder of Dr Robert Ouko has never been factually substantiated. In a recent broadcast (March 2017) Episode Six \"Lingering Doubts and Further Investigations\" it is explained why the allegations against Nicholas Biwott were false, and summarise \"It may be a hard truth for many Kenyans to swallow, but Nicholas Biwott clearly had no involvement in the murder of [[Robert Ouko (politician)|Robert Ouko]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=895|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko? ...and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, a Nairobi court awarded Mr Biwott record damages of Sh30 million arising from a case in which he sued a British journalist, Chester Stern, and others for linking him to the Ouko murder in a book entitled 'Dr Iain West's Casebook'. Chester Stern and the book's publishers, Little Brown, stated that they would \"vigorously defend\" the action but ultimately they did not do so and the case was uncontested.<ref>[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/559672/-/u3td4x/-/index.html \u2018It\u2019s Our Turn to Eat\u2019 now in electronic bookshop] ''Daily Nation''</ref> Earlier Biwott won Sh10 : million from Bookpoint, a popular Nairobi bookshop, for stocking copies of the book ''Dr Ian West's Casebook''.\n\nIn 1993 the 'Goldenberg scandal' came to light in which the Kenyan government was found to have subsidised exports of gold by paying a company, Goldenberg International Ltd (GIL), 35 percent more (in Kenyan shillings) than the foreign currency earnings supposedly derived from the sale of gold. The scheme had begun in 1991 and is estimated to have cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10 percent of its annual Gross Domestic Product. A Commission of Inquiry headed by Mr Justice Bosire reported its findings in October 2005 stating that Sh158.3 billion [$2.1 billion] of Goldenberg money had been transacted through 487 companies and individuals. 1,559 'Adverse Notices' were issued against companies and individuals but although Nicholas Biwott was included on that list he was only mentioned directly or indirectly in three of the reports 847 paragraphs and the report, together with subsequent revelations would seem to absolve Biwott of any involvement in the scandal.\n\nThe Report of the Judicial Commission of Enquiry into the Goldenberg Affair (to which Nicholas Biwott was not summoned to appear) states  that Lima Limited, of which Biwott was shareholder and director, was 'said (to) have received Kshs.6,300,000.00 [$84,000] from GIL'. However, it was subsequently revealed that the payment to Lima Ltd, a company that sold farm machinery and equipment, was made not from GIL but by Tandui Estates Ltd for the purchase of farm equipment, including a number of tractors and other machinery.<ref>[http://www.kenyadocex.com/wiki/report-of-the-judicial-commission-of-inquiry-into-the-goldenberg-affair-para-511/ states on para 511]</ref> Paragraph 693 of the same report mentions Biwott in conjunction with a payment of KShs. 6,000,000 [$80,000], which involved Trade Bank Ltd, Pan-African Bank Ltd and Liabilities of H.Z. & Co.

Biwott served as a civil servant, Member of Parliament and government minister, during which time he held eight senior ministerial positions during the presidency of [[Daniel arap Moi]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nBiwott was born in Chebior village, [[Keiyo District]], [[Rift Valley Province]], Kenya in 1940 to Cheserem Soti, a market trader and cattle herder in [[Eldoret]], and Maria Soti. He attended Tambach Intermediate School from 1951 to 1954, after which he joined [[Kapsabet High School]].\n\nAfter finishing secondary school in 1959, Biwott began working at the Department of Information in [[Eldoret]], after which he published the [[Kalenjin monthly]] newsletter with Kendagor Bett.\n\nHe attended the [[University of Melbourne]], [[Australia]], from 1962 to 1964, where he took a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[Economics]] and [[Political Science]], as well as a [[Diploma]] in [[Public Administration]].\n\nBiwott then served as a District Officer in [[Nkubu]] in the South Imenti Division of [[Meru District]] from 1964 to 1965, returning to the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1966 to study for a [[Masters Degree]] in [[Economics]] under a [[Commonwealth scholarship]].\n\n==Political career==\n\nBiwott was a member of parliament for 28 years. In 1974 he ran unsuccessfully as a prospective MP for the Keiyo South Constituency. At the next election in 1979 he was successful, standing on KANU ticket in Keiyo-Marakwet, retaining the seat in 1983 and 1988. In 1992, 1997, and 2002 he was elected the MP for Keiyo South Constituency. In the Parliamentary elections held on 27 December 2007, running on a KANU ticket, he lost his seat to Jackson Kiptanui arap Kamai of the Orange Democratic Party (ODM). The ODM swept to victory in all but one of KANU's seats on the Rift Valley.\n\nFollowing the 2002 election, Biwott served on the Devolution Committee of the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission. Biwott was the only Member of Parliament who abstained on the Constitutional Referendum held in 2005, stating that the Draft Constitution 'would divide the country along ethnic lines'. The draft Constitution was rejected at the Referendum.\n\nMore recently, Biwott has fought an election for leadership of KANU, the former party of government and now the official opposition, following years of decline in KANU political fortunes but lost the post to Uhuru Kenyatta following a decision by the Kenyan High Court.\n\n==Service in government of Kenya==\n\n===District Officer===\n\nBiwott entered government service in 1965 as the District Officer in South [[Imenti]] and [[Tharaki]], [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]] District (Jan 1965\u201366). As District Officer Biwott instituted, on a 'harrambe' basis, community fund-raising programmes to aid the development of local irrigation projects and roads, to build a health centre at Nkwene and schools at [[Nkubu]] and [[Kanyakini]], develop employment at the [[Egoji]] quarries and promote the planting of coffee and tea. He was also actively involved in the resettlement of previously European owned land through the 'Land Transfer' programme, part of the 'Million Acres' scheme, and played a central role in the rehabilitation of the [[Mau Mau]], many of whom still remained in the Mau Forest four years after the end of the 'Emergency', helping to persuade them to give up violence and organising the resettlement of many on to their own land.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ministry of Agriculture===\n\nHaving completed his master's degree in Australia in 1968, Nicholas Biwott returned to public service in the Ministry of Agriculture, GOK, Personal Assistant to Minister Bruce MacKenzie (1968\u201370). He coordinated cereal production, the marketing of cereal crops and the management of the Ministry's fertiliser policy, and helped develop research into new strains of wheat and maize more suited to the growing conditions in Kenya. He played a similar co-ordinating role for the Ministry's work with the East African Council of Ministers (MacKenzie was also a member of the Council), guiding Kenya's policy in the region in the development of ports, railways and the East African Airways.\n\n===Treasury===\n\nIn 1971 Nicholas Biwott moved to the Treasury as Senior Secretary under the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Mwai Kibaki.

He also purchased a dairy farm in the same year, started an importer exporter business in 1972, purchased two wheat farms in 1974, invested in the sole agency for IH in Kenya for agricultural tractors and implements in 1975, and purchased a local air operator in 1977 (now Air Kenya).\n\nBiwott's business philosophy of purchasing small or failing businesses, investing and re-investing in them over many years, appears to have paid dividends. He is now regarded as one of Kenya's wealthiest businessmen.\n\nBiwott's businesses in Kenya employ thousands of people and one company of which he is the major shareholder, has for many years been listed among Kenya's top 10 corporate taxpayers.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nMr Biwott supported a number of projects in the areas of education, health and medicine, and assisting small businesses. In 2008 he established the Mbegu Trust 'to develop education and opportunity in Kenya'.<ref>[http://www.mbegutrust.org The Mbegu Trust]</ref>\n\nNicholas Biwott raised and contributed funds for the building of a number of schools, and hospitals in Keiyo.<ref>A full list can be found [http://www.nicholasbiwott.com/nicholas-biwott-biography/ here]</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\n\nNicholas Biwott's name has been raised, \u2018perhaps unfairly \u2019<ref>{{cite web|last=Phombeah |first=Gray |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4490163.stm |title=Africa &#124; Nicholas Biwott: Kenya's comeback king |publisher=BBC News |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> by his detractors both inside and outside Kenya regarding several controversies all which have date their origins to the years 1990\u201391. His supporters maintain that the allegations, none of which have ever been proved, arose from the campaign at the time to introduce multi-party democracy in Kenya coupled with Biwott's association with President Moi.\n\nBiwott was named by [[Scotland Yard]] detective [[John Troon]] as a person of interest in the 1990 murder of Kenya's Foreign Affairs minister [[Robert Ouko (politician)|Robert Ouko]]. Troon's theories and the basis for them as to the motives for the murder have since been criticised.\n\nTen government officials, including Biwott, were held in police custody for questioning for two weeks in November 1991<ref>{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=880|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko?..and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}</ref> but a Kenyan Police investigation concluded that there was no 'evidence to support the allegations that Biwott was involved in the disappearance and subsequent death of the late minister Dr. Robert John Ouko'.<ref>Kenya Police, Report on Further Investigations into the Disappearance and Subsequent Death of the Late Hon. Dr Robert John Ouko</ref>\n\nIn December 2003, Biwott issued a formal complaint against New Scotland Yard through his lawyer on the basis that Troon's investigation was 'fundamentally flawed and, in many cases erroneous' and called on New Scotland Yard 'to investigate Troon' and to issue an apology. The request was ultimately turned down in December 2004 by the Metropolitan Police as the original investigation 'did not involve any UK \"victim\", potential suspect, or even witnesses', and because 'the resources of the Metropolitan Police are limited'. Another reason given for the refusal by the Metropolitan Police to review the case was that the Kenyan Parliamentary Select Committee was investigating the death of Dr Robert Ouko and that it was 'open to Mr Biwott to make any representations he wishes to that Inquiry'. The Select Committee's proceedings, however, were abruptly terminated as Nicholas Biwott began to give his testimony.<ref>{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=901|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko?..and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}</ref>\n\nTo date, the allegation that Biwott was involved in the murder of Dr Robert Ouko has never been factually substantiated. In a recent broadcast (March 2017) Episode Six \"Lingering Doubts and Further Investigations\" it is explained why the allegations against Nicholas Biwott were false, and summarise \"It may be a hard truth for many Kenyans to swallow, but Nicholas Biwott clearly had no involvement in the murder of [[Robert Ouko (politician)|Robert Ouko]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Murder at Got Alila|url=http://murderatgotalila.com/?p=895|website=Who killed Dr Robert Ouko? ...and Why?|publisher=WPMS/INCA/CitizenTV}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, a Nairobi court awarded Mr Biwott record damages of Sh30 million arising from a case in which he sued a British journalist, Chester Stern, and others for linking him to the Ouko murder in a book entitled 'Dr Iain West's Casebook'. Chester Stern and the book's publishers, Little Brown, stated that they would \"vigorously defend\" the action but ultimately they did not do so and the case was uncontested.<ref>[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/559672/-/u3td4x/-/index.html \u2018It\u2019s Our Turn to Eat\u2019 now in electronic bookshop] ''Daily Nation''</ref> Earlier Biwott won Sh10 : million from Bookpoint, a popular Nairobi bookshop, for stocking copies of the book ''Dr Ian West's Casebook''.\n\nIn 1993 the 'Goldenberg scandal' came to light in which the Kenyan government was found to have subsidised exports of gold by paying a company, Goldenberg International Ltd (GIL), 35 percent more (in Kenyan shillings) than the foreign currency earnings supposedly derived from the sale of gold. The scheme had begun in 1991 and is estimated to have cost Kenya the equivalent of more than 10 percent of its annual Gross Domestic Product. A Commission of Inquiry headed by Mr Justice Bosire reported its findings in October 2005 stating that Sh158.3 billion [$2.1 billion] of Goldenberg money had been transacted through 487 companies and individuals. 1,559 'Adverse Notices' were issued against companies and individuals but although Nicholas Biwott was included on that list he was only mentioned directly or indirectly in three of the reports 847 paragraphs and the report, together with subsequent revelations would seem to absolve Biwott of any involvement in the scandal.\n\nThe Report of the Judicial Commission of Enquiry into the Goldenberg Affair (to which Nicholas Biwott was not summoned to appear) states  that Lima Limited, of which Biwott was shareholder and director, was 'said (to) have received Kshs.6,300,000.00 [$84,000] from GIL'. However, it was subsequently revealed that the payment to Lima Ltd, a company that sold farm machinery and equipment, was made not from GIL but by Tandui Estates Ltd for the purchase of farm equipment, including a number of tractors and other machinery.<ref>[http://www.kenyadocex.com/wiki/report-of-the-judicial-commission-of-inquiry-into-the-goldenberg-affair-para-511/ states on para 511]</ref> Paragraph 693 of the same report mentions Biwott in conjunction with a payment of KShs. 6,000,000 [$80,000], which involved Trade Bank Ltd, Pan-African Bank Ltd and Liabilities of H.Z. & Co. Ltd. The Commission concluded however, that 'no moneys of Goldenberg were involved'.<ref>[http://www.kenyadocex.com/wiki/report-of-the-judicial-commission-of-inquiry-into-the-goldenberg-affair-para-693/ Paragraph 693]</ref>\n\nBiwott is now but one name on a long list of Kenyan politicians and civil servants associated with the Moi era to have travel restrictions imposed on them by the United States<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4062541.stm US revokes visa for key Moi ally] ''BBC''</ref> and the UK<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7155379.stm UK travel ban for Kenyan minister] ''BBC''</ref><ref>[http://www.allafrica.com/stories/200909240896.htm] Revealed \u2013 Top names in U.S. Visa Ban List</ref> including most recently, in October 2009, Kenya's Attorney General Amos Wako, in what has been described by Kenya's Foreign Minister Moses Wetang'ula as \"megaphone diplomacy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/677778/-/uo3ssl/-/index.html |title=US slaps visa ban on govt official |publisher=nation.co.ke |date=26 October 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Death, memorial and funeral==\nOn the morning of 11 July 2017, Biwott was rushed to Nairobi Hospital. He died of complications arising from kidney failure 30 minutes later.\n\nA memorial service was held at Milimani AIC on 18 July 2017 followed on 20 July by a funeral service at the Maria Soti Girls Educational Centre Kaptarakwa, in Keiyo, Elgeyo/Marakwet County.\n\nIn the final speech of the funeral President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] eulogized the late Biwott as a  \"true patriot\".<ref>http://www.president.go.ke/2017/07/20/president-kenyatta-leads-kenyans-in-eulogising-late-biwott-as-a-true-patriot/</ref>\n\"When the history of this country is written, it will include many men and women in this country who quietly but firmly and confidently are responsible for what Kenya is today \u2013 a sound country, a stable country with a growing economy.

It also premiered on the Canadian television channel [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n''Ni Hao, Kai-Lan'' is based on the childhood memories of the show's creator, [[Karen Chau]], growing up in a bicultural (Chinese-American) household. \"Ni hao\" means \"Hello\" in Mandarin, and Kai-Lan is the Chinese name Chau was given at birth, which was later anglicized to Karen. It was also based on the classic short series ''Downward Doghouse''.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows the adventures of Kai-Lan and her group of talking anthropomorphic animal companions. The group consists of Kai-Lan, a seven-year old Asian girl; Rintoo, the yellow tiger; Tolee, the gray koala; Lulu, the pink rhino; and Hoho, the white monkey. Each episode is based around a series of events that occur during Kai-Lan's day, along with obstacles that she and her friends are forced to overcome (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, playing games, and working together. Common rituals may involve Kai-Lan resolving temper tantrums from her friends Rintoo and Hoho when they misbehave. To help Rintoo and Hoho, Kai-Lan shows them and the audience why they are having temper tantrums. Usually, once Rintoo and Hoho discover that their actions are wrong, they apologize and promise to work together better. Another obstacle is Hoho's aversion to trying new things; when the group goes to visit Lulu's house, Hoho refuses to try new foods before Kai-Lan and Lulu change Hoho's mind with the viewer's help. The audience is usually presented two musical sing-alongs where Kai-Lan sings about what must be done to overcome her and her friends' challenges. The episode always ends with Kai-Lan successfully helping her friends and everyone getting along. In the Season 1 finale, it is stated that they all live in California. \n\nEpisodes generally feature breaking the [[fourth wall]], 11 minutes of interactivity,<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|title=Ni Hao, Kai-lan: Tigers and Dragons and Mandarin Lessons|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=2007-12-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627225527/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|archivedate=2009-06-27}}</ref> a target word that is repeated multiple times,<ref name=\"weiss interview\">{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|title=Toon Zone Interviews Nick SVP Teri Weiss About \"Ni Hao, Kai-lan\"|author=Liu, Ed|publisher=Toon Zone|date=2008-01-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420113112/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|archivedate=2008-04-20}}</ref>  a few words of Mandarin Chinese vocabulary, one or more of Kai-lan's friends having a negative emotional response to some action or activity (problem), Kai-lan thinking out loud (observation), cause-and-effect problem solving, and before saying goodbye (at the end of each episode), Kai-lan says, \"You make my heart feel super happy!\" Later installments added Kai-lan saying this phrase in Mandarin after she said it in English: \"Ni rang wo hao kai xin!\" ''Ni Hao, Kai-lan'' introduces its viewers to the [[Mandarin Chinese]] language, along with elements of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture and values]], and intergenerational families (e.g., Kai-lan and her relationship with Ye Ye).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n{{:List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n\n==Major characters==\n\n===Kai-Lan===\nKai-Lan (voiced by Jade Lianna Peters) is a playful, adventurous young girl with a big heart. She has black hair that she wears in two space buns with red flowers. The character is often shown wearing a blue t-shirt, orange shorts, and red sneakers. She wears a necklace with a green jade pendant around her neck in every episode. Kai-Lan tries to help all of the characters she meets. She wants to help her friends when she sees that they are not happy or acting out in temper tantrums, even when her friends refuse to compromise, she fails to display actual anger. She gives others a chance to change their minds and do the right thing. Kai-Lan values her family (throughout the show only her grandpa, Ye-Ye, is seen) and she is very fond of her friends: Rintoo, Tolee, Lulu, and Hoho. Kai-Lan speaks both English and Mandarin Chinese. She loves to share her language, her culture, and her playtime with her animal friends and the viewers at home. Kai-Lan is a natural leader, but she is also thoughtful and always ready to help someone in need. Her favorite animal is a dinosaur. In her music group, she plays the tambourine.  \n\n===Rintoo===\nRintoo (voiced by Jack Samson) is a rambunctious and energetic 5-year-old young tiger with a frontal lisp who often acts before he thinks. He often fails to see when he is having a temper tantrum and needs his friends to subtly guide him towards learning to act with more manners. Rintoo enjoys playing sports and he is an avid fan of dragons and racecars. Rintoo hates losing at anything and will often do a tiger roar when he feels angry that he lost.   However, he is always willing to correct his behavior and work better with his friends. Rintoo, along with Hoho, is often seen as the character who get into trouble. He plays the xylophone in Kai-Lan's music group. \n\n===Tolee===\nTolee (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is a gray 5-year-old koala who loves pandas and eating fruit, especially apples, bananas, and pineapples. He is intelligent, sensitive, and always thinks before he acts; however, Tolee often overthinks and worries too much. He dislikes feeling left out of the group, such as when his friends are playing a game where they need to pair up and everyone is paired up before he is. Tolee is Rintoo's [[Foil (literature)|foil]]. Whereas Rintoo is talkative and acts before he thinks, Tolee is thoughtful and will deeply consider his actions before making a decision. When Tolee feels sad or has his feelings hurt, he starts to cry, but his friends can always cheer him up. Tolee loves playing with his friends. Kai-Lan and her friends can always rely on him for good ideas. Tolee also has a stuffed panda that he affectionately named Pandy. Tolee is the vocalist in Kai-Lan's music group.\n\n===Lulu===\nLulu (voiced by [[Beverly Duan]]) is a sweet and intelligent 6-year-old pink rhinoceros. Lulu has a red balloon tied around her horn that helps her fly in the sky. She likes to help her friends, using her red balloon to fly to their aid when they call her name. Lulu gives others a chance to try their hands at tasks even when she herself might have an easier time with them. Lulu values all of the characters she meets and is always friendly and willing to help. She demonstrates compassion and diplomacy, and will often be the first (besides Kai-Lan) to compromise and work out a resolution among her friends. Lulu enjoys dressing up like a princess, having tea parties, and dancing to disco music. She tries to introduce her traditions and customs subtly and without compulsion to those who are not familiar with them. Lulu lives in a floating castle in the sky. Lulu is also a musician, skilled at playing the piano and singing. She's indicated to be best friends with Kai-Lan. Her instrument in Kai-Lan's music group is the keyboard, and her favorite fruit is the lychee.  \n\n===Hoho===\nHoho (voiced by Angie Wu) is an energetic white 3-year-old monkey and is the youngest of Kai-Lan's friends. When he participates in activities, he often goes first. He is full of energy and enjoys being the center of attention. He is a picky eater and can be stubborn towards change such as when his friends want to play a different game. Despite his initial difficulties towards accepting new foods and games, Hoho often to his surprise finds that he loves the thing that he was reluctant to try. Whenever he jumps a springing sound can be heard. He can often be found jumping on his friends' heads or playing his turntables as the DJ in Kai-Lan's music group. Aside from his turntables and his friends, Hoho loves bananas.\n\n===Ye-Ye===\nYe-Ye (voiced by Clem Cheung and Ben Wang) is Kai-lan's playful, thoughtful, and caring grandfather. He was born in Hong Kong and lovingly passes on his exciting traditions to his granddaughter. He provides Kai-lan with gentle guidance, leading her to find her own answers, at her own pace. (Kai-lan's parents and other grandparents are not known.) He can play the tuba, and enjoys picking apples and making dumplings for Kai-lan and all her animal friends.  \n\n===Mr. Sun===\nAt the start of almost every episode, Kai-Lan wakes up Mr. Sun so she can start her day. With the help of the viewer, Mr. Sun rises and showers down smiling sun fuzzies to Kai-Lan and she gets tickled by them. He also knows how to play the trumpet, so Kai-Lan and the ladybugs (playing the [[pipa]]) join him as a little music group at the beginning of '''Tolee's Rhyme Time''' and later joins Kai-Lan and her friends in the music show.\n\n===The Ants===\nIn one corner of Kai-Lan's backyard is a teeming mini-metropolis of ants called Ant City. The ants serve very important roles in the community: they deliver mail, they build things, and they love to play with Kai-Lan and her friends. San San is their leader along with his two right-hand ants, Bubu and Fufu.\n\nSan San is voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]], Bubu is voiced by Luke Manriquez, and Fufu is voiced by Kyla Rae Kowalewski.\n\n===Other, grown-up, and minor characters===\n* Howard (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is an owl who first appears in \"The Dragonboat Festival.\" He delivers letters and only speaks in hoots.  \n* Mr. Fluffy (voiced by Elan Garfias) is a hamster and baker who first appears in \"Everybody's Hat Parade.\"  \n* Mei Mei (voiced by [[Laura Marano]]) is a shy blue polar bear.  \n* Stompy the Elephant (voiced by Hsiang Lo) is a big, playful blue elephant who made his first appearance in \"Safari Pals.\" Nothing makes Stompy happier than being able to play with his friends.   \n* GuNaiNai (voiced by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) is Kai-Lan's great-aunt and YeYe's sister.

He appears in \"Princess Kai-Lan.\"   \n* The Fox King (voiced by [[James Siang'a]]) is a fox in The Fox Kingdom. He creates magic bamboo forests to keep the bears away. He usually gets mad, and he could not get his sleep and talk to his friends, because of the dancing bears.  \n* The Foxes are red foxes that live in The Fox Kingdom.

It also premiered on the Canadian television channel [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n''Ni Hao, Kai-Lan'' is based on the childhood memories of the show's creator, [[Karen Chau]], growing up in a bicultural (Chinese-American) household. \"Ni hao\" means \"Hello\" in Mandarin, and Kai-Lan is the Chinese name Chau was given at birth, which was later anglicized to Karen. It was also based on the classic short series ''Downward Doghouse''.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows the adventures of Kai-Lan and her group of talking anthropomorphic animal companions. The group consists of Kai-Lan, a seven-year old Asian girl; Rintoo, the yellow tiger; Tolee, the gray koala; Lulu, the pink rhino; and Hoho, the white monkey. Each episode is based around a series of events that occur during Kai-Lan's day, along with obstacles that she and her friends are forced to overcome (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, playing games, and working together. Common rituals may involve Kai-Lan resolving temper tantrums from her friends Rintoo and Hoho when they misbehave. To help Rintoo and Hoho, Kai-Lan shows them and the audience why they are having temper tantrums. Usually, once Rintoo and Hoho discover that their actions are wrong, they apologize and promise to work together better. Another obstacle is Hoho's aversion to trying new things; when the group goes to visit Lulu's house, Hoho refuses to try new foods before Kai-Lan and Lulu change Hoho's mind with the viewer's help. The audience is usually presented two musical sing-alongs where Kai-Lan sings about what must be done to overcome her and her friends' challenges. The episode always ends with Kai-Lan successfully helping her friends and everyone getting along. In the Season 1 finale, it is stated that they all live in California. \n\nEpisodes generally feature breaking the [[fourth wall]], 11 minutes of interactivity,<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|title=Ni Hao, Kai-lan: Tigers and Dragons and Mandarin Lessons|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=2007-12-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627225527/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|archivedate=2009-06-27}}</ref> a target word that is repeated multiple times,<ref name=\"weiss interview\">{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|title=Toon Zone Interviews Nick SVP Teri Weiss About \"Ni Hao, Kai-lan\"|author=Liu, Ed|publisher=Toon Zone|date=2008-01-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420113112/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|archivedate=2008-04-20}}</ref>  a few words of Mandarin Chinese vocabulary, one or more of Kai-lan's friends having a negative emotional response to some action or activity (problem), Kai-lan thinking out loud (observation), cause-and-effect problem solving, and before saying goodbye (at the end of each episode), Kai-lan says, \"You make my heart feel super happy!\" Later installments added Kai-lan saying this phrase in Mandarin after she said it in English: \"Ni rang wo hao kai xin!\" ''Ni Hao, Kai-lan'' introduces its viewers to the [[Mandarin Chinese]] language, along with elements of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture and values]], and intergenerational families (e.g., Kai-lan and her relationship with Ye Ye).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n{{:List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n\n==Major characters==\n\n===Kai-Lan===\nKai-Lan (voiced by Jade Lianna Peters) is a playful, adventurous young girl with a big heart. She has black hair that she wears in two space buns with red flowers. The character is often shown wearing a blue t-shirt, orange shorts, and red sneakers. She wears a necklace with a green jade pendant around her neck in every episode. Kai-Lan tries to help all of the characters she meets. She wants to help her friends when she sees that they are not happy or acting out in temper tantrums, even when her friends refuse to compromise, she fails to display actual anger. She gives others a chance to change their minds and do the right thing. Kai-Lan values her family (throughout the show only her grandpa, Ye-Ye, is seen) and she is very fond of her friends: Rintoo, Tolee, Lulu, and Hoho. Kai-Lan speaks both English and Mandarin Chinese. She loves to share her language, her culture, and her playtime with her animal friends and the viewers at home. Kai-Lan is a natural leader, but she is also thoughtful and always ready to help someone in need. Her favorite animal is a dinosaur. In her music group, she plays the tambourine.  \n\n===Rintoo===\nRintoo (voiced by Jack Samson) is a rambunctious and energetic 5-year-old young tiger with a frontal lisp who often acts before he thinks. He often fails to see when he is having a temper tantrum and needs his friends to subtly guide him towards learning to act with more manners. Rintoo enjoys playing sports and he is an avid fan of dragons and racecars. Rintoo hates losing at anything and will often do a tiger roar when he feels angry that he lost.   However, he is always willing to correct his behavior and work better with his friends. Rintoo, along with Hoho, is often seen as the character who get into trouble. He plays the xylophone in Kai-Lan's music group. \n\n===Tolee===\nTolee (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is a gray 5-year-old koala who loves pandas and eating fruit, especially apples, bananas, and pineapples. He is intelligent, sensitive, and always thinks before he acts; however, Tolee often overthinks and worries too much. He dislikes feeling left out of the group, such as when his friends are playing a game where they need to pair up and everyone is paired up before he is. Tolee is Rintoo's [[Foil (literature)|foil]]. Whereas Rintoo is talkative and acts before he thinks, Tolee is thoughtful and will deeply consider his actions before making a decision. When Tolee feels sad or has his feelings hurt, he starts to cry, but his friends can always cheer him up. Tolee loves playing with his friends. Kai-Lan and her friends can always rely on him for good ideas. Tolee also has a stuffed panda that he affectionately named Pandy. Tolee is the vocalist in Kai-Lan's music group.\n\n===Lulu===\nLulu (voiced by [[Beverly Duan]]) is a sweet and intelligent 6-year-old pink rhinoceros. Lulu has a red balloon tied around her horn that helps her fly in the sky. She likes to help her friends, using her red balloon to fly to their aid when they call her name. Lulu gives others a chance to try their hands at tasks even when she herself might have an easier time with them. Lulu values all of the characters she meets and is always friendly and willing to help. She demonstrates compassion and diplomacy, and will often be the first (besides Kai-Lan) to compromise and work out a resolution among her friends. Lulu enjoys dressing up like a princess, having tea parties, and dancing to disco music. She tries to introduce her traditions and customs subtly and without compulsion to those who are not familiar with them. Lulu lives in a floating castle in the sky. Lulu is also a musician, skilled at playing the piano and singing. She's indicated to be best friends with Kai-Lan. Her instrument in Kai-Lan's music group is the keyboard, and her favorite fruit is the lychee.  \n\n===Hoho===\nHoho (voiced by Angie Wu) is an energetic white 3-year-old monkey and is the youngest of Kai-Lan's friends. When he participates in activities, he often goes first. He is full of energy and enjoys being the center of attention. He is a picky eater and can be stubborn towards change such as when his friends want to play a different game. Despite his initial difficulties towards accepting new foods and games, Hoho often to his surprise finds that he loves the thing that he was reluctant to try. Whenever he jumps a springing sound can be heard. He can often be found jumping on his friends' heads or playing his turntables as the DJ in Kai-Lan's music group. Aside from his turntables and his friends, Hoho loves bananas.\n\n===Ye-Ye===\nYe-Ye (voiced by Clem Cheung and Ben Wang) is Kai-lan's playful, thoughtful, and caring grandfather. He was born in Hong Kong and lovingly passes on his exciting traditions to his granddaughter. He provides Kai-lan with gentle guidance, leading her to find her own answers, at her own pace. (Kai-lan's parents and other grandparents are not known.) He can play the tuba, and enjoys picking apples and making dumplings for Kai-lan and all her animal friends.  \n\n===Mr. Sun===\nAt the start of almost every episode, Kai-Lan wakes up Mr. Sun so she can start her day. With the help of the viewer, Mr. Sun rises and showers down smiling sun fuzzies to Kai-Lan and she gets tickled by them. He also knows how to play the trumpet, so Kai-Lan and the ladybugs (playing the [[pipa]]) join him as a little music group at the beginning of '''Tolee's Rhyme Time''' and later joins Kai-Lan and her friends in the music show.\n\n===The Ants===\nIn one corner of Kai-Lan's backyard is a teeming mini-metropolis of ants called Ant City. The ants serve very important roles in the community: they deliver mail, they build things, and they love to play with Kai-Lan and her friends. San San is their leader along with his two right-hand ants, Bubu and Fufu.\n\nSan San is voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]], Bubu is voiced by Luke Manriquez, and Fufu is voiced by Kyla Rae Kowalewski.\n\n===Other, grown-up, and minor characters===\n* Howard (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is an owl who first appears in \"The Dragonboat Festival.\" He delivers letters and only speaks in hoots.  \n* Mr. Fluffy (voiced by Elan Garfias) is a hamster and baker who first appears in \"Everybody's Hat Parade.\"  \n* Mei Mei (voiced by [[Laura Marano]]) is a shy blue polar bear.  \n* Stompy the Elephant (voiced by Hsiang Lo) is a big, playful blue elephant who made his first appearance in \"Safari Pals.\" Nothing makes Stompy happier than being able to play with his friends.   \n* GuNaiNai (voiced by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) is Kai-Lan's great-aunt and YeYe's sister.

He appears in \"Princess Kai-Lan.\"   \n* The Fox King (voiced by [[James Siang'a]]) is a fox in The Fox Kingdom. He creates magic bamboo forests to keep the bears away.
