He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''.

He has been redesigned: now taller and more muscular than before.<ref name=\"scarf\"/> As a somewhat exaggerated reference to his mainstream counterpart's easily deceived personality (as well being based on the stereotypical team muscles), Knuckles is also portrayed as being somewhat slow-witted and goofy in this series.\n\n==Reception and impact==\nThe character has received positive attention.

He is also a member of the [[Brotherhood of Guardians]], a [[secret society]] that defends the island and is made up of Knuckles' predecessors/ancestors. In keeping with the incorporation of elements of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|'' Sonic the Hedgehog'']] cartoon into the series, Knuckles lives on the planet Mobius. Knuckles is supported in his efforts by the [[Chaotix]], and often works together with Sonic the Hedgehog and the Freedom Fighters.\n\nWhen Knuckles was first introduced he was the lone defender of the island, but differences between this continuity and the games were quickly introduced. Writer [[Ken Penders]] built up a considerable backstory for Knuckles, in which he is abandoned by his father, Locke, as part of his Guardian training. He was later tricked by Robotnik into believing that Sonic and Tails were on their way to steal the Chaos Emerald and its powers. After a short melee, Robotnik blatantly betrayed Knuckles, causing him to join Sonic in a begrudging team-up, which eventually grew into a strong friendship.\n\nNot too long after that, he formed the Chaotix along with Vector, out of the few refugee inhabitants on Angel Island at the time and would leave the island to their care if he ever had to leave. The Chaotix at the time were Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Charmy Bee, Heavy, and Bomb, but later saw the addition of Ray the Flying Squirrel, Julie-Su the Echidna (who became his love interest), and Saffron Bee (Charmy's betrothed), while Heavy and Bomb departed and later joined the King's Secret Service. Knuckles was also revealed to have a mystically significant destiny as \"the Avatar,\" corresponding to similar destinies shared by Tails and Sonic. He and Princess [[Sally Acorn]] were also revealed to be childhood friends, having met when she and her father paid a visit to the Floating Island while Knuckles' father was Guardian.\n\nAfter believing himself to be the last living Echidna for some time, Knuckles stumbled upon the existence of others; his earliest encounters with others of his people would earn him enemies. The first would be his great-uncle Dimitri, who had been possessed by a malevolent spirit and become an evil being known as Enerjak. He would then run across a cyborg army known as the Dark Legion-led by Dimitri's descendants-who had previously been banished to another dimension by one of the Knuckles' ancestors. Julie-Su started out as a member of this group but defected to join Knuckles after an Echidna sixth sense known as the Soultouch identified Knuckles as an ideal soul mate. Accompanied by Julie, Knuckles would come across others of his kind, including the city of Echidnaopolis-home to his mother after she divorced his father Locke-the Brotherhood of Guardians, and the hidden city of Albion.\n\nKnuckles' early adventures typically involved protecting Angel Island or the various Echidna groups-only rarely would he join the Freedom Fighters against threats like Dr. Robotnik. However, Robotnik's encroachments on different areas of the planet-including Angel Island itself-eventually persuaded Knuckles to relocate to the surface to join the battle against the evil doctor and other threats. One of his enemies-a villainous Echidna named Dr. Finitevus-later made Knuckles into a new Enerjak after revealing that Robotnik had driven the Echidna race to the brink of extinction. Knuckles would become wracked with guilt over his actions, especially since the remnants of the Dark Legion chose to ally themselves with Dr. Robotnik.\n\nThe final blow would come when Knuckles responded to a distress call from his people and arrived in Albion to find it deserted. This would be revealed to be the work of Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, whose people were mutated by ancient Echidnas. Thrash's actions led to almost all the remaining Echidnas being banished from Mobius, with Knuckles failing to rescue them. In reality, the disappearance of these characters-among others-was due to a lawsuit by Ken Penders.\n\nAs a result of the continuity reboot that followed the crossover with the ''[[Mega Man]]'' franchise, Knuckles became virtually indistinguishable from his video game counterpart: he is the last known Echidna and the last Guardian of Master Emerald, and the Chaotix no longer serve as his full-time support team.\n\n===In animation===\nKnuckles' animation debut came with the 1996 Japanese ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[original video animation|OVA]]. Sonic and Tails meet him in an alternate dimension, and over the course of the film he helps them defeat Black Eggman/Metal Robotnik and [[Metal Sonic|Hyper Metal Sonic]], two robots created by Eggman/Robotnik. As Metal is about to descend into a lava pit, Sonic attempts to save him after all, but Knuckles holds him back and Sonic is disappointed. Knuckles play-fights with Sonic a few times in the film as well.<ref>{{cite AV media|title=[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)|Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie]]|year=1999|publisher=[[ADV Films]]|medium=DVD}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles is a minor character in ''[[Sonic Underground]]''. Sonic, Sonia, and Manic meet Knuckles atop his home, the Floating Island while searching for their mother. Knuckles is initially skeptical of them but soon accepts their help in protecting the Island and its guardian Chaos Emerald from villains Sleet and Dingo.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Friend or Foe?|episodelink=List of Sonic Underground episodes|series=[[Sonic Underground]]|airdate=January 18, 2000|season=1|number=18}}</ref> Later on, the siblings recruit Knuckles to help them deactivate Doctor Robotnik's giant fortress, as it is powered by Emeralds and he can control them.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Flying Fortress|episodelink=List of Sonic Underground episodes|series=Sonic Underground|airdate=March 22, 2000|season=1|number=27}}</ref> They succeed, but Sleet and Dingo accidentally break the Emerald, unleashing gradually effective but massive energy upon the planet Mobius, and Knuckles enlists one of his relatives to help them control it, with mediocre results.<ref>{{cite episode|title=No Hedgehog Is an Island|episodelink=List of Sonic Underground episodes|series=Sonic Underground|airdate=March 29, 2000|season=1|number=28}}</ref> Reluctantly, Knuckles cuts a deal with Robotnik to turn over the hedgehogs in exchange for setting Mobius right; Robotnik succeeds and starts turning the hedgehogs into robots, but Knuckles betrays Robotnik to rescue his friends.<ref>{{cite episode|title=New Echidna in Town|episodelink=List of Sonic Underground episodes|series=Sonic Underground|airdate=April 5, 2000|season=1|number=29}}</ref>\n\nKnuckles appears in all three seasons of ''[[Sonic X]]''. He takes guarding Master Emerald seriously and has a fearsome temper with a \"chip on his shoulder\". After being stranded in the new world with Sonic, his only desire is to get back home quickly.<ref name=\"4Kids characters\">{{cite web |url=http://www.4kids.tv/show/sonic-x/characters |title=Characters: Knuckles|accessdate=October 26, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410060055/http://www.4kids.tv/show/sonic-x/characters|archivedate=April 10, 2012|publisher=4Kids.tv}}</ref> He spends most of the first season traveling alone, but as the series continues he begins to travel with Sonic and the others more often, as well as befriending other characters. After returning home for the third season, he joins Sonic on the spaceship, \"Blue Typhoon\", which is captained by Tails after their planet was invaded by the Metarex.\n\nKnuckles is among the main cast in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' computer-animated series. He has been redesigned: now taller and more muscular than before.<ref name=\"scarf\"/> As a somewhat exaggerated reference to his mainstream counterpart's easily deceived personality (as well being based on the stereotypical team muscles), Knuckles is also portrayed as being somewhat slow-witted and goofy in this series.\n\n==Reception and impact==\nThe character has received positive attention.

There, they meet Mr. Hubley, who works at the spa. When Shaggy asks if there is anything to eat, Hubley says no, but there is a barbecue in town.\n\nThe gang goes to the barbecue, and all but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo go off to see the paleontological dig of Professor Svankmajer. Shaggy and Scooby are too full to walk right away. When they set out, a [[gila monster]] steals a biscuit from them, causing Scooby to go after it. He meets the Phantosaur (described as somewhat resembling an ''[[Appalachiosaurus]]'' by Professor Svankmajer) and runs away. Later, Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the Phantosaur and narrowly escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Professor Svankmajor shows the rest of the gang over the dig, and Velma meets Svankmajor's student, Winsor. She instantly sees him as a soul mate and they plan to go out on a date, to which Fred replies to Daphne, \"On our own for clue searching then.\"\n\nBack at the spa, Shaggy is in terrible shape after a fright. Mr. Hubley helps with aromatherapy, assisted by Scooby-Doo adding a Scooby Snack to the aromas. Shaggy becomes more calm, but freaks out again when Mr. Hubley tells them the legend of the Phantosaur, the ghost of a predatory dinosaur. The legend says the Phantosaur was summoned by Native Americans to drive out Spanish conquistadors, but it turned on them instead.\n\nHubley has an advanced hypnosis machine with a hologram projector. He hypnotizes Shaggy to become fearless and unstoppable when he heard the word \"bad,\" and to switch back to normal when he hears it again. Then he orders Shaggy to forget everything; unfortunately, Hubley himself is affected by the hypnosis and he can't remember the key word for Shaggy.\n\nDaphne, Fred, and Velma go back to the dig to look for clues, but Velma is so love struck that she's not much use. She misses an obvious clue about many footprints going to a part of the cave where Winsor says they never go because of the snakes that lurk in the lower cave levels.\n\nMeanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and start to eat it out of business. Then a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a [[hot dog bun]] on one of the bikers, who angrily grabs him and tells him, \"Little buddy, this is gonna be bad.\" Suddenly, Shaggy is fearless. He knocks out the whole motorcycle gang and repels all their assaults on him. Then the gang leader, a large, muscly man named Tex, arrives and, taking an admitted liking to Shaggy, challenges him to a motorcycle race on Dead Man's curve. Shaggy confidently accepts, even though he's never ridden a motorcycle before. As Tex leaves the restaurant, he tells Shaggy that he won't kill Shaggy \"too bad.\". Suddenly back to normal, Shaggy is terrified of the challenge he has just accepted, and by what he has just done to the rest of the gang.\n\nThat night, Daphne decides to give him motorcycling lessons, because she drove a motorcycle when she was five. Shaggy and Tex have their motorcycle race as planned, and Shaggy hears \"bad\" just in time and almost wins, until a Phantosaur shows up and he thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so \"bad,\" which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased, but still miraculously wins the race.\n\nEventually, they figure out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists.\n\nOnce back at Hubley's they find the hologram projector gone and they get attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and a ghostly fire-breathing ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajer and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete ''[[Allosaurus]]'' encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holographic projector (stolen from Hubley's hypnotism room) and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects.\n\nWhile they are underground, the dynamite charges Svankmajor set to blast free the dinosaur crystal go off (because Daphne left a paint-stripper on and the heat lit the fuses). Shaggy's hypnotic bravery comes in again when Svankmejer comments on how \"bad\" the lower caverns are, and he flawlessly leads them toward the exit until Daphne praises him that he's \"not bad.\"  Scooby realizes the keyword but is unable to tell the rest of the gang (who misunderstand his \"rad\" as other words). Shaggy has to complete the rest of the escape on sheer guts, and with some help from Tex and his biker friends. The remorseful Svankmajer and Winsor are arrested, but Velma says she will date Winsor again when he gets out of jail, which he happily agrees with.\n\nThey then go back to La Serena Spa and Mr. Hubley tries to un-hypnotize Shaggy, but accidentally makes the entire gang turn into him. The end of the movie shows them driving away in the \"Mustard\" Machine. A post-credits scene reveals the \"Mustard\" Machine wearing a wig that looks like Shaggy's hairstyle. The GPS inside the van says aloud that if it had hands, it would remove the wig, but as such, it has none.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]] and Shaky Joe\n* [[Mindy Cohn]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Cathy Cavadini]] as Faith\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Fritz, GPS and misc. bikers\n* [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as Mr. Babbit, Blair, Grad Student #1 and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Winsor\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as Professor Svankmajer\n* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as Doctor\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Tex, Cop #2, Grad Student #3 and misc. bikers\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Hubley\n* [[Dave Wittenberg]] as Cop #1, Grad Student #2, Policeman and misc. bikers\n* [[Gwendoline Yeo]] as Ms. Fetich\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1777608}}\n\n{{Scooby-Doo}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n[[Category:2011 television films]]\n[[Category:2011 animated films]]\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:Scooby-Doo direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ethan Spaulding]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = Scooby-Doo!

She misses an obvious clue about many footprints going to a part of the cave where Winsor says they never go because of the snakes that lurk in the lower cave levels.\n\nMeanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and start to eat it out of business. Then a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a [[hot dog bun]] on one of the bikers, who angrily grabs him and tells him, \"Little buddy, this is gonna be bad.\" Suddenly, Shaggy is fearless. He knocks out the whole motorcycle gang and repels all their assaults on him. Then the gang leader, a large, muscly man named Tex, arrives and, taking an admitted liking to Shaggy, challenges him to a motorcycle race on Dead Man's curve. Shaggy confidently accepts, even though he's never ridden a motorcycle before. As Tex leaves the restaurant, he tells Shaggy that he won't kill Shaggy \"too bad.\". Suddenly back to normal, Shaggy is terrified of the challenge he has just accepted, and by what he has just done to the rest of the gang.\n\nThat night, Daphne decides to give him motorcycling lessons, because she drove a motorcycle when she was five. Shaggy and Tex have their motorcycle race as planned, and Shaggy hears \"bad\" just in time and almost wins, until a Phantosaur shows up and he thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so \"bad,\" which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased, but still miraculously wins the race.\n\nEventually, they figure out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists.\n\nOnce back at Hubley's they find the hologram projector gone and they get attacked by a pack of ''[[Velociraptor]]'' and a ghostly fire-breathing ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajer and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete ''[[Allosaurus]]'' encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holographic projector (stolen from Hubley's hypnotism room) and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects.\n\nWhile they are underground, the dynamite charges Svankmajor set to blast free the dinosaur crystal go off (because Daphne left a paint-stripper on and the heat lit the fuses). Shaggy's hypnotic bravery comes in again when Svankmejer comments on how \"bad\" the lower caverns are, and he flawlessly leads them toward the exit until Daphne praises him that he's \"not bad.\"  Scooby realizes the keyword but is unable to tell the rest of the gang (who misunderstand his \"rad\" as other words). Shaggy has to complete the rest of the escape on sheer guts, and with some help from Tex and his biker friends. The remorseful Svankmajer and Winsor are arrested, but Velma says she will date Winsor again when he gets out of jail, which he happily agrees with.\n\nThey then go back to La Serena Spa and Mr. Hubley tries to un-hypnotize Shaggy, but accidentally makes the entire gang turn into him. The end of the movie shows them driving away in the \"Mustard\" Machine. A post-credits scene reveals the \"Mustard\" Machine wearing a wig that looks like Shaggy's hairstyle. The GPS inside the van says aloud that if it had hands, it would remove the wig, but as such, it has none.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frank Welker]] as [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]], [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]] and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as [[Shaggy Rogers]] and Shaky Joe\n* [[Mindy Cohn]] as [[Velma Dinkley]]\n* [[Grey DeLisle]] as [[Daphne Blake]]\n* [[Cathy Cavadini]] as Faith\n* [[John DiMaggio]] as Fritz, GPS and misc. bikers\n* [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as Mr. Babbit, Blair, Grad Student #1 and misc. bikers\n* [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] as Winsor\n* [[Finola Hughes]] as Professor Svankmajer\n* [[Maulik Pancholy]] as Doctor\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] as Tex, Cop #2, Grad Student #3 and misc. bikers\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Mr. Hubley\n* [[Dave Wittenberg]] as Cop #1, Grad Student #2, Policeman and misc. bikers\n* [[Gwendoline Yeo]] as Ms. Fetich\n\n==Ultra Instinct Shaggy meme==\nOn October 12, 2017, a [[YouTube]] user named \"Midya\" created a video featuring Shaggy fighting a biker gang in the film called \"Ultra Instinct Shaggy\" using the Ky\u016bkyoku no Battle theme from the ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' anime and slow-motion to make the character seem as if he were in the Ultra Instinct form (a powered up state in the Dragon Ball series where the user can react to attacks almost instinctively). The video earned millions of views and spawned the \"Ultra Instinct Shaggy\" meme depicting Shaggy Rogers as an omnipotent power, with subsequent fan art showing him beating other fictional characters such as [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thanos]] and [[Goku]] from the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise, as well as using still images and footage of the behind the scenes look at the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|2002 ''Scooby-Doo'' film]] with fake subtitles to make it seem as if Shaggy is a powerful being.\n\nAt the same time as the meme gained popularity in January 2019, the then-upcoming video game ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'' was being marketed and thus a petition was made on [[Change.org]] by Woken News Network to include the character as [[Downloadable content|DLC]]. The petition received hundreds of thousands of signatures even gaining attention of ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' co-creator [[Ed Boon]], and Shaggy's voice actor [[Matthew Lillard]]. Lillard had previously tweeted posts and retweeted fan art in support of the idea as well as Boon jokingly petitioning to get [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby Doo]] into another [[NetherRealm Studios]] game ''[[Injustice 2]]''. It was later confirmed that Shaggy would never appear in any Mortal Kombat game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/28/18201001/powerful-shaggy-meme-timeline-explained|title=What is the Ultra Instinct Shaggy meme?: an investigation|last=Radulovic|first=Petrana|work=Polygon|date=January 29, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://gamerant.com/mortal-kombat-11-shaggy-ed-boon-response/|title=Mortal Kombat 11 Director Ed Boon Responds to Shaggy Petition|last=Cooper|first=Dalton|work=Game Rant|date=January 28, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/01/30/-mortal-kombat-11-producer-scooby-doo-injustice-2-petition/|title='Mortal Kombat 11's' Ed Boon Has Fun With Shaggy Rumours, Suggests New Character for 'Injustice 2'|last=Workman|first=Robert|work=Comicbook.com|date=January 30, 2010|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/andyneuenschwander/|title=This \"Powerful Shaggy\" Meme Is So Damn Funny That Now Matthew Lillard Is On Board|last=Golder|first=Andy|work=[[Buzzfeed News]]|date=January 30, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/mortal-kombat-shaggy-ed-boon/|title=Mortal Kombat 11 Co-Creator Fuels Fire of Shaggy Meme|last=Burks|first=Robin|work=Screen Rant|date=February 1, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/gaming/petition-add-shaggy-mortal-kombat-11-got-300000-signatures-counting|title=Petition to Add Shaggy to Mortal Kombat 11 Hits 300,000 Signatures|last=James|first=David|work=We Got This Covered|date=February 3, 2019|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1777608}}\n\n{{Scooby-Doo}}\n{{Warner Bros. animation and comics}}\n\n[[Category:2011 television films]]\n[[Category:2011 animated films]]\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:Scooby-Doo direct-to-video animated films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about dinosaurs]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2010s American animated films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Ethan Spaulding]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Internet memes introduced in 2017]]\n", "name_user": "2600:6c50:757f:bcf1:84ad:a370:2573:96e6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Stupid nonsense)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby-Doo!_Legend_of_the_Phantosaur"}

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

{"title_page": "Foreign policy of the Richard Nixon administration", "text_new": "{{Nixon series}}\n\nThe '''foreign policy of the Richard Nixon administration''' was the foreign policy of the [[United States]] from January 20, 1969 to August 9, 1974, when [[Richard Nixon]] served as the [[President of the United States]]. Nixon held office during the [[Cold War]], a sustained period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nNixon's foreign policy focused on [[d\u00e9tente]] with the Soviet Union and [[China]], as he sought to move away from traditional ideological conflicts and the policy of [[containment]]. Nixon's [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|1972 visit to China]] ushered in a new era of [[China\u2013United States relations|U.S.-Chinese relations]] and effectively removed China as a Cold War foe. The Nixon administration signed the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with the Soviet Union and organized a conference that would lead to the signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] after Nixon left office.\n\nWhen Nixon took office, the United States had approximately 500,000 soldiers stationed in [[Southeast Asia]] as part of an effort to aid [[South Vietnam]] in the [[Vietnam War]]. Nixon implemented a policy of \"[[Vietnamization]]\", carrying out phased withdrawals of U.S. soldiers and shifting combat roles to Vietnamese troops. As peace negotiations continually bogged down, Nixon ordered major bombing campaigns in Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]]. The U.S., South Vietnam, and [[North Vietnam]] agreed to the [[Paris Peace Accords]] in early 1973, and the U.S. subsequently withdrew its remaining soldiers in South Vietnam. The war resumed as North Vietnam and South Vietnam violated the truce, and in 1975 North Vietnam captured [[Saigon]] and completed the reunification of Vietnam.\n\n==Leadership==\nRichard Nixon and his top aide Henry Kissinger focused on the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, the Middle East, Pakistan, and major arms limitation agreements.  Unless a crisis erupted on other matters, they let the State Department handle it with secretary [[William P. Rogers]] in charge.  He was an old friend of Nixon\u2014a good administrator with little diplomatic experience and less interest in geopolitical dynamics.<ref>Melvin Small, ''The Presidency of Richard Nixon'' (1999) p 46.</ref><ref>See ''United States Foreign Policy 1969-1970: A report of the Secretary of State'' (1971), [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001755720 online] and subsequent annual volumes for the details of lesser issues.</ref>\n\n===Kissinger===\nThe relationship between Nixon and Kissinger was unusually close, and has been compared to the relationships of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Edward M.

In a way, they complemented each other perfectly. Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr. Outside who provided the grace and intellectual-establishment respectability that Nixon lacked, disdained and aspired to. Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies. Kissinger would, of course, say that he was not political like Nixon\u2014but in fact he was just as political as Nixon, just as calculating, just as relentlessly ambitious....these self-made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths.<ref>David Rothkopf, ''Running the world: the inside story of the National Security Council and the architects of American foreign policy'' (2004), pp. 111\u201312.</ref>\n\n===The Nixon Doctrine===\n{{Further|Nixon Doctrine}}\nThe [[Nixon Doctrine]] shifted the main responsibility for the defense of an ally, to the ally itself, especially regarding combat. The United States would work on the diplomacy, provide financial help and munitions, and help train the allied army.  Specifically:\n* The U.S. would keep all its treaty commitments.\n* The U.S. would \u201cprovide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security.\u201d\n* In conflicts involving non-nuclear aggression, the U.S. would \u201clook to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for defense.\u201d<ref>Henry Kissinger, ''Diplomacy'' (1994) p 708.</ref>\n\nThe Doctrine was exemplified by the [[Vietnamization]] process regarding South Vietnam and the Vietnam War.<ref>John G. Keilers, \"Nixon Doctrine and Vietnamization\"  (U.S. Army Military History Institute, June 29, 2007) [https://www.army.mil/article/3867/nixon_doctrine_and_vietnamization  online]</ref>  It also came into play elsewhere in Asia including Iran,<ref>Stephen McGlinchey,  \"Richard Nixon\u2019s Road to Tehran: The Making of the US\u2013Iran Arms Agreement of May 1972.\" ''Diplomatic History'' 37.4 (2013): 841-860.</ref>  Taiwan,<ref>Earl C.

''America's commitment to South Korea: the first decade of the Nixon doctrine'' (1986).</ref>  The doctrine was an explicit rejection of the practice that sent 500,000 American soldiers to Vietnam, even though there was no treaty obligation to that country.  A major long-term goal was to reduce the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and  China, so as to better enable the d\u00e9tente process to work.<ref>Robert S. Litwak, ''D\u00e9tente and the Nixon doctrine: American foreign policy and the pursuit of stability, 1969-1976'' (1986).</ref>\n\n==Detente and Arms Control, 1969-1979==\nNixon and Kissinger were both committed to a realism that focused on American economic advantages and jettisoned moralism in foreign policy, seeking d\u00e9tente with Communism and confrontation with old allies who now had become economic adversaries. Everyone assumed, mistakenly, that Nixon's anticommunist reputation at home indicated a hard-line cold warrior. But as early as 1959 (in his \"kitchen debate\" with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev) he was moving away from containment. Nixon concluded that containment (which he saw as a Truman policy) had failed. As a realist in foreign policy it was time to emphasize economic goals in foreign policy, and to de-emphasize expensive ideological or peripheral commitments. Furthermore, having rich allies meant the American economy no longer could dominate or control the world economy. By the mid-1960s China and the USSR had become bitter enemies. Their armies growled at one another across a long border; the risk of war was serious.<ref>Jeremi Suri, ''Henry Kissinger and the American century'' (2007), pp 179-86.</ref>\n\nBoth Moscow and Beijing realized it would be wise to de-escalate tensions with the US, but Lyndon Johnson ignored them both. Sensing fresh opportunity, Nixon played the two Communist giants one against the other.<ref>Evelyn Goh,  \"Nixon, Kissinger, and the \u201cSoviet card\u201d in the US opening to China, 1971\u20131974.\" ''Diplomatic history'' 29.3 (2005): 475-502.</ref> Nixon's utterly unexpected trip to China in 1972 was set up by Kissinger's negotiations using Pakistan as an intermediary. The trip in effect ended the cold war with that nation and ushered in an era of friendship that was still unfolding a half-century.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed the World'' (2008)</ref> Moscow rushed to catch favor, and Nixon's summit meetings with Brezhnev produced major arms agreements\u2014especially a treaty banning anti-missile defenses in space. (It was thought that the balance of terror, with each side having thousands of nuclear missiles, guaranteed peace, and that a successful defense against missiles would dangerously destabilize this equilibrium.)<ref>Allen S. Whiting, \"Sino-American D\u00e9tente.\" ''China Quarterly'' 82 (1980): 334-341.</ref>\n\n===Arms race US vs USSR===\n===SALT I Agreements, 1969-72===\n{{Main|Strategic Arms Limitation Talks}}\n\nThe Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) led to START I and START II, which were Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties with the USSR.  The goal was to limit multiple-warhead capacities and impose other restrictions on each side's number of nuclear weapons. Thanks to negotiations in Helsinki, Finland, in November 1969,  SALT I produced an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an interim agreement between the two countries. The agreement expired on December 31, 1985 and was not  renewed. START never was ratified. A successor to START I, New START, was proposed and was eventually ratified in February 2011.<ref>Raymond L. Garthoff, ''D\u00e9tente and Confrontation: American-Soviet Relations from Nixon to Reagan'' (2nd 1994), pgs. 146-223.</ref>\n\nNixon and Kissinger achieved breakthrough agreements with Moscow on the limitation of Anti Ballistic Missiles and the Interim Agreement on Strategic Missiles. Nixon Was proud that he achieved an agreement that his predecessors were unable to reach, thanks to his diplomatic skills. Nixon and Kissinger planned to link arms control to d\u00e9tente.  and to the resolution of other urgent problems regarding Vietnam, the Mideast, and Berlin. Through the employment of linkage.

In late March 1972, the PAVN launched a major cross-border conventional surprise attack on the South. They expected the peasants to rise up and overthrow the government; they did not. They expected the South's army to collapse; instead the ARVN fought very well indeed. They did not expect heavy US bombing, which disrupted their plans and forced a retreat.\n\nIn 1971 Nixon sent massive quantities of hardware to the ARVN, and gave Thieu a personal pledge to send air power if Hanoi invaded. The NLF and Viet Cong had largely disappeared. They controlled a few remote villages, and contested a few more, but the Pentagon estimated that 93% of the South's population now lived under secure GVN control. The guerrilla war had been decisively won by GVN. The year 1971 was eerily quiet, with no large campaigns, apart from a brief ARVN foray into Laos to which was routed by the PAVN.\n\n====1972: LINEBACKER I====\n{{Main|Operation Linebacker}}\nGiap decided that since the American forces had left he could invade in conventional fashion and defeat Saigon's demoralized army, the ARVN. His assumption that Vietnamization had failed was soon proven wrong. Saigon had started to exert itself; new draft laws produced over one million well-armed regular soldiers, and another four million in part-time, lightly armed self-defense militia.<ref>Dale Andrad\u00e9, ''Trial by Fire: The 1972 Easter Offensive, America's Last Vietnam Battle'' (1995)</ref>\n\nIn March\u2013April, 1972 Hanoi invaded at three points from north and west with PAVN regulars spearheaded by tanks. On March 30, 30,000 PAVN troops, supported by regiments of tanks and artillery, rolled southward across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separated the two Vietnams. A second PAVN force of 20,000 crossed the border from their sanctuaries in Cambodia into areas north of Saigon. A third PAVN invasion moved in from eastern Laos. This was conventional old- fashioned warfare, reminiscent of North Korea's invasion in 1950.<ref>A.J.C. Lavalle, ed. ''Airpower and the 1972 Spring Offensive'' (Air University Press, 1976), pp 1-7.</ref>\n\nThe outcome was quite different however. Nixon ordered LINEBACKER I, with 42,000 bombing sorties over North Vietnam. Hanoi was evacuated. Nixon also ordered the mining of North Vietnam's harbors, a stroke LBJ had always vetoed for fear of Soviet or Chinese involvement, But thanks to d\u00e9tente the Soviets and Chinese held quiet. The ARVN, its morale stiffened by American resolve, rose to the occasion. With massive tactical air support from the US, it held the line.<ref>Robert A.

However they did retain control of a slice of territory south of the DMZ. There the NLF, renamed the \"Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam\" (PRG) was established; it welcomed diplomats from the Communist world, including Fidel Castro, and served as one of the launch points of the 1975 invasion.<ref>Lewis Sorley, \"Courage and Blood: South Vietnam's Repulse of the 1972 Easter Invasion,\" ''Parameters'' Summer 1999, pp. 38-56.</ref>\n\nAfter the failed Easter Offensive the Thieu government made a fatal strategic mistake. Overconfident of its military prowess, it adopted a policy of static defense that made its units vulnerable; worse, it failed to use the breathing space to reorganize and rebuilt its faulty command structure. The departure of American forces and American money lowered morale in both military and civilian South Vietnam. Desertions rose as military performance indicators sank, and no longer was the US looking over the shoulder demanding improvement. Politics, not military need, still ruled the South Vietnamese Army. On other side, the PAVN had been badly mauled\u2014the difference was that it knew it and it was determined to rebuild. Discarding guerrilla tactics, Giap three years to rebuild his forces into a strong conventional army. Without constant American bombing it was possible to solve the logistics problem by modernizing the Ho Chi Minh trail with 12,000 more miles or roads. Brazenly, he even constructed a pipeline along the Trail to bring in gasoline for the next invasion.<ref>Phillip B.

Nixon thereupon unleashed the full fury of air power to force Hanoi to come to terms. Operation LINEBACKER II, in 12 days smashed many targets in North Vietnam cities that had always been sacrosanct. 59 railroad yards, warehouses, radar stations, electric power plants, and airfields were blasted with laser- guided \"smart bombs.\" US policy was to try to avoid residential areas; the Politburo had already evacuated civilians not engaged in essential war work. The Soviets had sold Hanoi 1,200 SAM surface-to-air missiles that proved effective against the B-52s for the first three days. In a remarkable display of flexibility, the Air Force radically changed its bomber formations overnight\u2014and Hanoi ran out of SAMs. An American negotiator in Paris observed that:\n\nPrior to LINEBACKER II, the North Vietnamese were intransigent. After LINEBACKER II, they were shaken, demoralized, and anxious to talk about anything. Beijing and Moscow advised Hanoi to agree to the peace accords;they did so on January 23, 1973. The Air Force interpreted the quick settlement as proof unrestricted bombing of the sort they had wanted to do for eight years had finally broken Hanoi's will to fight; other analysts said Hanoi had not changed at all.<ref>Mark Clodfelter, ''The Limits of Air Power: The American Bombing of North Vietnam'' (2006) pp 197-202.</ref>\n\n===Bombing of Cambodia, 1969===\nIn March 1969, Nixon approved a secret [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] carpet bombing campaign (code-named ''[[Operation Menu]]'') of North Vietnamese positions in Cambodia without the consent of Cambodian leader [[Norodom Sihanouk]].{{sfn|Black|p=591}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Clymer|first=Kenton|title=The United States and Cambodia, 1969-2000: A Troubled Relationship|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2013|isbn=9781134341566|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> In early 1970, Nixon [[Cambodian Campaign|sent]] U.S. and South Vietnamese soldiers into [[Cambodia]] to attack North Vietnamese bases, expanding the ground war out of Vietnam for the first time.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=766\u2013768}} Even within the administration, many disapproved of the incursions into Cambodia, and anti-war protesters were irate.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=79\u201380}} The bombing of Cambodia continued into the 1970s in support of the Cambodian government of [[Lon Nol]]\u2014which was then battling a [[Khmer Rouge]] insurgency in the [[Cambodian Civil War]]\u2014as part of [[Operation Freedom Deal]].<ref name=\"Kiernan\">{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Taylor|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|title=Bombs Over Cambodia|journal=The Walrus|date=October 2006|url=http://www.yale.edu/cgp/Walrus_CambodiaBombing_OCT06.pdf|pages=32\u201336}}Kiernan and Owen later revised their estimate of 2.7 million tons of U.S. bombs dropped on Cambodia down to the previously accepted figure of roughly 500,000 tons: See {{cite web|authorlink1=Ben Kiernan|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|last2=Owen|first2=Taylor|url=http://apjjf.org/2015/13/16/Ben-Kiernan/4313.html|title=Making More Enemies than We Kill?

Nixon held office during the [[Cold War]], a sustained period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nNixon's foreign policy focused on [[d\u00e9tente]] with the Soviet Union and [[China]], as he sought to move away from traditional ideological conflicts and the policy of [[containment]]. Nixon's [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|1972 visit to China]] ushered in a new era of [[China\u2013United States relations|U.S.-Chinese relations]] and effectively removed China as a Cold War foe. The Nixon administration signed the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] with the Soviet Union and organized a conference that would lead to the signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] after Nixon left office.\n\nWhen Nixon took office, the United States had approximately 500,000 soldiers stationed in [[Southeast Asia]] as part of an effort to aid [[South Vietnam]] in the [[Vietnam War]]. Nixon implemented a policy of \"[[Vietnamization]]\", carrying out phased withdrawals of U.S. soldiers and shifting combat roles to Vietnamese troops. As peace negotiations continually bogged down, Nixon ordered major bombing campaigns in Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]]. The U.S., South Vietnam, and [[North Vietnam]] agreed to the [[Paris Peace Accords]] in early 1973, and the U.S. subsequently withdrew its remaining soldiers in South Vietnam. The war resumed as North Vietnam and South Vietnam violated the truce, and in 1975 North Vietnam captured [[Saigon]] and completed the reunification of Vietnam.\n\n==Leadership==\nRichard Nixon and his top aide Henry Kissinger focused on the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, the Middle East, Pakistan, and major arms limitation agreements.  Unless a crisis erupted on other matters, they let the State Department handle it with secretary [[William P. Rogers]] in charge.  He was an old friend of Nixon\u2014a good administrator with little diplomatic experience and less interest in geopolitical dynamics.<ref>Melvin Small, ''The Presidency of Richard Nixon'' (1999) p 46.</ref><ref>See ''United States Foreign Policy 1969-1970: A report of the Secretary of State'' (1971), [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001755720 online] and subsequent annual volumes for the details of lesser issues.</ref>\n\n===Kissinger===\nThe relationship between Nixon and Kissinger was unusually close, and has been compared to the relationships of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Edward M.

In a way, they complemented each other perfectly. Kissinger was the charming and worldly Mr. Outside who provided the grace and intellectual-establishment respectability that Nixon lacked, disdained and aspired to. Kissinger was an international citizen. Nixon very much a classic American. Kissinger had a worldview and a facility for adjusting it to meet the times, Nixon had pragmatism and a strategic vision that provided the foundations for their policies. Kissinger would, of course, say that he was not political like Nixon\u2014but in fact he was just as political as Nixon, just as calculating, just as relentlessly ambitious....these self-made men were driven as much by their need for approval and their neuroses as by their strengths.<ref>David Rothkopf, ''Running the world: the inside story of the National Security Council and the architects of American foreign policy'' (2004), pp. 111\u201312.</ref>\n\n===The Nixon Doctrine===\n{{Further|Nixon Doctrine}}\nThe [[Nixon Doctrine]] shifted the main responsibility for the defense of an ally, to the ally itself, especially regarding combat. The United States would work on the diplomacy, provide financial help and munitions, and help train the allied army.  Specifically:\n* The U.S. would keep all its treaty commitments.\n* The U.S. would \u201cprovide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security.\u201d\n* In conflicts involving non-nuclear aggression, the U.S. would \u201clook to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for defense.\u201d<ref>Henry Kissinger, ''Diplomacy'' (1994) p 708.</ref>\n\nThe Doctrine was exemplified by the [[Vietnamization]] process regarding South Vietnam and the Vietnam War.<ref>John G.

Everyone assumed, mistakenly, that Nixon's anticommunist reputation at home indicated a hard-line cold warrior. But as early as 1959 (in his \"kitchen debate\" with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev) he was moving away from containment. Nixon concluded that containment (which he saw as a Truman policy) had failed. As a realist in foreign policy it was time to emphasize economic goals in foreign policy, and to de-emphasize expensive ideological or peripheral commitments. Furthermore, having rich allies meant the American economy no longer could dominate or control the world economy. By the mid-1960s China and the USSR had become bitter enemies. Their armies growled at one another across a long border; the risk of war was serious.<ref>Jeremi Suri, ''Henry Kissinger and the American century'' (2007), pp 179-86.</ref>\n\nBoth Moscow and Beijing realized it would be wise to de-escalate tensions with the US, but Lyndon Johnson ignored them both.

The goal was to limit multiple-warhead capacities and impose other restrictions on each side's number of nuclear weapons. Thanks to negotiations in Helsinki, Finland, in November 1969,  SALT I produced an Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and an interim agreement between the two countries. The agreement expired on December 31, 1985 and was not  renewed. START never was ratified. A successor to START I, New START, was proposed and was eventually ratified in February 2011.<ref>Raymond L.

A conservative faction of Republicans led by [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] strongly opposed a rapprochement with China, while [[Lin Biao]] led a similar faction in the PRC. For the first two years of his presidency, Nixon and China each made subtle moves designed to lower tensions, including the removal of travel restrictions. The expansion of the Vietnam War into Laos and Cambodia hindered, but did not derail, the move towards normalization of relations.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=776\u2013778}} Due to a misunderstanding at the [[1971 World Table Tennis Championships]], the Chinese [[table tennis]] team invited the [[ping-pong diplomacy|U.S. table tennis team to tour China]].{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=120\u2013121}} In the aftermath of the visit, Nixon lifted the trade embargo on China.

In late March 1972, the PAVN launched a major cross-border conventional surprise attack on the South. They expected the peasants to rise up and overthrow the government; they did not. They expected the South's army to collapse; instead the ARVN fought very well indeed. They did not expect heavy US bombing, which disrupted their plans and forced a retreat.\n\nIn 1971 Nixon sent massive quantities of hardware to the ARVN, and gave Thieu a personal pledge to send air power if Hanoi invaded. The NLF and Viet Cong had largely disappeared. They controlled a few remote villages, and contested a few more, but the Pentagon estimated that 93% of the South's population now lived under secure GVN control. The guerrilla war had been decisively won by GVN. The year 1971 was eerily quiet, with no large campaigns, apart from a brief ARVN foray into Laos to which was routed by the PAVN.\n\n====1972: LINEBACKER I====\n{{Main|Operation Linebacker}}\nGiap decided that since the American forces had left he could invade in conventional fashion and defeat Saigon's demoralized army, the ARVN. His assumption that Vietnamization had failed was soon proven wrong. Saigon had started to exert itself; new draft laws produced over one million well-armed regular soldiers, and another four million in part-time, lightly armed self-defense militia.<ref>Dale Andrad\u00e9, ''Trial by Fire: The 1972 Easter Offensive, America's Last Vietnam Battle'' (1995)</ref>\n\nIn March\u2013April, 1972 Hanoi invaded at three points from north and west with PAVN regulars spearheaded by tanks. On March 30, 30,000 PAVN troops, supported by regiments of tanks and artillery, rolled southward across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separated the two Vietnams. A second PAVN force of 20,000 crossed the border from their sanctuaries in Cambodia into areas north of Saigon. A third PAVN invasion moved in from eastern Laos. This was conventional old- fashioned warfare, reminiscent of North Korea's invasion in 1950.<ref>A.J.C. Lavalle, ed. ''Airpower and the 1972 Spring Offensive'' (Air University Press, 1976), pp 1-7.</ref>\n\nThe outcome was quite different however. Nixon ordered LINEBACKER I, with 42,000 bombing sorties over North Vietnam. Hanoi was evacuated. Nixon also ordered the mining of North Vietnam's harbors, a stroke LBJ had always vetoed for fear of Soviet or Chinese involvement, But thanks to d\u00e9tente the Soviets and Chinese held quiet. The ARVN, its morale stiffened by American resolve, rose to the occasion. With massive tactical air support from the US, it held the line.<ref>Robert A.

However they did retain control of a slice of territory south of the DMZ. There the NLF, renamed the \"Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam\" (PRG) was established; it welcomed diplomats from the Communist world, including Fidel Castro, and served as one of the launch points of the 1975 invasion.<ref>Lewis Sorley, \"Courage and Blood: South Vietnam's Repulse of the 1972 Easter Invasion,\" ''Parameters'' Summer 1999, pp. 38-56.</ref>\n\nAfter the failed Easter Offensive the Thieu government made a fatal strategic mistake. Overconfident of its military prowess, it adopted a policy of static defense that made its units vulnerable; worse, it failed to use the breathing space to reorganize and rebuilt its faulty command structure. The departure of American forces and American money lowered morale in both military and civilian South Vietnam. Desertions rose as military performance indicators sank, and no longer was the US looking over the shoulder demanding improvement. Politics, not military need, still ruled the South Vietnamese Army. On other side, the PAVN had been badly mauled\u2014the difference was that it knew it and it was determined to rebuild. Discarding guerrilla tactics, Giap three years to rebuild his forces into a strong conventional army. Without constant American bombing it was possible to solve the logistics problem by modernizing the Ho Chi Minh trail with 12,000 more miles or roads. Brazenly, he even constructed a pipeline along the Trail to bring in gasoline for the next invasion.<ref>Phillip B.

Nixon thereupon unleashed the full fury of air power to force Hanoi to come to terms. Operation LINEBACKER II, in 12 days smashed many targets in North Vietnam cities that had always been sacrosanct. 59 railroad yards, warehouses, radar stations, electric power plants, and airfields were blasted with laser- guided \"smart bombs.\" US policy was to try to avoid residential areas; the Politburo had already evacuated civilians not engaged in essential war work. The Soviets had sold Hanoi 1,200 SAM surface-to-air missiles that proved effective against the B-52s for the first three days. In a remarkable display of flexibility, the Air Force radically changed its bomber formations overnight\u2014and Hanoi ran out of SAMs. An American negotiator in Paris observed that:\n\nPrior to LINEBACKER II, the North Vietnamese were intransigent. After LINEBACKER II, they were shaken, demoralized, and anxious to talk about anything. Beijing and Moscow advised Hanoi to agree to the peace accords;they did so on January 23, 1973. The Air Force interpreted the quick settlement as proof unrestricted bombing of the sort they had wanted to do for eight years had finally broken Hanoi's will to fight; other analysts said Hanoi had not changed at all.<ref>Mark Clodfelter, ''The Limits of Air Power: The American Bombing of North Vietnam'' (2006) pp 197-202.</ref>\n\n===Bombing of Cambodia, 1969===\nIn March 1969, Nixon approved a secret [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] carpet bombing campaign (code-named ''[[Operation Menu]]'') of North Vietnamese positions in Cambodia without the consent of Cambodian leader [[Norodom Sihanouk]].{{sfn|Black|p=591}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Clymer|first=Kenton|title=The United States and Cambodia, 1969-2000: A Troubled Relationship|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2013|isbn=9781134341566|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> In early 1970, Nixon [[Cambodian Campaign|sent]] U.S. and South Vietnamese soldiers into [[Cambodia]] to attack North Vietnamese bases, expanding the ground war out of Vietnam for the first time.{{Sfn|Herring|2008|pp=766\u2013768}} Even within the administration, many disapproved of the incursions into Cambodia, and anti-war protesters were irate.{{Sfn|Small|1999|pp=79\u201380}} The bombing of Cambodia continued into the 1970s in support of the Cambodian government of [[Lon Nol]]\u2014which was then battling a [[Khmer Rouge]] insurgency in the [[Cambodian Civil War]]\u2014as part of [[Operation Freedom Deal]].<ref name=\"Kiernan\">{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Taylor|last2=Kiernan|first2=Ben|title=Bombs Over Cambodia|journal=The Walrus|date=October 2006|url=http://www.yale.edu/cgp/Walrus_CambodiaBombing_OCT06.pdf|pages=32\u201336}}Kiernan and Owen later revised their estimate of 2.7 million tons of U.S. bombs dropped on Cambodia down to the previously accepted figure of roughly 500,000 tons: See {{cite web|authorlink1=Ben Kiernan|last1=Kiernan|first1=Ben|last2=Owen|first2=Taylor|url=http://apjjf.org/2015/13/16/Ben-Kiernan/4313.html|title=Making More Enemies than We Kill?

Bill, ''The eagle and the lion: The tragedy of American-Iranian relations'' (1989).</ref> However, Richard  Alvandi argues that it worked the other war around, with the Shah taking the initiative.  President Nixon, who had first met the Shah in 1953, regarded him as a modernizing anticommunist statesman who deserved American support now that the British were withdrawing from the region. They met in 1972 and the Shah agreed to buy large quantities of expensive American military hardware and took responsibility for ensuring political stability and fighting off Soviet subversion throughout the region.<ref>Roham Alvandi, ''Nixon, Kissinger, and the Shah: The United States and Iran in the Cold War'' (2014)</ref>\n\n== Latin America==\n{{Main|Latin America\u2013United States relations}}\n\n===Cuba===\n===Chile===\n{{Main|United States intervention in Chile}}\nChile moved sharply to the left, after 1970, seizing American copper mining companies and aligning itself with Castro's Cuba. In Chile in 1973 the military executed a putsch that overthrew the socialist government of [[Salvador Allende]], and killed him.<ref>Jonathan Haslam, ''Nixon Administration and the Death of Allende's Chile: A Case of Assisted Suicide'' (2005).</ref>  Nixon and Kissinger set policy to strongly oppose the Allende regime while avoiding visible intervention.  Economic pressure was used to boycott Chilean copper and thereby damage the Chilean economy and retaliate for nationalizing American copper interests without compensation. The CIA convinced the Chilean generals that Allende was plotting against the army.  The result of the coup was long term authoritarian control of  Chile by General [[Augusto Pinochet]] who supported American interests and brutally crushed the left wing opposition.<ref>Tanya Harmer, ''Allende's Chile and the Inter-American Cold War'' (2011) [https://www.questia.com/library/120077274/allende-s-chile-and-the-inter-american-cold-war online]</ref>\n\nFor decades historians have heatedly debated the role of the United States, focusing on four main issues: (1) Did the US attempt to spark a military coup to prevent Allende taking office in 1970? (There was no coup that year.) (2) The commander in chief of the Chilean army, General [[Rene Schneider]] blocked coup efforts; he was murdered\u2014was the US involved? (3) Chile's economy went into free fall as copper revenues plunged and food prices soared; was the US responsible? (4) Was the US involved in the plotting and execution of the successful 1973 coup? The Clinton Administration in 1999-2000 released a massive cache of 23,000 secret documents, allowing for the first time an in-depth look at American involvement. Historian working through the documents continue to be bitterly divided, with one group insisting that American involvement at all stages was minimal, and the opposition insisting that the Kissinger was deeply guilty.<ref>For a review of the historiography see Zakia Shiraz, \"CIA Intervention in Chile and the Fall of the Allende Government in 1973.\" ''Journal of American Studies'' (2011) 45#3 pp 603-613.

The Canadian economy became dependent on smooth trade flows with the United States so much that in 1971 when the United States enacted the \"[[Nixon Shock]]\" economic policies (including a 10% tariff on all imports) it put the Canadian government into a panic. This led in a large part to the articulation of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau]]'s \"[[Third Option]]\" policy of diversifying Canada's trade and downgrading the importance of Canada \u2013 United States relations.

In video games, this usually means a character controlled by the computer via algorithmic, predetermined or responsive behavior, but not necessarily true [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].\n\n==Role-playing games==\nIn a traditional [[tabletop role-playing game]] such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', an NPC is a [[fiction]]al character portrayed by the [[gamemaster]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Bill|last1=Slavicsek|first2=Richard|last2=Baker|title=Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies|date=April 8, 2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780764599248|page=73}}</ref> If [[player character]]s form the narrative's protagonists, non-player characters can be thought of as the \"supporting cast\" or \"extras\" of a roleplaying narrative. Non-player characters populate the fictional world of the game, and can fill any role not occupied by a [[player character]] (PC). Non-player characters might be allies, bystanders or competitors to the PCs. NPCs can also be traders that trade currency for things such as equipment or gear. NPCs thus vary in their level of detail. Some may be only a brief description (\"You see a man in a corner of the tavern\"), while others may have complete game [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] and [[backstory|backstories]] of their own.\n\nThere is some debate about how much work a [[gamemaster]] should put into an important NPC's statistics; some players prefer to have every NPC completely defined with stats, skills, and gear, while others define only what is immediately necessary and fill in the rest as the game proceeds. There is also some discussion as to just how important fully defined NPCs are in any given RPG, but it is general consensus that the more \"real\" the NPCs feel, the more fun players will have interacting with them in character.\n\n===Playability===\nIn some games and in some circumstances, a player who is without a [[player character]] of their own can temporarily take control of an NPC. Reasons for this vary, but often arise from the player not maintaining a PC within the group and playing the NPC for a session or from the player's PC being unable to act for some time (for example, because they are injured or in another location). Although these characters are still designed and normally controlled by the gamemaster, when players are given the opportunity to temporarily control these non-player characters it gives them another perspective on the plot of the game. Some systems, such as ''[[Nobilis]]'', encourage this in their rules.\n\nIn less traditional RPGs, narrative control is less strictly separated between gamemaster and players. In this case, the line between PC and NPC can be vague.\n\n===Dependents===\nMany game systems have rules for characters sustaining positive allies in the form of NPC followers; hired hands, or other dependent stature to the PC. Characters may sometimes help in the design, recruitment, or development of NPCs.\n\nIn the ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' game (and related games using the [[Hero System]]), a character may have a DNPC, or \"dependent non-player character\". This is a character controlled by the GM, but for which the [[player character]] is responsible in some way, and who may be put in harm's way by the PC's choices.\n\n==Video games==\n{{see also|Video game bot|Mob (gaming)|Boss (video gaming)}}\nThe term ''non-player character'' is also used in [[video game]]s to describe entities not under the direct control of a player. The term carries a connotation that the character is not hostile towards players; hostile characters are referred to as enemies, [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]], or creeps. In video games, NPC is sometimes expanded as \"non-playable character\" or \"non-player class\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nNPC behavior in computer games is usually scripted and automatic, triggered by certain actions or dialogue with the player characters. In certain multi-player games (''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[Vampire: the Masquerade]]'' series, for example) a player that acts as the GM can \"possess\" both player and non-player characters, controlling their actions in order to further the storyline.  More complex games, such as the aforementioned ''Neverwinter Nights'', allow the player to customize the NPCs' behavior by modifying their default scripts or creating entirely new ones.\n\nIn some online games, such as [[MMORPG]]s, NPCs may be entirely unscripted, and are essentially regular character avatars controlled by employees of the game company. These \"non-players\" are often distinguished from player characters by avatar appearance or other visual designation, and often serve as in-game support for new players. In other cases, these \"live\" NPCs are virtual actors, playing regular characters which drive a continuing storyline (as in ''[[Myst Online: Uru Live]]'').\n\nIn early and less advanced RPGs, NPCs only had monologue. Code directs the appearance of a dialogue box, floating text, [[cutscene]], or other means of displaying the NPCs' speech or reaction to the player.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} NPC speeches of this kind are often designed to give an instant impression of the character of the speaker, providing character vignettes, but they may also advance the story or illuminate the world around the PC. Similar to this is the most common form of storytelling, non-branching dialogue, in which the means of displaying NPC speech are the same as above, but the [[player character]] or [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] responds to or initiates speech with NPCs. In addition to the purposes listed above, this enables development of the player character.\n\nMore advanced RPGs feature interactive dialogue, or [[Nonlinear gameplay|branching dialogue]] ([[Dialog tree|dialogue trees]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/27441/1/EDTree-Emotional%20Dialogue%20Trees%20for%20Game.pdf|format=PDF|title=EDTree: Emotional Dialogue Trees for Game Based Training|author1=Jay Collins|author2=William Hisrt|author3=Wen Tang|author4=Colin Luu|author5=Peter Smith|author6=Andrew Watson|author7=Reza Sahandi|website=Spirits.bournemouth.ac.uk|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> A good example are the games produced by [[Black Isle Studios]] and [[White Wolf, Inc.]]; every one of their games is multiple-choice roleplaying. When talking to an NPC, the player is presented with a list of dialogue options, and may choose between them. Each choice may result in a different response from the NPC. These choices may affect the course of the game, as well as the conversation. At the least, they provide a reference point to the player of his or her relationship with the game world.\n\n''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' is an example of a game series that has advanced from non-branching (''[[Ultima III]]'' and earlier) to branching dialogue (from ''[[Ultima IV]]'' and on).

Games revolving around relationship-building, including visual novels, dating sims such as ''Tokimeki Memorial'', and some role-playing games such as ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona]]'', often give choices that have a different number of associated \"mood points\" which influence a player character's relationship and future conversations with a non-player character.

Non-player characters populate the fictional world of the game, and can fill any role not occupied by a [[player character]] (PC). Non-player characters might be allies, bystanders or competitors to the PCs. NPCs can also be traders that trade currency for things such as equipment or gear. NPCs thus vary in their level of detail. Some may be only a brief description (\"You see a man in a corner of the tavern\"), while others may have complete game [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] and [[backstory|backstories]] of their own.\n\nThere is some debate about how much work a [[gamemaster]] should put into an important NPC's statistics; some players prefer to have every NPC completely defined with stats, skills, and gear, while others define only what is immediately necessary and fill in the rest as the game proceeds. There is also some discussion as to just how important fully defined NPCs are in any given RPG, but it is general consensus that the more \"real\" the NPCs feel, the more fun players will have interacting with them in character.\n\n===Playability===\nIn some games and in some circumstances, a player who is without a [[player character]] of their own can temporarily take control of an NPC. Reasons for this vary, but often arise from the player not maintaining a PC within the group and playing the NPC for a session or from the player's PC being unable to act for some time (for example, because they are injured or in another location). Although these characters are still designed and normally controlled by the gamemaster, when players are given the opportunity to temporarily control these non-player characters it gives them another perspective on the plot of the game. Some systems, such as ''[[Nobilis]]'', encourage this in their rules.\n\nIn less traditional RPGs, narrative control is less strictly separated between gamemaster and players. In this case, the line between PC and NPC can be vague.\n\n===Dependents===\nMany game systems have rules for characters sustaining positive allies in the form of NPC followers; hired hands, or other dependent stature to the PC. Characters may sometimes help in the design, recruitment, or development of NPCs.\n\nIn the ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' game (and related games using the [[Hero System]]), a character may have a DNPC, or \"dependent non-player character\". This is a character controlled by the GM, but for which the [[player character]] is responsible in some way, and who may be put in harm's way by the PC's choices.\n\n==Video games==\n{{see also|Video game bot|Mob (gaming)|Boss (video gaming)}}\nThe term ''non-player character'' is also used in [[video game]]s to describe entities not under the direct control of a player. The term carries a connotation that the character is not hostile towards players; hostile characters are referred to as enemies, [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]], or creeps.

The orthography of Old English \u2013 which was entirely handwritten in its own time \u2013 was not well standardized, though it did not use all the Latin letters, and included several letters not present in the modern alphabet.  When reprinted in modern times, an [[overdot]] is occasionally used with two Latin letters to differentiate sounds for the reader:\n* [[\u010b]] is used for a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /t\u0361\u0283/\n* [[\u0121]] for a palatal approximant /j/ (probably a voiced palatal fricative /\u029d/ in the earliest texts)\n\nSome modern printings also apply diacritics to vowels following the rules of [[Old_Norse_orthography#Normalized_spelling|Old Norse normalized spelling]] developed in the 19th century.\n\nIn the Late [[Middle English]] period, the shape of the English letter [[\u00fe]] (thorn), which was derived from the Runic alphabet, evolved in some handwritten and [[blackletter]] texts to resemble the Latin letter [[y]].  The \u00fe shape survived into the era of printing presses only as far as the press of [[William Caxton]].  In later publications, thorn was represented by \"y\", or by [[\u1e8f]] to distinguish thorn from y.  By the end of the [[Early Modern English]] period, thorn had been completely replaced{{why|date=February 2018}} in contemporary usage by the [[Th (digraph)|digraph \"th\"]] (reviving a practice from early Old English), and the overdot was no longer needed outside of printings of very old texts.  The overdot is missing from the only surviving usage of a Y-shaped thorn, in the archaic stock phrase [[ye olde]] (from \"\u00fee olde\", pronounced \"the old\", but \"ye olde\" is often misanalyzed and pronounced with the modern \"y\" sound).\n\n== Words imported from other languages ==\nNon-English [[loanword]]s enter the English language by a process of naturalisation, or specifically [[anglicisation]], which is carried out mostly unconsciously (a similar process occurs in all other languages). During this process there is a tendency for accents and other diacritics that were present in the donor language to be dropped (for example French ''[[:wikt:h\u00f4tel|h\u00f4tel]]'' and French ''[[:wikt:r\u00f4le|r\u00f4le]]'' becoming \"[[hotel]]\" and \"[[role]]\" respectively in English, or French ''[[:wikt:\u00e0 propos|\u00e0 propos]]'', which lost both the accent and space to become English \"[[:wikt:apropos|apropos]]\").<ref>Bryan A. Garner, ''Garner's Modern American Usage'' (2009) p. 248: \"Sometimes they survive indefinitely, but often they fall into disuse as terms are fully naturalised. Nobody today, for example, writes h\u00f4tel or r\u00f4le.\"</ref>\n\nIn many cases, imported words can be found in print in both their accented and unaccented versions. Since modern dictionaries are mostly descriptive and no longer [[Linguistic prescription|prescribe]] outdated forms, they increasingly list unaccented forms, though some dictionaries, such as the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], do not list the unaccented variants of particular words (e.g., [[:wikt:soup\u00e7on|soup\u00e7on]]).\n\nWords that retain their accents often do so to help indicate pronunciation (e.g. ''[[frapp\u00e9 coffee|frapp\u00e9]]'', ''[[na\u00efve]]'', ''[[souffl\u00e9]]''), or to help distinguish them from an unaccented English word (e.g. ''[[expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]]'', ''[[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]'', ''[[ros\u00e9]]''). Technical terms or those associated with specific fields (especially cooking or musical terms) are less likely to lose their accents (such as the [[French language|French]] ''[[soup\u00e7on]]'', ''[[fa\u00e7ade]]'' and ''[[entr\u00e9e]]'').\n\nSome Spanish words with the Spanish letter ''[[\u00f1]]'' have been naturalised by substituting English ''ny'' (e.g. Spanish ''[[:wikt:ca\u00f1\u00f3n|ca\u00f1\u00f3n]]'' is now usually English ''[[canyon]]'', Spanish ''[[:wikt:pi\u00f1\u00f3n|pi\u00f1\u00f3n]]'' is now usually English ''[[pinyon pine]]''). Certain words like ''[[pi\u00f1ata]]'', ''[[jalape\u00f1o]]'' and ''[[quincea\u00f1era]]'' are usually kept intact. In many instances the ''\u00f1'' is replaced with the plain letter ''[[n]]''. In words of German origin, the letters with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauts]] ''\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc'' may be written ''ae, oe, ue''.<ref>Robbin D. Knapp, \"German English Words: A Popular Dictionary of German Words Used in English\" (2005) p. 108: \"When German words with umlauts are assimilated into the English language, they sometimes keep their umlauts (e.g., doppelg\u00e4nger, Fl\u00fcgelhorn, f\u00f6hn, Der Freisch\u00fctz, f\u00fchrer, j\u00e4ger, k\u00fcmmel, K\u00fcnstlerroman, schweizerk\u00e4se, \u00fcber-), but often are ...\"</ref> This could be seen in many newspapers during World War II, which printed ''Fuehrer'' for ''F\u00fchrer''. However, today umlauts are usually either left out, with no ''e'' following the previous letter, or in sources with a higher [[Manual of Style]] (such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' or ''[[The Economist]]'') included as German. [[Zurich]] is an exception since it is not a case of a \"dropped umlaut\", but is a genuine [[English exonym]], used also in French (from Latin ''Turicum'') written without the umlaut even alongside other German and Swiss names that retain the umlaut in English.<ref>Diccon Bewes ''Swiss Watching'' 2012 \"In English, the most daring thing we do now is leave the umlaut off Z\u00fcrich; not that any British ear would hear the difference anyway. For other official names, such as the houses of parliament, I have given only the German version, as it's the one used most often.\"</ref>\n\n===Accent-addition and accent-removal===\nAs words are naturalized into English, sometimes diacritics are added to imported words that originally did not have any, often to distinguish them from common English words or to otherwise assist in proper pronunciation. In the cases of [[yerba mate|mat\u00e9]] from Spanish ''mate'' ({{IPAc-en|'|m|\u0251\u02d0|t|e\u026a}}; {{IPA-es|'mate|lang}}), anim\u00e9 from Japanese anime, and ''latt\u00e9'' or even ''latt\u00e8'' from Italian ''[[latte]]'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|\u0251\u02d0|t|e\u026a}}; {{IPAc-it|lang|audio=It-latte.ogg|\u02c8|l|a|t|t|e}}), an accent on the final ''e'' indicates that the word is pronounced with a long A sound (the [[diphthong]] {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-a.ogg|e\u026a}}, {{respell|AY}}) at the end, rather than the ''e'' being silent. Examples of a partial removal include resum\u00e9 (from the French r\u00e9sum\u00e9) and [[ha\u010dek]] (from the Czech h\u00e1\u010dek) because of the change in pronunciation of the initial vowels. Complete naturalization stripping all diacritics also has occurred, in words such as ''canyon'', from the Spanish ''ca\u00f1\u00f3n''. For accurate readings, some speech writers use diacritics to differentiate [[Homograph|homographs]], such as ''l\u0113ad'' (pronounced like ''leed'') and ''l\u0115ad'' (pronounced like ''led''). Not to be forgotten are adjectives such as ''learn\u00e8d'' and ''belov\u00e8d'', which are pronounced with two and three syllables respectively, unlike the past participles ''learned'' and ''beloved'', which are each pronounced with one fewer syllable.\n\n== Regional differences ==\n===Canada===\n{{See also|French language in Canada}}\nIn [[Canadian English]], words of French origin retain their orthography more often than in other English-speaking countries, such as the usage of [[\u00e9]] (e with acute) in [[caf\u00e9|''caf'''\u00e9''']], [[Montreal|Montr'''\u00e9'''al]], [[n\u00e9e|n'''\u00e9'''e]], [[Quebec|Qu'''\u00e9'''bec,]] and [[Resume|''r'''\u00e9'''sum'''\u00e9''''']]. This is due to the large influence afforded by French being one of [[Canada]]'s two official languages at the federal government level as well as at the provincial level in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Manitoba]], and the majority and sole official language in [[Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[New Zealand English]] includes words derived from the [[M\u0101ori language|Maori language]], which uses a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (M\u0101ori: ''tohut\u014d'') to indicate vowel length. In English, the vowel length of these words is indicated in three ways: no change (Maori), doubling the vowel (Maaori), or using a macron (M\u0101ori). An umlaut has sometimes been used (M\u00e4ori) in place of a macron where the technical capacity to display a macron is limited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/matauranga-hangarau-information-technology/page-3|title=M\u0101tauranga hangarau \u2013 information technology - M\u0101ori language on the internet|last=Keane|first=Basil|date=11 March 2010|website=Te Ara \u2013 Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref> Since 2000, macrons are increasingly common in New Zealand English; both of the main newspaper chains had adopted macrons in their print and online editions in May 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/96578644/why-stuff-is-introducing-macrons-for-te-reo-maori-words?rm=m?rm=m|title=Why Stuff is introducing macrons for te reo M\u0101ori words|last=Crewdson|first=Patrick|date=11 September 2017|website=Stuff.co.nz|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/horowhenua-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503788&objectid=12048013|title=Official language to receive our best efforts|date=9 May 2018|website=New Zealand Herald|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Names with diacritics==\nDiacritics are used in the names of some English-speaking people:\n* British: [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] (and other members of the [[Bront\u00eb family]]), [[No\u00ebl Coward]], [[Zo\u00eb Wanamaker]], [[Zo\u00eb Ball]], [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]], [[John le Carr\u00e9]]\n* American: [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]], [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Zo\u00eb Baird]], [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]], [[John C.

(See {{section link|English orthography|History}}.)\n\n==Types of diacritical marks==\n{{main|Diacritical marks}}\nThough limited, the following diacritical marks in English may be encountered, particularly for marking in poetry:<ref>John Lennard, ''The Poetry Handbook'' (2006), p. 57: \"Though limited in English the following may be encountered: acute (n\u00e9e) and grave (chang\u00e8d) accents, modifying vowels or marking stresses; the circumflex (entrep\u00f4t), indicating omitted s; the diaeresis (na\u00eff), preventing a diphthong, or umlaut (\u00fcber), altering Germanic vowels; the cedilla (soup\u00e7on), softening c; the ''tittle'' (fr\u014d [sic]), indicating omitted n or m, or ''macron'' (stat\u016bs), lengthening vowels; the ''tilde'' (Se\u00f1or), indicating palatalised n; and the breve (dr\u014fll = 'drol', not 'drowle'), shortening vowels....\"</ref>\n* the [[acute accent]] (n\u00e9e) and [[grave accent]] (English poetry marking, chang\u00e8d), modifying vowels or marking stresses\n* the [[circumflex]] (entrep\u00f4t), borrowed from French<!--the s was lost before it was borrowed into English-->\n* the [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (Zo\u00eb), indicating a second syllable in two consecutive vowels\n* the [[tittle]], the dot found on the regular small i and small j, is removed when another diacritic is required\n* the [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (English poetry marking, l\u0113ad pronounced 'leed', not 'led'), lengthening vowels, as in M\u0101ori; or indicating omitted n or m (in pre-[[Modern English]], both in print and in handwriting).\n* the [[breve]] (English poetry marking, dr\u014fll pronounced 'drol', not 'drowle'), shortening vowels.\n* the [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] ([[\u00fcber]]), altering Germanic vowels\n* the [[cedilla]] (soup\u00e7on), in French, Portuguese and in Catalan it is a softening c, indicating 's-' not 'k-' pronunciation\n* the [[tilde]] (Se\u00f1or), in Spanish indicating palatalised n (although in Spanish and most source languages, it is not considered a diacritic over the letter n but rather as an integral part of the distinct letter [[\u00f1]])\nIn representing European personal names, [[anthroponym]]s, and place names, [[toponym]]s, the following are often encountered:\n* the [[caron]] (as in [[Karel \u010capek]]), often also called the [[h\u00e1\u010dek]] in English (adapted from \"h\u00e1\u010dek\", the Czech name [meaning \"little hook\"]), as [[\u010c|\u010c/\u010d]], [[\u0160|\u0160/\u0161]], [[\u0158|\u0158/\u0159]] (only in Czech), [[\u017d|\u017d/\u017e]] broadly turns \"c\" \"s\" \"r\" \"z\" into English \"ch\" \"sh\" \"rzh\" \"zh\" sounds respectively, and [[\u010e|\u010e/\u010f]], [[\u013d|\u013d/\u013e]] (only in Slovak), [[\u0147|\u0147/\u0148]] and [[\u0164|\u0164/\u0165]] turn \"d\" \"l\" \"n\" and \"t\" into palatal \"dy\" \"ly\" \"ny\" and \"ty\" sounds.

The second of two vowels in a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] can be marked with a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (or \"tr\u00e9ma\") \u2013 as in words such as ''co\u00f6perative'', ''da\u00efs'' and ''re\u00eblect'' \u2013 but its use has become less common, sometimes being replaced by the use of a hyphen.<ref>[http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19981209 diaeresis: December 9, 1998].

It is often omitted in printed works because the sign is missing on modern keyboards.<ref name=\"Fowler\">{{cite book | last = Burchfield | first = R.W. | title = Fowlers's Modern English Usage | edition = 3 | year = 1996 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-869126-2 | page = [https://archive.org/details/newfowlersmodern00fowl/page/210 210] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/newfowlersmodern00fowl/page/210 }}</ref>\n\nThe acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (r\u00e9bel vs. reb\u00e9l) or nonstandard for metrical reasons (cal\u00e9ndar); the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (warn\u00e8d, parl\u00ecament).\n\n===In historical versions of English===\n\nThe [[Old English Latin alphabet]] began to replace the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Runic alphabet]] in the 8th century, due to the influence of [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Celtic Christian missionaries to the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].  The orthography of Old English \u2013 which was entirely handwritten in its own time \u2013 was not well standardized, though it did not use all the Latin letters, and included several letters not present in the modern alphabet.  When reprinted in modern times, an [[overdot]] is occasionally used with two Latin letters to differentiate sounds for the reader:\n* [[\u010b]] is used for a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate /t\u0361\u0283/\n* [[\u0121]] for a palatal approximant /j/ (probably a voiced palatal fricative /\u029d/ in the earliest texts)\n\nSome modern printings also apply diacritics to vowels following the rules of [[Old_Norse_orthography#Normalized_spelling|Old Norse normalized spelling]] developed in the 19th century.\n\nIn the Late [[Middle English]] period, the shape of the English letter [[\u00fe]] (thorn), which was derived from the Runic alphabet, evolved in some handwritten and [[blackletter]] texts to resemble the Latin letter [[y]].  The \u00fe shape survived into the era of printing presses only as far as the press of [[William Caxton]].  In later publications, thorn was represented by \"y\", or by [[\u1e8f]] to distinguish thorn from y.  By the end of the [[Early Modern English]] period, thorn had been completely replaced{{why|date=February 2018}} in contemporary usage by the [[Th (digraph)|digraph \"th\"]] (reviving a practice from early Old English), and the overdot was no longer needed outside of printings of very old texts.  The overdot is missing from the only surviving usage of a Y-shaped thorn, in the archaic stock phrase [[ye olde]] (from \"\u00fee olde\", pronounced \"the old\", but \"ye olde\" is often misanalyzed and pronounced with the modern \"y\" sound).\n\n== Words imported from other languages ==\nNon-English [[loanword]]s enter the English language by a process of naturalisation, or specifically [[anglicisation]], which is carried out mostly unconsciously (a similar process occurs in all other languages). During this process there is a tendency for accents and other diacritics that were present in the donor language to be dropped (for example French ''[[:wikt:h\u00f4tel|h\u00f4tel]]'' and French ''[[:wikt:r\u00f4le|r\u00f4le]]'' becoming \"[[hotel]]\" and \"[[role]]\" respectively in English, or French ''[[:wikt:\u00e0 propos|\u00e0 propos]]'', which lost both the accent and space to become English \"[[:wikt:apropos|apropos]]\").<ref>Bryan A. Garner, ''Garner's Modern American Usage'' (2009) p. 248: \"Sometimes they survive indefinitely, but often they fall into disuse as terms are fully naturalised. Nobody today, for example, writes h\u00f4tel or r\u00f4le.\"</ref>\n\nIn many cases, imported words can be found in print in both their accented and unaccented versions. Since modern dictionaries are mostly descriptive and no longer [[Linguistic prescription|prescribe]] outdated forms, they increasingly list unaccented forms, though some dictionaries, such as the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], do not list the unaccented variants of particular words (e.g., [[:wikt:soup\u00e7on|soup\u00e7on]]).\n\nWords that retain their accents often do so to help indicate pronunciation (e.g. ''[[frapp\u00e9 coffee|frapp\u00e9]]'', ''[[na\u00efve]]'', ''[[souffl\u00e9]]''), or to help distinguish them from an unaccented English word (e.g. ''[[expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]]'', ''[[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]'', ''[[ros\u00e9]]''). Technical terms or those associated with specific fields (especially cooking or musical terms) are less likely to lose their accents (such as the [[French language|French]] ''[[soup\u00e7on]]'', ''[[fa\u00e7ade]]'' and ''[[entr\u00e9e]]'').\n\nSome Spanish words with the Spanish letter ''[[\u00f1]]'' have been naturalised by substituting English ''ny'' (e.g. Spanish ''[[:wikt:ca\u00f1\u00f3n|ca\u00f1\u00f3n]]'' is now usually English ''[[canyon]]'', Spanish ''[[:wikt:pi\u00f1\u00f3n|pi\u00f1\u00f3n]]'' is now usually English ''[[pinyon pine]]''). Certain words like ''[[pi\u00f1ata]]'', ''[[jalape\u00f1o]]'' and ''[[quincea\u00f1era]]'' are usually kept intact. In many instances the ''\u00f1'' is replaced with the plain letter ''[[n]]''. In words of German origin, the letters with [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlauts]] ''\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc'' may be written ''ae, oe, ue''.<ref>Robbin D. Knapp, \"German English Words: A Popular Dictionary of German Words Used in English\" (2005) p. 108: \"When German words with umlauts are assimilated into the English language, they sometimes keep their umlauts (e.g., doppelg\u00e4nger, Fl\u00fcgelhorn, f\u00f6hn, Der Freisch\u00fctz, f\u00fchrer, j\u00e4ger, k\u00fcmmel, K\u00fcnstlerroman, schweizerk\u00e4se, \u00fcber-), but often are ...\"</ref> This could be seen in many newspapers during World War II, which printed ''Fuehrer'' for ''F\u00fchrer''. However, today umlauts are usually either left out, with no ''e'' following the previous letter, or in sources with a higher [[Manual of Style]] (such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' or ''[[The Economist]]'') included as German. [[Zurich]] is an exception since it is not a case of a \"dropped umlaut\", but is a genuine [[English exonym]], used also in French (from Latin ''Turicum'') written without the umlaut even alongside other German and Swiss names that retain the umlaut in English.<ref>Diccon Bewes ''Swiss Watching'' 2012 \"In English, the most daring thing we do now is leave the umlaut off Z\u00fcrich; not that any British ear would hear the difference anyway. For other official names, such as the houses of parliament, I have given only the German version, as it's the one used most often.\"</ref>\n\n===Accent-addition and accent-removal===\nAs words are naturalized into English, sometimes diacritics are added to imported words that originally did not have any, often to distinguish them from common English words or to otherwise assist in proper pronunciation. In the cases of [[yerba mate|mat\u00e9]] from Spanish ''mate'' ({{IPAc-en|'|m|\u0251\u02d0|t|e\u026a}}; {{IPA-es|'mate|lang}}), anim\u00e9 from Japanese anime, and ''latt\u00e9'' or even ''latt\u00e8'' from Italian ''[[latte]]'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|\u0251\u02d0|t|e\u026a}}; {{IPAc-it|lang|audio=It-latte.ogg|\u02c8|l|a|t|t|e}}), an accent on the final ''e'' indicates that the word is pronounced with a long A sound (the [[diphthong]] {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-a.ogg|e\u026a}}, {{respell|AY}}) at the end, rather than the ''e'' being silent. Examples of a partial removal include resum\u00e9 (from the French r\u00e9sum\u00e9) and [[ha\u010dek]] (from the Czech h\u00e1\u010dek) because of the change in pronunciation of the initial vowels. Complete naturalization stripping all diacritics also has occurred, in words such as ''canyon'', from the Spanish ''ca\u00f1\u00f3n''. For accurate readings, some speech writers use diacritics to differentiate [[Homograph|homographs]], such as ''l\u0113ad'' (pronounced like ''leed'') and ''l\u0115ad'' (pronounced like ''led''). Not to be forgotten are adjectives such as ''learn\u00e8d'' and ''belov\u00e8d'', which are pronounced with two and three syllables respectively, unlike the past participles ''learned'' and ''beloved'', which are each pronounced with one fewer syllable.\n\n== Regional differences ==\n===Canada===\n{{See also|French language in Canada}}\nIn [[Canadian English]], words of French origin retain their orthography more often than in other English-speaking countries, such as the usage of [[\u00e9]] (e with acute) in [[caf\u00e9|''caf'''\u00e9''']], [[Montreal|Montr'''\u00e9'''al]], [[n\u00e9e|n'''\u00e9'''e]], [[Quebec|Qu'''\u00e9'''bec,]] and [[Resume|''r'''\u00e9'''sum'''\u00e9''''']]. This is due to the large influence afforded by French being one of [[Canada]]'s two official languages at the federal government level as well as at the provincial level in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Manitoba]], and the majority and sole official language in [[Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[New Zealand English]] includes words derived from the [[M\u0101ori language|Maori language]], which uses a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] (M\u0101ori: ''tohut\u014d'') to indicate vowel length. In English, the vowel length of these words is indicated in three ways: no change (Maori), doubling the vowel (Maaori), or using a macron (M\u0101ori). An umlaut has sometimes been used (M\u00e4ori) in place of a macron where the technical capacity to display a macron is limited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/matauranga-hangarau-information-technology/page-3|title=M\u0101tauranga hangarau \u2013 information technology - M\u0101ori language on the internet|last=Keane|first=Basil|date=11 March 2010|website=Te Ara \u2013 Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref> Since 2000, macrons are increasingly common in New Zealand English; both of the main newspaper chains had adopted macrons in their print and online editions in May 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/96578644/why-stuff-is-introducing-macrons-for-te-reo-maori-words?rm=m?rm=m|title=Why Stuff is introducing macrons for te reo M\u0101ori words|last=Crewdson|first=Patrick|date=11 September 2017|website=Stuff.co.nz|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/horowhenua-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503788&objectid=12048013|title=Official language to receive our best efforts|date=9 May 2018|website=New Zealand Herald|access-date=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Names with diacritics==\nDiacritics are used in the names of some English-speaking people:\n* British: [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]], [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] (and other members of the [[Bront\u00eb family]]), [[No\u00ebl Coward]], [[Zo\u00eb Wanamaker]], [[Zo\u00eb Ball]], [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]], [[John le Carr\u00e9]]\n* American: [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]], [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Chlo\u00eb Sevigny]], [[Ren\u00e9e Fleming]], [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]], [[Zo\u00eb Baird]], [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]], [[John C.
