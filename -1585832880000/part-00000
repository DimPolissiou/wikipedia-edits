It is a [[master limited partnership]] operating in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) industry, primarily providing transportation and storage for those commodities. Boardwalk owns approximately {{convert|14,365|mi|km}} of natural gas and NGLs pipelines and underground storage caverns having an aggregate capacity of approximately 205 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas and {{convert|24.0|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=2}} of NGLs. Boardwalk's pipeline system originates in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas and extends north and east to the Midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and Boardwalk's NGLs pipeline and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas. Boardwalk's common units are traded under the symbol \"BWP\" on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n \nBoardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of [[Loews Corporation]], owns 100% of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners's capital.<ref name=sec10k /> The common units, class B and general partner interest indirectly owned by Loews Corporation represent approximately 53 percent of the equity interests, excluding the incentive distribution rights.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Operations==\nBoardwalk serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, local distribution companies (LDCs), marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines. Boardwalk provides a significant portion of pipeline transportation and storage services through firm contracts under which customers pay monthly capacity reservation charges (which are charges owed regardless of actual pipeline or storage capacity utilization). Other charges are based on actual utilization of the capacity under firm contracts and contracts for interruptible services. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 81% of revenues were derived from capacity reservation charges under firm contracts, approximately 12% of revenues were derived from charges based on actual utilization under firm contracts and approximately 7% of revenues were derived from interruptible transportation, interruptible storage, parking and lending (PAL) and other services.\n\nBoardwalk has the following operating subsidiaries: \n* Texas Gas Transmission, LLC\n* Gulf South Pipeline Pipeline Company, LP\n* Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company, LLC\n* Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC\n* Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC\n* Boardwalk Field Services, LLC\n\n==History==\nLoews Corporation (NYSE: L) bought Texas Gas Transmission, LLC in May 2003 and Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP in December 2004. These two interstate natural gas pipeline companies were consolidated into a new entity \u2013 Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP \u2013 which went public in 2005. Boardwalk placed into service a third interstate natural gas pipeline company, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, in 2009. In 2011, Boardwalk acquired the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage companies, which were merged into Gulf South in 2015.  In 2012, Boardwalk acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC, which diversified Boardwalk's operations into the natural gas liquids business, serving petrochemical markets in southern Louisiana.

It is a [[master limited partnership]] operating in the midstream portion of the natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) industry, primarily providing transportation and storage for those commodities. Boardwalk owns approximately {{convert|14,365|mi|km}} of natural gas and NGLs pipelines and underground storage caverns having an aggregate capacity of approximately 205 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working natural gas and {{convert|24.0|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on|sigfig=2}} of NGLs. Boardwalk's pipeline system originates in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma and Arkansas and extends north and east to the Midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, and Boardwalk's NGLs pipeline and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas.

Boardwalk provides a significant portion of pipeline transportation and storage services through firm contracts under which customers pay monthly capacity reservation charges (which are charges owed regardless of actual pipeline or storage capacity utilization). Other charges are based on actual utilization of the capacity under firm contracts and contracts for interruptible services. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, approximately 81% of revenues were derived from capacity reservation charges under firm contracts, approximately 12% of revenues were derived from charges based on actual utilization under firm contracts and approximately 7% of revenues were derived from interruptible transportation, interruptible storage, parking and lending (PAL) and other services.\n\nBoardwalk has the following operating subsidiaries: \n* Texas Gas Transmission, LLC\n* Gulf South Pipeline Pipeline Company, LP\n* Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company, LLC\n* Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC\n* Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline, LLC\n* Boardwalk Field Services, LLC\n\n==History==\nLoews Corporation (NYSE: L) bought Texas Gas Transmission, LLC in May 2003 and Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP in December 2004. These two interstate natural gas pipeline companies were consolidated into a new entity \u2013 Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP \u2013 which went public in 2005. Boardwalk placed into service a third interstate natural gas pipeline company, Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC, in 2009. In 2011, Boardwalk acquired the Petal and Hattiesburg natural gas storage companies, which were merged into Gulf South in 2015.  In 2012, Boardwalk acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, LLC, which diversified Boardwalk's operations into the natural gas liquids business, serving petrochemical markets in southern Louisiana. In 2014, Boardwalk acquired Evangeline ethylene pipeline system, further expanding Boardwalk's service offerings to petrochemical customers.

Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33\u201334,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nSome writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836\u2013885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D.

Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area.

Rawlinson (1873) believed that it is derived from the name of the Babylonian king and god [[Belus (Babylonian)|Belus]]. Dames (1904) believed that it is derived from the Persian term for [[cockscomb]], said to have been used as a crest on the helmets of Baloch troops in 6th century BCE. Herzfeld (1968) proposed that it is derived from the [[Median language|Median]] term ''brza-vaciya'', which describes a loud or aggressive way of speaking. Naseer Dashti (2012) presents another possibility, that of being derived from the name of the ethnic group 'Balaschik' living in Balashagan, between the [[Caspian Sea]] and [[Lake Van]] in present-day Turkey and Azerbaijan, who are believed to have migrated to Balochistan during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] times.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=8,&nbsp;33\u201334,&nbsp;44}} The remnants of the original name such as 'Balochuk' and 'Balochiki' are said to be still used as ethnic names in Balochistan.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nSome writers suggest a derivation from [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] words ''bal'', meaning strength, and ''och'' meaning high or magnificent.{{sfn|Dashti, The Baloch and Balochistan|2012|pp=33\u201334}} An earliest Sanskrit reference to the Baloch might be the Gwalior inscription of the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]] ruler [[Mihira Bhoja]] (r. 836\u2013885), which says that the dynasty's founder [[Nagabhata I]] repelled a powerful army of ''Valacha Mlecchas'', translated as \"Baluch foreigners\" by [[D.

Based on an analysis of the linguistic connections of the Balochi language, which is one of the [[Western Iranian languages]], the original homeland of the Balochi tribes was likely to the east or southeast of the central [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] region. The Baloch began migrating towards the east in the late [[Sasanian]] period. The cause of the migration is unknown but may have been as a result of the generally unstable conditions in the Caspian area.

They usually wear a gold brooch (''tasni'') that is made by local jewellers in different shapes and sizes and is used to fasten the two parts of the dress together over the chest. In ancient times, especially during the pre-Islamic era, it was common for Baloch women to perform [[Persian dance|dances]] and sing [[Balochi music|folk songs]] at different events. The tradition of a Baloch mother singing lullabies to her children has played an important role in the transfer of knowledge from generation to generation since ancient times. Apart from the dressing style of the Baloch, indigenous and local traditions and customs are also of great importance to the Baloch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0;wap2 |title=Baloch Society & culture |publisher=Baask.com |accessdate=7 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045319/http://baask.com/diwwan/index.php?topic=4273.0%3Bwap2 |archivedate=16 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nBaloch Culture Day is celebrated by the Balochi people annually on 2 March with festivities to celebrate their rich culture and history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/03/02/baloch-cultural-day-celebrated-with-colourful-functions-gatherings/ |title=Baloch Cultural Day celebrated with colourful functions, gatherings |date=2 March 2018 |website=Pakistan Today |publisher=Pakistan Today |access-date=21 April 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Baloch tribes==\n{{see also|List of Baloch tribes}}\n[[File:Men in Zaranj-cropped.jpg|thumb|Afghan Baloch men in [[Zaranj]], [[Nimruz Province]]]]\n\n===Tradition===\nTraditionally, [[Jalal Khan]] was the ruler and founder of the first Balochi confederacy in 12th century.

The film stars [[Frank Ram\u00edrez]], Florina Lemaitre, Humberto Dorado, Fausto Cabrera and [[Carlos Vives]]. The film is a winner of the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and the Biarritz Film Cinema Festival of Latin America. The film deals with the hardships of lower income families in Bogot\u00e1, the breach between rich and poor, and their interactions in a highly stratified social system. The film was selected as the Colombian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[67th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts with news reporter Jose Antonio Pupo (played by [[Carlos Vives]]) interviewing a man after events have taken place. The man, part of a community of [[squatters]] who had taken over a house in [[Bogot\u00e1]] which had been left derelict, reveals to the journalist that when the absentee landlord reappeared, the very house itself was moved to another location by ingenious means. The man's story is interwoven with the depiction of the events.\n\nThe building is an old mansion and it has become home to a diverse community of people. After years of occupation, they are suddenly ordered to leave by the owner, a rich obnoxious, rich man called Dr. Holguin. The inhabitants are confronted by the authorities attempting to perform an eviction, but they lock the doors and shoot at the policemen. After this confrontation, the inhabitants are given more time to find a new place to live. They are legally represented by 'Perro' Romero ([[Frank Ram\u00edrez]]). Holguin pressures Romero by having him kidnapped and beaten up. Meanwhile, Jacinto (Fausto Cabrera), an intellectual and rebellious Spaniard, devises a way to remove everything inside the house (walls, windows, bathtubs, kitchens, toilets, roofs and so on) and to transport all of it to another location. Jacinto shows Romero how it can be done by using a rope and [[pulley]], using the stage of the [[Teatro de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n theater]].\n\nJacinto is able to convince the rest of the inhabitants to help. As the house is being dismantled, Misia Triana (Delfina Guido) accidentally finds the silhouette of the [[virgin Mary]] on a wall, which persuades her to help. The squatters are eventually able to remove all the interior of the house, but in order to gain more time, Romero tells Holguin's lawyer Victor Honorio Mosquera (Humberto Dorado) that the tenants wanted to paint the house before they leave. By the time the lawyers, policemen and Dr. Holguin eagerly approach the house to confirm that the tenants have actually left, they are surprised by a huge explosion and the collapse of the house's facade. After the dust and debris have settled, they find a wall painted with the slogan \"Here's your motherfucking painted house.\" The movie ends by returning to the journalist Jose interviewing the squatter and finally the former inhabitants are shown gathered on a hill with a panoramic view of Bogot\u00e1.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Carlos Vives]] - Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pupo: A journalist who investigates Gustavo Calle's famous snail strategy.\n* [[Frank Ram\u00edrez]] - \"Perro\" Romero: A lawyer not yet graduated, also a tenant of Casa Uribe who defends the interests of his fellow tenants.

By focusing upon the inhabitants and their teamwork in moving the house and outwitting the owner, the film exposes the corruption of officials such as judges, police, lawyers and politicians in Colombia.<ref name=\"Variety-Review\">{{cite news |last1=Staff |first1=Variety |title=The Snail\u2019s Strategy |url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/the-snail-s-strategy-1200436108/ |accessdate=31 March 2020 |work=Variety |date=28 March 1994 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was originally envisioned by Ramon Jimeno as an inspiration based on a story he had read in a newspaper, about the removal of tenants in a house whose legal procedure had taken such a long time that by the time the authorities had to intervene they realized that the house no longer existed. Although Jimeno had envisioned the movie several years before it was screenwriter and actor Humberto Dorado who finally shaped it into a dense 400 pages screenplay, that eventually became the original screenplay and a blueprint for the film. \nLater after the majority of it was filmed, screenwriter Jorge Goldemberg came as an editing consultant and restructured the film, but it was not only until [[Nobel Prize]] [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] saw the pilot of the film and encouraged Sergio Cabrera to continue with the making of the film. Because of budget problems and the lack of support of the Colombian government the film took four years to be fully completed . In fact by the time the Colombian government was actually shutting down the cultural organizations that supported filmmakers such as Focine.

The film stars [[Frank Ram\u00edrez]], Florina Lemaitre, Humberto Dorado, Fausto Cabrera and [[Carlos Vives]]. The film is a winner of the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and the Biarritz Film Cinema Festival of Latin America. The film deals with the hardships of lower income families in Bogot\u00e1, the breach between rich and poor, and their interactions in a highly stratified social system. The film was selected as the Colombian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[67th Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film starts with news reporter Jose Antonio Pupo (played by [[Carlos Vives]]) interviewing a man after events have taken place. The man, part of a community of [[squatters]] who had taken over a house in [[Bogot\u00e1]] which had been left derelict, reveals to the journalist that when the absentee landlord reappeared, the very house itself was moved to another location by ingenious means. The man's story is interwoven with the depiction of the events.\n\nThe building is an old mansion and it has become home to a diverse community of people. After years of occupation, they are suddenly ordered to leave by the owner, a rich obnoxious, rich man called Dr. Holguin. The inhabitants are confronted by the authorities attempting to perform an eviction, but they lock the doors and shoot at the policemen. After this confrontation, the inhabitants are given more time to find a new place to live. They are legally represented by 'Perro' Romero ([[Frank Ram\u00edrez]]). Holguin pressures Romero by having him kidnapped and beaten up. Meanwhile, Jacinto (Fausto Cabrera), an intellectual and rebellious Spaniard, devises a way to remove everything inside the house (walls, windows, bathtubs, kitchens, toilets, roofs and so on) and to transport all of it to another location. Jacinto shows Romero how it can be done by using a rope and [[pulley]], using the stage of the [[Teatro de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n theater]].\n\nJacinto is able to convince the rest of the inhabitants to help. As the house is being dismantled, Misia Triana (Delfina Guido) accidentally finds the silhouette of the [[virgin Mary]] on a wall, which persuades her to help. The squatters are eventually able to remove all the interior of the house, but in order to gain more time, Romero tells Holguin's lawyer Victor Honorio Mosquera (Humberto Dorado) that the tenants wanted to paint the house before they leave. By the time the lawyers, policemen and Dr. Holguin eagerly approach the house to confirm that the tenants have actually left, they are surprised by a huge explosion and the collapse of the house's facade. After the dust and debris have settled, they find a a wall painted with the slogan \"Here's your motherfucking painted house.\" The movie ends by returning to the journalist Jose interviewing the squatter and finally the former inhabitants are shown gathered on a hill with a panoramic view of Bogot\u00e1.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Carlos Vives]] - Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pupo: A journalist who investigates Gustavo Calle's famous snail strategy.\n* [[Frank Ram\u00edrez]] - \"Perro\" Romero: A lawyer not yet graduated, also a tenant of Casa Uribe who defends the interests of his fellow tenants.

By focusing upon the inhabitants and their teamwork in moving the house and outwitting the owner, the film exposes the corruption of officials such as judges, police, lawyers and politicians in Colombia.<ref name=\"Variety-Review\">{{cite news |last1=Staff |first1=Variety |title=The Snail\u2019s Strategy |url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/the-snail-s-strategy-1200436108/ |accessdate=31 March 2020 |work=Variety |date=28 March 1994 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was originally envisioned by Ramon Jimeno as an inspiration based on a story he had read in a newspaper, about the removal of tenants in a house whose legal procedure had taken such a long time that by the time the authorities had to intervene they realized that the house no longer existed. Although Jimeno had envisioned the movie several years before it was screenwriter and actor Humberto Dorado who finally shaped it into a dense 400 pages screenplay, that eventually became the original screenplay and a blueprint for the film. \nLater after the majority of it was filmed, screenwriter Jorge Goldemberg came as an editing consultant and restructured the film, but it was not only until [[Nobel Prize]] [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] saw the pilot of the film and encouraged Sergio Cabrera to continue with the making of the film. Because of budget problems and the lack of support of the Colombian government the film took four years to be fully completed . In fact by the time the Colombian government was actually shutting down the cultural organizations that supported filmmakers such as Focine. The film was shot in Bogot\u00e1's downtown with several scenes filmed in the depressed areas of the eastern hills.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in Colombia on December 23, 1993.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The film has won several prizes, it was the winner of the Golden Spike in Valladolid's Film Festival and several others.
