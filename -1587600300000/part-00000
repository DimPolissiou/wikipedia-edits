It was built in 1905\u20131909 under the proposal of [[Viceroy of Zhili]] [[Yuan Shikai]] (\u8881\u4e16\u51ef) and Assistant Director-General of Railways Hu Yufen (\u80e1\u71cf\u68fb), with [[Zhan Tianyou]] (\u8a79\u5929\u4f51) or Jeme Tien Yow as engineer-in-chief. When building the railway, Zhan reduced the length of Badaling Tunnel by using a switchback''\u2014''or \u201c\u4eba\u201d-shaped rail track called in China as the shape of it resembles the Chinese character \u201c\u4eba\u201d (pinyin: ''r\u00e9n''; literally: people); he also used vertical shafts to facilitate the excavation of the tunnel.\n\nThe railway formally opened in 1909, with a total length of 201.2&nbsp;km. Starting from Liucun Village in Fengtai, it connected Beijing to Zhangjiakou via the Guan\u2019gou Valley with 14 stations, 4 tunnels and 125 bridges. In 1912, four stations with [[passing loop]]s were built in the Guan\u2019gou section. The railway was merged into Beijing-Suiyuan Railway in 1916, and later into [[Beijing\u2013Baotou railway|Beijing-Baotou Railway]] after the founding of [[China|People\u2019s Republic of China]] (PRC).\n\nThe rail tracks located within the city area of Beijing were gradually dismantled to meet the need of urban traffic. In 1995, the former [[Xizhimen]] Station (\u897f\u76f4\u95e8\u7ad9) was designated as Major Historical and Cultural Site of Beijing, and in 2013, the section between [[Nankou railway station|Nankou]] (\u5357\u53e3) and [[Badaling railway station|Badaling]] (\u516b\u8fbe\u5cad) was listed as [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nIn late 19th century, railway and mining became targets of Western powers in their colonial endeavours in China. In 1895, the [[Guangxu Emperor]] issued an imperial edict, claiming to carry out a national reform through a variety of measures, where railway construction was considered a top priority. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] thus began competing for the power to build railways in North China, but the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] rejected both of them in 1898. Around a year later in 1899, [[Claude W. Kinder|Kinder]], the British engineer-in-chief of the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] (\u5173\u5185\u5916\u94c1\u8def), carried out preliminary surveying in areas between [[Beijing]] and [[Zhangjiakou]], and this led to the rivalry between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] for the control of Inner Mongolia. [[Russia]] made a request to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] for approval of building the railway, but was refused by the latter.\n\nOn June 1, 1899, [[Russia]] forced the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] to make a commitment that it would consult Russia or Russian companies beforehand in the case that companies from any third country wanted to build railways in the north of [[Beijing]] or [[Northeast China]].\n\nAfter the [[Siege of the International Legations]], the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] signed with Britain Regulations on Britain Returning the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] (\u300a\u82f1\u56fd\u4ea4\u8fd8\u94c1\u8def\u7ae0\u7a0b\u300b) and Regulations on Following the Returning of the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] (\u300a\u5173\u5185\u5916\u94c1\u8def\u4ea4\u8fd8\u4ee5\u540e\u7ae0\u7a0b\u300b), which excluded any third country from building railways in areas within 80 miles in the north and south of the [[Shanhai Pass]] and between [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]] and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] in the north. This caused objection of [[Russia]] and [[France]], which made representations to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] on the latter Regulations. Ultimately, it was agreed that no foreign capital shall be used to build railways in the north of [[Beijing]], including the railway between [[Beijing]] and [[Zhangjiakou]], and neither the railways, if built, nor the revenue made from the railways shall be transferred to foreign countries as collateral.{{r|fifteen|page=31-32}}\n\n=== Planning ===\n\nIn 1905, [[Viceroy of Zhili]] [[Yuan Shikai|Yuanshikai]] and Assistant Director-General of Railways Hu Yufen submitted a memorial to the throne, asking for approval to build the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway. The project was expected to take 4 years at a cost of 5 million taels of silver. The [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] would contribute 1 million taels of silver annually to the budget and in return, receive 800,000 taels of silver per year from the Boxer Indemnities.{{r|two|page=271}} The proposal was approved in February the same year.{{r|fifteen|page=32-33;410}}\n\nBased on the recommendation of Liang Dunyan (\u6881\u6566\u5f66), Yuan Shikai chose [[Zhan Tianyou]] as the chief engineer.<ref name=\"twenty-one\" /> In May the same year, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] appointed Chen Zhaochang (\u9648\u662d\u5e38) as the director-general of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway and [[Zhan Tianyou]] as the assistant director-general and chief engineer. Meanwhile, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration was established in Tianjin, and a branch office was opened in [[Fuchengmen]], [[Beijing]].{{r|fifteen|page=32-33;410}} Zhan Tianyou soon led two Chinese graduates of railway engineering Xu Wenhui (\u5f90\u6587\u6d04) and Zhang Honggao (\u5f20\u9e3f\u8bf0) to carry out the surveying{{r|four|page=205}} They started in Liucun Village, and proceeded in Nankou, Guan\u2019gou, and [[Badaling]]. On May 31, they reached [[Zhangjiakou]] and tried to find a site for the Zhangjiakou Station. Before deciding the final location of the station, Zhan visited Governor-General of Chahar Pu Ting (\u6ea5\u988b) and other local officials.<ref name=\"sixteen\" />\n\n=== Construction ===\nConstruction began on October 2, 1905,{{r|eleven|page=17}} in three sections.\n\n==== Section I: [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]] (\u4e30\u53f0)\u2013[[Nankou railway station|Nankou]] (\u5357\u53e3) ====\nThis section was 55&nbsp;km long, starting from Bridge 60 of [[Beijing-Fengtian Railway]] (\u4eac\u5949\u94c1\u8def) located in the east of Fengtai Station in Liucun (\u67f3\u6751). When building the section, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway borrowed sites and facilities from the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]], and agreed, through negotiation, to pay the latte an annual rent of 200 taels of silver. On September 30, 1906, the section was fully built and put in use.{{r|fifteen|page=38}} Meanwhile, the [[Xizhimen]] Station (\u897f\u76f4\u95e8\u7ad9), designed by the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration, was established also in 1905\u20131906.{{r|six|page=483}}\n\n==== Section II: [[Nankou railway station|Nankou]]-Chadaocheng (\u5c94\u9053\u57ce) ====\nThis section was 16.5&nbsp;km long, covering the most challenging part in the Guan\u2019gou Valley (\u5173\u6c9f). To be closer to the construction site, [[Zhan Tianyou]] moved his office to [[Nankou railway station|Nankou]] (\u5357\u53e3).{{r|fifteen|page=38}} In order to satisfy the need for ballast and locomotives, a ballast factory was built in Nankou in 1906,{{efn|It was the first ballast production base in Beijing.{{r|three|page=357}}}}{{r|three|page=357}} and a locomotive factory, the Jingzhang Manufactory (\u4eac\u5f20\u5236\u9020\u5382), was established in the same year.{{efn|The manufactory was the predecessor of Beijing Nankou Locomotive and Train Factory.{{r|six|page=372}}}}{{r|six|page=372}} When building the railway going through the [[Jundu Mountains|Jundu Mountain]] (\u519b\u90fd\u5c71), [[Zhan Tianyou]] used a [[Zig zag (railway)|zigzag]],{{efn|It was also called zigzag tack in some literature.<ref name=\"eighteen\"/>}} at a high gradient of 0.033. Owed to the design, the length of the [[Badaling]] Tunnel was reduced from 1.8&nbsp;km, which was beyond the construction capacity back then, to 1.095&nbsp;km.{{r|four|page=205-206}}{{r|fifteen|page=241}} Before the excavation in [[Badaling]] began, Japanese merchant Amemiya Keijirou (\u96e8\u5bab\u656c\u6b21\u90ce) and [[Claude W. Kinder|Kinder]] recommended foreign machinery and contractors to [[Zhan Tianyou]] as a solution to the seemingly unconquerable task. Zhan, however, stood fast on using an all-Chinese team. When building the tunnel, in addition to cutting from the two sides of the mountain, Zhan also drilled two vertical [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shafts]] from the mountaintop, so that workers can excavate within the mountain on four surfaces simultaneously. Of the two [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shafts]], the bigger one was 33 m deep and 3.05 m wide. Together, they contributed to a daily excavation of 0.9 m. Also, with fans installed, the shafts could bring air to the [[tunnel]], and served, after the tunnel was finished, as [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shafts]], through which the smoke puffed by the train could run out. To accelerate the construction, workers worked in shifts. Among the 60 people in each shift, 40 were responsible for blasting and 20 for transportation.{{r|fifteen|page=38-39}} When building the rail track going through the [[Juyong Pass]] (\u5c45\u5eb8\u5173), Zhan decided to build a tunnel in the nearby mountain to avoid damaging civilian houses.<ref name=\"eighteen\" /> During the excavation, the construction team found a gorge that had probably been blocked by other people, which, together with the soft mountain rocks and soil, posed a great challenge to the construction.{{r|fifteen|page=39-40}} In 1907, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] ordered the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration to plant trees along the railway.{{r|five|page=149}} On April 14, 1908, the 367 m [[Juyong Pass|Juyongguan]] Tunnel was completed, and on May 22, the 1,090.5 m [[Badaling]] Tunnel was completed. Before that, construction work of the 141 m and 46 m tunnels in Shifosi (\u77f3\u4f5b\u5bfa) and Wuguitou (\u4e94\u6842\u5934) had been finished.{{r|fifteen|page=39-40}}\n\n==== Section III: Chadaocheng-[[Huailai County|Huailai]] (\u6000\u6765)-[[Zhangjiakou]]====\nThe section was 129.7&nbsp;km long. The construction started even before the second section was completed, and work on this section was largely accelerated by the completion of the first two sections as construction materials could be transported by rail. The major challenges in this section lied in the Huailai River Bridge (\u6000\u6765\u6cb3\u5927\u6865) and the section between Jiming Mountain (\u9e21\u9e23\u5c71) and Xiangshuipu (\u54cd\u6c34\u94fa). For the former, [[Zhan Tianyou]] built a steel truss bridge with [[Timber piles|timber-pile]] foundation and concrete [[abutment]]s; for the latter, the [[riverbed]] was raised with fillings, and cement was used to protect the track from flood damage. On July 4, the railway finally reached [[Zhangjiakou]].{{r|fifteen|page=39-40}}\n\n==== Opening ====\n[[File:\u65e7\u4e94\u6842\u5934\u96a7\u9053.jpg|thumb|267x267px|Wuguitou Tunnel; foundation damaged by flood.]]\nOn August 11, 1909, with some final work finished, the project was formally completed. On September 19, Minister of Posts and Communications [[Xu Shichang]] (\u5f90\u4e16\u660c), Director-General of Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway [[Zhan Tianyou]], and Assistant Director-General of Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Guan Mianjun (\u5173\u5195\u94a7) took the train and checked the railway section by section. A celebration tea party was held in Zhangjiakou on September 21. On September 24, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was formally opened. An opening ceremony was held in the [[Nankou railway station|Nankou Station]] on October 2,{{r|one|page=12;894}} with over 10,000 people present, including foreign diplomats in [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]], representatives of the minister of Beiyang (\u5317\u6d0b\u5927\u81e3), and senior officials of the Ministry of Post and Communications. [[Xu Shichang]], [[Zhan Tianyou]], and Zhu Junqi (\u6731\u541b\u6dc7) made speeches on the ceremony.{{r|fifteen|page=40-43}} The actual total cost of the 201.2&nbsp;km railway was 289,000 less than the initially expected 7.29 million taels of silver, and the cost per km (34,500 taels of silver) marked the lowest of all railways in China. More importantly, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]]\u2019s first and only railway that had been designed, built, and managed solely by Chinese.{{r|fifteen|page=40;423}}\n\nAfter the opening, the railway was used for various purposes, including transporting mails between [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]] and [[Zhangjiakou]].{{r|eight|page=211}} The [[Qinghe railway station]] gradually took place of the Qinghe waterway in transporting passengers and cargo.{{r|eleven|page=659}}{{r|ten|page=847}} The ballast production in Nankou ended, while the Jingzhang Manufactory expanded.{{r|six|page=372}}\n\n=== Later development ===\n[[File:1912\u5e749\u67087\u65e5\u5b59\u4e2d\u5c71\u89c6\u5bdf\u4eac\u5f20\u94c1\u8def\u65f6\u4e0e\u6b22\u8fce\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u5f20\u5bb6\u53e3\u8f66\u7ad9\u5408\u5f71.jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[Sun Yat-sen]] on inspection tour; at [[Zhangjiakou]] Station ]]\nIn 1910, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Engineering Bureau moved to [[Zhangjiakou]] under the new name of Zhangjiakou-Suiyuan Railway Engineering Bureau, to support the construction of Zhangjiakou-Suiyuan Railway (\u5f20\u7ee5\u94c1\u8def). In September 1912, [[Sun Yat-sen]] (\u5b59\u4e2d\u5c71), who resigned from the post of interim president of [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], showed great interest in railway undertaking. He met [[Yuan Shikai]] in Beijing, and took an inspection tour to [[Zhangjiakou]] by train. In 1916, as the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Authority merged into the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Authority, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway became a part of the [[Peiking\u2013Suiyuan Railway Operation|Beijing-Suiyuan Railway]]. In April 1921, the railway extended westward to [[Suiyuan]], and further to [[Baotou]] in January 1923. In 1928, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway was renamed Peking-Suiyuan Railway (\u5e73\u7ee5\u94c1\u8def), and was renamed again after the establishment of [[China|PRC]] as [[Beijing\u2013Baotou railway|Beijing-Baotou Railway]].{{r|fifteen|page=10;44-45;399}} In 1924, six kilometres of the railway near the [[Xiahuayuan District|Xiahuayuan]] Station (\u4e0b\u82b1\u56ed\u7ad9) was relocated due to flood damage. After the outbreak of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese Aggression against China]], the railway was seized by Japanese army. On July 25, 1939, ten kilometres of the railway in the Huailai section was relocated due to flood damage, and the Wuguitou Tunnel and Shifosi Tunnel were discarded also because of flood damage. In 1940, four newly built tunnels and five newly built bridges were put in use, and the ruling gradient rose from 0.333 to 0.358.{{r|fifteen|page=10;44-45}} In 1953, the railway between Kangzhuang (\u5eb7\u5e84) and Langshan (\u72fc\u5c71) was relocated.{{r|fifteen|page=44-47}} In 1960, due to the expansion of [[Tsinghua University]] (\u6e05\u534e\u5927\u5b66), the rail track in the north of [[Qinghuayuan railway station|Qinghuayuan Station]] (\u6e05\u534e\u56ed\u7ad9) was relocated to the east, and new buildings were established in the south of the original station, which turned into a freight yard.{{r|eleven|page=658}} In 1968, due to the need of Beijing\u2019s urban traffic, the railway between [[Guang'anmen|Guang\u2019anmen]] (\u5e7f\u5b89\u95e8) and [[Xizhimen]] was dismantled, while that between Liucun and [[Guang'anmen|Guang\u2019anmen]] maintained operation.{{r|fifteen|page=48}} In 2016, for the construction of [[Beijing\u2013Zhangjiakou intercity railway|Beijing-Zhangjiakou inter-city railway]], rail tracks within the Beijing city were all dismantled and the [[Qinghuayuan railway station|Qinghuayuan Station]] was closed permanently.<ref name=\"twenty-six\" />\n\n== Commemoration and conservation ==\nIn 1919, [[Zhan Tianyou]] died of disease in [[Hankou]] at age of 58. In commemoration of him, in 1922, the Chinese Engineers Society (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5b66\u4f1a), together with the Association of Colleagues of Beijing-Suiyuan Railway (\u4eac\u7ee5\u94c1\u8def\u540c\u4eba\u4f1a) and other organisations, built a 3 m high bronze statue of him in the [[Qinglongqiao railway station|Qinglongqiao Station]] (\u9752\u9f99\u6865\u7ad9). In 1926, Zhan\u2019s wife Tan Juzhen died and was buried with him.

\u4eac\u5f20\u94c1\u8def; pinyin: ''J\u012bngzh\u0101ng Ti\u011bl\u00f9''), also known as the '''Imperial Peking-Kalgan Railway''', is [[China]]\u2019s first railway that has been designed and built solely by Chinese, situated in the nation\u2019s capital [[Beijing]] and [[Zhangjiakou]] City in Hebei Province. It was built in 1905\u20131909 under the proposal of [[Viceroy of Zhili]] [[Yuan Shikai]] (\u8881\u4e16\u51ef) and Assistant Director-General of Railways Hu Yufen (\u80e1\u71cf\u68fb), with [[Zhan Tianyou]] (\u8a79\u5929\u4f51) or Jeme Tien Yow as engineer-in-chief. When building the railway, Zhan reduced the length of Badaling Tunnel by using a switchback''\u2014''or \u201c\u4eba\u201d-shaped rail track called in China as the shape of it resembles the Chinese character \u201c\u4eba\u201d (pinyin: ''r\u00e9n''; literally: people); he also used vertical shafts to facilitate the excavation of the tunnel.\n\nThe railway formally opened in 1909, with a total length of 201.2&nbsp;km. Starting from Liucun Village in Fengtai, it connected Beijing to Zhangjiakou via the Guan\u2019gou Valley with 14 stations, 4 tunnels and 125 bridges. In 1912, four stations with [[passing loop]]s were built in the Guan\u2019gou section. The railway was merged into Beijing-Suiyuan Railway in 1916, and later into [[Beijing\u2013Baotou railway|Beijing-Baotou Railway]] after the founding of [[China|People\u2019s Republic of China]] (PRC).\n\nThe rail tracks located within the city area of Beijing were gradually dismantled to meet the need of urban traffic. In 1995, the former [[Xizhimen]] Station (\u897f\u76f4\u95e8\u7ad9) was designated as Major Historical and Cultural Site of Beijing, and in 2013, the section between [[Nankou railway station|Nankou]] (\u5357\u53e3) and [[Badaling railway station|Badaling]] (\u516b\u8fbe\u5cad) was listed as [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nIn late 19th century, railway and mining became targets of Western powers in their colonial endeavours in China. In 1895, the [[Guangxu Emperor]] issued an imperial edict, claiming to carry out a national reform through a variety of measures, where railway construction was considered a top priority. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] thus began competing for the power to build railways in North China, but the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] rejected both of them in 1898. Around a year later in 1899, [[Claude W. Kinder|Kinder]], the British engineer-in-chief of the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] (\u5173\u5185\u5916\u94c1\u8def), carried out preliminary surveying in areas between [[Beijing]] and [[Zhangjiakou]], and this led to the rivalry between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Russia]] for the control of Inner Mongolia. [[Russia]] made a request to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] for approval of building the railway, but was refused by the latter.\n\nOn June 1, 1899, [[Russia]] forced the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] to make a commitment that it would consult Russia or Russian companies beforehand in the case that companies from any third country wanted to build railways in the north of [[Beijing]] or [[Northeast China]].\n\nAfter the [[Siege of the International Legations]], the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] signed with Britain Regulations on Britain Returning the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] (\u300a\u82f1\u56fd\u4ea4\u8fd8\u94c1\u8def\u7ae0\u7a0b\u300b) and Regulations on Following the Returning of the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] (\u300a\u5173\u5185\u5916\u94c1\u8def\u4ea4\u8fd8\u4ee5\u540e\u7ae0\u7a0b\u300b), which excluded any third country from building railways in areas within 80 miles in the north and south of the [[Shanhai Pass]] and between [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]] and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] in the north. This caused objection of [[Russia]] and [[France]], which made representations to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] on the latter Regulations. Ultimately, it was agreed that no foreign capital shall be used to build railways in the north of [[Beijing]], including the railway between [[Beijing]] and [[Zhangjiakou]], and neither the railways, if built, nor the revenue made from the railways shall be transferred to foreign countries as collateral.{{r|fifteen|page=31-32}}\n\n=== Planning ===\n\nIn 1905, [[Viceroy of Zhili]] [[Yuan Shikai|Yuanshikai]] and Assistant Director-General of Railways Hu Yufen submitted a memorial to the throne, asking for approval to build the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway. The project was expected to take 4 years at a cost of 5 million taels of silver. The [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]] would contribute 1 million taels of silver annually to the budget and in return, receive 800,000 taels of silver per year from the Boxer Indemnities.{{r|two|page=271}} The proposal was approved in February the same year.{{r|fifteen|page=32-33;410}}\n\nBased on the recommendation of Liang Dunyan (\u6881\u6566\u5f66), Yuan Shikai chose [[Zhan Tianyou]] as the chief engineer.<ref name=\"twenty-one\" /> In May the same year, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] appointed Chen Zhaochang (\u9648\u662d\u5e38) as the director-general of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway and [[Zhan Tianyou]] as the assistant director-general and chief engineer. Meanwhile, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration was established in Tianjin, and a branch office was opened in [[Fuchengmen]], [[Beijing]].{{r|fifteen|page=32-33;410}} Zhan Tianyou soon led two Chinese graduates of railway engineering Xu Wenhui (\u5f90\u6587\u6d04) and Zhang Honggao (\u5f20\u9e3f\u8bf0) to carry out the surveying{{r|four|page=205}} They started in Liucun Village, and proceeded in Nankou, Guan\u2019gou, and [[Badaling]]. On May 31, they reached [[Zhangjiakou]] and tried to find a site for the Zhangjiakou Station. Before deciding the final location of the station, Zhan visited Governor-General of Chahar Pu Ting (\u6ea5\u988b) and other local officials.<ref name=\"sixteen\" />\n\n=== Construction ===\nConstruction began on October 2, 1905,{{r|eleven|page=17}} in three sections.\n\n==== Section I: [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]] (\u4e30\u53f0)\u2013[[Nankou railway station|Nankou]] (\u5357\u53e3) ====\nThis section was 55&nbsp;km long, starting from Bridge 60 of [[Beijing-Fengtian Railway]] (\u4eac\u5949\u94c1\u8def) located in the east of Fengtai Station in Liucun (\u67f3\u6751). When building the section, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway borrowed sites and facilities from the [[Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China|Imperial Railways of North China]], and agreed, through negotiation, to pay the latte an annual rent of 200 taels of silver. On September 30, 1906, the section was fully built and put in use.{{r|fifteen|page=38}} Meanwhile, the [[Xizhimen]] Station (\u897f\u76f4\u95e8\u7ad9), designed by the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration, was established also in 1905\u20131906.{{r|six|page=483}}\n\n==== Section II: [[Nankou railway station|Nankou]]-Chadaocheng (\u5c94\u9053\u57ce) ====\nThis section was 16.5&nbsp;km long, covering the most challenging part in the Guan\u2019gou Valley (\u5173\u6c9f). To be closer to the construction site, [[Zhan Tianyou]] moved his office to [[Nankou railway station|Nankou]] (\u5357\u53e3).{{r|fifteen|page=38}} In order to satisfy the need for ballast and locomotives, a ballast factory was built in Nankou in 1906,{{efn|It was the first ballast production base in Beijing.{{r|three|page=357}}}}{{r|three|page=357}} and a locomotive factory, the Jingzhang Manufactory (\u4eac\u5f20\u5236\u9020\u5382), was established in the same year.{{efn|The manufactory was the predecessor of Beijing Nankou Locomotive and Train Factory.{{r|six|page=372}}}}{{r|six|page=372}} When building the railway going through the [[Jundu Mountains|Jundu Mountain]] (\u519b\u90fd\u5c71), [[Zhan Tianyou]] used a [[Zig zag (railway)|zigzag]],{{efn|It was also called zigzag tack in some literature.<ref name=\"eighteen\"/>}} at a high gradient of 0.033. Owed to the design, the length of the [[Badaling]] Tunnel was reduced from 1.8&nbsp;km, which was beyond the construction capacity back then, to 1.095&nbsp;km.{{r|four|page=205-206}}{{r|fifteen|page=241}} Before the excavation in [[Badaling]] began, Japanese merchant Amemiya Keijirou (\u96e8\u5bab\u656c\u6b21\u90ce) and [[Claude W. Kinder|Kinder]] recommended foreign machinery and contractors to [[Zhan Tianyou]] as a solution to the seemingly unconquerable task. Zhan, however, stood fast on using an all-Chinese team. When building the tunnel, in addition to cutting from the two sides of the mountain, Zhan also drilled two vertical [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shafts]] from the mountaintop, so that workers can excavate within the mountain on four surfaces simultaneously. Of the two [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shafts]], the bigger one was 33 m deep and 3.05 m wide. Together, they contributed to a daily excavation of 0.9 m. Also, with fans installed, the shafts could bring air to the [[tunnel]], and served, after the tunnel was finished, as [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] [[Shaft (civil engineering)|shafts]], through which the smoke puffed by the train could run out. To accelerate the construction, workers worked in shifts. Among the 60 people in each shift, 40 were responsible for blasting and 20 for transportation.{{r|fifteen|page=38-39}} When building the rail track going through the [[Juyong Pass]] (\u5c45\u5eb8\u5173), Zhan decided to build a tunnel in the nearby mountain to avoid damaging civilian houses.<ref name=\"eighteen\" /> During the excavation, the construction team found a gorge that had probably been blocked by other people, which, together with the soft mountain rocks and soil, posed a great challenge to the construction.{{r|fifteen|page=39-40}} In 1907, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing government]] ordered the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Administration to plant trees along the railway.{{r|five|page=149}} On April 14, 1908, the 367 m [[Juyong Pass|Juyongguan]] Tunnel was completed, and on May 22, the 1,090.5 m [[Badaling]] Tunnel was completed. Before that, construction work of the 141 m and 46 m tunnels in Shifosi (\u77f3\u4f5b\u5bfa) and Wuguitou (\u4e94\u6842\u5934) had been finished.{{r|fifteen|page=39-40}}\n\n==== Section III: Chadaocheng-[[Huailai County|Huailai]] (\u6000\u6765)-[[Zhangjiakou]]====\nThe section was 129.7&nbsp;km long. The construction started even before the second section was completed, and work on this section was largely accelerated by the completion of the first two sections as construction materials could be transported by rail. The major challenges in this section lied in the Huailai River Bridge (\u6000\u6765\u6cb3\u5927\u6865) and the section between Jiming Mountain (\u9e21\u9e23\u5c71) and Xiangshuipu (\u54cd\u6c34\u94fa). For the former, [[Zhan Tianyou]] built a steel truss bridge with [[Timber piles|timber-pile]] foundation and concrete [[abutment]]s; for the latter, the [[riverbed]] was raised with fillings, and cement was used to protect the track from flood damage. On July 4, the railway finally reached [[Zhangjiakou]].{{r|fifteen|page=39-40}}\n\n==== Opening ====\n[[File:\u65e7\u4e94\u6842\u5934\u96a7\u9053.jpg|thumb|267x267px|Wuguitou Tunnel; foundation damaged by flood.]]\nOn August 11, 1909, with some final work finished, the project was formally completed. On September 19, Minister of Posts and Communications [[Xu Shichang]] (\u5f90\u4e16\u660c), Director-General of Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway [[Zhan Tianyou]], and Assistant Director-General of Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Guan Mianjun (\u5173\u5195\u94a7) took the train and checked the railway section by section. A celebration tea party was held in Zhangjiakou on September 21. On September 24, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was formally opened. An opening ceremony was held in the [[Nankou railway station|Nankou Station]] on October 2,{{r|one|page=12;894}} with over 10,000 people present, including foreign diplomats in [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]], representatives of the minister of Beiyang (\u5317\u6d0b\u5927\u81e3), and senior officials of the Ministry of Post and Communications. [[Xu Shichang]], [[Zhan Tianyou]], and Zhu Junqi (\u6731\u541b\u6dc7) made speeches on the ceremony.{{r|fifteen|page=40-43}} The actual total cost of the 201.2&nbsp;km railway was 289,000 less than the initially expected 7.29 million taels of silver, and the cost per km (34,500 taels of silver) marked the lowest of all railways in China. More importantly, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway was [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]]\u2019s first and only railway that had been designed, built, and managed solely by Chinese.{{r|fifteen|page=40;423}}\n\nAfter the opening, the railway was used for various purposes, including transporting mails between [[Fengtai District|Fengtai]] and [[Zhangjiakou]].{{r|eight|page=211}} The [[Qinghe railway station]] gradually took place of the Qinghe waterway in transporting passengers and cargo.{{r|eleven|page=659}}{{r|ten|page=847}} The ballast production in Nankou ended, while the Jingzhang Manufactory expanded.{{r|six|page=372}}\n\n=== Later development ===\n[[File:1912\u5e749\u67087\u65e5\u5b59\u4e2d\u5c71\u89c6\u5bdf\u4eac\u5f20\u94c1\u8def\u65f6\u4e0e\u6b22\u8fce\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u5f20\u5bb6\u53e3\u8f66\u7ad9\u5408\u5f71.jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[Sun Yat-sen]] on inspection tour; at [[Zhangjiakou]] Station ]]\nIn 1910, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Engineering Bureau moved to [[Zhangjiakou]] under the new name of Zhangjiakou-Suiyuan Railway Engineering Bureau, to support the construction of Zhangjiakou-Suiyuan Railway (\u5f20\u7ee5\u94c1\u8def). In September 1912, [[Sun Yat-sen]] (\u5b59\u4e2d\u5c71), who resigned from the post of interim president of [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], showed great interest in railway undertaking. He met [[Yuan Shikai]] in Beijing, and took an inspection tour to [[Zhangjiakou]] by train. In 1916, as the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway Authority merged into the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Authority, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway became a part of the [[Peiking\u2013Suiyuan Railway Operation|Beijing-Suiyuan Railway]]. In April 1921, the railway extended westward to [[Suiyuan]], and further to [[Baotou]] in January 1923. In 1928, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway was renamed Peking-Suiyuan Railway (\u5e73\u7ee5\u94c1\u8def), and was renamed again after the establishment of [[China|PRC]] as [[Beijing\u2013Baotou railway|Beijing-Baotou Railway]].{{r|fifteen|page=10;44-45;399}} In 1924, six kilometres of the railway near the [[Xiahuayuan District|Xiahuayuan]] Station (\u4e0b\u82b1\u56ed\u7ad9) was relocated due to flood damage. After the outbreak of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese Aggression against China]], the railway was seized by Japanese army. On July 25, 1939, ten kilometres of the railway in the Huailai section was relocated due to flood damage, and the Wuguitou Tunnel and Shifosi Tunnel were discarded also because of flood damage. In 1940, four newly built tunnels and five newly built bridges were put in use, and the ruling gradient rose from 0.333 to 0.358.{{r|fifteen|page=10;44-45}} In 1953, the railway between Kangzhuang (\u5eb7\u5e84) and Langshan (\u72fc\u5c71) was relocated.{{r|fifteen|page=44-47}} In 1960, due to the expansion of [[Tsinghua University]] (\u6e05\u534e\u5927\u5b66), the rail track in the north of [[Qinghuayuan railway station|Qinghuayuan Station]] (\u6e05\u534e\u56ed\u7ad9) was relocated to the east, and new buildings were established in the south of the original station, which turned into a freight yard.{{r|eleven|page=658}} In 1968, due to the need of Beijing\u2019s urban traffic, the railway between [[Guang'anmen|Guang\u2019anmen]] (\u5e7f\u5b89\u95e8) and [[Xizhimen]] was dismantled, while that between Liucun and [[Guang'anmen|Guang\u2019anmen]] maintained operation.{{r|fifteen|page=48}} In 2016, for the construction of [[Beijing\u2013Zhangjiakou intercity railway|Beijing-Zhangjiakou inter-city railway]], rail tracks within the Beijing city were all dismantled and the [[Qinghuayuan railway station|Qinghuayuan Station]] was closed permanently.<ref name=\"twenty-six\" />\n\n== Commemoration and conservation ==\nIn 1919, [[Zhan Tianyou]] died of disease in [[Hankou]] at age of 58. In commemoration of him, in 1922, the Chinese Engineers Society (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5b66\u4f1a), together with the Association of Colleagues of Beijing-Suiyuan Railway (\u4eac\u7ee5\u94c1\u8def\u540c\u4eba\u4f1a) and other organisations, built a 3 m high bronze statue of him in the [[Qinglongqiao railway station|Qinglongqiao Station]] (\u9752\u9f99\u6865\u7ad9). In 1926, Zhan\u2019s wife Tan Juzhen died and was buried with him. In 1982, the [[Ministry of Railways (China)|Ministry of Railways of PRC]], the [[Beijing Railway Bureau|Beijing Railway Administration]], and the China Railway Society moved their tomb in Baiwanzhaung
