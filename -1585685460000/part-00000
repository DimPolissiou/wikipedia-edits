Jimmy represents him at his arraignment and Lalo is remanded. He directs Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so he will not go to trial, promising that if successful, Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\".

Gus later meets with Peter and Lydia to update them on the status of the meth lab and warns them that Lalo remains a threat even while incarcerated. Peter panics, and Gus calms him by reminding him of their shared experience in Santiago. On his return, Gus and Nacho protect Nacho's role as the mole inside the Salamanca organization by vandalizing Gus's flagship restaurant, then set a delayed explosion that burns it.\n\nGus wants Lalo released, so Mike provides Jimmy details about the investigative work he did under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the information at the bail hearing to accuse police of witness tampering. The judge grants bail at {{USD|7 million}} cash, which Lalo tells a shocked Jimmy he can pay.\n\nHoward approaches Jimmy about working at HHM and Jimmy says he is still considering it.

Becoming known as a scholar in [[urban planning]], she taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at [[UCLA]], and in 1966 asked him to visit [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with her. The two were married in [[Santa Monica, California]], on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to [[Philadelphia]] in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969.  Denise Scott Brown later taught at [[Yale University]], where she developed courses that encouraged architects to study problems in the built environment employing both traditional empirical methods of social science but also media studies and pop culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

The book published studies of the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at [[Yale]]'s School of Architecture and Planning. The book coined the terms \"Duck\" and \"Decorated Shed\" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning.  The book joined Venturi's previous ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and [[vernacular architecture]].  \n\nScott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the [[Bryn Mawr College]] plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last1=von Moos|first1=Stanislaus|title=Venturi Scott Brown & Associates Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998|date=1999|publisher=The Monacelli Press|location=New York}}</ref>\nScott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as \u201cFFF studios.\u201d In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment.<ref name=\"Out of the Ordinary\">{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Hiesinger|first3=Kathryn B.|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Department of Publishing|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}</ref> For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the [[Nikko Hotels|Nikko hotel chain]] are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical [[kimono]] patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior \u201cstreet\u201d complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nWith the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design.<ref name=\"Out of the Ordinary\"/> She has also served as principal-in-charge with [[Robert Venturi]] on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the [[Sainsbury Wing]] of [[London National Gallery|London's National Gallery]], the capitol building in [[Toulouse]] and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|title=VSBA Homepage|access-date=2006-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015154318/http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|archive-date=2006-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Pritzker Prize controversy===\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right\n | headerimage= [[File:Benjamin Franklin House Outline.jpg|210px]]\n | video1 = {{YouTube|aWHMTbaR4uw|2016 AIA Gold Medal: Denise Scott Brown, Hon.

Scott Brown left the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Becoming known as a scholar in [[urban planning]], she taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at [[UCLA]], and in 1966 asked him to visit [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with her. The two were married in [[Santa Monica, California]], on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to [[Philadelphia]] in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969.  Denise Scott Brown later taught at [[Yale University]], where she developed courses that encouraged architects to study problems in the built environment employing both traditional empirical methods of social science but also media studies and pop culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

The book published studies of the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at [[Yale]]'s School of Architecture and Planning. The book coined the terms \"Duck\" and \"Decorated Shed\" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning.  The book joined Venturi's previous ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and [[vernacular architecture]].  \n\nScott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the [[Bryn Mawr College]] plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite book|last1=von Moos|first1=Stanislaus|title=Venturi Scott Brown & Associates Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998|date=1999|publisher=The Monacelli Press|location=New York}}</ref>\nScott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as \u201cFFF studios.\u201d In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment.<ref name=\"Out of the Ordinary\">{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Hiesinger|first3=Kathryn B.|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Department of Publishing|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}</ref> For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the [[Nikko Hotels|Nikko hotel chain]] are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical [[kimono]] patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior \u201cstreet\u201d complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nWith the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design.<ref name=\"Out of the Ordinary\"/> She has also served as principal-in-charge with [[Robert Venturi]] on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the [[Sainsbury Wing]] of [[London National Gallery|London's National Gallery]], the capitol building in [[Toulouse]] and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|title=VSBA Homepage|access-date=2006-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015154318/http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|archive-date=2006-10-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Pritzker Prize controversy===\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right\n | headerimage= [[File:Benjamin Franklin House Outline.jpg|210px]]\n | video1 = {{YouTube|aWHMTbaR4uw|2016 AIA Gold Medal: Denise Scott Brown, Hon.

Canadian-style sign, rather than an MUTCD-standard one as would be used in the US''</small>]]\n* All main countries, except for the United States and the United Kingdom, use the [[metric system|metric]] system. Some countries mark this fact by using units on various signs.  Note that some smaller English-speaking countries in the Caribbean also use miles per hour.  \n** Ireland, parts of Canada ([[British Columbia]], parts of [[Ontario]], and [[Yukon]]), and Liberia<ref name=\"Liberia speed limits\" /> list units (km/h) on their [[Speed limit|maximum speed limit]] signs. In Canada and Ireland, this is a reflection of (somewhat) recent transitions from [[Imperial units|Imperial]] to metric.\n** Advisory speed limit signs in most countries list units, although New Zealand does not. The US lists units in [[Miles per hour|mph]].\n** Height, weight, and width restrictions are almost always accompanied by units ([[tonne]]s or [[metre]]s); in the US, the [[short ton]] is used with no distinction from metric tonnes.\n** Signs in some parts of Canada near the US border often include both metric and Imperial units, to remind American drivers that they are entering metric countries. No such equivalent exists in the US.<ref name=bc>[http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/eng_publications/electrical/most_pm.pdf  British Columbia Manual of Standard Traffic Signs & Pavement Markings]</ref>\n* The US was, at one time, planning a [[Metrication in the United States|transition to the metric system]]. The [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975 started the process, but the abolition of the United States Metric Board in 1982 significantly hampered conversion. Nevertheless, the MUTCD specifies metric versions of speed limit signs. Furthermore, [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]] is partially signed in metric.\n\n=== Color differences ===\n\n==== Warning signs ====\n\n[[File:Sheep sign.jpg|thumb|right|Sheep road sign in the [[United Kingdom]].]]\n\n[[File:Road Warning signs around the World.svg|thumbnail|right|Countries in yellow use MUTCD-style diamond warning signs. Click for large image and detailed info key.]]\n* Most warning signs are diamond-shaped and yellow or red-bordered triangular warning signs; some warning signs may be fluorescent yellow-green in order to draw extra attention. There are a few exceptions to this:\n** Pentagonal signs are used in school zones in the United States, Liberia, and many areas in Canada.  In the [[Philippines]], pentagonal signs are permanently used for pedestrian crossings.\n* Warning signs may be text-only.\n\n==== Road works and construction ====\n\n* Most countries use orange or yellow diamond-shaped signs or yellow, orange or white red-bordered triangular warning signs for construction zones. Australia and the [[Philippines]] use rectangular signs that fit into temporary casings.\n\n==== Regulatory signs ====\n\n* Prohibitory and restrictive signs are classified as regulatory signs.\n* Almost all prohibitory signs use a red circle with a slash. Restrictive signs typically use a red circle, as in Europe. Some may be seated on a rectangular white background.\n** The original MUTCD prohibitory and restrictive signs were text-only (i.e. NO LEFT TURN).<ref name=mutcdhist>[https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ghawkins/MUTCD-History.htm  MUTCD History]</ref> Some of these signs continue to be used in the US.\n* Yield signs can be blank or have text with the legend \"YIELD\" or \"GIVE WAY\" depending on which country it is.\n* The No Entry / Do Not Enter sign may or may not feature text. In Ireland, an upwards-pointing arrow contained within a slashed red circle is used instead. Some countries have those two signs separated.\n** The Latin American-style do not proceed straight sign may take a different meaning in countries with standard No Entry signs. Typically, it indicates an intersection where traffic cannot continue straight ahead, but where cross-traffic may enter the street from the right (or left). Thus, it is distinguished from a No Entry (for all vehicles) sign.\n\n\n==== Mandatory or permitted-action signs ====\n\n[[File:Mandatory signs around the world.svg|thumbnail|right|Various color schemes for mandatory signs. Click for large image and detailed info key.]]\n* The design of mandatory signs varies widely, since the MUTCD does not specify their use.<ref name=mutcd>[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009/mutcd2009edition.pdf  Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2009 Edition]</ref> Rather, the MUTCD's equivalent are classified as regulatory signs.\n** Some countries use simple arrows with the text \"ONLY\" or its equivalent underneath. This is the US and Australian standard.\n** Some countries use European-style white-on-blue circular signs. These are \"Type A Mandatory Signs\" as prescribed by the Vienna Convention.\n** Some [[Latin America]]n countries use red-bordered circular signs, in the same style as regulatory signs.

limits.png|thumb|left|Imperial measurements reminder in [[Northern Ireland]] when entering from the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic]]]]\n[[File:BC Road Sign I-106-100.svg|thumbnail|right|Road sign used in [[British Columbia]], Canada, near the Canada\u2013US border to remind American drivers that Canada uses the metric system.<br /><small>''Note that the imperial speed limit (left) is shown using a Canadian-style sign, rather than an MUTCD-standard one as would be used in the US''</small>]]\n* All main countries, except for the United States and the United Kingdom, use the [[metric system|metric]] system. Some countries mark this fact by using units on various signs.  Note that some smaller English-speaking countries in the Caribbean also use miles per hour.  \n** Ireland, parts of Canada ([[British Columbia]], parts of [[Ontario]], and [[Yukon]]), and Liberia<ref name=\"Liberia speed limits\" /> list units (km/h) on their [[Speed limit|maximum speed limit]] signs. In Canada and Ireland, this is a reflection of (somewhat) recent transitions from [[Imperial units|Imperial]] to metric.\n** Advisory speed limit signs in most countries list units, although New Zealand does not. The US lists units in [[Miles per hour|mph]].\n** Height, weight, and width restrictions are almost always accompanied by units ([[tonne]]s or [[metre]]s); in the US, the [[short ton]] is used with no distinction from metric tonnes.\n** Signs in some parts of Canada near the US border often include both metric and Imperial units, to remind American drivers that they are entering metric countries. No such equivalent exists in the US.<ref name=bc>[http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/eng_publications/electrical/most_pm.pdf  British Columbia Manual of Standard Traffic Signs & Pavement Markings]</ref>\n* The US was, at one time, planning a [[Metrication in the United States|transition to the metric system]]. The [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975 started the process, but the abolition of the United States Metric Board in 1982 significantly hampered conversion. Nevertheless, the MUTCD specifies metric versions of speed limit signs. Furthermore, [[Interstate 19]] in [[Arizona]] is partially signed in metric.\n\n=== Color differences ===\n\n==== Warning signs ====\n\n[[File:Sheep sign.jpg|thumb|right|Sheep road sign in the [[United Kingdom]].]]\n\n[[File:Road Warning signs around the World.svg|thumbnail|right|Countries in yellow use MUTCD-style diamond warning signs. Click for large image and detailed info key.]]\n* Most warning signs are diamond-shaped and yellow or red-bordered triangular warning signs; some warning signs may be fluorescent yellow-green in order to draw extra attention. There are a few exceptions to this:\n** Pentagonal signs are used in school zones in the United States, Liberia, and many areas in Canada.  In the [[Philippines]], pentagonal signs are permanently used for pedestrian crossings.\n* Warning signs may be text-only.\n\n==== Road works and construction ====\n\n* Most countries use orange or yellow diamond-shaped signs or yellow, orange or white red-bordered triangular warning signs for construction zones. Australia and the [[Philippines]] use rectangular signs that fit into temporary casings.\n\n==== Regulatory signs ====\n\n* Prohibitory and restrictive signs are classified as regulatory signs.\n* Almost all prohibitory signs use a red circle with a slash. Restrictive signs typically use a red circle, as in Europe. Some may be seated on a rectangular white background.\n** The original MUTCD prohibitory and restrictive signs were text-only (i.e. NO LEFT TURN).<ref name=mutcdhist>[https://ceprofs.civil.tamu.edu/ghawkins/MUTCD-History.htm  MUTCD History]</ref> Some of these signs continue to be used in the US.\n* Yield signs can be blank or have text with the legend \"YIELD\" or \"GIVE WAY\" depending on which country it is.\n* The No Entry / Do Not Enter sign may or may not feature text. In Ireland, an upwards-pointing arrow contained within a slashed red circle is used instead. Some countries have those two signs separated.\n** The Latin American-style do not proceed straight sign may take a different meaning in countries with standard No Entry signs. Typically, it indicates an intersection where traffic cannot continue straight ahead, but where cross-traffic may enter the street from the right (or left). Thus, it is distinguished from a No Entry (for all vehicles) sign.\n\n\n==== Mandatory or permitted-action signs ====\n\n[[File:Mandatory signs around the world.svg|thumbnail|right|Various color schemes for mandatory signs. Click for large image and detailed info key.]]\n* The design of mandatory signs varies widely, since the MUTCD does not specify their use.<ref name=mutcd>[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/pdfs/2009/mutcd2009edition.pdf  Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, 2009 Edition]</ref> Rather, the MUTCD's equivalent are classified as regulatory signs.\n** Some countries use simple arrows with the text \"ONLY\" or its equivalent underneath. This is the US and Australian standard.\n** Some countries use European-style white-on-blue circular signs. These are \"Type A Mandatory Signs\" as prescribed by the Vienna Convention.\n** Some [[Latin America]]n countries use red-bordered circular signs, in the same style as regulatory signs. These are \"Type B Mandatory Signs\" as prescribed by the Vienna Convention.

Authors who developed them are listed below sorted by movement.\n\nWhile most authors listed below are primarily [[philosophers]], also included here are some [[Russian literature|Russian fiction]] writers, such as [[Tolstoy]] and [[Dostoyevsky]], who are also known as philosophers.\n\nRussian [[philosophy]] as a separate entity started its development in the [[History of Russia (1892\u20131917)|19th century]], defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing [[Russia]] as a unique civilization. The latter group included [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]]. The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy.\n\nIn its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to [[literature]] and interest in [[creativity]], [[society]], [[politics]] and [[nationalism]]; [[Russian cosmism|cosmos]] and [[religion]] were other notable subjects.\n\nNotable  philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include  [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Vasily Rozanov]],  [[Lev Shestov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].\n\nFrom the early 1920s to late 1980s, Russian philosophy was dominated by [[Marxism]] presented as dogma and not grounds for discussion. Stalin's purges, culminating in 1937, delivered a deadly blow to the development of philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nA handful of dissident philosophers survived through the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period, among them [[Aleksei Losev]]. Stalin's death in 1953 gave way for new schools of thought to spring up, among them Moscow Logic Circle, and [[Tartu-Moscow Semiotic School]].\n\n== Major thinkers ==\n\n===[[Russian Enlightenment]]===\n\n*[[Vasily Tatishchev]] (1686\u20131750)\n*[[Mikhail Shcherbatov]] (1733\u20131790)\n*[[Andrey Bolotov]] (1738\u20131833)\n*[[Alexander Radishchev]] (1749\u20131802)\n\n===[[Slavophile]]s and [[pochvennichestvo]]===\n*[[Ivan Kireyevsky]] (1806\u20131856)\n*[[Aleksey Khomyakov]] (1804\u20131860)\n*[[Vladimir Odoyevsky]] (1803\u20131869)\n*[[Konstantin Aksakov]] (1817\u20131860)\n*[[Yuri Samarin]] (1819\u20131876)\n*[[Fyodor Tyutchev]] (1803\u20131873)\n*[[Nikolay Danilevsky]] (1822\u20131885)\n*[[Nikolay Strakhov]] (1828\u20131896)\n*[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] (1821\u20131881) ''Religious philosopher artist (see [[Nikolai Berdyaev]])''\n*[[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]] (1827\u20131907)\n*[[Konstantin Leontiev]] (1831\u20131891)\n* [[Ivan Ilyin]] (1883\u20131954)\n\n===[[Russian symbolism|Russian symbolists]]===\n*[[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]] (1866\u20131941)\n*[[Zinaida Gippius]] (1869\u20131945)\n*[[Valery Bryusov]] (1873\u20131924)\n*[[Konstantin Balmont]] (1867\u20131942)\n*[[Maximilian Voloshin|Max Voloshin]] (1877\u20131932)\n*[[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] (1874\u20131940)\n*[[Alexander Blok]] (1880\u20131921)\n*[[Andrei Bely]] (1880\u20131934)\n*[[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] (1866\u20131949)\n*[[Innokenty Annensky]] (1855\u20131909)\n*[[Fyodor Sologub]] (1863\u20131927)\n\n===[[Westernizer]]s===\n*[[Pyotr Chaadayev]] (1794\u20131856)\n*[[Nikolai Stankevich]] (1813\u20131840)\n*[[Vissarion Belinsky]] (1811\u20131848)\n*[[Alexander Herzen]] (1812\u20131870) ''Father of Russian Socialism''\n\n===Russian Schellingians<!--'Russian Schellingians' and 'Russian Schellingianism' redirect here-->===\n*[[Pyotr Chaadayev]] (1794\u20131856)\n*[[Dmitry Venevitinov]] (1805\u20131827)\n*[[Vissarion Belinsky]] (1811\u20131848)\n*[[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]] (1853\u20131900)\n\n===Russian [[Positivism|positivists]]===\n*[[Peter Lavrovich Lavrov]] (1823\u20131900)\n*[[Grigorii Nikolayevich Vyrubov|Grigory Vyrubov]] (1843\u20131913)\n*[[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] (1842\u20131910)\n*[[Konstantin Kavelin]] (1818\u20131885)\n*[[Nikolai Korkunov]] (1853\u20131904)\n\n====[[Russian Machism|Russian Machists]]====\n*[[Vladimir Bazarov]]\n*[[Jakov Berman]]\n*[[Alexander Bogdanov]] (1873\u20131928)\n*[[Sergei Suvorov]]\n*[[Pavel Yushkevich]]\n\n===[[Russian cosmism|Russian cosmists]]===\n[[Image:Volition-of-the-Cosmos.jpg|thumb|The cover of the book \"The Will of the Universe.

These apply automatically in the absence of 'posted' speed restriction signage.  The two default speed limits are:\n* within built-up areas, {{convert|50|km/h|mph}}, except for the Northern Territory which remains at {{convert|60|km/h|mph}}\n* outside built-up areas, {{convert|100|km/h|mph}}; two exceptions are Western Australia and the Northern Territory at {{convert|110|km/h|mph}}\n\nCommon speed zones below the default built up area 50&nbsp;km/h limit are:\n* Shared zones (signposted areas where pedestrians and motorised traffic share the same space) are {{convert|10|km/h|mph}}.\n* [[School zone]]s are variable speed zones, with a {{convert|40|km/h|mph}} limit applying during [[gazette]]d school terms (which may include pupil-free days)<ref>http://smh.drive.com.au/schools-out-but-cameras-on-duty-20110716-1hj01.html</ref> and at specific times of the day when children are expected to be present.  In South Australia, the limit is {{convert|25|km/h|mph}}.  A minority of school zones have flashing lights to indicate when the lower speed limit applies.\n* 40&nbsp;km/h zones. A number of local governments have implemented lower speed limits, typically 40&nbsp;km/h, in certain areas, such as shopping precincts, whole suburbs such as Balmain and Rozelle in Sydney, or areas with high pedestrian activity.\n\nCommon speed zones above the default limits are:\n* Many sub-arterial roads are zoned {{convert|60|km/h|mph}}. \n*Major connector roads and smaller highways are zoned {{convert|60|km/h|mph}}, {{convert|70|km/h|mph}}, {{convert|80|km/h|mph}} or {{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 340<!-- Set larger than 300px to stop caption wrapping -->\n| caption_align = center\n| image1 = 50km speedlimit.jpg\n| width1 = 1054\n| height1 = 1500\n| alt1 = \n| link1 = File:50km speedlimit.jpg\n| caption1 = 50&nbsp;km/h speed limit sign\n| image2 = Australian 60kmh speed limit sign.jpg\n| width2 = 1182\n| height2 = 1500\n| alt2 = \n| link2 = File:Australian 60kmh speed limit sign.jpg\n| caption2 = 60&nbsp;km/h speed limit sign\n}}\n{{convert|90|km/h|mph}}.\n* Some highways and freeways are zoned {{convert|110|km/h|mph}}.\n* Most of the [[Stuart Highway|Stuart]], [[Arnhem Highway|Arnhem]], [[Barkly Highway|Barkly]] and [[Victoria Highway|Victoria]] highways in the Northern Territory are zoned {{convert|130|km/h|mph}}.\n\nThe \"END\" speed limit sign is increasingly used throughout Australia to signal the end of a posted speed restriction, or built-up area \"default\" speed-limit leading to the jurisdiction's \"rural\" default speed limit. It contains the word \"END\" and a number in a black circle beneath this, representing the ceasing speed-limit.  It is typically used where, according to AS1742.4 the road beyond has certain hazards such as hidden driveways, poor camber, soft edges and other hazards where the road authority feels a posted speed limit sign might be too dangerous or otherwise unwarranted. It is intended therefore to invoke particular caution. This sign is used as a direct replacement for the slash-through speed derestriction signs common in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nSpeed limits are [[Road speed limit enforcement in Australia|enforced]] in all areas of the country. Tolerance{{clarify|date=September 2018}} ranges from 3% to 10% in most states but only 3&nbsp;km/h in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], an issue that has caused much controversy in that state{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, especially in light of the fact that earlier Australian Design Rules specified that vehicle speedometers may have up to 10% leeway in accuracy.

As part of [[Metrication in Australia|metrication]] in 1974, speed limits and speed advisories were converted into [[kilometres per hour]], [[round number|rounded]] to the nearest 10&nbsp;km/h, leading to small discrepancies in speed limits. Signage changed from a North American-style black and white textual sign to a design based on metric signage in use in New Zealand with black number in red annulus (or circle) on white, itself a derivative of the European standard number in red circle design.\n\n=== Urban limits ===\n<!-- suggest this be split into state based paragraphs as the story is different in each state -->\nThe urban default, which prior to the 1930s was {{convert|30|mph|km/h}}, applied to any \"built up area\", usually defined by the presence of street lighting. This limit was progressively increased to {{convert|35|mph|km/h}} over the next 30 years by each of the states and territories, with New South Wales being the last to change in May 1964. South Australia adopted <!-- give reference to transport committee a decrease from {{convert|40|mph|km/h}} to --> {{convert|35|mph|km/h}} on 30 November 1950 along with the \"new short-right hand turn\" (in place of a hook turn). <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45675961 |title=Follow-The-Leader In New Right Turn |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |location=South Australia |date=30 November 1950 |access-date=16 December 2019 |page=3 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\n<!-- In the context of issues caused by rounding at metrication it is important not to round the converted limits!

However, many existing roads, especially subarterial roads in urban areas, have had 60&nbsp;km/h limits posted on them.

(2009 edition has dropped from reference the R4-2 speed derestriction). The speed derestriction sign (//) had developed 'different meaning' over time at state and territory level, although its contract-meaning under \"The United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, Signs & Signals\" where the sign is catalogued \"C,17a\", is; \"End of all local prohibitions imposed on moving vehicles\" and has never changed. In the Northern Territory, they designated the end of speed restrictions. In Victoria and Western Australia they meant that the rural default speed limit applied, whilst in New South Wales, they indicated that the ''prima facie'' {{convert|50|mph|km/h}} limit applied.\n\n[[File:YarrawarraRdSigns.JPG|thumb|left|Derestriction signs remain in place even though officially no longer in use in NSW]]\nNew South Wales's ''prima facie'' 50&nbsp;miles per hour or 80&nbsp;km/hr  limit, often signed by derestriction signs, was only enforced in cases where a driver's speed could be demonstrated to be excessive or dangerous in the context of prevailing road conditions. This was somewhat similar in principle to \"reasonable and prudent\" limits in other jurisdictions. This led to the widespread but misleading belief that no limit applied, and that derestriction signs indicated an \"unlimited\" limit. This belief, coupled with repeated studies showing 85th percentile speeds in excess of 120&nbsp;km/h on major routes, comparatively high road tolls, difficulty in prosecuting speeding offences, and the variance in meaning of the derestriction sign across states, led New South Wales to harmonise its rural default limit to {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} in 1978. The use of derestriction signs in New South Wales was officially discouraged, and on state controlled routes, 100&nbsp;km/h signs were progressively used instead.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Australian roads}}\n* [[Australian Road Rules]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/metric-motoring/ ''Metric Motoring'' (1973)] \u2013 Original television advertisements explaining the conversion to metric speed limits.

It contains the word \"END\" and a number in a black circle beneath this, representing the ceasing speed-limit.  It is typically used where, according to AS1742.4 the road beyond has certain hazards such as hidden driveways, poor camber, soft edges and other hazards where the road authority feels a posted speed limit sign might be too dangerous or otherwise unwarranted. It is intended therefore to invoke particular caution. This sign is used as a direct replacement for the slash-through speed derestriction signs common in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nSpeed limits are [[Road speed limit enforcement in Australia|enforced]] in all areas of the country.

As part of [[Metrication in Australia|metrication]] in 1974, speed limits and speed advisories were converted into [[kilometres per hour]], [[round number|rounded]] to the nearest 10&nbsp;km/h, leading to small discrepancies in speed limits. Signage changed from a North American-style black and white textual sign to a design based on metric signage in use in New Zealand with black number in red annulus (or circle) on white, itself a derivative of the European standard number in red circle design.\n\n=== Urban limits ===\n<!-- suggest this be split into state based paragraphs as the story is different in each state -->\nThe urban default, which prior to the 1930s was {{convert|30|mph|km/h}}, applied to any \"built up area\", usually defined by the presence of street lighting. This limit was progressively increased to {{convert|35|mph|km/h}} over the next 30 years by each of the states and territories, with New South Wales being the last to change in May 1964. South Australia adopted <!-- give reference to transport committee a decrease from {{convert|40|mph|km/h}} to --> {{convert|35|mph|km/h}} on 30 November 1950 along with the \"new short-right hand turn\" (in place of a hook turn). <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article45675961 |title=Follow-The-Leader In New Right Turn |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |location=South Australia |date=30 November 1950 |access-date=16 December 2019 |page=3 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\n<!-- In the context of issues caused by rounding at metrication it is important not to round the converted limits!

However, many existing roads, especially subarterial roads in urban areas, have had 60&nbsp;km/h limits posted on them.

(2009 edition has dropped from reference the R4-2 speed derestriction). The speed derestriction sign (//) had developed 'different meaning' over time at state and territory level, although its contract-meaning under \"The United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, Signs & Signals\" where the sign is catalogued \"C,17a\", is; \"End of all local prohibitions imposed on moving vehicles\" and has never changed. In the Northern Territory, they designated the end of speed restrictions. In Victoria and Western Australia they meant that the rural default speed limit applied, whilst in New South Wales, they indicated that the ''prima facie'' {{convert|50|mph|km/h}} limit applied.\n\n[[File:YarrawarraRdSigns.JPG|thumb|left|Derestriction signs remain in place even though officially no longer in use in NSW]]\nNew South Wales's ''prima facie'' 50&nbsp;miles per hour or 80&nbsp;km/hr  limit, often signed by derestriction signs, was only enforced in cases where a driver's speed could be demonstrated to be excessive or dangerous in the context of prevailing road conditions. This was somewhat similar in principle to \"reasonable and prudent\" limits in other jurisdictions. This led to the widespread but misleading belief that no limit applied, and that derestriction signs indicated an \"unlimited\" limit. This belief, coupled with repeated studies showing 85th percentile speeds in excess of 120&nbsp;km/h on major routes, comparatively high road tolls, difficulty in prosecuting speeding offences, and the variance in meaning of the derestriction sign across states, led New South Wales to harmonise its rural default limit to {{convert|100|km/h|mph}} in 1978. The use of derestriction signs in New South Wales was officially discouraged, and on state controlled routes, 100&nbsp;km/h signs were progressively used instead.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Australian roads}}\n* [[Australian Road Rules]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/metric-motoring/ ''Metric Motoring'' (1973)] \u2013 Original television advertisements explaining the conversion to metric speed limits.
