In such cases, the model can be viewed as a [[black box]], i.e. the output is an \"opaque\" function of its inputs.\n\nQuite often, some or all of the model inputs are subject to sources of [[Uncertainty quantification|uncertainty]], including [[Measurement uncertainty|errors of measurement]], absence of information and poor or partial understanding of the driving forces and mechanisms.  This uncertainty imposes a limit on our [[confidence]] in the response or output of the model. Further, models may have to cope with the natural intrinsic variability of the system (aleatory), such as the occurrence of [[stochastic]] events.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Der Kiureghian |first=A. |last2=Ditlevsen |first2=O. |year=2009 |title=Aleatory or epistemic?

This requires, first, a [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] of the uncertainty in any model results ([[uncertainty analysis]]); and second, an evaluation of how much each input is contributing to the output uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis addresses the second of these issues (although uncertainty analysis is usually a necessary precursor), performing the role of ordering by importance the strength and relevance of the inputs in determining the variation in the output.<ref name=\"Primer\" />\n\nIn models involving many input variables, sensitivity analysis is an essential ingredient of model building and quality assurance. National and international agencies involved in [[impact assessment]] studies have included sections devoted to sensitivity analysis in their guidelines. Examples are the [[European Commission]] (see e.g. the guidelines for [[impact assessment]]),<ref name=\"EC_GUIDE\">http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/commission_guidelines/docs/iag_2009_en.pdf</ref> the White House [[Office of Management and Budget]], the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and [[US Environmental Protection Agency]]'s modeling guidelines.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/CREM/library/cred_guidance_0309.pdf</ref>\n\n==Settings and constraints==\nThe choice of method of sensitivity analysis is typically dictated by a number of problem constraints or settings. Some of the most common are\n* '''Computational expense:''' Sensitivity analysis is almost always performed by running the model a (possibly large) number of times, i.e. a [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]-based approach.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

This is not unusual with very complex models.\n** The model has a large number of uncertain inputs. Sensitivity analysis is essentially the exploration of the [[Dimension|multidimensional input space]], which grows exponentially in size with the number of inputs. See the [[curse of dimensionality]].\n:Computational expense is a problem in many practical sensitivity analyses. Some methods of reducing computational expense include the use of emulators (for large models), and screening methods (for reducing the dimensionality of the problem). Another method is to use an event-based sensitivity analysis method for variable selection for time-constrained applications.<ref name=\"tavakoli1\">{{cite journal |last=Tavakoli |first= Siamak |first2=Alireza |last2=Mousavi |title=Event tracking for real-time unaware sensitivity analysis (EventTracker) |journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=348\u2013359 |doi=10.1109/tkde.2011.240|url= http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/8690 }}</ref> This is an input variable selection (IVS) method that assembles together information about the trace of the changes in system inputs and outputs using sensitivity analysis to produce an input/output trigger/event matrix that is designed to map the relationships between input data as causes that trigger events and the output data that describes the actual events. The cause-effect relationship between the causes of state change i.e. input variables and the effect system output parameters determines which set of inputs have a genuine impact on a given output. The method has a clear advantage over analytical and computational IVS method since it tries to understand and interpret system state change in the shortest possible time with minimum computational overhead.<ref name=\"tavakoli1\"/><ref name=\"tavakoli2\">{{cite journal |last=Tavakoli |first=Siamak |first2=Alireza |last2=Mousavi |first3=Stefan |last3=Poslad |title=Input variable selection in time-critical knowledge integration applications: A review, analysis, and recommendation paper |journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics |year=2013 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=519\u2013536 |doi=10.1016/j.aei.2013.06.002 |url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/8691 }}</ref>\n* '''Correlated inputs:''' Most common sensitivity analysis methods assume [[Independence (probability theory)|independence]] between model inputs, but sometimes inputs can be strongly correlated. This is still an immature field of research and definitive methods have yet to be established.\n* '''Nonlinearity:''' Some sensitivity analysis approaches, such as those based on [[linear regression]], can inaccurately measure sensitivity when the model response is [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] with respect to its inputs. In such cases, [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based measures]] are more appropriate.\n* '''Model interactions:''' [[Interaction (statistics)|Interactions]] occur when the perturbation of two or more inputs ''simultaneously'' causes variation in the output greater than that of varying each of the inputs alone. Such interactions are present in any model that is non-[[Additive map|additive]], but will be neglected by methods such as scatterplots and one-at-a-time perturbations.<ref name=\"OAT\">{{cite journal |last=Saltelli |first=A. |last2=Annoni |first2=P. |year=2010 |title=How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis |journal=Environmental Modeling and Software |volume=25 |issue= 12|pages=1508\u20131517 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.04.012}}</ref> The effect of interactions can be measured by the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|total-order sensitivity index]].\n* '''Multiple outputs:''' Virtually all sensitivity analysis methods consider a single [[univariate]] model output, yet many models output a large number of possibly spatially or time-dependent data. Note that this does not preclude the possibility of performing different sensitivity analyses for each output of interest. However, for models in which the outputs are correlated, the sensitivity measures can be hard to interpret.\n* '''Given data:''' While in many cases the practitioner has access to the model, in some instances a sensitivity analysis must be performed with \"given data\", i.e. where the sample points (the values of the model inputs for each run) cannot be chosen by the analyst.

These categories can somehow overlap. Alternative ways of obtaining these measures, under the constraints of the problem, can be given.\n\n===Derivative-based local methods===\nLocal derivative-based methods involve taking the [[partial derivative]] of the output  ''Y'' with respect to an input factor ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>:\n:<math>\n\\left| \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X_i} \\right |_{\\textbf {x}^0 },\n</math>\nwhere the subscript '''X'''<sup>0</sup> indicates that the derivative is taken at some fixed point in the space of the input (hence the 'local' in the name of the class). Similar to OAT, local methods do not attempt to fully explore the input space, since they examine small perturbations, typically one variable at a time.\n\n\n\n===Regression analysis===\n[[Regression analysis]], in the context of sensitivity analysis, involves adapting a  [[linear regression]] to the model response and using [[Standardized coefficient|standardized regression coefficients]]. The regression must be linear with respect to the data (i.e. a hyperplane, therefore without quadratic terms, etc., as regressors) in order to interpret the standardized coefficients. This method is therefore more suitable when the model response is in fact linear; linearity can be confirmed, for example, if the determination coefficient is large. The advantages of regression analysis are simplicity and low computational cost.\n\n===Variance-based methods===\n{{Main article|Variance-based sensitivity analysis}}\nVariance-based methods<ref>Saltelli, A.; Chan, K.; and Scott, M. (eds.) (2000). ''Sensitivity Analysis''. Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics. New York: John Wiley and Sons.</ref> are a class of probabilistic approaches which quantify the input and output uncertainties as [[probability distribution]]s, and decompose the output variance into parts attributable to input variables and combinations of variables. The sensitivity of the output to an input variable is therefore measured by the amount of variance in the output caused by that input. These can be expressed as conditional expectations, i.e., considering a model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''') for '''''X'''''={''X''<sub>''1''</sub>, ''X''<sub>''2''</sub>, ... ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}, a measure of sensitivity of the ''i''th variable ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> is given as,\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Var} \\left( E_{\\textbf{X}_{\\sim i}} \\left( Y \\mid X_i \\right)\n\\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere \"Var\" and \"''E''\" denote the variance and expected value operators respectively, and '''''X'''''<sub>''~i''</sub> denotes the set of all input variables except ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>. This expression essentially measures the contribution ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> alone to the uncertainty (variance) in ''Y'' (averaged over variations in other variables), and is known as the ''first-order sensitivity index'' or ''main effect index''. Importantly, it does not measure the uncertainty caused by interactions with other variables. A further measure, known as the ''total effect index'', gives the total variance in ''Y'' caused by ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> ''and'' its interactions with any of the other input variables. Both quantities are typically standardised by dividing by Var(''Y'').\n\nVariance-based methods allow full exploration of the input space, accounting for interactions, and nonlinear responses. For these reasons they are widely used when it is feasible to calculate them. Typically this calculation involves the use of [[Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo]] methods, but since this can involve many thousands of model runs, other methods (such as emulators) can be used to reduce computational expense when necessary. Note that full variance decompositions are only meaningful when the input factors are independent from one another.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saltelli | first1 = A. | last2 = Tarantola | first2 = S. | year = 2002 | title = On the relative importance of input factors in mathematical models: safety assessment for nuclear waste disposal | url = | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 97 | issue = 459| pages = 702\u2013709 | doi=10.1198/016214502388618447}}</ref>\n\n===Variogram analysis of response surfaces (''VARS'')===\n\nOne of the main shortcomings of the previous sensitivity analysis methods is that none of them consider the spatially ordered structure of the response output of model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''')  in the parameter space. The analysis of the variogram of the response surfaces (VARS) addresses this criticality by recognizing a spatially continuous correlation structure with the values of Y, and therefore also with the values of <math> \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_i} </math>.\n\nBasically, the higher the variability the more heterogeneous is the response surface along a particular direction/parameter, at a specific perturbation scale. Accordingly, in the VARS framework, the values of directional [[variogram]]s for a given perturbation scale can be considered as a comprehensive illustration of sensitivity information, through linking variogram analysis to both direction and perturbation scale concepts. As a result, the VARS framework accounts for the fact that sensitivity is a scale-dependent concept, and thus overcomes the scale issue of traditional sensitivity analysis methods.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haghnegahdar|first1=Amin|last2=Razavi|first2=Saman|title=Insights into sensitivity analysis of Earth and environmental systems models: On the impact of parameter perturbation scale|journal=Environmental Modelling & Software|date=September 2017|volume=95|pages=115\u2013131|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.031}}</ref> More importantly, VARS is able to provide relatively stable and statistically robust estimates of parameter sensitivity with much lower computational cost than other strategies (about two orders of magnitude more efficient).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=H|last2=Razavi|first2=S|editor1-last=Petropoulos|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Srivastava|editor2-first=Prashant|title=Sensitivity Analysis in Earth Observation Modelling|date=2016|isbn=9780128030318|pages=397\u2013415|edition=1st|chapter-url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/sensitivity-analysis-in-earth-observation-modelling/petropoulos/978-0-12-803011-0|language=en|chapter=Challenges and Future Outlook of Sensitivity Analysis}}</ref> Noteworthy, it has been shown that there is a theoretical link between the VARS framework and the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based]] and derivative-based approaches.\n\n===Screening===\nScreening is a particular instance of a sampling-based method. The objective here is rather to identify which input variables are contributing significantly to the output uncertainty in high-dimensionality models, rather than exactly quantifying sensitivity (i.e. in terms of variance). Screening tends to have a relatively low computational cost when compared to other approaches, and can be used in a preliminary analysis to weed out uninfluential variables before applying a more informative analysis to the remaining set. One of the most commonly used screening method is the [[Elementary effects method|elementary effect method]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = M.

The advantage of this approach is that it can also deal with \"given data\", i.e., a set of arbitrarily-placed data points, and gives a direct visual indication of sensitivity. Quantitative measures can also be drawn, for example by measuring the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between ''Y'' and ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, or even by estimating variance-based measures by [[nonlinear regression]].<ref name=\"voodoo\" />\n\n==Alternative methods==\nA number of methods have been developed to overcome some of the constraints discussed above, which would otherwise make the estimation of sensitivity measures infeasible (most often due to [[computational expense]]). Generally, these methods focus on efficiently calculating variance-based measures of sensitivity.\n\n===Emulators===\nEmulators (also known as metamodels, surrogate models or response surfaces) are [[Data modeling|data-modeling]]/[[machine learning]] approaches that involve building a relatively simple mathematical function, known as an ''emulator'', that approximates the input/output behavior of the model itself.<ref name=\"emcomp\">{{cite journal | last1 = Storlie | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Swiler | first2 = L.P. | last3 = Helton | first3 = J.C. | last4 = Sallaberry | first4 = C.J. | year = 2009 | title = Implementation and evaluation of nonparametric regression procedures for sensitivity analysis of computationally demanding models | url = | journal = Reliability Engineering & System Safety | volume = 94 | issue = 11| pages = 1735\u20131763 | doi=10.1016/j.ress.2009.05.007}}</ref> In other words, it is the concept of \"modeling a model\" (hence the name \"metamodel\").

The HDMR approach exploits the fact that the model can usually be well-approximated by neglecting higher-order interactions (second or third-order and above). The terms in the truncated series can then each be approximated by e.g. polynomials or splines (REFS) and the response expressed as the sum of the main effects and interactions up to the truncation order. From this perspective, HDMRs can be seen as emulators which neglect high-order interactions; the advantage is that they are able to emulate models with higher dimensionality than full-order emulators.\n\n===Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST)===\n{{Main article| Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing }}\n\nThe Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) uses the [[Fourier series]] to represent, with a single frequency variable, a multivariate function in the frequency domain.

The point is well illustrated by the econometrician [[Edward E. Leamer]]:<ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Let's Take the Con Out of Econometrics |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=73 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=31\u201343 |jstor=1803924 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Sensitivity Analyses Would Help |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=75 |issue=3 |year=1985 |pages=308\u2013313 |jstor=1814801 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I have proposed a form of organized sensitivity analysis that I call 'global sensitivity analysis' in which a neighborhood of alternative assumptions is selected and the corresponding interval of inferences is identified. Conclusions are judged to be sturdy only if the neighborhood of assumptions is wide enough to be credible and the corresponding interval of inferences is narrow enough to be useful.</blockquote>\n\nNote Leamer's emphasis is on the need for 'credibility' in the selection of assumptions. The easiest way to invalidate a model is to demonstrate that it is fragile with respect to the uncertainty in the assumptions or to show that its assumptions have not been taken 'wide enough'. The same concept is expressed by Jerome R. Ravetz, for whom bad modeling is when ''uncertainties in inputs must be suppressed lest outputs become indeterminate.''<ref>Ravetz, J.R., 2007, ''No-Nonsense Guide to Science'', New Internationalist Publications Ltd.</ref>\n\n===Pitfalls and difficulties===\nSome common difficulties in sensitivity analysis include\n* Too many model inputs to analyse. Screening can be used to reduce dimensionality. Another way to tackle the curse of dimensionality is to use sampling based on low discrepancy sequences<ref>O. Tsvetkova, T.B.M.J. Ouarda, Quasi-Monte Carlo technique in global sensitivity analysis of wind resource assessment with a study on UAE, J. Renew. Sustain. Energy. 11 (2019). doi:10.1063/1.5120035.</ref>\n* The model takes too long to run. Emulators (including HDMR) can reduce the number of model runs needed.\n* There is not enough information to build probability distributions for the inputs. Probability distributions can be constructed from [[expert elicitation]], although even then it may be hard to build distributions with great confidence. The subjectivity of the probability distributions or ranges will strongly affect the sensitivity analysis.\n* Unclear purpose of the analysis. Different statistical tests nd measures are applied to the problem and different factors rankings are obtained. The test should instead be tailored to the purpose of the analysis, e.g. one uses Monte Carlo filtering if one is interested in which factors are most responsible for generating high/low values of the output.\n* Too many model outputs are considered. This may be acceptable for quality assurance of sub-models but should be avoided when presenting the results of the overall analysis.\n* Piecewise sensitivity. This is when one performs sensitivity analysis on one sub-model at a time. This approach is non conservative as it might overlook interactions among factors in different sub-models (Type II error).\n* Commonly used OAT approach is not valid for nonlinear models. Global methods should be used instead.<ref>A. Saltelli, K. Aleksankina, W. Becker, P. Fennell, F. Ferretti, N. Holst, S. Li, Q. Wu, Why so many published sensitivity analyses are false: A systematic review of sensitivity analysis practices, Environ. Model.

For example, [[global climate model]]s are used for both short-term [[weather forecasts]] and long-term [[climate change]]. Moreover, computer models are increasingly used for environmental decision-making at a local scale, for example for assessing the impact of a waste water treatment plant on a river flow, or for assessing the behavior and life-length of bio-filters for contaminated waste water. Similarly, sensitivity analyses can be used to evaluate the effect of demographic and environmental variables on the viability of populations to guide wildlife management <ref name=\"Applicability and limitations of sensitivity analyses for wildlife management\">{{cite journal |last=Manlik |first=O. |last2=Lacy |first2=R.C. |last3=Sherwin |first3=W.B.|year=2018 |title=Applicability and limitations of sensitivity analyses for wildlife management |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=1430\u20131440 |doi=10.1111/1365-2664.13044 }}</ref>\n\nIn either case, sensitivity analysis may help to understand the contribution of the various sources of uncertainty to the model output uncertainty and the system performance in general. In these cases, depending on model complexity, different sampling strategies may be advisable and traditional sensitivity indices have to be generalized to cover multiple model outputs,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fass\u00f2 |first=Alessandro |year=2006 |title=Sensitivity Analysis for Environmental Models and Monitoring Networks |journal=Preprint |url=http://www.iemss.org/iemss2006/papers/s7/268_Fasso_0.pdf }}</ref> [[heteroskedastic]] effects and correlated inputs.<ref name=\"tavakoli2\"/>\n\n===Business===\nIn a decision problem, the analyst may want to identify cost drivers as well as other quantities for which we need to acquire better knowledge in order to make an informed decision. On the other hand, some quantities have no influence on the predictions, so that we can save resources at no loss in accuracy by relaxing some of the conditions. See [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|Corporate finance: Quantifying uncertainty]].\nAdditionally to the general motivations listed above, sensitivity analysis can help in a variety of other circumstances specific to business:\n\n* To identify critical assumptions or compare alternative model structures\n* To guide future data collections\n* To optimize the tolerance of manufactured parts in terms of the uncertainty in the parameters\n* To optimize resources allocation\n\nHowever, there are also some problems associated with sensitivity analysis in the business context:\n* Variables are often interdependent ([[correlation|correlated]]), which makes examining each variable individually unrealistic. E.G. changing one factor such as sales volume, will most likely affect other factors such as the selling price.\n* Often the assumptions upon which the analysis is based are made by using past experience/data which may not hold in the future.\n* Assigning a maximum and minimum (or optimistic and pessimistic) value is open to subjective interpretation. For instance, one person's 'optimistic' forecast may be more conservative than that of another person performing a different part of the analysis. This sort of subjectivity can adversely affect the accuracy and overall objectivity of the analysis.\n\n===Social sciences===\nSensitivity analysis is common practice in social sciences. A famous early example is Mroz (1987), who analysed [[econometric model]]s of female labor market participation.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Thomas A. |last=Mroz |title=The Sensitivity of an Empirical Model of Married Women's Hours of Work to Economic and Statistical Assumptions |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=765\u2013799 |doi=10.2307/1911029 |jstor=1911029 }}</ref>\n\nIn modern econometrics the use of sensitivity analysis to anticipate criticism is the subject of one of [[Peter Kennedy (economist)|Peter Kennedy]]'s \"ten commandments of applied econometrics\":<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=P. |year=2007 |title=A Guide to Econometrics |edition=Fifth |publisher=Blackwell |location= |isbn= 9780262611831|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8I5SP69e4kC }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Thou shall confess in the presence of sensitivity. Corollary: Thou shall anticipate criticism [\u2022\u2022\u2022] When reporting a sensitivity analysis, researchers should explain fully their specification search so that the readers can judge for themselves how the results may have been affected.

Sensitivity analysis can be used for [[optimal experimental design]], e.g. determining initial conditions, measurement positions, and sampling time, to generate informative data which are critical to estimation accuracy. A great number of parameters in a complex model can be candidates for estimation but not all are estimable.<ref name=\"SRI\"/> Sensitivity analysis can be used to identify the influential parameters which can be determined from available data while screening out the unimportant ones. Sensitivity analysis can also be used to identify the redundant species and reactions allowing model reduction.\n\n===Engineering===\nModern [[engineering]] design makes extensive use of computer models to test designs before they are manufactured.

For instance, the field of  [[multi-criteria decision making]] (MCDM) studies (among other topics) the problem of how to select the best alternative among a number of competing alternatives.  This is an important task in [[decision making]].  In such a setting each alternative is described in terms of a set of evaluative criteria.  These criteria are associated with weights of importance.  Intuitively, one may think that the larger the weight for a criterion is, the more critical that criterion should be.  However, this may not be the case.  It is important to distinguish here the notion of ''criticality'' with that of ''importance.''  By ''critical,'' we mean that a criterion with small change (as a percentage) in its weight, may cause a significant change of the final solution.  It is possible criteria with rather small weights of importance (i.e., ones that are not so important in that respect) to be much more critical in a given situation than ones with larger weights.<ref name = 'SENSITIVITY'>{{cite journal | title = A Sensitivity Analysis Approach for Some Deterministic Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Methods | journal = Decision Sciences | year=1997 | first = E. | last = Triantaphyllou | authorlink = |author2=A.

This, in turn, may dramatically improve the effectiveness of the initial study and assist in the successful implementation of the final solution.\n\n===Time-critical decision making===\n{{see also|Window of opportunity}}\nProducing time-critical accurate knowledge about the state of a system (effect) under computational and data acquisition (cause) constraints is a major challenge, especially if the knowledge required is critical to the system operation where the safety of operators or integrity of costly equipment is at stake, e.g., during manufacturing or during environment substrate drilling.\nUnderstanding and interpreting, a chain of interrelated events, predicted or unpredicted, that may or may not result in a specific state of the system, is the core challenge of this research. Sensitivity analysis may be used to identify which set of input data signals has a significant impact on the set of system state information (i.e. output). Through a cause-effect analysis technique, sensitivity can be used to support the filtering of unsolicited data to reduce the communication and computational capabilities of a standard supervisory control and data acquisition system.<ref name=\"tavakoli2\"/>\n\n===Model calibration and improvement===\nOne application of sensitivity analysis addresses the question of \"What's important to model or system development?\" One can seek to identify important connections between observations, model inputs, and predictions or forecasts. That is, one can seek to understand what observations (measurements of dependent variables) are most and least important to model inputs (parameters representing system characteristics or excitation), what model inputs are most and least important to predictions or forecasts, and what observations are most and least important to the predictions and forecasts. Often the results are surprising, lead to finding problems in the data or model development, and fixing the problems. This leads to better models.<ref name=\"Model Analysis\"/><ref name=\"Methods and Guidelines\"/> In biomedical engineering, sensitivity analysis can be used to determine system dynamics in ODE-based kinetic models.

In these cases the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become a matter of great importance, and a pure sensitivity analysis \u2013 with its emphasis on parametric uncertainty \u2013 may be seen as insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may derive inter-alia from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about 'what the problem is' and foremost about 'who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes more or less implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).\n\nIn order to take these concerns into due consideration the instruments of SA have been extended to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge and model generating process. This approach has been called 'sensitivity auditing'. It takes inspiration from NUSAP,<ref name=\"NUSAP\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Sluijs | first1 = JP | last2 = Craye | first2 = M | last3 = Funtowicz | first3 = S | last4 = Kloprogge | first4 = P | last5 = Ravetz | first5 = J | last6 = Risbey | first6 = J | year = 2005 | title = Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 481\u2013492 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00604.x| pmid = 15876219 }}</ref> a method used to qualify the worth of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers.

In a design of experiments, one studies the effect of some process or intervention (the 'treatment') on some objects (the 'experimental units'). In sensitivity analysis one looks at the effect of varying the inputs of a mathematical model on the output of the model itself. In both disciplines one strives to obtain information from the system with a minimum of physical or numerical experiments.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Causality]]\n* [[Elementary effects method]]\n* [[Experimental uncertainty analysis]]\n* [[Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing]]\n* [[Info-gap decision theory]]\n* [[Interval FEM]]\n* [[Perturbation analysis]]\n* [[Probabilistic design]]\n* [[Probability bounds analysis]]\n* [[Robustification]]\n* [[ROC curve]]\n* [[Uncertainty quantification]]\n* [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Cannav\u00f3 | first1 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Sensitivity analysis for volcanic source modeling quality assessment and model selection | url = | journal = Computers & Geosciences | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 52\u201359 | doi = 10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.008 | bibcode = 2012CG.....44...52C }}\n*Fass\u00f2 A.

In such cases, the model can be viewed as a [[black box]], i.e. the output is an \"opaque\" function of its inputs.\n\nQuite often, some or all of the model inputs are subject to sources of [[Uncertainty quantification|uncertainty]], including [[Measurement uncertainty|errors of measurement]], absence of information and poor or partial understanding of the driving forces and mechanisms.  This uncertainty imposes a limit on our [[confidence]] in the response or output of the model. Further, models may have to cope with the natural intrinsic variability of the system (aleatory), such as the occurrence of [[stochastic]] events.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Der Kiureghian |first=A. |last2=Ditlevsen |first2=O. |year=2009 |title=Aleatory or epistemic?

This requires, first, a [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] of the uncertainty in any model results ([[uncertainty analysis]]); and second, an evaluation of how much each input is contributing to the output uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis addresses the second of these issues (although uncertainty analysis is usually a necessary precursor), performing the role of ordering by importance the strength and relevance of the inputs in determining the variation in the output.<ref name=\"Primer\" />\n\nIn models involving many input variables, sensitivity analysis is an essential ingredient of model building and quality assurance. National and international agencies involved in [[impact assessment]] studies have included sections devoted to sensitivity analysis in their guidelines. Examples are the [[European Commission]] (see e.g. the guidelines for [[impact assessment]]),<ref name=\"EC_GUIDE\">http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/commission_guidelines/docs/iag_2009_en.pdf</ref> the White House [[Office of Management and Budget]], the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and [[US Environmental Protection Agency]]'s modeling guidelines.<ref>http://www.epa.gov/CREM/library/cred_guidance_0309.pdf</ref>\n\n==Settings and constraints==\nThe choice of method of sensitivity analysis is typically dictated by a number of problem constraints or settings. Some of the most common are\n* '''Computational expense:''' Sensitivity analysis is almost always performed by running the model a (possibly large) number of times, i.e. a [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]]-based approach.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. C. |last=Helton |first2=J. D. |last2=Johnson |first3=C. J. |last3=Salaberry |first4=C.

This is not unusual with very complex models.\n** The model has a large number of uncertain inputs. Sensitivity analysis is essentially the exploration of the [[Dimension|multidimensional input space]], which grows exponentially in size with the number of inputs. See the [[curse of dimensionality]].\n:Computational expense is a problem in many practical sensitivity analyses. Some methods of reducing computational expense include the use of emulators (for large models), and screening methods (for reducing the dimensionality of the problem). Another method is to use an event-based sensitivity analysis method for variable selection for time-constrained applications.<ref name=\"tavakoli1\">{{cite journal |last=Tavakoli |first= Siamak |first2=Alireza |last2=Mousavi |title=Event tracking for real-time unaware sensitivity analysis (EventTracker) |journal=IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering |year=2013 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=348\u2013359 |doi=10.1109/tkde.2011.240|url= http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/8690 }}</ref> This is an input variable selection (IVS) method that assembles together information about the trace of the changes in system inputs and outputs using sensitivity analysis to produce an input/output trigger/event matrix that is designed to map the relationships between input data as causes that trigger events and the output data that describes the actual events. The cause-effect relationship between the causes of state change i.e. input variables and the effect system output parameters determines which set of inputs have a genuine impact on a given output. The method has a clear advantage over analytical and computational IVS method since it tries to understand and interpret system state change in the shortest possible time with minimum computational overhead.<ref name=\"tavakoli1\"/><ref name=\"tavakoli2\">{{cite journal |last=Tavakoli |first=Siamak |first2=Alireza |last2=Mousavi |first3=Stefan |last3=Poslad |title=Input variable selection in time-critical knowledge integration applications: A review, analysis, and recommendation paper |journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics |year=2013 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=519\u2013536 |doi=10.1016/j.aei.2013.06.002 |url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/8691 }}</ref>\n* '''Correlated inputs:''' Most common sensitivity analysis methods assume [[Independence (probability theory)|independence]] between model inputs, but sometimes inputs can be strongly correlated. This is still an immature field of research and definitive methods have yet to be established.\n* '''Nonlinearity:''' Some sensitivity analysis approaches, such as those based on [[linear regression]], can inaccurately measure sensitivity when the model response is [[nonlinear system|nonlinear]] with respect to its inputs. In such cases, [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based measures]] are more appropriate.\n* '''Model interactions:''' [[Interaction (statistics)|Interactions]] occur when the perturbation of two or more inputs ''simultaneously'' causes variation in the output greater than that of varying each of the inputs alone. Such interactions are present in any model that is non-[[Additive map|additive]], but will be neglected by methods such as scatterplots and one-at-a-time perturbations.<ref name=\"OAT\">{{cite journal |last=Saltelli |first=A. |last2=Annoni |first2=P. |year=2010 |title=How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis |journal=Environmental Modeling and Software |volume=25 |issue= 12|pages=1508\u20131517 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2010.04.012}}</ref> The effect of interactions can be measured by the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|total-order sensitivity index]].\n* '''Multiple outputs:''' Virtually all sensitivity analysis methods consider a single [[univariate]] model output, yet many models output a large number of possibly spatially or time-dependent data. Note that this does not preclude the possibility of performing different sensitivity analyses for each output of interest. However, for models in which the outputs are correlated, the sensitivity measures can be hard to interpret.\n* '''Given data:''' While in many cases the practitioner has access to the model, in some instances a sensitivity analysis must be performed with \"given data\", i.e. where the sample points (the values of the model inputs for each run) cannot be chosen by the analyst. This may occur when a sensitivity analysis has to be performed retrospectively, perhaps using data from an optimisation or uncertainty analysis, or when data comes from a [[Discrete probability distribution#Discrete probability distribution|discrete]] source.<ref name=\"voodoo\">{{cite journal |last=Paruolo |first=P. |last2=Saisana |first2=M. |last3=Saltelli |first3=A. |year=2013 |title=Ratings and Rankings: Voodoo or Science? |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A]] |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=609\u2013634 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-985X.2012.01059.x |arxiv=1104.3009 }}</ref>\n\n==Types of sensitivity analysis==\n===One-at-a-time (OAT)===\n\nOne of the simplest and most common approaches is that of changing one-factor-at-a-time (OAT), to see what effect this produces on the output.<ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Campbell |year=2008 |title=Photosynthetic Control of Atmospheric Carbonyl Sulfide During the Growing Season |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=322 |issue=5904 |pages=1085\u20131088 |doi=10.1126/science.1164015 |display-authors=etal |pmid=19008442|bibcode=2008Sci...322.1085C |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/82r9s2x3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=R. |last=Bailis |first2=M. |last2=Ezzati |first3=D. |last3=Kammen |year=2005 |title=Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Impacts of Biomass and Petroleum Energy Futures in Africa |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=308 |issue= 5718|pages=98\u2013103 |doi=10.1126/science.1106881 |pmid=15802601|bibcode=2005Sci...308...98B }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Murphy |year=2004 |title=Quantification of modelling uncertainties in a large ensemble of climate change simulations |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=430 |issue= 7001|pages=768\u2013772 |doi= 10.1038/nature02771|display-authors=etal |pmid=15306806|bibcode=2004Natur.430..768M}}</ref> OAT customarily involves\n\n* Moving one input variable, keeping others at their baseline (nominal) values, then,\n* Returning the variable to its nominal value, then repeating for each of the other inputs in the same way.\n\nSensitivity may then be measured by monitoring changes in the output, e.g. by [[partial derivatives]] or [[linear regression]]. This appears a logical approach as any change observed in the output will unambiguously be due to the single variable changed. Furthermore, by changing one variable at a time, one can keep all other variables fixed to their central or baseline values. This increases the comparability of the results (all 'effects' are computed with reference to the same central point in space) and minimizes the chances of computer programme crashes, more likely when several input factors are changed simultaneously.\nOAT is frequently preferred by modellers because of practical reasons. In case of model failure under OAT analysis the modeller immediately knows which is the input factor responsible for the failure.<ref name=\"OAT\" />\n\nDespite its simplicity however, this approach does not fully explore the input space, since it does not take into account the simultaneous variation of input variables.

These categories can somehow overlap. Alternative ways of obtaining these measures, under the constraints of the problem, can be given.\n\n===Derivative-based local methods===\nLocal derivative-based methods involve taking the [[partial derivative]] of the output  ''Y'' with respect to an input factor ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>:\n:<math>\n\\left| \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X_i} \\right |_{\\textbf {x}^0 },\n</math>\nwhere the subscript '''X'''<sup>0</sup> indicates that the derivative is taken at some fixed point in the space of the input (hence the 'local' in the name of the class). Similar to OAT, local methods do not attempt to fully explore the input space, since they examine small perturbations, typically one variable at a time.\n\n\n\n===Regression analysis===\n[[Regression analysis]], in the context of sensitivity analysis, involves fitting a [[linear regression]] to the model response and using [[Standardized coefficient|standardized regression coefficients]] as direct measures of sensitivity. The regression is required to be linear with respect to the data (i.e. a hyperplane, hence with no quadratic terms, etc., as regressors) because otherwise it is difficult to interpret the standardised coefficients. This method is therefore most suitable when the model response is in fact linear;  linearity can be confirmed, for instance, if the [[coefficient of determination]] is large. The advantages of regression analysis are that it is simple and has a low computational cost.\n\n===Variance-based methods===\n{{Main article|Variance-based sensitivity analysis}}\nVariance-based methods<ref>Sobol', I.

The sensitivity of the output to an input variable is therefore measured by the amount of variance in the output caused by that input. These can be expressed as conditional expectations, i.e., considering a model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''') for '''''X'''''={''X''<sub>''1''</sub>, ''X''<sub>''2''</sub>, ... ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}, a measure of sensitivity of the ''i''th variable ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> is given as,\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Var} \\left( E_{\\textbf{X}_{\\sim i}} \\left( Y \\mid X_i \\right)\n\\right)\n</math>\n\nwhere \"Var\" and \"''E''\" denote the variance and expected value operators respectively, and '''''X'''''<sub>''~i''</sub> denotes the set of all input variables except ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>. This expression essentially measures the contribution ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> alone to the uncertainty (variance) in ''Y'' (averaged over variations in other variables), and is known as the ''first-order sensitivity index'' or ''main effect index''. Importantly, it does not measure the uncertainty caused by interactions with other variables. A further measure, known as the ''total effect index'', gives the total variance in ''Y'' caused by ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> ''and'' its interactions with any of the other input variables. Both quantities are typically standardised by dividing by Var(''Y'').\n\nVariance-based methods allow full exploration of the input space, accounting for interactions, and nonlinear responses. For these reasons they are widely used when it is feasible to calculate them. Typically this calculation involves the use of [[Monte Carlo integration|Monte Carlo]] methods, but since this can involve many thousands of model runs, other methods (such as emulators) can be used to reduce computational expense when necessary. Note that full variance decompositions are only meaningful when the input factors are independent from one another.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Saltelli | first1 = A. | last2 = Tarantola | first2 = S. | year = 2002 | title = On the relative importance of input factors in mathematical models: safety assessment for nuclear waste disposal | url = | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 97 | issue = 459| pages = 702\u2013709 | doi=10.1198/016214502388618447}}</ref>\n\n===Variogram analysis of response surfaces (''VARS'')===\n\nOne of the major shortcomings of the previous sensitivity analysis methods is that none of them considers the spatially ordered structure of the response surface/output of the model ''Y''=''f''('''''X''''') in the parameter space.

As a result, the VARS framework accounts for the fact that sensitivity is a scale-dependent concept, and thus overcomes the scale issue of traditional sensitivity analysis methods.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Haghnegahdar|first1=Amin|last2=Razavi|first2=Saman|title=Insights into sensitivity analysis of Earth and environmental systems models: On the impact of parameter perturbation scale|journal=Environmental Modelling & Software|date=September 2017|volume=95|pages=115\u2013131|doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.031}}</ref> More importantly, VARS is able to provide relatively stable and statistically robust estimates of parameter sensitivity with much lower computational cost than other strategies (about two orders of magnitude more efficient).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=H|last2=Razavi|first2=S|editor1-last=Petropoulos|editor1-first=George|editor2-last=Srivastava|editor2-first=Prashant|title=Sensitivity Analysis in Earth Observation Modelling|date=2016|isbn=9780128030318|pages=397\u2013415|edition=1st|chapter-url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/sensitivity-analysis-in-earth-observation-modelling/petropoulos/978-0-12-803011-0|language=en|chapter=Challenges and Future Outlook of Sensitivity Analysis}}</ref> Noteworthy, it has been shown that there is a theoretical link between the VARS framework and the [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis|variance-based]] and derivative-based approaches.\n\n===Screening===\nScreening is a particular instance of a sampling-based method. The objective here is rather to identify which input variables are contributing significantly to the output uncertainty in high-dimensionality models, rather than exactly quantifying sensitivity (i.e. in terms of variance). Screening tends to have a relatively low computational cost when compared to other approaches, and can be used in a preliminary analysis to weed out uninfluential variables before applying a more informative analysis to the remaining set. One of the most commonly used screening method is the [[Elementary effects method|elementary effect method]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morris | first1 = M.

The advantage of this approach is that it can also deal with \"given data\", i.e., a set of arbitrarily-placed data points, and gives a direct visual indication of sensitivity. Quantitative measures can also be drawn, for example by measuring the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between ''Y'' and ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, or even by estimating variance-based measures by [[nonlinear regression]].<ref name=\"voodoo\" />\n\n==Alternative methods==\nA number of methods have been developed to overcome some of the constraints discussed above, which would otherwise make the estimation of sensitivity measures infeasible (most often due to [[computational expense]]). Generally, these methods focus on efficiently calculating variance-based measures of sensitivity.\n\n===Emulators===\nEmulators (also known as metamodels, surrogate models or response surfaces) are [[Data modeling|data-modeling]]/[[machine learning]] approaches that involve building a relatively simple mathematical function, known as an ''emulator'', that approximates the input/output behavior of the model itself.<ref name=\"emcomp\">{{cite journal | last1 = Storlie | first1 = C.B. | last2 = Swiler | first2 = L.P. | last3 = Helton | first3 = J.C. | last4 = Sallaberry | first4 = C.J. | year = 2009 | title = Implementation and evaluation of nonparametric regression procedures for sensitivity analysis of computationally demanding models | url = | journal = Reliability Engineering & System Safety | volume = 94 | issue = 11| pages = 1735\u20131763 | doi=10.1016/j.ress.2009.05.007}}</ref> In other words, it is the concept of \"modeling a model\" (hence the name \"metamodel\"). The idea is that, although computer models may be a very complex series of equations that can take a long time to solve, they can always be regarded as a function of their inputs ''Y''=''f''('''''X'''''). By running the model at a number of points in the input space, it may be possible to fit a much simpler emulator ''\u03b7''('''''X'''''), such that ''\u03b7''('''''X''''')\u2248''f''('''''X''''') to within an acceptable margin of error.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Shangying|last2=Fan|first2=Kai|last3=Luo|first3=Nan|last4=Cao|first4=Yangxiaolu|last5=Wu|first5=Feilun|last6=Zhang|first6=Carolyn|last7=Heller|first7=Katherine A.|last8=You|first8=Lingchong|date=2019-09-25|title=Massive computational acceleration by using neural networks to emulate mechanism-based biological models|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4354|doi=10.1038/s41467-019-12342-y|issn=2041-1723|pmc=6761138|pmid=31554788}}</ref> Then, sensitivity measures can be calculated from the emulator (either with Monte Carlo or analytically), which will have a negligible additional computational cost.

This requires the following steps,\n# Sampling (running) the model at a number of points in its input space. This requires a sample design.\n# Selecting a type of emulator (mathematical function) to use.\n# \"Training\" the emulator using the sample data from the model \u2013 this generally involves adjusting the emulator parameters until the emulator mimics the true model as well as possible.\n\nSampling the model can often be done with [[low-discrepancy sequences]], such as the [[Sobol sequence]] \u2013 due to mathematician [[Ilya M. Sobol]] or [[Latin hypercube sampling]], although random designs can also be used, at the loss of some efficiency. The selection of the emulator type and the training are intrinsically linked since the training method will be dependent on the class of emulator. Some types of emulators that have been used successfully for sensitivity analysis include,\n* [[Gaussian processes]]<ref name=\"oak\" /> (also known as [[kriging]]), where any combination of output points is assumed to be distributed as a [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]].

The HDMR approach exploits the fact that the model can usually be well-approximated by neglecting higher-order interactions (second or third-order and above). The terms in the truncated series can then each be approximated by e.g. polynomials or splines (REFS) and the response expressed as the sum of the main effects and interactions up to the truncation order. From this perspective, HDMRs can be seen as emulators which neglect high-order interactions; the advantage is that they are able to emulate models with higher dimensionality than full-order emulators.\n\n===Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST)===\n{{Main article| Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing }}\n\nThe Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) uses the [[Fourier series]] to represent a multivariate function (the model) in the frequency domain, using a single frequency variable. Therefore, the integrals required to calculate sensitivity indices become univariate, resulting in computational savings.\n\n===Other===\nMethods based on Monte Carlo filtering.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hornberger |first=G. |first2=R. |last2=Spear |year=1981 |title=An approach to the preliminary analysis of environmental systems |journal=Journal of Environmental Management |volume=7 |issue= |pages=7\u201318 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Saltelli |first=A. |first2=S. |last2=Tarantola |first3=F. |last3=Campolongo |first4=M. |last4=Ratto |year=2004 |title=Sensitivity Analysis in Practice: A Guide to Assessing Scientific Models |location= |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}</ref> These are also sampling-based and the objective here is to identify regions in the space of the input factors corresponding to particular values (e.g. high or low) of the output.\n\n==Other issues==\n\n===Assumptions vs. inferences===\nIn uncertainty and sensitivity analysis there is a crucial trade off between how scrupulous an analyst is in exploring the input [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] and how wide the resulting [[inference]] may be. The point is well illustrated by the econometrician [[Edward E. Leamer]]:<ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Let's Take the Con Out of Econometrics |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=73 |issue=1 |year=1983 |pages=31\u201343 |jstor=1803924 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Edward E. |last=Leamer |title=Sensitivity Analyses Would Help |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=75 |issue=3 |year=1985 |pages=308\u2013313 |jstor=1814801 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I have proposed a form of organized sensitivity analysis that I call 'global sensitivity analysis' in which a neighborhood of alternative assumptions is selected and the corresponding interval of inferences is identified. Conclusions are judged to be sturdy only if the neighborhood of assumptions is wide enough to be credible and the corresponding interval of inferences is narrow enough to be useful.</blockquote>\n\nNote Leamer's emphasis is on the need for 'credibility' in the selection of assumptions. The easiest way to invalidate a model is to demonstrate that it is fragile with respect to the uncertainty in the assumptions or to show that its assumptions have not been taken 'wide enough'. The same concept is expressed by Jerome R. Ravetz, for whom bad modeling is when ''uncertainties in inputs must be suppressed lest outputs become indeterminate.''<ref>Ravetz, J.R., 2007, ''No-Nonsense Guide to Science'', New Internationalist Publications Ltd.</ref>\n\n===Pitfalls and difficulties===\nSome common difficulties in sensitivity analysis include\n* Too many model inputs to analyse. Screening can be used to reduce dimensionality. Another way to tackle the curse of dimensionality is to use sampling based on low discrepancy sequences<ref>O. Tsvetkova, T.B.M.J. Ouarda, Quasi-Monte Carlo technique in global sensitivity analysis of wind resource assessment with a study on UAE, J. Renew. Sustain. Energy. 11 (2019). doi:10.1063/1.5120035.</ref>\n* The model takes too long to run. Emulators (including HDMR) can reduce the number of model runs needed.\n* There is not enough information to build probability distributions for the inputs. Probability distributions can be constructed from [[expert elicitation]], although even then it may be hard to build distributions with great confidence. The subjectivity of the probability distributions or ranges will strongly affect the sensitivity analysis.\n* Unclear purpose of the analysis. Different statistical tests nd measures are applied to the problem and different factors rankings are obtained. The test should instead be tailored to the purpose of the analysis, e.g. one uses Monte Carlo filtering if one is interested in which factors are most responsible for generating high/low values of the output.\n* Too many model outputs are considered. This may be acceptable for quality assurance of sub-models but should be avoided when presenting the results of the overall analysis.\n* Piecewise sensitivity. This is when one performs sensitivity analysis on one sub-model at a time. This approach is non conservative as it might overlook interactions among factors in different sub-models (Type II error).\n* Commonly used OAT approach is not valid for nonlinear models. Global methods should be used instead.<ref>A. Saltelli, K. Aleksankina, W. Becker, P. Fennell, F. Ferretti, N. Holst, S. Li, Q.

For example, [[global climate model]]s are used for both short-term [[weather forecasts]] and long-term [[climate change]]. Moreover, computer models are increasingly used for environmental decision-making at a local scale, for example for assessing the impact of a waste water treatment plant on a river flow, or for assessing the behavior and life-length of bio-filters for contaminated waste water. Similarly, sensitivity analyses can be used to evaluate the effect of demographic and environmental variables on the viability of populations to guide wildlife management <ref name=\"Applicability and limitations of sensitivity analyses for wildlife management\">{{cite journal |last=Manlik |first=O. |last2=Lacy |first2=R.C. |last3=Sherwin |first3=W.B.|year=2018 |title=Applicability and limitations of sensitivity analyses for wildlife management |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=1430\u20131440 |doi=10.1111/1365-2664.13044 }}</ref>\n\nIn either case, sensitivity analysis may help to understand the contribution of the various sources of uncertainty to the model output uncertainty and the system performance in general. In these cases, depending on model complexity, different sampling strategies may be advisable and traditional sensitivity indices have to be generalized to cover multiple model outputs,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fass\u00f2 |first=Alessandro |year=2006 |title=Sensitivity Analysis for Environmental Models and Monitoring Networks |journal=Preprint |url=http://www.iemss.org/iemss2006/papers/s7/268_Fasso_0.pdf }}</ref> [[heteroskedastic]] effects and correlated inputs.<ref name=\"tavakoli2\"/>\n\n===Business===\nIn a decision problem, the analyst may want to identify cost drivers as well as other quantities for which we need to acquire better knowledge in order to make an informed decision. On the other hand, some quantities have no influence on the predictions, so that we can save resources at no loss in accuracy by relaxing some of the conditions. See [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|Corporate finance: Quantifying uncertainty]].\nAdditionally to the general motivations listed above, sensitivity analysis can help in a variety of other circumstances specific to business:\n\n* To identify critical assumptions or compare alternative model structures\n* To guide future data collections\n* To optimize the tolerance of manufactured parts in terms of the uncertainty in the parameters\n* To optimize resources allocation\n\nHowever, there are also some problems associated with sensitivity analysis in the business context:\n* Variables are often interdependent ([[correlation|correlated]]), which makes examining each variable individually unrealistic. E.G. changing one factor such as sales volume, will most likely affect other factors such as the selling price.\n* Often the assumptions upon which the analysis is based are made by using past experience/data which may not hold in the future.\n* Assigning a maximum and minimum (or optimistic and pessimistic) value is open to subjective interpretation. For instance, one person's 'optimistic' forecast may be more conservative than that of another person performing a different part of the analysis. This sort of subjectivity can adversely affect the accuracy and overall objectivity of the analysis.\n\n===Social sciences===\nSensitivity analysis is common practice in social sciences. A famous early example is Mroz (1987), who analysed [[econometric model]]s of female labor market participation.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Thomas A. |last=Mroz |title=The Sensitivity of an Empirical Model of Married Women's Hours of Work to Economic and Statistical Assumptions |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=765\u2013799 |doi=10.2307/1911029 |jstor=1911029 }}</ref>\n\nIn modern econometrics the use of sensitivity analysis to anticipate criticism is the subject of one of [[Peter Kennedy (economist)|Peter Kennedy]]'s \"ten commandments of applied econometrics\":<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=P. |year=2007 |title=A Guide to Econometrics |edition=Fifth |publisher=Blackwell |location= |isbn= 9780262611831|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B8I5SP69e4kC }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Thou shall confess in the presence of sensitivity.

For instance, the field of  [[multi-criteria decision making]] (MCDM) studies (among other topics) the problem of how to select the best alternative among a number of competing alternatives.  This is an important task in [[decision making]].  In such a setting each alternative is described in terms of a set of evaluative criteria.  These criteria are associated with weights of importance.  Intuitively, one may think that the larger the weight for a criterion is, the more critical that criterion should be.  However, this may not be the case.  It is important to distinguish here the notion of ''criticality'' with that of ''importance.''  By ''critical,'' we mean that a criterion with small change (as a percentage) in its weight, may cause a significant change of the final solution.

This, in turn, may dramatically improve the effectiveness of the initial study and assist in the successful implementation of the final solution.\n\n===Time-critical decision making===\n{{see also|Window of opportunity}}\nProducing time-critical accurate knowledge about the state of a system (effect) under computational and data acquisition (cause) constraints is a major challenge, especially if the knowledge required is critical to the system operation where the safety of operators or integrity of costly equipment is at stake, e.g., during manufacturing or during environment substrate drilling.\nUnderstanding and interpreting, a chain of interrelated events, predicted or unpredicted, that may or may not result in a specific state of the system, is the core challenge of this research. Sensitivity analysis may be used to identify which set of input data signals has a significant impact on the set of system state information (i.e. output). Through a cause-effect analysis technique, sensitivity can be used to support the filtering of unsolicited data to reduce the communication and computational capabilities of a standard supervisory control and data acquisition system.<ref name=\"tavakoli2\"/>\n\n===Model calibration and improvement===\nOne application of sensitivity analysis addresses the question of \"What's important to model or system development?\" One can seek to identify important connections between observations, model inputs, and predictions or forecasts. That is, one can seek to understand what observations (measurements of dependent variables) are most and least important to model inputs (parameters representing system characteristics or excitation), what model inputs are most and least important to predictions or forecasts, and what observations are most and least important to the predictions and forecasts. Often the results are surprising, lead to finding problems in the data or model development, and fixing the problems. This leads to better models.<ref name=\"Model Analysis\"/><ref name=\"Methods and Guidelines\"/> In biomedical engineering, sensitivity analysis can be used to determine system dynamics in ODE-based kinetic models. Parameters corresponding to stages of differentiation can be varied to determine which parameter is most influential on cell fate. Therefore, the most limiting step can be identified and the cell state for most advantageous scale-up and expansion can be determined.<ref> {{cite journal | last1 = Selekman | first1 = JA | last2 = Das | first2 = A | last3 = Grundl | first3 = NJ | last4 = Palecek | first4 = SP | year = 2013 | title = Improving efficiency of human pluripotent stem cell differentiation platforms using an integrated experimental and computational approach | url = | journal = Biotechnol Bioeng | volume = 110 | issue = 11| pages = 3024\u201337 | doi = 10.1002/bit.24968 }}</ref> Additionally, complex networks in systems biology can be better understood through fitting mass-action kinetic models.

In these cases the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become a matter of great importance, and a pure sensitivity analysis \u2013 with its emphasis on parametric uncertainty \u2013 may be seen as insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may derive inter-alia from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about 'what the problem is' and foremost about 'who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes more or less implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).\n\nIn order to take these concerns into due consideration the instruments of SA have been extended to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge and model generating process. This approach has been called 'sensitivity auditing'. It takes inspiration from NUSAP,<ref name=\"NUSAP\">{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Sluijs | first1 = JP | last2 = Craye | first2 = M | last3 = Funtowicz | first3 = S | last4 = Kloprogge | first4 = P | last5 = Ravetz | first5 = J | last6 = Risbey | first6 = J | year = 2005 | title = Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 25 | issue = 2| pages = 481\u2013492 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2005.00604.x| pmid = 15876219 }}</ref> a method used to qualify the worth of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers.

Sensitivity auditing is recommended in the European Commission guidelines for impact assessment <ref name=\"EC_GUIDE\"/>, as well as in the report Science Advice for Policy by European Academies <ref>Science Advice for Policy by European Academies, Making sense of science for policy under conditions of complexity and uncertainty, Berlin, 2019.</ref>.\n\n==Related concepts==\n{{unsourced|section|date=February 2020}}\nSensitivity analysis is closely related with uncertainty analysis; while the latter studies the overall [[uncertainty]] in the conclusions of the study, sensitivity analysis tries to identify what source of uncertainty weighs more on the study's conclusions.\n\nThe problem setting in sensitivity analysis also has strong similarities with the field of [[design of experiments]]. In a design of experiments, one studies the effect of some process or intervention (the 'treatment') on some objects (the 'experimental units'). In sensitivity analysis one looks at the effect of varying the inputs of a mathematical model on the output of the model itself. In both disciplines one strives to obtain information from the system with a minimum of physical or numerical experiments.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Causality]]\n* [[Elementary effects method]]\n* [[Experimental uncertainty analysis]]\n* [[Fourier amplitude sensitivity testing]]\n* [[Info-gap decision theory]]\n* [[Interval FEM]]\n* [[Perturbation analysis]]\n* [[Probabilistic design]]\n* [[Probability bounds analysis]]\n* [[Robustification]]\n* [[ROC curve]]\n* [[Uncertainty quantification]]\n* [[Variance-based sensitivity analysis]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Cannav\u00f3 | first1 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Sensitivity analysis for volcanic source modeling quality assessment and model selection | url = | journal = Computers & Geosciences | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 52\u201359 | doi = 10.1016/j.cageo.2012.03.008 | bibcode = 2012CG.....44...52C }}\n*Fass\u00f2 A.

Cem passes mostly through limestone terrain where many [[karst]]ic formations are observed. The terrain through which it flows in its {{convert|58.8|km}} course, is at an elevation of more than 1,200 m and can reach as low as 50 m. Throughout its declining elevation, it passes through narrow valleys and steep canyons, where waterfalls are formed before it reaches the Zeta plain.\n\nThe first cultural indicators of human settlement in the Cem river basin are from the late Copper Age and early Bronze Age (3500-2300 BC). In following millennia, Illyrian tribes, the Roman empire, Slavic principalities, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire controlled the area. Today, the river is divided by Albania and Montenegro.\n\nCem is one of the last free-flowing rivers in Europe. The river's basin is a source of very high biodiversity for the two countries. In the recent decades, it is threatened by industrialization, the installation of small hydropower stations and the effects of climate change.\n\n== Name ==\n[[Ptolemy]] is the first to mention Cem as ''Kinna'' in ancient Greek. In [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] a location named ''Cinna'' in Latin is connected to the river. These two forms are considered to be written forms of a local, [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] name ''Cinua''.<ref name=\"3a\">{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Anton |title=Die Sprache der alten Illyrier |date=1957 |publisher=In Kommission bei R.

Montenegrin \u2013 and also Bosniak and Serbian \u2013 ''Cijevna'' is derived from Serbo-Croatian ''cijev'' (pipe), but other toponyms preserve the older name ''\u0106emovsko polje'' (field of Cem).<ref name=\"3a\"/>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gebirgsfahrten_15.JPG|thumb|Cem in Kelmend region]]\n\nCem originates in [[Kelmend (municipality)|Kelmend]], [[Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]], Albania and flows through the region of [[Mal\u00ebsia]]. The river has two tributaries: Cem of [[Vuk\u00ebl]] (''Cemi i Vuklit'') and Cem of [[Selc\u00eb]] (''Cemi i Selc\u00ebs''), which join at the confluence of [[Tamar\u00eb]].<ref name=\"Maroj4\">{{harvnb|Marojevi\u0107|2014|p=4}}</ref> Cem of Vuk\u00ebl \u2013 the more important of the two in terms of water volume \u2013 rises at 900 m and flows for 17.9&nbsp;km. It passes through a narrow canyon, a terrain which widens only near [[Kozhnja]], where deposition has formed a small limestone valley. A creek called Cem of [[Nik\u00e7]] (''Cem i Nik\u00e7it'') also contributes to its flow volume in the rainy period. As ''Cem i Nik\u00e7it'' passes through Kozhnja, a small hydropower project has been developed.<ref name=\"Kodhelaj18\">{{harvnb|Kodhelaj|2019|p=18}}</ref>\n\nCem of Selc\u00eb rises at 1,250 m on Mt. Bordolec near [[L\u00ebpush\u00eb]] and flows for 22.5&nbsp;km mostly through narrow limestone terrain until the valley of Tamar\u00eb. In its course it passes through [[Gropat e Selc\u00ebs]] [[karstic cave]]s, the canyon of Gerrlla, 900 m long and 25 m deep, and the 30-meter high waterfall of Sllapi before Dobrinj\u00eb.<ref name=\"Maroj4\"/>\n\nAfter confluence, Cem flows generally southwest for {{convert|26.5|km}} and crosses into Montenegro, near Grabom.<ref name=\"Maroj4\"/> A border crossing is also located after this village. Then the river flows through the villages of [[Tuzi|Tuzi municipality]] for {{convert|32.3|km}} before flowing into the [[Mora\u010da]] just south of [[Podgorica]] near Mitrovi\u0107i and [[Mojanovi\u0107i]]. The river and its terrain in Montenegro are divided into two parts. It firstly forms a steep canyon and then slowly crosses into the [[Zeta plain]], part of it called ''\u0106emovsko polje'' after the river. In the field, [[\u0160piro Mugo\u0161a Airport]] stands between Cem and [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]] and further west the [[Podgorica Airport]] is found. In this part, land occupation becomes more urbanized and industrialized.<ref name=\"Maroj5\">{{harvnb|Marojevi\u0107|2014|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThe Cem canyon (''Kanjon Cijevne''/''Kanioni i Cemit'') is 12&nbsp;km long and has a depth of 903 m.<ref name=\"1g\"/> It is the natural habitat of many animal, insect and plant species. The canyon starts at the Albania-Montenegro border and forms a distinct geomorphological formation that crosses into \u0106emovsko polje roughly before [[Dinosha]] near Gurrec.<ref name=\"Maroj5\"/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Dinaric Alps subdivisions-fr.svg|thumb|Geomorphology of the Dinaric Alps. Cem is found in the Prokletije/Albanian Alps subdivision in B31]]\n\nThe geomorphological features of the Cem basin have their origin in the tectonic activity of the [[Alpine orogeny]], which formed the [[Dinaric Alps]] and its southern range, the [[Prokletije]] in the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic era up until today. Specifically, the Cem basin is in the [[High Karst Unit]]. In this sub-unit, tectonic activity creates a vertical uplifting of landmasses and carbonate rocks are a large part of the landscape, which is defined by fluvial processes like the deposion of carbonate sediments by the river's streamflow. As the Prokletije have had glacial features, thus a high accumulutaion of water, the end of the Ice Age saw a general increase of Cem's discharge, which in turn enhanced fluvial processes in the basin.<ref name=\"1g\"/><ref name=\"Mrdak16\">{{harvnb|Mrdak|Had\u017eiablahovi\u0107|2015|p=16}}</ref>\n\nHeavy concentration of limestone has enabled the formation of [[Uvala (landform)|uvalas]], caves and other karst formations.<ref name=\"Mrdak17\">{{harvnb|Mrdak|Had\u017eiablahovi\u0107|2015|p=17}}</ref> As water is retained in limestone, [[denudation]] of geological formations decreases.<ref name=\"1g\">{{cite journal |last1=Djurovi\u0107 |first1=Predrag |last2=Petrovi\u0107 |first2=Aleksandar |title=Large Canyons in Dinaric and Prokletije Mountains Region of Montenegro |journal=Geographica Pannonica |date=2007 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=14-18 |doi=10.5937/GeoPan0711014D |url=http://www.dgt.uns.ac.rs/pannonica/papers/volume11_03.pdf |accessdate=22 January 2020 |ref=1g}}</ref> The result of these interconnected processes is that Cem flows mostly through elevated, vertical and steep terrain that forms canyons, but crosses into small valleys where noncarbonate rocks have allowed horizontal erosion to take place like in the valley of Tamara. Then, the river exits high elevation areas and flows towards the Mora\u010da as the relief flattens and a [[polje]] is formed by karst processes.<ref name=\"1g\"/>\n\n== Drainage Basin == \nThe drainage basin of Cem encompasses {{convert|368|km2|}} and is part of the Adriatic river basin along with other rivers that empty into [[Lake Skadar]], a total area of {{convert|6,560|km2|}}. 238&nbsp;km\u00b2 of the basin are in Albania, where the river and its tributaries originate, and 130&nbsp;km\u00b2 in Montenegro.<ref name=\"Maroj4\"/> In the north, it borders the basin of Vermosh river and in the east that of L\u00ebpush\u00eb river. In the south, Cem's basin ends near [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Bog\u00eb]].<ref name=\"Kodhelaj18\"/>\n\nThe river's elevation ranges from above 1,250 m to no more than 50 m. Its elevation drop forms waterfalls of more than a 50-meter height in Montenegro. Annual precipitation is about 2,500&nbsp;mm - November being the highest point (361&nbsp;mm) and July the lowest (69.9&nbsp;mm). Snowfall occurs mainly in the winter months but can be observed even in May. There is a 40-day period of annual snowfall and an accumulation average of 70 m.<ref name=\"Maroj6\">{{harvnb|Marojevi\u0107|2014|p=6}}</ref>\n\nCem is affected by a continental climate in its upper part and a Mediterranean one as it reaches the Mora\u010da.<ref name=\"Maroj5\"/> Annual temperature is around 6.8-7&nbsp;\u00b0C - January being the coldest month at -3&nbsp;\u00b0C and July the hottest at 15.7-20&nbsp;\u00b0C. Water temperature ranges from 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in the spring  to 13&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer. There are three local winds that affect Cem in Albania.<ref name=\"Kodhelaj16\">{{harvnb|Kodhelaj|2019|p=16}}</ref> Murlani is a dry and cold northern and northeastern wind that blows towards the Adriatic. Shiroku and Juga are humid and warm southern winds that are associated with a rainy period.<ref name=\"Kodhelaj16\"/>\n\n== Discharge ==\nThe river's streamflow increases as tributaries and springs pour into it. Elevation and other morphological features also cause variations in its discharge. In general, the upper part of Cem in Albania has a lower discharge than the flow of Cem through the canyon in Montenegro, where Cem has increased streamflow as it moves through declining elevation. When it reaches the Zeta plain, its streamflow is again reduced as it pours into the Mora\u010da.<ref name=\"Mrdak20\">{{harvnb|Mrdak|Had\u017eiablahovi\u0107|2015|p=20}}</ref>\n\nCem of Vuk\u00ebl contributes 10.2-10.5 m\u00b3/s to the river. Measurements at Tamar\u00eb, where the confluence with Cem of Selc\u00eb is located, show an average discharge of 13.99-14.4 m\u00b3/s. As the river passes into Montenegro near [[Grabom]] karstic springs in Dverbta and Brezhda increase its streamflow.<ref name=\"Maroj6\"/> After this point the average discharge through the canyon is 24.86 m\u00b3/s, but as it crosses into the valley, it can drop even below 5 m\u00b3/s in the dry summer months. The maximal discharge rate of the river has been observed in May and has reached 41,6m\u00b3/s.<ref name=\"Mrdak19\">{{harvnb|Mrdak|Had\u017eiablahovi\u0107|2015|p=19}}</ref>\n\nCauses of the flow decrease are use in the water supply network and environmental factors linked to climate change. The climatic interruption of the water cycle has led to the cyclical decrease of rainfall, groundwater and karstic springs water yield to the river.<ref name=\"4b\">{{cite web |last1=Mitrovi\u0107 |first1=Luka |title=The impact of the climate change on the groundwater regime in the area of the Podgorica-Shkod\u00ebr Basin |pages=83-85 |url=https://issuu.com/regionalnivodovod/docs/waters_of_montenegro_-_volume_4 |publisher=Regionalni Vodovod Crnogorsko Primorje |accessdate=8 January 2020 |ref=4b}}</ref> This trend of flow decrease was observed in the Trgaj measurement station near Dinosha, in 2019, where summer flow was at a very low 3 m\u00b3/s.

Cem passes mostly through limestone terrain where many [[karst]]ic formations are observed. The terrain through which it flows in its {{convert|58.8|km}} course, is at an elevation of more than 1,200 m and can reach as low as 50 m. Throughout its declining elevation, it passes through narrow valleys and steep canyons, where waterfalls are formed before it reaches the Zeta plain.\n\nThe first cultural indicators of human settlement in the Cem river basin are from the late Copper Age and early Bronze Age (3500-2300 BC). In following millennia, Illyrian tribes, the Roman empire, Slavic principalities, the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire controlled the area. Today, the river is divided by Albania and Montenegro.\n\nCem is one of the last free-flowing rivers in Europe. The river's basin is a source of very high biodiversity for the two countries. In the recent decades, it is threatened by industrialization, the installation of small hydropower stations and the effects of climate change.\n\n== Name ==\n[[Ptolemy]] is the first to mention Cem as ''Kinna'' in ancient Greek. In [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] a location named ''Cinna'' in Latin is connected to the river.

Montenegrin \u2013 and also Bosniak and Serbian \u2013 ''Cijevna'' is derived from Serbo-Croatian ''cijev'' (pipe), but other toponyms preserve the older name ''\u0106emovsko polje'' (field of Cem).<ref name=\"3a\"/>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gebirgsfahrten_15.JPG|thumb|Cem in Kelmend region]]\n\nCem originates in [[Kelmend (municipality)|Kelmend]], [[Mal\u00ebsi e Madhe]], Albania and flows through the region of [[Mal\u00ebsia]]. The river has two tributaries: Cem of [[Vuk\u00ebl]] (''Cemi i Vuklit'') and Cem of [[Selc\u00eb]] (''Cemi i Selc\u00ebs''), which join at the confluence of [[Tamar\u00eb]].<ref name=\"Maroj4\">{{harvnb|Marojevi\u0107|2014|p=4}}</ref>Cem of Vuk\u00ebl - the more important of the two in terms of water volume - rises at 900 m and flows for 17.9&nbsp;km. It passes through a narrow canyon, a terrain which widens only near [[Kozhnja]], where deposition has formed a small limestone valley. A creek called Cem of [[Nik\u00e7]] (''Cem i Nik\u00e7it'') also contributes to its flow volume in the rainy period. As ''Cem i Nik\u00e7it'' passes through Kozhnja, a small hydropower project has been developed.<ref name=\"Kodhelaj18\">{{harvnb|Kodhelaj|2019|p=18}}</ref>\n\nCem of Selc\u00eb rises at 1,250 m on Mt. Bordolec near [[L\u00ebpush\u00eb]] and flows for 22.5&nbsp;km mostly through narrow limestone terrain until the valley of Tamar\u00eb. In its course it passes through [[Gropat e Selc\u00ebs]] [[karstic cave]]s, the canyon of Gerrlla, 900 m long and 25 m deep, and the 30-meter high waterfall of Sllapi before Dobrinj\u00eb.<ref name=\"Maroj4\"/>\n\nAfter confluence, Cem flows generally southwest for {{convert|26.5|km}} and crosses into Montenegro, near Grabom.<ref name=\"Maroj4\"/> A border crossing is also located after this village. Then the river flows through the villages of [[Tuzi|Tuzi municipality]] for {{convert|32.3|km}} before flowing into the [[Mora\u010da]] just south of [[Podgorica]] near Mitrovi\u0107i and [[Mojanovi\u0107i]]. The river and its terrain in Montenegro are divided into two parts. It firstly forms a steep canyon and then slowly crosses into the [[Zeta plain]], part of it called ''\u0106emovsko polje'' after the river. In the field, [[\u0160piro Mugo\u0161a Airport]] stands between Cem and [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]] and further west the [[Podgorica Airport]] is found. In this part, land occupation becomes more urbanized and industrialized.<ref name=\"Maroj5\">{{harvnb|Marojevi\u0107|2014|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThe Cem canyon (''Kanjon Cijevne''/''Kanioni i Cemit'') is 12&nbsp;km long and has a depth of 903 m.<ref name=\"1g\"/> It is the natural habitat of many animal, insect and plant species. The canyon starts at the Albania-Montenegro border and forms a distinct geomorphological formation that crosses into \u0106emovsko polje roughly before [[Dinosha]] near Gurrec.<ref name=\"Maroj5\"/>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Dinaric Alps subdivisions-fr.svg|thumb|Geomorphology of the Dinaric Alps. Cem is found in the Prokletije/Albanian Alps subdivision in B31]]\n\nThe geomorphological features of the Cem basin have their origin in the tectonic activity of the [[Alpine orogeny]], which formed the [[Dinaric Alps]] and its southern range, the [[Prokletije]] in the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic era up until today. Specifically, the Cem basin is in the [[High Karst Unit]]. In this sub-unit, tectonic activity creates a vertical uplifting of landmasses and carbonate rocks are a large part of the landscape, which is defined by fluvial processes like the deposion of carbonate sediments by the river's streamflow. As the Prokletije have had glacial features, thus a high accumulutaion of water, the end of the Ice Age saw a general increase of Cem's discharge, which in turn enhanced fluvial processes in the basin.<ref name=\"1g\"/><ref name=\"Mrdak16\">{{harvnb|Mrdak|Had\u017eiablahovi\u0107|2015|p=16}}</ref>\n\nHeavy concentration of limestone has enabled the formation of [[Uvala (landform)|uvalas]], caves and other karst formations.<ref name=\"Mrdak17\">{{harvnb|Mrdak|Had\u017eiablahovi\u0107|2015|p=17}}</ref> As water is retained in limestone, [[denudation]] of geological formations decreases.<ref name=\"1g\">{{cite journal |last1=Djurovi\u0107 |first1=Predrag |last2=Petrovi\u0107 |first2=Aleksandar |title=Large Canyons in Dinaric and Prokletije Mountains Region of Montenegro |journal=Geographica Pannonica |date=2007 |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=14-18 |doi=10.5937/GeoPan0711014D |url=http://www.dgt.uns.ac.rs/pannonica/papers/volume11_03.pdf |accessdate=22 January 2020 |ref=1g}}</ref> The result of these interconnected processes is that Cem flows mostly through elevated, vertical and steep terrain that forms canyons, but crosses into small valleys where noncarbonate rocks have allowed horizontal erosion to take place like in the valley of Tamara. Then, the river exits high elevation areas and flows towards the Mora\u010da as the relief flattens and a [[polje]] is formed by karst processes.<ref name=\"1g\"/>\n\n== Drainage Basin == \nThe drainage basin of Cem encompasses {{convert|368|km2|}} and is part of the Adriatic river basin along with other rivers that empty into [[Lake Skadar]], a total area of {{convert|6,560|km2|}}. 238&nbsp;km\u00b2 of the basin are in Albania, where the river and its tributaries originate, and 130&nbsp;km\u00b2 in Montenegro.<ref name=\"Maroj4\"/> In the north, it borders the basin of Vermosh river and in the east that of L\u00ebpush\u00eb river. In the south, Cem's basin ends near [[Bog\u00eb, Albania|Bog\u00eb]].<ref name=\"Kodhelaj18\"/>\n\nThe river's elevation ranges from above 1,250 m to no more than 50 m. Its elevation drop forms waterfalls of more than a 50-meter height in Montenegro. Annual precipitation is about 2,500&nbsp;mm - November being the highest point (361&nbsp;mm) and July the lowest (69.9&nbsp;mm). Snowfall occurs mainly in the winter months but can be observed even in May.

Elevation and other morphological features also cause variations in its discharge. In general, the upper part of Cem in Albania has a lower discharge than the flow of Cem through the canyon in Montenegro, where Cem has increased streamflow as it moves through declining elevation. When it reaches the Zeta plain, its streamflow is again reduced as it pours into the Mora\u010da.<ref name=\"Mrdak20\">{{harvnb|Mrdak|Had\u017eiablahovi\u0107|2015|p=20}}</ref>\n\nCem of Vuk\u00ebl contributes 10.2-10.5 m\u00b3/s to the river. Measurements at Tamar\u00eb, where the confluence with Cem of Selc\u00eb is located, show an average discharge of 13.99-14.4 m\u00b3/s. As the river passes into Montenegro near [[Grabom]] karstic springs in Dverbta and Brezhda increase its streamflow.<ref name=\"Maroj6\"/> After this point the average discharge through the canyon is 24.86 m\u00b3/s, but as it crosses into the valley, it can drop even below 5 m\u00b3/s in the dry summer months.

These include classics such as the ''Tirukkural'', the Tamil epics, long and short devotional poems.{{sfn|Indira Peterson|1998|pp=166-167}} Some of these texts \"paint a picture of dialogue and mutual tolerance\" between the various Indian religions in the Tamil country, according to Peterson.{{sfn|Indira Peterson|1998|pp=166-167}} Other scholars disagree that these are Jain texts, or that the authors of these texts that praise the Vedas, the Brahmins, Hindu gods and goddesses were Jains.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=464-465}}{{sfn|P.

These include classics such as the ''Tirukkural'', the Tamil epics, long and short devotional poems.{{sfn|Indira Peterson|1998|pp=166-167}} Some of these texts \"paint a picture of dialogue and mutual tolerance\" between the various Indian religions in the Tamil country, according to Peterson.{{sfn|Indira Peterson|1998|pp=166-167}} Other scholars disagree that these are Jain texts, or that the authors of these texts that praise the Vedas, the Brahmins, Hindu gods and goddesses were Jains.{{sfn|Stuart Blackburn|2000|pp=464-465}}{{sfn|P.

When he was sixteen, his family had financial difficulties, and was forced to move to [[Hollywood, Florida]]. Melamed has said that he was raised in a non-believer [[Jew]]ish family who never went to [[synagogue]], except to attend a cousin's [[bar mitzvah]]. When he was asked if he wanted to attend [[Hebrew school]], he said no, and thus had no religious training. However, he credits his non-religious upbringing as helping him to develop a belief in God later in life, as he had no \"forced dogma to overcome.\"<ref name=\"thejc\"/>\n\n==Career==\nHe received his theatrical training at [[Hampshire College]] and the [[Yale School of Drama]]. At Yale, he was a [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] College Graduate Fellow. He was also a nominee for the [[Irene Ryan]] Award, a prize conferred upon the most promising young actors in the United States. While still at Yale, he was an instructor at the well-known performing arts camp, [[Stagedoor Manor]]. After his training, he appeared on stage with several resident theatre companies, including [[The Guthrie Theater]], the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], The [[Yale Repertory Theater]], and on Broadway in the [[Tony Award]]-winning ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]''. Following Amadeus, Melamed entered what he called \"a period of personal darkness\", during which he effectively stopped acting on stage. At the same time, with an insider's understanding of the industry and assistance from his agent, he became established as a [[voice actor]], and continued to do film work.<ref>{{cite web\n| title=In 'A World,' All Voice-Overs Are Not Created Equal\n| url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/08/210135579/in-a-world-all-voice-overs-are-not-created-equal\n| last=Gross\n| first=Terry\n| authorlink=Terry Gross\n| date=2013-08-08\n| work=[[Fresh Air]]\n| publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY Radio]]\n| accessdate=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nMelamed's voice became a familiar presence on television, serving as the sound of the [[Olympics]], [[Mercedes Benz]], [[CBS Sports]], [[USA Network]], the [[Super Bowl]], and numerous commercials and television programs. He became known within the industry as a [[voice actor]], appearing in the [[Grand Theft Auto]] series, and dubbing several actors' entire performances in films. But it was for his portrayal of \"sensitive\" villain Sy Ableman, in [[Joel and Ethan Coen]]'s 2009 film, ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the 2010 [[Academy Awards]], that he became most widely known. About that character, ''Film Confessional'' said, \"Sy Ableman is as great a contemporary movie villain as [[Joker (character)|The Joker]], [[Hans Landa]], or [[Anton Chigurh]].... The character Fred Melamed contrives is the year's most brilliant force of destruction.\"\n\nFor his performance in ''[[A Serious Man]]'', Melamed, along with the Coen Brothers, and the film's Ensemble and Casting Directors won Film Independent's [[Independent Spirit]] [[Robert Altman]] Award. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine listed Melamed's work as among the Best Performances of the Decade, and ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called Sy Ableman \"One of The Best Coen Bros. Characters of All Time\". Several leading U.S. critics, including [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and [[Roger Ebert]] all said his performance was worthy of an [[Academy Award]] nomination.\n\nIn addition, Melamed turns up prolifically in [[Woody Allen]] films. He has appeared in more Allen movies than any other actor besides [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Mia Farrow]] (and Allen himself).  Melamed is featured in ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Radio Days]]'', ''[[Another Woman]]'', ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'', ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Ending]]''. He has also played significant supporting roles in ''[[Suspect (1987 film)|Suspect]]'', ''[[The Good Mother (1988 film)|The Good Mother]]'', ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'', ''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pickup Artist]]'', and other films.\n\nOn television, Melamed stars with [[Maria Bamford]] in the Netflix comedy ''[[Lady Dynamite (TV series)|Lady Dynamite]]'', on FX's [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'', Hulu's [[Golden Globe Award]]-nominated ''[[Casual (TV series)|Casual]]'', the Fox comedy ''[[New Girl]]'', and Verizon Go90's sports send-up ''Now We're Talking''. He is a present or past recurring guest star on [[USA Network]]'s ''[[Benched]]'', [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[House of Lies]]'', [[HBO]]'s ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'', ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'', ''[[Blunt Talk]]'', FX's ''[[Married (TV series)|Married]]'', and ''[[Trial & Error (TV series)|Trial & Error]]''. In previous seasons, he played [[Larry David]]'s smug psychiatrist, Dr. Arthur Thurgood, on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', tough-guy jurist Judge Alan Karpman on ''[[The Good Wife (TV series)|The Good Wife]]'', and played himself in the CBS [[situation comedy]] ''[[The Crazy Ones]]'' with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]. In 2017, he appeared as a special guest star in the acclaimed ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' episode \"[[The Law of Non-Contradiction]]\". He also appeared in 2 episodes of ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' as author D.C. Parlov. \n\nMelamed appeared in the Sundance film ''[[Lemon (2017 film)|Lemon]]'', a collaboration with [[Brett Gelman]] and [[Janicza Bravo]], ''[[Brawl in Cell Block 99]]'' opposite [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Sean McGinly]]'s ''Silver Lake'', which he stars in with [[Martin Starr]], and ''[[Dragged Across Concrete]]''.  Melamed recently starred as Sam in [[Lake Bell]]'s ''[[In a World...]]'', winner of the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the Sundance Film Festival, opposite [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Richard Jenkins]] in ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'', and re-teamed with the Coen brothers and co-stars [[George Clooney]], [[Tilda Swinton]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]] in ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''. He starred previously in [[Get On Up (film)|''Get On Up'']], a bio-pic about the life of [[James Brown]], and opposite [[Elliott Gould]], as auteur/director Bob Wilson, in ''[[Fred Won't Move Out]]'', a film about the decline of a stubborn patriarch and his family. Other recent films include ''[[The Dictator (2012 film)|The Dictator]]'' (2012), with [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] and [[Sir Ben Kingsley]], where Melamed appears in a cameo as the Director of the dictator's Nuclear Weapons Program, and ''[[Some Kind of Beautiful]]'', where Melamed plays a villain, opposite [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Jessica Alba]].\n\nOn Broadway in 2011, after a long hiatus from the theatre, Melamed originated the roles of The Father in Ethan Coen's ''Talking Cure'', and Thomas Moran in Elaine May's ''George Is Dead'', two of the one-act plays that comprised ''[[Relatively Speaking (2011 play)|Relatively Speaking]]''. Subsequently, Melamed took on the role of Vanya in the Guild Hall production of ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', about which ''[[The New York Times]]'' said he gave \"an excellent (...) multi-layered performance (...) Mr. Melamed easily inhabits the comic, awkward lover, but also brings out Vanya's vast loneliness\".\n\nAs a writer, he has produced screenplays including ''Girl of the Perfume River'', ''A Jones for Gash'', ''The Asshat Project'', and is currently at work on a long-form, television version of ''The Preservationist'', a fictional drama inspired by the case of Melamed's college friend, [[Edward Forbes Smiley III]], a renowned cartographic expert and dealer, who admitted to having been the most brazen and prolific map thief of all time.\n\n==Personal life==\nMelamed lives with his wife and twin sons in Los Angeles.

Characters of All Time\". Several leading U.S. critics, including [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', and [[Roger Ebert]] all said his performance was worthy of an [[Academy Award]] nomination.\n\nIn addition, Melamed turns up prolifically in [[Woody Allen]] films. He has appeared in more Allen movies than any other actor besides [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Mia Farrow]] (and Allen himself).  Melamed is featured in ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Radio Days]]'', ''[[Another Woman]]'', ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'', ''[[Husbands and Wives]]'', and ''[[Hollywood Ending]]''. He has also played significant supporting roles in ''[[Suspect (1987 film)|Suspect]]'', ''[[The Good Mother (1988 film)|The Good Mother]]'', ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'', ''[[The Pick-up Artist (film)|The Pickup Artist]]'', and other films.\n\nOn television, Melamed stars with [[Maria Bamford]] in the Netflix comedy ''[[Lady Dynamite (TV series)|Lady Dynamite]]'', on FX's [[Emmy Award]]-winning ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'', Hulu's [[Golden Globe Award]]-nominated ''[[Casual (TV series)|Casual]]'', the Fox comedy ''[[New Girl]]'', and Verizon Go90's sports send-up ''Now We're Talking''. He is a present or past recurring guest star on [[USA Network]]'s ''[[Benched]]'', [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[House of Lies]]'', [[HBO]]'s ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'', ''[[Childrens Hospital]]'', ''[[Blunt Talk]]'', FX's ''[[Married (TV series)|Married]]'', and ''[[Trial & Error (TV series)|Trial & Error]]''. In previous seasons, he played [[Larry David]]'s smug psychiatrist, Dr. Arthur Thurgood, on ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', tough-guy jurist Judge Alan Karpman on ''[[The Good Wife (TV series)|The Good Wife]]'', and played himself in the CBS [[situation comedy]] ''[[The Crazy Ones]]'' with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]. In 2017, he appeared as a special guest star in the acclaimed ''[[Fargo (TV series)|Fargo]]'' episode \"[[The Law of Non-Contradiction]]\". He also appeared in 2 episodes of ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' as author D.C. Parlov. \n\nMelamed appeared in the Sundance film ''[[Lemon (2017 film)|Lemon]]'', a collaboration with [[Brett Gelman]] and [[Janicza Bravo]], ''[[Brawl in Cell Block 99]]'' opposite [[Vince Vaughn]], [[Sean McGinly]]'s ''Silver Lake'', which he stars in with [[Martin Starr]], and ''[[Dragged Across Concrete]]''.  Melamed recently starred as Sam in [[Lake Bell]]'s ''[[In a World...]]'', winner of the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at the Sundance Film Festival, opposite [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Richard Jenkins]] in ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'', and re-teamed with the Coen brothers and co-stars [[George Clooney]], [[Tilda Swinton]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]] in ''[[Hail, Caesar!]]''. He starred previously in [[Get On Up (film)|''Get On Up'']], a bio-pic about the life of [[James Brown]], and opposite [[Elliott Gould]], as auteur/director Bob Wilson, in ''[[Fred Won't Move Out]]'', a film about the decline of a stubborn patriarch and his family. Other recent films include ''[[The Dictator (2012 film)|The Dictator]]'' (2012), with [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] and [[Sir Ben Kingsley]], where Melamed appears in a cameo as the Director of the dictator's Nuclear Weapons Program, and ''[[Some Kind of Beautiful]]'', where Melamed plays a villain, opposite [[Pierce Brosnan]] and [[Jessica Alba]].\n\nOn Broadway in 2011, after a long hiatus from the theatre, Melamed originated the roles of The Father in Ethan Coen's ''Talking Cure'', and Thomas Moran in Elaine May's ''George Is Dead'', two of the one-act plays that comprised ''[[Relatively Speaking (2011 play)|Relatively Speaking]]''. Subsequently, Melamed took on the role of Vanya in the Guild Hall production of ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'', about which ''[[The New York Times]]'' said he gave \"an excellent (...) multi-layered performance (...) Mr. Melamed easily inhabits the comic, awkward lover, but also brings out Vanya's vast loneliness\".\n\nAs a writer, he has produced screenplays including ''Girl of the Perfume River'', ''A Jones for Gash'', ''The Asshat Project'', and is currently at work on a long-form, television version of ''The Preservationist'', a fictional drama inspired by the case of Melamed's college friend, [[Edward Forbes Smiley III]], a renowned cartographic expert and dealer, who admitted to having been the most brazen and prolific map thief of all time.\n\n==Personal life==\nMelamed lives with his wife and twin sons in Los Angeles. Both of the Melamed children were born with [[autism]] and he and his wife have been involved in advocacy for persons living with [[autism spectrum disorder]] and their families.<ref name=\"thejc\"/>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

As an example there are several Portuguese food recipes with [[canned food]].<ref>[https://covid19.min-saude.pt/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Receitas_Enlatados-Isolamento.pdf Receitas Enlatados Isolamento]</ref> \n[[File:CARTAZES-COVID19-V25-02-2020 SINTOMAS.pdf|alt=Portuguese COVID-19 Symptoms|thumb|Portuguese COVID-19 Symptoms|392x392px]]\n\n== Hospitals for COVID-19 ==\nThe following is a list of the front line COVID-19 hospitals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Situa\u00e7\u00e3o em Portugal |url=https://www.dgs.pt/pagina-de-entrada3/corona-virus/situacao-em-portugal.aspx |website=www.dgs.pt |publisher=www.dgs.pt |accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Region\n!Hospital\n!Adults\n!Pediatric\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |ARS North\n|Braga\n|{{yes C|}}\n|\n|-\n|Santo Ant\u00f3nio\n|{{yes C|}}\n|\n|-\n|S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o\n|{{yes C|}}\n|{{yes C|}}\n|-\n|Pedro Hispano\n|{{yes C|}}\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ARS Center\n|[[Centro Hospitalar e Universit\u00e1rio de Coimbra|CHU Coimbra]]\n|{{yes C|}}\n|{{yes C|}} \n|-\n|ULS Guarda\n|{{yes C|}}\n|{{yes C|}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ARS Lisbon\nand Tagus Valley\n|[[Hospital de Santa Maria|Santa Maria]]\n|{{yes C|}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Hospital Curry Cabral|Curry Cabral]]\n|{{yes C|}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Hospital de Dona Estef\u00e2nia|Dona Estef\u00e2nia]]\n|\n|{{yes C|}}\n|-\n|ARS Algarve\n|Faro\n|{{yes C|}}\n|{{yes C|}}\n|-\n|RA Madeira\n|Dr. N\u00e9lio Mendon\u00e7a\n|{{yes C|}}\n|{{yes C|}}\n|-\n|RA A\u00e7ores\n|Santo Esp\u00edrito (Terceira)\n|{{yes C|}}\n|{{yes C|}}\n|}\n\n==Cases timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\"\n|+ |{{nowrap|New COVID-19 cases in Portugal by region}}\n!

Accessed January 7, 2009.</ref> Added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 9, 1982, the ''Binghamton'' was possibly the last surviving steam ferry built to serve [[New York Harbor]], where commercial steam navigation and double-ended steam ferries got their start, and which was profoundly shaped by vessels of this kind.\n<!--The Binghamton is currently for sale: http://www.boats.com/power-boats/1905-newport-news-shipbuilding-hoboken-ferry-company-binghamton-5762455/#.Vzt4AEzD_cs-->\n\n==Background==\n[[File:John Stevens of Hoboken.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] of Hoboken inaugurated the world's first steam ferry service between Hoboken and Manhattan in 1811.]]\nUntil the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Manhattan]] and tunneled under the [[Hudson River]], all New York-bound rail lines from the west terminated at the New Jersey shoreline of [[New York Harbor]]. Accordingly, a number of independent and railroad-affiliated ferry companies provided passenger and light freight service across the harbor. One particular type of ferryboat, the \"double-ender,\" was especially common in New York Harbor.\n\n[[Steamboat|Steam navigation]] met its first commercial success in New York Harbor, with the voyage of [[Robert Fulton]]'s [[North River Steamboat]] (Clermont) from New York to Albany in 1807.  Four years later, in 1811, [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] inaugurated what is thought to be the world's first steam ferry service on the Hudson River between Hoboken and Manhattan with the vessel ''Juliana''.  The first American double-ended ferries appeared the following year with the paddle-wheelers ''Jersey'' and ''York'' of [[Robert Fulton]]'s York & Jersey Steamboat Ferry Company.<ref name=\"Hilton\">{{cite book |last1=Hilton |first1=George Woodman |title=The illustrated history of paddle steamers |date=1976 |location=New York |isbn=9780846703518 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000hilt/page/73 73-76] |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000hilt/page/73 }}</ref> Excellent for transporting vehicles, the double-enders were well adapted to New York Harbor, where there was considerable demand for speed and efficiency (vehicles could drive on and off from either end, and time-consuming turns were not necessary). It has been estimated that over 400 double-ended ferries operated in New York Harbor during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The peak years were 1906-1908 when approximately 150 double-ended ferries were in service in the Harbor.<ref name=\"Hilton\" />\n\nThe Hoboken Ferry Company was a subsidiary of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W). The company had a fleet of six ferryboats when it ceased operations in 1967.  These vessels took their names from principal stations on the DL&W RR's main line from Hoboken, NJ to Buffalo, NY.  Three of these - the ''Elmira'', ''Scranton'', and ''Pocono'' (n\u00e9e ''Scandinavia'') - the ''Binghamton'''s sisters, were also built in 1905. (Another, the ''Ithaca'', was destroyed by fire in 1946.) Of these, the ''Binghamton'' is now the only survivor.\n\nThe Binghamton's engine: 4 cylinder, double compound, marine steam engine.  Like the double ended ferryboat Binghamton, this engine is of an axially symmetric design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s240/kellygail/dcompoundsmall.jpg|title=Double expansion engine|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Double [[compound engine]]<nowiki/>s were superseded by more efficient [[Steam engine|Triple expansion]] steam engines.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lackawanna EL Logos.JPG|thumb|180px|left|The ''Binghamton'' wore the funnel markings of the [[Lackawanna Railroad|DL&W]] (left) before 1960 and of the [[Erie Lackawanna|Erie-Lackawanna RR]] (right) at the end of her career.]]\nThe ''Binghamton'' (Hull #49) was one of five identical screw-propeller, double-ended ferryboats built by the [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry-dock Company]] \nat [[Newport News, Virginia]] in 1904\u201305 to designs by Gardner & Cox, naval architects. She was launched on February 20, 1905, with Miss Charlotte Emery, daughter of John M. Emery, the newly promoted superintendent of the Hoboken Ferry Company and Ferry Department of the DL&W, serving as her sponsor. The ''Binghamton'' was completed a month later and left the Newport News yard on March 25 for the trip to Hoboken, New Jersey. She was placed in commission on April 3. Her Captain for the first crossing was Oren D. Relyea.\n\nHer normal run was from the [[Hoboken Terminal]] to Barclay Street, a twelve-minute journey of approximately 1 and 3/4 miles, a trip made continuously nearly every day for more than sixty years (on occasion she substituted on the Hoboken - 23rd Street run).\n\nAs alternate methods of travel across the Harbor were implemented, ferry transport diminished. The opening of the Pennsylvania Railroad line to Penn Station in Manhattan (1907); the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|Hudson and Manhattan Rapid Transit Line]] (1907); the [[Holland Tunnel|Holland]] and [[Lincoln Tunnel|Lincoln]] tunnels (1927; 1937); and the [[George Washington Bridge]] (1931) all contributed to the decline of the ferries. In 1960, the DL&W RR merged with the Erie Railroad to form the [[Erie Lackawanna Railway|Erie-Lackawanna Railroad]].  The last ferry crossing of the Hoboken company, in operation since 1821, took place on November 22, 1967, when the railroad closed its trans-Hudson operations and offered its ferries for sale.  The Erie-Lackawanna Railroad eventually filed for bankruptcy before being absorbed into [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nHudson River ferry service later experienced a revival, beginning with services provided by [[NY Waterway]] in December 1986.  These services are maintained by small, single-ended diesel-powered pedestrian ferries that carry on the tradition of their steam-powered predecessors.  Traditional double-ended ferries (diesel-powered) meanwhile continue to serve in New York Harbor on the [[Staten Island Ferry]].\n\n==Appearance on film==\nIn 1948, Marathon Pictures released a crime drama titled [[Close-Up (1948 film)|''Close-Up'']]. A \"B\" production, it was shot entirely in Manhattan. The film includes a dramatic pursuit scene shot outside of the Hoboken Ferry terminal, at Barclay Street, and on board the ferryboat ''Binghamton'' itself. Detailed interiors and exteriors of the ferryboat appear in this scene, as well as passengers and deckhands. The film starred [[Alan Baxter (actor)|Alan Baxter]].\n\n==Restaurant conversion==\n[[File:Binghamton plaque.JPG|thumb|220px|left|The ''Binghamton'' retired in 1967.]]\nThe ''Binghamton'' was acquired in 1969 by Edward Russo, an Edgewater, NJ contractor, for conversion into a restaurant. Russo planned large dining rooms on the Upper and Main decks, plus two pubs in the former engine room.  He leased a berth at Edgewater, NJ, and scheduled a grand opening for Labor Day, 1970.  But a tug strike and delays in dredging her berth at Edgewater indefinitely postponed these plans.<ref name=\"Cotterell 1982\">Cotterell, Harry Jr.  \"Ferryboat Binghamton, Edgewater, Bergen County, New Jersey.\"  National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form,  February 1982.</ref>\n\nThe ''Binghamton'' finally moved to Edgewater in 1971.  Unable to find a concessionaire to operate the restaurant, Russo relinquished control of the vessel in 1973.  In late 1974, the ''Binghamton'' was sold to Ferry Binghamton Inc., of Hackensack, New Jersey, for conversion to a restaurant and nightclub.  On February 28, 1975, her new owners had the vessel moved to a new permanent berth about one half mile downstream.  The restaurant opened later that year.<ref name=\"Cotterell 1982\"/>\n\nThe US Department of the Interior listed the ''Binghamton'' on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Accessed January 7, 2009.</ref> Added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 9, 1982, the ''Binghamton'' was possibly the last surviving steam ferry built to serve [[New York Harbor]], where commercial steam navigation and double-ended steam ferries got their start, and which was profoundly shaped by vessels of this kind.\n<!--The Binghamton is currently for sale: http://www.boats.com/power-boats/1905-newport-news-shipbuilding-hoboken-ferry-company-binghamton-5762455/#.Vzt4AEzD_cs-->\n\n==Background==\n[[File:John Stevens of Hoboken.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] of Hoboken inaugurated the world's first steam ferry service between Hoboken and Manhattan in 1811.]]\nUntil the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] built [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Manhattan]] and tunneled under the [[Hudson River]], all New York-bound rail lines from the west terminated at the New Jersey shoreline of [[New York Harbor]]. Accordingly, a number of independent and railroad-affiliated ferry companies provided passenger and light freight service across the harbor. One particular type of ferryboat, the \"double-ender,\" was especially common in New York Harbor.\n\n[[Steamboat|Steam navigation]] met its first commercial success in New York Harbor, with the voyage of [[Robert Fulton]]'s [[North River Steamboat]] (Clermont) from New York to Albany in 1807.  Four years later, in 1811, [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] inaugurated what is thought to be the world's first steam ferry service on the Hudson River between Hoboken and Manhattan with the vessel ''Juliana''.  The first American double-ended ferries appeared the following year with the paddle-wheelers ''Jersey'' and ''York'' of [[Robert Fulton]]'s York & Jersey Steamboat Ferry Company.<ref name=\"Hilton\">{{cite book |last1=Hilton |first1=George Woodman |title=The illustrated history of paddle steamers |date=1976 |location=New York |isbn=9780846703518 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000hilt/page/73 73-76] |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000hilt/page/73 }}</ref> Excellent for transporting vehicles, the double-enders were well adapted to New York Harbor, where there was considerable demand for speed and efficiency (vehicles could drive on and off from either end, and time-consuming turns were not necessary). It has been estimated that over 400 double-ended ferries operated in New York Harbor during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The peak years were 1906-1908 when approximately 150 double-ended ferries were in service in the Harbor.<ref name=\"Hilton\" />\n\nThe Hoboken Ferry Company was a subsidiary of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W). The company had a fleet of six ferryboats when it ceased operations in 1967.  These vessels took their names from principal stations on the DL&W RR's main line from Hoboken, NJ to Buffalo, NY.  Three of these - the ''Elmira'', ''Scranton'', and ''Pocono'' (n\u00e9e ''Scandinavia'') - the ''Binghamton'''s sisters, were also built in 1905. (Another, the ''Ithaca'', was destroyed by fire in 1946.) Of these, the ''Binghamton'' is now the only survivor.\n\nThe Binghamton's engine: 4 cylinder, double compound, marine steam engine.  Like the double ended ferryboat Binghamton, this engine is of an axially symmetric design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s240/kellygail/dcompoundsmall.jpg|title=Double expansion engine|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Double [[compound engine]]<nowiki/>s were superseded by more efficient [[Steam engine|Triple expansion]] steam engines.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lackawanna EL Logos.JPG|thumb|180px|left|The ''Binghamton'' wore the funnel markings of the [[Lackawanna Railroad|DL&W]] (left) before 1960 and of the [[Erie Lackawanna|Erie-Lackawanna RR]] (right) at the end of her career.]]\nThe ''Binghamton'' (Hull #49) was one of five identical screw-propeller, double-ended ferryboats built by the [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry-dock Company]] \nat [[Newport News, Virginia]] in 1904\u201305 to designs by Gardner & Cox, naval architects. She was launched on February 20, 1905, with Miss Charlotte Emery, daughter of John M. Emery, the newly promoted superintendent of the Hoboken Ferry Company and Ferry Department of the DL&W, serving as her sponsor. The ''Binghamton'' was completed a month later and left the Newport News yard on March 25 for the trip to Hoboken, New Jersey. She was placed in commission on April 3. Her Captain for the first crossing was Oren D. Relyea.\n\nHer normal run was from the [[Hoboken Terminal]] to Barclay Street, a twelve-minute journey of approximately 1 and 3/4 miles, a trip made continuously nearly every day for more than sixty years (on occasion she substituted on the Hoboken - 23rd Street run).\n\nAs alternate methods of travel across the Harbor were implemented, ferry transport diminished. The opening of the Pennsylvania Railroad line to Penn Station in Manhattan (1907); the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|Hudson and Manhattan Rapid Transit Line]] (1907); the [[Holland Tunnel|Holland]] and [[Lincoln Tunnel|Lincoln]] tunnels (1927; 1937); and the [[George Washington Bridge]] (1931) all contributed to the decline of the ferries. In 1960, the DL&W RR merged with the Erie Railroad to form the [[Erie Lackawanna Railway|Erie-Lackawanna Railroad]].  The last ferry crossing of the Hoboken company, in operation since 1821, took place on November 22, 1967, when the railroad closed its trans-Hudson operations and offered its ferries for sale.  The Erie-Lackawanna Railroad eventually filed for bankruptcy before being absorbed into [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nHudson River ferry service later experienced a revival, beginning with services provided by [[NY Waterway]] in December 1986.  These services are maintained by small, single-ended diesel-powered pedestrian ferries that carry on the tradition of their steam-powered predecessors.

She began operation in March 2004 and primarily cruises in [[Asia]] during the northern hemisphere summer and [[Australia]] during the southern hemisphere summer. She is a subclassed {{sclass-|Grand|cruise ship|0}} ship, which is also known as a Gem-class ship. ''Diamond Princess'' and her [[sister ship]], {{ship||Sapphire Princess}}, are the widest subclass of ''Grand''-class ships, as they have a {{convert|37.5|m|ftin|adj=on}} [[beam (nautical)|beam]], while all other ''Grand''-class ships have a beam of {{convert|36|m|ftin}}. ''Diamond Princess'' and ''Sapphire Princess'' were both built in [[Nagasaki, Japan]], by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Industries]].\n\nThere have been two notable outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship&nbsp;\u2013 an outbreak of [[gastroenteritis]] caused by [[norovirus]] in 2016 and an [[2020 coronavirus pandemic on Diamond Princess|outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus]] in 2020. In the latter incident, the ship was quarantined for nearly a month with her passengers on board, and her passengers and crew were subject to further quarantine after disembarking. At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, and twelve have died.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe diesel-electric plant of ''Diamond Princess'' has four diesel generators and a gas turbine generator. The diesel generators are [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] 46 series common rail engines, two [[straight-nine engine|straight 9-cylinder configuration]] (9L46), and two [[straight-eight engine|straight 8-cylinder configuration]] (8L46). The 8- and 9-cylinder engines can produce approximately {{convert|8500|kW|hp|lk=on|abbr=on}} and {{convert|9500|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. These engines are fueled with [[heavy fuel oil]] (HFO or bunker c) and [[Gas oil|marine gas oil]] (MGO) depending on the local regulations regarding emissions, as MGO produces much lower emissions, but is much more expensive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe gas turbine generator is a [[General Electric]] [[General Electric LM2500|LM2500]], producing a peak of {{convert|25000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} fueled by MGO. This generator is much more expensive to run than the diesel generators, and is used mostly in areas, such as [[Alaska]], where the emissions regulations are strict. It is also used when high speed is required to make it to a port in a shorter time period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThere are two propulsion electric motors, driving fixed-pitch propellers and six thrusters used during maneuvering&nbsp;\u2013 three at the bow and three at the stern. The propulsion electric motors (PEMs), are conventional synchronous motors made by [[Alstom]] Motors. The two motors are each rated to 20&nbsp;MW and have a maximum speed of 154 rpm. (Rated speed of 0-145 rpm.){{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn June 2017 ''Diamond Princess'' was retrofitted with a [[Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System|hull air lubrication system]] to reduce fuel consumption and related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air lubrication system |url=http://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/news-headlines/diamond-princess-retrofitted-with-silverstream-air-lubrication-system.html |website=Seatrade-cruise |access-date=17 December 2018|date=14 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Construction and career==\nThe ship was originally intended to be christened ''Sapphire Princess''. However, construction of another ship&nbsp;\u2013\u2009the one intended to be ''Diamond Princess'' (currently sailing as {{ship||Sapphire Princess}})&nbsp;\u2013\u2009was delayed when fire swept through her decks during construction. Because completion of the damaged ship would be delayed for some time, her [[sister ship]], which was also under construction, was renamed ''Diamond Princess''. The name swap helped keep the delivery of ''Diamond Princess'' on time.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Cruise Ship ''Sapphire Princess'' To Be Delivered to Princess Cruises |url=http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=7393 | publisher=Hideo Ikuno, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. |date=26 May 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318104519/http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=7393 |archivedate=18 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\nShe was the first [[Princess Cruises]] ship to be built in a Japanese shipyard, and the first to forego the controversial \"wing\" or \"shopping cart handle\" structure overhanging the stern, which houses the Skywalkers Nightclub on {{ship||Caribbean Princess}}, {{ship||Golden Princess}} and {{ship||Star Princess|2001|2}}, and which was originally also a feature of {{ship||Grand Princess}} prior to her 2011 refit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nPrior to 2014, ''Diamond Princess'' alternated sailing north and southbound voyages of the glacier cruises during the northern summer months and in the southern summer, she sailed from Australia and New Zealand.

She began operation in March 2004 and primarily cruises in [[Asia]] during the northern hemisphere summer and [[Australia]] during the southern hemisphere summer. She is a subclassed {{sclass-|Grand|cruise ship|0}} ship, which is also known as a Gem-class ship. ''Diamond Princess'' and her [[sister ship]], {{ship||Sapphire Princess}}, are the widest subclass of ''Grand''-class ships, as they have a {{convert|37.5|m|ftin|adj=on}} [[beam (nautical)|beam]], while all other ''Grand''-class ships have a beam of {{convert|36|m|ftin}}. ''Diamond Princess'' and ''Sapphire Princess'' were both built in [[Nagasaki, Japan]], by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Industries]].\n\nThere have been two notable outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship&nbsp;\u2013 an outbreak of [[gastroenteritis]] caused by [[norovirus]] in 2016 and an [[2020 coronavirus pandemic on Diamond Princess|outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus]] in 2020. In the latter incident, the ship was quarantined for nearly a month with her passengers on board, and her passengers and crew were subject to further quarantine after disembarking. At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, and twelve have died.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe diesel-electric plant of ''Diamond Princess'' has four diesel generators and a gas turbine generator. The diesel generators are [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] 46 series common rail engines, two [[straight-nine engine|straight 9-cylinder configuration]] (9L46), and two [[straight-eight engine|straight 8-cylinder configuration]] (8L46). The 8- and 9-cylinder engines can produce approximately {{convert|8500|kW|hp|lk=on|abbr=on}} and {{convert|9500|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. These engines are fueled with [[heavy fuel oil]] (HFO or bunker c) and [[Gas oil|marine gas oil]] (MGO) depending on the local regulations regarding emissions, as MGO produces much lower emissions, but is much more expensive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe gas turbine generator is a [[General Electric]] [[General Electric LM2500|LM2500]], producing a peak of {{convert|25000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} fueled by MGO. This generator is much more expensive to run than the diesel generators, and is used mostly in areas, such as [[Alaska]], where the emissions regulations are strict. It is also used when high speed is required to make it to a port in a shorter time period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThere are two propulsion electric motors, driving fixed-pitch propellers and six thrusters used during maneuvering&nbsp;\u2013 three at the bow and three at the stern. The propulsion electric motors (PEMs), are conventional synchronous motors made by [[Alstom]] Motors. The two motors are each rated to 20&nbsp;MW and have a maximum speed of 154 rpm. (Rated speed of 0-145 rpm.){{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn June 2017 ''Diamond Princess'' was retrofitted with a [[Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System|hull air lubrication system]] to reduce fuel consumption and related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air lubrication system |url=http://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/news-headlines/diamond-princess-retrofitted-with-silverstream-air-lubrication-system.html |website=Seatrade-cruise |access-date=17 December 2018|date=14 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Construction and career==\nThe ship was originally intended to be christened ''Sapphire Princess''. However, construction of another ship&nbsp;\u2013\u2009the one intended to be ''Diamond Princess'' (currently sailing as {{ship||Sapphire Princess}})&nbsp;\u2013\u2009was delayed when fire swept through her decks during construction. Because completion of the damaged ship would be delayed for some time, her [[sister ship]], which was also under construction, was renamed ''Diamond Princess''. The name swap helped keep the delivery of ''Diamond Princess'' on time.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Cruise Ship ''Sapphire Princess'' To Be Delivered to Princess Cruises |url=http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=7393 | publisher=Hideo Ikuno, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. |date=26 May 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318104519/http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=7393 |archivedate=18 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\nShe was the first [[Princess Cruises]] ship to be built in a Japanese shipyard, and the first to forego the controversial \"wing\" or \"shopping cart handle\" structure overhanging the stern, which houses the Skywalkers Nightclub on {{ship||Caribbean Princess}}, {{ship||Golden Princess}} and {{ship||Star Princess|2001|2}}, and which was originally also a feature of {{ship||Grand Princess}} prior to her 2011 refit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nPrior to 2014, ''Diamond Princess'' alternated sailing north and southbound voyages of the glacier cruises during the northern summer months and in the southern summer, she sailed from Australia and New Zealand.
