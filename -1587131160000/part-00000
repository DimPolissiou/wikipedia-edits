Its relation to permittivity in the very simple case of ''linear, homogeneous, [[isotropic]]'' materials with ''\"instantaneous\" response'' to changes in electric field is:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{D}=\\varepsilon \\mathbf{E}</math>\n\nwhere the permittivity {{mvar|\u03b5}} is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. If the medium is [[anisotropic]], the permittivity is a second rank [[tensor]].\n\nIn general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear medium]], the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.\n\nIn SI units, permittivity is measured in [[farads]] per meter (F/m or A<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>4</sup>\u00b7kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7m<sup>\u22123</sup>). The displacement field {{math|'''D'''}} is measured in units of [[coulomb]]s per [[square meter]] (C/m<sup>2</sup>), while the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} is measured in [[volt]]s per meter (V/m). {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}} describe the interaction between charged objects. {{math|'''D'''}} is related to the ''charge densities'' associated with this interaction, while {{math|'''E'''}} is related to the ''forces'' and ''potential differences''.\n\n==Vacuum permittivity==\n\n{{main|Vacuum permittivity}}\n\nThe vacuum permittivity {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} (also called '''permittivity of free space''' or the '''electric constant''') is the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|'''D'''|'''E'''}}}} in [[Vacuum|free space]].

The formula for capacitance in a [[Parallel-plate capacitor|parallel plate capacitor]] is written as\n\n:<math>C = \\varepsilon \\ \\frac{A}{d}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the area of one plate, <math>d</math> is the distance between the plates, and <math>\\varepsilon</math> is the permittivity of the medium between the two plates. For a capacitor with relative permittivity <math>\\kappa</math>, it can be said that\n\n:<math>C = \\kappa \\ \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{A}{d}</math>\n\n=== Gauss's law ===\nPermittivity is connected to electric flux (and by extension electric field) through [[Gauss's law]]. Gauss's law states that for a closed [[Gaussian surface]], s\n\n:<math>\\Phi_E = \\frac{Q_\\text{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0} = \\oint_s \\mathbf{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{A}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi_E</math> is the net electric flux passing through the surface, <math>Q_\\text{enc}</math> is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface, <math>\\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field vector at a given point on the surface, and <math>\\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{A}</math> is a differential area vector on the Gaussian surface.\n\nIf the Gaussian surface uniformly encloses an insulated, symmetrical charge arrangement, the formula can be simplified to\n\n:<math>EA \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{Q_\\text{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> represents the angle between the electric field vector and the area vector.\n\nIf all of the electric field lines cross the surface at 90\u00b0, the formula can be further simplified to\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{Q_\\text{enc}}{\\varepsilon_0 A}</math>\n\nBecause the surface area of a sphere is <math>4 \\pi r^2</math>, the electric field a distance <math>r</math> away from a uniform, spherical charge arrangement is\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0 A} = \\frac{Q}{\\varepsilon_0 \\left(4 \\pi r^2\\right)}</math>\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 r^2} = \\frac{kQ}{r^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>k</math> is [[Coulomb's constant]] (<math>\\sim 9.0 \\times 10^9 \\ \\text{m}/\\text{F}</math>). This formula applies to the electric field due to a point charge, outside of a conducting sphere or shell, outside of a uniformly charged insulating sphere, or between the plates of a spherical capacitor.\n\n== Dispersion and causality ==\n\nIn general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\chi\\left(t - t'\\right) \\mathbf{E}\\left(t'\\right) \\, dt'.</math>\n\nThat is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'')}}. The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{math|\u0394''t'' < 0}}. An instantaneous response would correspond to a [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} ''\u03c7\u03b4''(\u0394''t'')}}.\n\nIt is convenient to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] with respect to time and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Because of the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi(\\omega) \\mathbf{E}(\\omega).</math>\n\nThis frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. effectively {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{math|\u0394''t'' < 0}}), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation|Kramers\u2013Kronig constraints]] on the susceptibility {{math|''\u03c7''(0)}}.\n\n===Complex permittivity===\n\n[[Image:Dielectric responses.svg|thumb|right|454px|A dielectric permittivity spectrum over a wide range of frequencies. {{math|''\u03b5''\u2032}} and {{math|''\u03b5''\u2033}} denote the real and the imaginary part of the permittivity, respectively.

This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material's polarization does not change instantaneously when an electric field is applied. The response must always be ''causal'' (arising after the applied field), which can be represented by a phase difference. For this reason, permittivity is often treated as a complex function of the [[Angular frequency|(angular) frequency]] {{mvar|\u03c9}} of the applied field:\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon \\rightarrow \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega)</math>\n\n(since complex numbers allow specification of magnitude and phase). The definition of permittivity therefore becomes\n\n:<math>D_0 e^{-i \\omega t} = \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) E_0 e^{-i \\omega t},</math>\n\nwhere\n* {{math|''D''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''E''<sub>0</sub>}} are the amplitudes of the displacement and electric fields, respectively,\n* {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]], {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}}.\n\nThe response of a medium to static electric fields is described by the low-frequency limit of permittivity, also called the static permittivity {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>s</sub>}} (also {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>DC</sub>}}):\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{s} = \\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0} \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega).</math>\n\nAt the high-frequency limit (meaning optical frequencies), the complex permittivity is commonly referred to as {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>\u221e</sub>}} (or sometimes {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>opt</sub>}}<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=Philip |date= 2015-05-26|title=Solid State Physics |edition=2 |url=http://philiphofmann.net/solid-state-book/ |location= |publisher=Wiley-VCH |page=194 |isbn=978-3527412822 |author-link= }}\n</ref>). At the [[plasma frequency]] and below, dielectrics behave as ideal metals, with electron gas behavior. The static permittivity is a good approximation for alternating fields of low frequencies, and as the frequency increases a measurable phase difference {{mvar|\u03b4}} emerges between {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}}. The frequency at which the phase shift becomes noticeable depends on temperature and the details of the medium. For moderate field strength ({{math|''E''<sub>0</sub>}}), {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}} remain proportional, and\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{D_0}{E_0} = |\\varepsilon|e^{-i\\delta}.</math>\n\nSince the response of materials to alternating fields is characterized by a complex permittivity, it is natural to separate its real and imaginary parts, which is done by convention in the following way:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon'(\\omega) - i\\varepsilon''(\\omega) = \\left| \\frac{D_0}{E_0} \\right| \\left( \\cos \\delta  - i\\sin \\delta  \\right). </math>\n\nwhere\n* {{math|''\u03b5''\u2032}} is the real part of the permittivity;\n* {{math|''\u03b5''\u2033}} is the imaginary part of the permittivity;\n* {{mvar|\u03b4}} is the [[loss angle]].\n\nThe choice of sign for time-dependence, {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''i\u03c9t''</sup>}}, dictates the sign convention for the imaginary part of permittivity. The signs used here correspond to those commonly used in physics, whereas for the engineering convention one should reverse all imaginary quantities.\n\nThe complex permittivity is usually a complicated function of frequency {{mvar|\u03c9}}, since it is a superimposed description of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] phenomena occurring at multiple frequencies. The dielectric function {{math|''\u03b5''(''\u03c9'')}} must have poles only for frequencies with positive imaginary parts, and therefore satisfies the [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation]]s. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the permittivity can be approximated as frequency-independent or by model functions.\n\nAt a given frequency, the imaginary part, {{math|''\u03b5''\u2033}}, leads to absorption loss if it is positive (in the above sign convention) and gain if it is negative. More generally, the imaginary parts of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the anisotropic dielectric tensor should be considered.\n\nIn the case of solids, the complex dielectric function is intimately connected to band structure. The primary quantity that characterizes the electronic structure of any crystalline material is the probability of [[photon]] absorption, which is directly related to the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function {{math|''\u03b5''(''\u03c9'')}}. The optical dielectric function is given by the fundamental expression:<ref name=Cardona>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Peter Y.

A ''[[perfect conductor]]'' has infinite conductivity, {{math|''\u03c3'' {{=}} \u221e}}, while a ''[[perfect dielectric]]'' is a material that has no conductivity at all, {{math|''\u03c3'' {{=}} 0}}; this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name ''lossless media''.<ref>http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf</ref> Generally, when {{math|{{sfrac|''\u03c3''|''\u03c9\u03b5''\u2032}} \u226a 1}} we consider the material to be a ''low-loss dielectric'' (although not exactly lossless), whereas {{math|{{sfrac|''\u03c3''|''\u03c9\u03b5''\u2032}} \u226b 1}} is associated with a ''good conductor''; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of [[dielectric loss|loss]] that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be ''lossy media''. Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media.\n\n===Lossy medium===\nIn the case of a lossy medium, i.e. when the conduction current is not negligible, the total current density flowing is:\n\n:<math>J_\\text{tot} = J_\\mathrm{c} + J_\\mathrm{d} = \\sigma E + i \\omega \\varepsilon' E = i \\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} E</math>\n\nwhere\n* {{mvar|\u03c3}} is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the medium;\n*<math>\\varepsilon'=\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r</math> is the real part of the permittivity.\n*<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon}=\\varepsilon'-i\\varepsilon''</math>is the complex permittivity\n\nThe size of the [[displacement current]] is dependent on the [[frequency]] \u03c9 of the applied field ''E''; there is no displacement current in a constant field.\n\nIn this formalism, the complex permittivity is defined as:<ref>John S. Seybold (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&dq= ''Introduction to RF Propagation''], John Wiley & Sons, p. 22, eq. (2.6).</ref><ref>Kenneth L. Kaiser, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bDuOAQDk38gC&dq= ''Electromagnetic Shielding''], CRC Press, 2005, p. 1\u00b728, eqs. (1.80) and (1.81).</ref>\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon' \\left(1 - i \\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega \\varepsilon'}\\right) = \\varepsilon' - i \\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega}</math>\n\nIn general, the absorption of electromagnetic energy by dielectrics is covered by a few different mechanisms that influence the shape of the permittivity as a function of frequency:\n* First are the [[Dielectric relaxation|relaxation]] effects associated with permanent and induced [[Dipole|molecular dipoles]]. At low frequencies the field changes slowly enough to allow dipoles to reach [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] before the field has measurably changed. For frequencies at which dipole orientations cannot follow the applied field because of the [[viscosity]] of the medium, absorption of the field's energy leads to energy dissipation. The mechanism of dipoles relaxing is called [[dielectric relaxation]] and for ideal dipoles is described by classic [[Debye relaxation]].\n* Second are the  [[resonance|resonance effects]], which arise from the rotations or vibrations of atoms, [[ion]]s, or [[electron]]s. These processes are observed in the neighborhood of their characteristic [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption frequencies]].\n\nThe above effects often combine to cause non-linear effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption refers to the inability of a capacitor that has been charged for a long time to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called ''soakage'' or ''battery action''. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1\u20132% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15\u201325% in the case of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s or [[supercapacitor]]s.\n\n\n===Quantum-mechanical interpretation===\n\nIn terms of [[quantum mechanics]], permittivity is explained by [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] interactions.\n\nAt low frequencies, molecules in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the [[microwave]] frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break [[hydrogen bond]]s. The field does work against the bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as [[heat]]. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.\n\nAt moderate frequencies, the energy is too high to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed in the form of resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the absorptive index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime).\n\nAt high frequencies (such as UV and above), molecules cannot relax, and the energy is purely absorbed by atoms, exciting [[electron]] energy levels. Thus, these frequencies are classified as [[ionizing radiation]].\n\nWhile carrying out a complete ''[[ab initio]]'' (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, it has not been widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The [[Debye relaxation|Debye model]] and the [[Lorentz model]] use a first-order and second-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit).\n\n==Measurement==\n{{main|dielectric spectroscopy}}\n\nThe relative permittivity of a material can be found by a variety of static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a wide range of frequencies by using different variants of [[dielectric spectroscopy]], covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10<sup>\u22126</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> [[hertz]]. Also, by using [[cryostat]]s and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range.\n\nVarious microwave measurement techniques are outlined in Chen ''et al.''.<ref name=Chen>{{cite book |title=Microwave electronics |author1=Linfeng Chen |author2=V.

If the medium is [[anisotropic]], the permittivity is a second rank [[tensor]].\n\nIn general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear medium]], the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.\n\nIn SI units, permittivity is measured in [[farads]] per meter (F/m or A<sup>2</sup>\u00b7s<sup>4</sup>\u00b7kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7m<sup>\u22123</sup>).

The formula for capacitance is written as\n\n:<math>C = \\varepsilon \\ \\frac{A}{d}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the area of one plate, <math>d</math> is the distance between the plates, and <math>\\varepsilon</math> is the permittivity of the medium between the two plates. For a capacitor with relative permittivity <math>\\kappa</math>, it can be said that\n\n:<math>C = \\kappa \\ \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{A}{d}</math>\n\n=== Gauss's law ===\nPermittivity is connected to electric flux (and by extension electric field) through [[Gauss's law]].

This formula applies to the electric field due to a point charge, outside of a conducting sphere or shell, outside of a uniformly charged insulating sphere, or between the plates of a spherical capacitor.\n\n== Dispersion and causality ==\n\nIn general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^t \\chi\\left(t - t'\\right) \\mathbf{E}\\left(t'\\right) \\, dt'.</math>\n\nThat is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'')}}. The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{math|\u0394''t'' < 0}}. An instantaneous response would correspond to a [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} ''\u03c7\u03b4''(\u0394''t'')}}.\n\nIt is convenient to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] with respect to time and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Because of the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,\n:<math>\\mathbf{P}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi(\\omega) \\mathbf{E}(\\omega).</math>\n\nThis frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. effectively {{math|''\u03c7''(\u0394''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{math|\u0394''t'' < 0}}), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation|Kramers\u2013Kronig constraints]] on the susceptibility {{math|''\u03c7''(0)}}.\n\n===Complex permittivity===\n\n[[Image:Dielectric responses.svg|thumb|right|454px|A dielectric permittivity spectrum over a wide range of frequencies. {{math|''\u03b5''\u2032}} and {{math|''\u03b5''\u2033}} denote the real and the imaginary part of the permittivity, respectively.

This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material's polarization does not change instantaneously when an electric field is applied. The response must always be ''causal'' (arising after the applied field), which can be represented by a phase difference. For this reason, permittivity is often treated as a complex function of the [[Angular frequency|(angular) frequency]] {{mvar|\u03c9}} of the applied field:\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon \\rightarrow \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega)</math>\n\n(since complex numbers allow specification of magnitude and phase). The definition of permittivity therefore becomes\n\n:<math>D_0 e^{-i \\omega t} = \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) E_0 e^{-i \\omega t},</math>\n\nwhere\n* {{math|''D''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''E''<sub>0</sub>}} are the amplitudes of the displacement and electric fields, respectively,\n* {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]], {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}}.\n\nThe response of a medium to static electric fields is described by the low-frequency limit of permittivity, also called the static permittivity {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>s</sub>}} (also {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>DC</sub>}}):\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{s} = \\lim_{\\omega \\rightarrow 0} \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega).</math>\n\nAt the high-frequency limit (meaning optical frequencies), the complex permittivity is commonly referred to as {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>\u221e</sub>}} (or sometimes {{math|''\u03b5''<sub>opt</sub>}}<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=Philip |date= 2015-05-26|title=Solid State Physics |edition=2 |url=http://philiphofmann.net/solid-state-book/ |location= |publisher=Wiley-VCH |page=194 |isbn=978-3527412822 |author-link= }}\n</ref>). At the [[plasma frequency]] and below, dielectrics behave as ideal metals, with electron gas behavior. The static permittivity is a good approximation for alternating fields of low frequencies, and as the frequency increases a measurable phase difference {{mvar|\u03b4}} emerges between {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}}. The frequency at which the phase shift becomes noticeable depends on temperature and the details of the medium. For moderate field strength ({{math|''E''<sub>0</sub>}}), {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}} remain proportional, and\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{D_0}{E_0} = |\\varepsilon|e^{-i\\delta}.</math>\n\nSince the response of materials to alternating fields is characterized by a complex permittivity, it is natural to separate its real and imaginary parts, which is done by convention in the following way:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) = \\varepsilon'(\\omega) - i\\varepsilon''(\\omega) = \\left| \\frac{D_0}{E_0} \\right| \\left( \\cos \\delta  - i\\sin \\delta  \\right). </math>\n\nwhere\n* {{math|''\u03b5''\u2032}} is the real part of the permittivity;\n* {{math|''\u03b5''\u2033}} is the imaginary part of the permittivity;\n* {{mvar|\u03b4}} is the [[loss angle]].\n\nThe choice of sign for time-dependence, {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''i\u03c9t''</sup>}}, dictates the sign convention for the imaginary part of permittivity. The signs used here correspond to those commonly used in physics, whereas for the engineering convention one should reverse all imaginary quantities.\n\nThe complex permittivity is usually a complicated function of frequency {{mvar|\u03c9}}, since it is a superimposed description of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] phenomena occurring at multiple frequencies. The dielectric function {{math|''\u03b5''(''\u03c9'')}} must have poles only for frequencies with positive imaginary parts, and therefore satisfies the [[Kramers\u2013Kronig relation]]s. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the permittivity can be approximated as frequency-independent or by model functions.\n\nAt a given frequency, the imaginary part, {{math|''\u03b5''\u2033}}, leads to absorption loss if it is positive (in the above sign convention) and gain if it is negative. More generally, the imaginary parts of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the anisotropic dielectric tensor should be considered.\n\nIn the case of solids, the complex dielectric function is intimately connected to band structure. The primary quantity that characterizes the electronic structure of any crystalline material is the probability of [[photon]] absorption, which is directly related to the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function {{math|''\u03b5''(''\u03c9'')}}. The optical dielectric function is given by the fundamental expression:<ref name=Cardona>\n{{cite book\n|author1=Peter Y.

A ''[[perfect conductor]]'' has infinite conductivity, {{math|''\u03c3'' {{=}} \u221e}}, while a ''[[perfect dielectric]]'' is a material that has no conductivity at all, {{math|''\u03c3'' {{=}} 0}}; this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name ''lossless media''.<ref>http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf</ref> Generally, when {{math|{{sfrac|''\u03c3''|''\u03c9\u03b5''\u2032}} \u226a 1}} we consider the material to be a ''low-loss dielectric'' (although not exactly lossless), whereas {{math|{{sfrac|''\u03c3''|''\u03c9\u03b5''\u2032}} \u226b 1}} is associated with a ''good conductor''; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of [[dielectric loss|loss]] that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be ''lossy media''. Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media.\n\n===Lossy medium===\nIn the case of a lossy medium, i.e. when the conduction current is not negligible, the total current density flowing is:\n\n:<math>J_\\text{tot} = J_\\mathrm{c} + J_\\mathrm{d} = \\sigma E + i \\omega \\varepsilon' E = i \\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} E</math>\n\nwhere\n* {{mvar|\u03c3}} is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the medium;\n*<math>\\varepsilon'=\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r</math> is the real part of the permittivity.\n*<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon}=\\varepsilon'-i\\varepsilon''</math>is the complex permittivity\n\nThe size of the [[displacement current]] is dependent on the [[frequency]] \u03c9 of the applied field ''E''; there is no displacement current in a constant field.\n\nIn this formalism, the complex permittivity is defined as:<ref>John S. Seybold (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&dq= ''Introduction to RF Propagation''], John Wiley & Sons, p. 22, eq. (2.6).</ref><ref>Kenneth L. Kaiser, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bDuOAQDk38gC&dq= ''Electromagnetic Shielding''], CRC Press, 2005, p. 1\u00b728, eqs. (1.80) and (1.81).</ref>\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\varepsilon' \\left(1 - i \\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega \\varepsilon'}\\right) = \\varepsilon' - i \\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega}</math>\n\nIn general, the absorption of electromagnetic energy by dielectrics is covered by a few different mechanisms that influence the shape of the permittivity as a function of frequency:\n* First are the [[Dielectric relaxation|relaxation]] effects associated with permanent and induced [[Dipole|molecular dipoles]]. At low frequencies the field changes slowly enough to allow dipoles to reach [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] before the field has measurably changed. For frequencies at which dipole orientations cannot follow the applied field because of the [[viscosity]] of the medium, absorption of the field's energy leads to energy dissipation. The mechanism of dipoles relaxing is called [[dielectric relaxation]] and for ideal dipoles is described by classic [[Debye relaxation]].\n* Second are the  [[resonance|resonance effects]], which arise from the rotations or vibrations of atoms, [[ion]]s, or [[electron]]s. These processes are observed in the neighborhood of their characteristic [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption frequencies]].\n\nThe above effects often combine to cause non-linear effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption refers to the inability of a capacitor that has been charged for a long time to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called ''soakage'' or ''battery action''. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1\u20132% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15\u201325% in the case of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s or [[supercapacitor]]s.\n\n\n===Quantum-mechanical interpretation===\n\nIn terms of [[quantum mechanics]], permittivity is explained by [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] interactions.\n\nAt low frequencies, molecules in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the [[microwave]] frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break [[hydrogen bond]]s. The field does work against the bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as [[heat]]. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.\n\nAt moderate frequencies, the energy is too high to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed in the form of resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the absorptive index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime).\n\nAt high frequencies (such as UV and above), molecules cannot relax, and the energy is purely absorbed by atoms, exciting [[electron]] energy levels. Thus, these frequencies are classified as [[ionizing radiation]].\n\nWhile carrying out a complete ''[[ab initio]]'' (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, it has not been widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The [[Debye relaxation|Debye model]] and the [[Lorentz model]] use a first-order and second-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit).\n\n==Measurement==\n{{main|dielectric spectroscopy}}\n\nThe relative permittivity of a material can be found by a variety of static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a wide range of frequencies by using different variants of [[dielectric spectroscopy]], covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10<sup>\u22126</sup> to 10<sup>15</sup> [[hertz]]. Also, by using [[cryostat]]s and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range.\n\nVarious microwave measurement techniques are outlined in Chen ''et al.''.<ref name=Chen>{{cite book |title=Microwave electronics |author1=Linfeng Chen |author2=V.

The film stars [[Ajith Kumar]] and [[Nayanthara]]. Produced by [[Sathya Jyothi Films]], the film was officially announced on 20 November 2017 and [[principal photography]] began in May 2018. The film was released on 10 January 2019.It is loosely based on 2009 Telugu movie Tulasi starting Venkatesh and Nayanthara itself in lead roles.\n\n== Plot ==\nThookku Durai is the well-respected chieftain of his village Koduvilaarpatti of [[Theni district]]. After 10 years, a thiruvizha ([[festival]]) is set to occur at the village's [[Ayyanar]] temple, when Thooku Durai's rival Kozhimuthu tries to stop it from occurring. The thiruvizha occurs thanks to Thooku Durai's intervention; however, his aunts and grandmother have been longing to see his wife and daughter. After much deliberation, Thooku Durai decides to go to Mumbai to meet them.\n\nOn the journey, Merit and Rosamani are upset over Thooku Durai's current life and remind him of his life 10-12 years ago. Thooku Durai used to be a happy-go-lucky man and rice mill owner. He was also a [[Good Samaritan]], albeit using violent ways to deal with problems. While chasing a few goons, he stumbles across Niranjana, a doctor, who witnesses his antics and lodges a case against him. When Thooku Durai sees Niranjana, he is immediately smitten by her and surrenders to the police out of the love that he has for her, but she is later forced to release him after Aavudaiyappan threatens to close her medical camp unless she pays him. After fighting the goons, Thooku Durai relocates her camp to his rice mill. Niranjana realizes her love for Thooku Durai and proposes to him, which he gladly accepts. They get married and lead a happy life, but Niranjana is disturbed by Thooku Durai's involvement into feuds. Soon, she gets pregnant and is accepted to go to one of the finest pharmaceutical programs abroad, which she refuses for Thooku Durai. After their child is born, one day, Niranjana leaves out of town, after getting a promise from Thooku Durai not to bring Swetha to any fights, and on the way to pick her up, Aavudaiyappan, waiting for revenge, picks up a fight with Thooku Durai. Thooku Durai, not finding Niranjana at the train station, finds her at home, and the baby passes out as she had been injured during the fight. After rushing to the emergency ward, she survives, but Niranjana gets infuriated at Thooku Durai and tells him to stay away from her and the baby, and she then leaves him.\n\nBack to the present day, Thooku Durai tries to meet up with Niranjana at her company, Niranjana Pharmaceuticals, to no avail. He later sees his daughter Swetha, who is in contention for the Junior National 100m title. Swetha travels home, when attempts are made to kill her Thooku Durai arrives at the nick of time to save her. It is then revealed that Gautham Veer is the one behind this as his daughter Neha had been paralyzed while attempting suicide. Gautham is the CEO of Skyline exports and owns a range of multinational companies, and expects the first position in everything, as he used to achieve the same in his earlier days, including academics and sports. He expects the same of Neha, who is slower than Swetha by milliseconds. After Gautham threatens Neha that she would find no affection in him if she loses, she resorts to [[Doping in sport|doping]], which helps her win the race. Unfortunately, this is found out by Swetha, who reports it to the authorities. Fearing that her father's reputation and affection would completely vanish, Neha attempts suicide but becomes paralyzed in the process. Gautham is distraught on seeing his daughter's condition and vows to have Swetha killed at any cost. \n\nAfter saving her, Thooku Durai requests Niranjana to appoint him as Swetha's bodyguard for the next 10 days, until her competition, on the condition that he does not reveal any information about him being her father, to which she reluctantly accepts. He enjoys being in the company of his daughter, whilst saving her from goons on multiple occasions. Thooku Durai later meets Gautham face-to-face and challenges him. Unfortunately, Thooku Durai is run over a car before Swetha's competition and is critical. Swetha then is forced to leave for America, and Thooku Durai recovers. Swetha also brings Gautham's daughter and mother. Before the competition, Gautham fights an already injured Thooku Durai, at which point Niranjana reveals that Thooku Durai is Swetha's father. Swetha lags behind during the meet as she has no encouragement. Thooku Durai fights Gautham back, reaches the track, and encourages his daughter by whistling. Swetha wins the race. At the same time, Gautham arrives at the track to attack Thooku Durai, but after seeing his daughter's recovery, he realizes his mistake. Thooku Durai tells Gautham that children should grow up as they desire and not to burden them with what the parents desire. Swetha is announced as the winner, along with Thooku Durai's name added to her name by Niranjana, and they reunite with Thooku Durai.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Thookku Durai<ref>[https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/south-gossip/article/viswasam-motion-poster-ajith-in-his-two-looks-has-stolen-the-hearts-of-his-fans/320736 Viswasam motion poster: Ajith, in his two looks, has stolen the hearts of his fans]. timesnownews.com. 26 November 2018</ref>\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Niranjana Thooku Durai\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Gautham Veer\n* [[Anikha]] as Swetha Thooku Durai\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Kesavan\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Velu\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Rosamani\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Merit\n* [[Kovai Sarala]] as Filomina\n* [[Kalairani]] as Pechiammal, Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[Sujatha Sivakumar]] as Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[R.

The film stars [[Ajith Kumar]] and [[Nayanthara]]. Produced by [[Sathya Jyothi Films]], the film was officially announced on 20 November 2017 and [[principal photography]] began in May 2018. The film was released on 10 January 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nThookku Durai is the well-respected chieftain of his village Koduvilaarpatti of [[Theni district]]. After 10 years, a thiruvizha ([[festival]]) is set to occur at the village's [[Ayyanar]] temple, when Thooku Durai's rival Kozhimuthu tries to stop it from occurring. The thiruvizha occurs thanks to Thooku Durai's intervention; however, his aunts and grandmother have been longing to see his wife and daughter. After much deliberation, Thooku Durai decides to go to Mumbai to meet them.\n\nOn the journey, Merit and Rosamani are upset over Thooku Durai's current life and remind him of his life 10-12 years ago. Thooku Durai used to be a happy-go-lucky man and rice mill owner. He was also a [[Good Samaritan]], albeit using violent ways to deal with problems. While chasing a few goons, he stumbles across Niranjana, a doctor, who witnesses his antics and lodges a case against him. When Thooku Durai sees Niranjana, he is immediately smitten by her and surrenders to the police out of the love that he has for her, but she is later forced to release him after Aavudaiyappan threatens to close her medical camp unless she pays him. After fighting the goons, Thooku Durai relocates her camp to his rice mill. Niranjana realizes her love for Thooku Durai and proposes to him, which he gladly accepts. They get married and lead a happy life, but Niranjana is disturbed by Thooku Durai's involvement into feuds. Soon, she gets pregnant and is accepted to go to one of the finest pharmaceutical programs abroad, which she refuses for Thooku Durai. After their child is born, one day, Niranjana leaves out of town, after getting a promise from Thooku Durai not to bring Swetha to any fights, and on the way to pick her up, Aavudaiyappan, waiting for revenge, picks up a fight with Thooku Durai. Thooku Durai, not finding Niranjana at the train station, finds her at home, and the baby passes out as she had been injured during the fight. After rushing to the emergency ward, she survives, but Niranjana gets infuriated at Thooku Durai and tells him to stay away from her and the baby, and she then leaves him.\n\nBack to the present day, Thooku Durai tries to meet up with Niranjana at her company, Niranjana Pharmaceuticals, to no avail. He later sees his daughter Swetha, who is in contention for the Junior National 100m title. Swetha travels home, when attempts are made to kill her Thooku Durai arrives at the nick of time to save her. It is then revealed that Gautham Veer is the one behind this as his daughter Neha had been paralyzed while attempting suicide. Gautham is the CEO of Skyline exports and owns a range of multinational companies, and expects the first position in everything, as he used to achieve the same in his earlier days, including academics and sports. He expects the same of Neha, who is slower than Swetha by milliseconds. After Gautham threatens Neha that she would find no affection in him if she loses, she resorts to [[Doping in sport|doping]], which helps her win the race. Unfortunately, this is found out by Swetha, who reports it to the authorities. Fearing that her father's reputation and affection would completely vanish, Neha attempts suicide but becomes paralyzed in the process. Gautham is distraught on seeing his daughter's condition and vows to have Swetha killed at any cost. \n\nAfter saving her, Thooku Durai requests Niranjana to appoint him as Swetha's bodyguard for the next 10 days, until her competition, on the condition that he does not reveal any information about him being her father, to which she reluctantly accepts. He enjoys being in the company of his daughter, whilst saving her from goons on multiple occasions. Thooku Durai later meets Gautham face-to-face and challenges him. Unfortunately, Thooku Durai is run over a car before Swetha's competition and is critical. Swetha then is forced to leave for America, and Thooku Durai recovers. Swetha also brings Gautham's daughter and mother. Before the competition, Gautham fights an already injured Thooku Durai, at which point Niranjana reveals that Thooku Durai is Swetha's father. Swetha lags behind during the meet as she has no encouragement. Thooku Durai fights Gautham back, reaches the track, and encourages his daughter by whistling. Swetha wins the race. At the same time, Gautham arrives at the track to attack Thooku Durai, but after seeing his daughter's recovery, he realizes his mistake. Thooku Durai tells Gautham that children should grow up as they desire and not to burden them with what the parents desire. Swetha is announced as the winner, along with Thooku Durai's name added to her name by Niranjana, and they reunite with Thooku Durai.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Thookku Durai<ref>[https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/south-gossip/article/viswasam-motion-poster-ajith-in-his-two-looks-has-stolen-the-hearts-of-his-fans/320736 Viswasam motion poster: Ajith, in his two looks, has stolen the hearts of his fans]. timesnownews.com. 26 November 2018</ref>\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Niranjana Thooku Durai\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Gautham Veer\n* [[Anikha]] as Swetha Thooku Durai\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Kesavan\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Velu\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Rosamani\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Merit\n* [[Kovai Sarala]] as Filomina\n* [[Kalairani]] as Pechiammal, Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[Sujatha Sivakumar]] as Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[R.

Like most members of this family, common beans acquire the [[nitrogen]] they require through an association with [[rhizobia]], a species of [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]].\n\nThe common bean is a highly variable species that has a long history of cultivation.

Bush varieties form erect bushes {{convert|20|\u2013|60|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} tall, while pole or running varieties form [[vine]]s {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long. All varieties bear alternate, green or purple [[leaf|leaves]], which are divided into three oval, smooth-edged leaflets, each {{convert|6|\u2013|15|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|3|\u2013|11|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} wide. The white, pink, or purple [[flower]]s are about 1&nbsp;cm long, and they give way to pods {{convert|8|\u2013|20|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long and 1\u20131.5&nbsp;cm wide. These may be green, yellow, black, or purple in color, each containing 4\u20136 beans. The beans are smooth, plump, kidney-shaped, up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long, range widely in color, and are often mottled in two or more colors. Raw or undercooked beans contain a toxic protein called [[phytohaemagglutinin]].<ref name=FDA>{{cite web |publisher=United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] |page=254|access-date=2013-12-27 |url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111185541/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf|title=Bad Bug Book (2012)|work=Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook: Phytohaemagglutinin}}</ref>\n\n===Dry beans===\nSimilar to other beans, the common bean is high in [[starch]], [[protein]], and [[dietary fiber]], and is an excellent source of [[iron]], [[potassium]], [[selenium]], [[thiamine]], [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]], and [[folate]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nDry beans will keep indefinitely if stored in a cool, dry place, but as time passes, their [[Nutrition|nutritive]] value and [[flavor]] degrade and cooking times lengthen. Dried beans are almost always cooked by [[boiling]], often after being soaked in water for several hours. While the soaking is not strictly necessary, it shortens cooking time and results in more evenly textured beans. In addition, soaking beans removes 5 to 10% of the gas-producing sugars that can cause [[flatulence]] for some people.<ref>Rombauer, Irma S. ''The Joy of Cooking''. Scribner, {{ISBN|0-684-81870-1}}, p. 271.</ref> The methods include simple overnight soaking and the power soak method in which beans are boiled for three minutes and then set aside for 2\u20134 hours. Before cooking, the soaking water is drained off and discarded. Dry common beans take longer to cook than most [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]: cooking times vary from one to four hours, but are substantially reduced with [[pressure cooking]].\n\nIn Mexico, Central America, and South America, the traditional spice used with beans is ''[[epazote]]'', which is also said to aid digestion. In East Asia, a type of seaweed, ''[[kombu]]'', is added to beans as they cook for the same purpose. Salt, sugar, and acidic foods such as tomatoes may harden uncooked beans, resulting in seasoned beans at the expense of slightly longer cooking times.\n\nDry beans may also be bought cooked and [[canning|canned]] as [[refried beans]], or whole with [[water]], [[edible salt|salt]], and sometimes [[sugar]].\n\n===Green beans and wax beans===\n{{main|Green beans}}\nThe three commonly known types of green beans are string or snap beans, which may be round or have a flat pod; stringless or French beans, which lack a tough, fibrous string running along the length of the pod; and runner beans, which belong to a separate species, ''[[Phaseolus coccineus]]''. Green beans may have a purple rather than green pod, which changes to green when cooked.<ref>{{cite book |author=Press, L. |year=2002 |title=The Bean Book: Over Seventy Incredible Recipes |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |isbn=9781585744732 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X9P_XK11miMC&pg=PA6&dq=%22purple-podded%22+bean+green+when+cooked#v=onepage&q=%22purple-podded%22%20bean%20green%20when%20cooked&f=false}}</ref> Wax beans are ''P. vulgaris'' beans that have a yellow<ref name=\"P&R\"/> or white pod. Wax bean cultivars are commonly grown;<ref name=\"P&R\"/> the plants are often of the bush or dwarf form.<ref name=\"P&R\"/>\n\nAs the name implies, snap beans break easily when the pod is bent, giving off a distinct audible snap sound. The pods of snap beans (green, yellow and purple in colour) are harvested when they are rapidly growing, fleshy, tender (not tough and stringy), bright in colour, and the seeds are small and underdeveloped (8 to 10 days after flowering). \n\nCompared to dry beans, green and wax beans provide less starch and protein and more [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin C]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} Green beans and wax beans are often [[Steaming|steamed]], boiled, [[Stir frying|stir-fried]], or [[Baking|baked]] in [[casserole]]s.\n\n===Shelling beans===\nShell, shelled, or shelling beans are beans removed from their pods before being cooked or dried. Common beans can be used as shell beans, but the term also refers to other species of beans whose pods are not typically eaten, such as [[lima bean]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s, and [[fava bean]]s. Fresh shell beans are nutritionally similar to dry beans, but are prepared more like a vegetable, often being steamed, fried, or made into soups.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Popping beans===\nThe ''nu\u00f1a'' is an Andean subspecies, ''P. v.'' subsp. ''nunas'' (formerly ''P. vulgaris'' Nu\u00f1as group), with round, multicolored seeds that resemble pigeon eggs. When cooked on high heat, the bean explodes, exposing the inner part, in the manner of [[popcorn]] and other [[puffed grain]]s.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Cultivars and varieties ==\nSome scientists have proposed [[Mesoamerica]] as a possible origin for the common bean. Scientists disagree over whether the common bean was a product of one or multiple [[domestication]] events. Over time two diverse gene pools emerged: the [[Andes|Andean]] gene pool from [[Agriculture in Peru|Southern Peru]] to [[Agriculture in Argentina|Northwest Argentina]] and the Mesoamerican gene pool between [[Agriculture in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Agriculture in Colombia|Colombia]].<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0205363| issn = 1932-6203| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = \u20130205363| last1 = Nadeem| first1 = Muhammad Azhar| last2 = Habyarimana| first2 = Ephrem| last3 = \u00c7ift\u00e7i| first3 = Vahdettin| last4 = Nawaz| first4 = Muhammad Amjad| last5 = Karak\u00f6y| first5 = Tolga| last6 = Comertpay| first6 = Gonul| last7 = Shahid| first7 = Muhammad Qasim| last8 = Hatipo\u011flu| first8 = R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc| last9 = Yeken| first9 = Mehmet Zahit| last10 = Ali| first10 = Fawad| last11 = Erci\u015fli| first11 = Sezai| last12 = Chung| first12 = Gyuhwa| last13 = Baloch| first13 = Faheem Shehzad| title = Characterization of genetic diversity in Turkish common bean gene pool using phenotypic and whole-genome DArTseq-generated silicoDArT marker information| journal = PLOS ONE| date = 2018-10-11| pmc = 6181364| pmid=30308006}}</ref>\n\nMany well-known bean [[cultivar]]s and varieties belong to this species, and the list below is in no way exhaustive.

Dried beans are almost always cooked by [[boiling]], often after being soaked in water for several hours. While the soaking is not strictly necessary, it shortens cooking time and results in more evenly textured beans. In addition, soaking beans removes 5 to 10% of the gas-producing sugars that can cause [[flatulence]] for some people.<ref>Rombauer, Irma S. ''The Joy of Cooking''. Scribner, {{ISBN|0-684-81870-1}}, p. 271.</ref> The methods include simple overnight soaking and the power soak method in which beans are boiled for three minutes and then set aside for 2\u20134 hours. Before cooking, the soaking water is drained off and discarded. Dry common beans take longer to cook than most [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]: cooking times vary from one to four hours, but are substantially reduced with [[pressure cooking]].\n\nIn Mexico, Central America, and South America, the traditional spice used with beans is ''[[epazote]]'', which is also said to aid digestion. In East Asia, a type of seaweed, ''[[kombu]]'', is added to beans as they cook for the same purpose. Salt, sugar, and acidic foods such as tomatoes may harden uncooked beans, resulting in seasoned beans at the expense of slightly longer cooking times.\n\nDry beans may also be bought cooked and [[canning|canned]] as [[refried beans]], or whole with [[water]], [[edible salt|salt]], and sometimes [[sugar]].\n\n===Green beans and wax beans===\n{{main|Green beans}}\nThe three commonly known types of green beans are string or snap beans, which may be round or have a flat pod; stringless or French beans, which lack a tough, fibrous string running along the length of the pod; and runner beans, which belong to a separate species, ''[[Phaseolus coccineus]]''. Green beans may have a purple rather than green pod, which changes to green when cooked.<ref>{{cite book |author=Press, L. |year=2002 |title=The Bean Book: Over Seventy Incredible Recipes |publisher=Globe Pequot Press |isbn=9781585744732 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X9P_XK11miMC&pg=PA6&dq=%22purple-podded%22+bean+green+when+cooked#v=onepage&q=%22purple-podded%22%20bean%20green%20when%20cooked&f=false}}</ref> Wax beans are ''P. vulgaris'' beans that have a yellow<ref name=\"P&R\"/> or white pod. Wax bean cultivars are commonly grown;<ref name=\"P&R\"/> the plants are often of the bush or dwarf form.<ref name=\"P&R\"/>\n\nAs the name implies, snap beans break easily when the pod is bent, giving off a distinct audible snap sound. The pods of snap beans (green, yellow and purple in colour) are harvested when they are rapidly growing, fleshy, tender (not tough and stringy), bright in colour, and the seeds are small and underdeveloped (8 to 10 days after flowering). \n\nCompared to dry beans, green and wax beans provide less starch and protein and more [[vitamin A]] and [[vitamin C]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} Green beans and wax beans are often [[Steaming|steamed]], boiled, [[Stir frying|stir-fried]], or [[Baking|baked]] in [[casserole]]s.\n\n===Shelling beans===\nShell, shelled, or shelling beans are beans removed from their pods before being cooked or dried. Common beans can be used as shell beans, but the term also refers to other species of beans whose pods are not typically eaten, such as [[lima bean]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s, and [[fava bean]]s. Fresh shell beans are nutritionally similar to dry beans, but are prepared more like a vegetable, often being steamed, fried, or made into soups.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Popping beans===\nThe ''nu\u00f1a'' is an Andean subspecies, ''P. v.'' subsp. ''nunas'' (formerly ''P. vulgaris'' Nu\u00f1as group), with round, multicolored seeds that resemble pigeon eggs. When cooked on high heat, the bean explodes, exposing the inner part, in the manner of [[popcorn]] and other [[puffed grain]]s.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Cultivars and varieties ==\nSome scientists have proposed [[Mesoamerica]] as a possible origin for the common bean. Scientists disagree over whether the common bean was a product of one or multiple [[domestication]] events. Over time two diverse gene pools emerged: the [[Andes|Andean]] gene pool from [[Agriculture in Peru|Southern Peru]] to [[Agriculture in Argentina|Northwest Argentina]] and the Mesoamerican gene pool between [[Agriculture in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Agriculture in Colombia|Colombia]].<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0205363| issn = 1932-6203| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = \u20130205363| last1 = Nadeem| first1 = Muhammad Azhar| last2 = Habyarimana| first2 = Ephrem| last3 = \u00c7ift\u00e7i| first3 = Vahdettin| last4 = Nawaz| first4 = Muhammad Amjad| last5 = Karak\u00f6y| first5 = Tolga| last6 = Comertpay| first6 = Gonul| last7 = Shahid| first7 = Muhammad Qasim| last8 = Hatipo\u011flu| first8 = R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc| last9 = Yeken| first9 = Mehmet Zahit| last10 = Ali| first10 = Fawad| last11 = Erci\u015fli| first11 = Sezai| last12 = Chung| first12 = Gyuhwa| last13 = Baloch| first13 = Faheem Shehzad| title = Characterization of genetic diversity in Turkish common bean gene pool using phenotypic and whole-genome DArTseq-generated silicoDArT marker information| journal = PLOS ONE| date = 2018-10-11| pmc = 6181364| pmid=30308006}}</ref>\n\nMany well-known bean [[cultivar]]s and varieties belong to this species, and the list below is in no way exhaustive.

Despite the name ('Peruvian beans' in Spanish), they are native to Mexico. Yellow beans are uncommon in the United States due to a controversial patent issued in 1999 to John Proctor, who selected and named a strain of yellow bean from seeds he brought back from Mexico.

Construction on the segment of the line that includes Prospect Avenue started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in May 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915 as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]]. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in 1970.
