With the goal of exposing the dangers to mankind arising from the research, production, and use of biological weapons, and also in order to strengthen anti-American sentiments in the world and to spark domestic political controversies in the USA, the GDR [<nowiki/>[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]] side will deliver a scientific study and other materials that prove that AIDS originated in the USA, not in Africa, and that AIDS is a product of the USA\u2019s bioweapons research.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/208947|title=PLAN FOR COMMON AND COORDINATED ACTIVE MEASURES OF THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANS OF THE MOI OF THE PR OF BULGARIA AND THE MFS OF THE GDR FOR 1987 AND 1988|last=HVA/X, MfS|date=3 September 1986|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 July 2019}}</ref></blockquote>The KGB confirmed that the East German HVA was playing a central role on various occasions, including in a telegram to the Bulgarians in 1987:<blockquote><u>The AIDS issue</u>\n\nA complex of [active] measures regarding this issue has been carried out since 1985 in cooperation with the [East] German and to some extent the Czech colleagues. In the initial stage, the task was resolved of spreading in the mass media the version regarding the artificial origin of the AIDS virus and the Pentagon\u2019s involvement in by means of the military-biological laboratory at Fort Detrick.\n\nAs a result of our joint efforts, it was possible to widely disseminate this version.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/208948|title=Information Nr. 2742 (to Bulgarian State Security), n. d.

The study had been distributed at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in August\u2013September 1986 in a brochure entitled, \u201cAIDS: USA home-made evil, NOT out of AFRICA.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> The report was quoted heavily by Soviet propagandists, and the Segals were often said to be French researchers to hide their connections to communism. Although both Segals, given the double danger to them as Jews and members of the German Communist Party, had fled into exile in France in 1933, both had attained Soviet citizenship in 1940 on the basis of Jakob's birth in (then Soviet-annexed) Lithuania, and in 1953, they had returned to Germany\u2014specifically, to communist East Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd126674272.html|title=Segal, Jakob - Deutsche Biographie|last=Biographie|first=Deutsche|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|language=de|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n\nIn his report, Jakob Segal postulated that the AIDS virus was synthesized by combining parts of two distantly related retroviruses: [[Visna virus|VISNA]] and [[HTLV-1]].<ref name=\"statereport\" /> An excerpt of the Segal report reads as follows:\n\n{{Quote|text=It is very easy using genetic technologies to unite two parts of completely independent viruses\u2026 but who would be interested in doing this? The military, of course\u2026 In 1977 a special top security lab\u2026 was set up\u2026at the Pentagon's central biological laboratory. One year after that\u2026 the first cases of AIDS occurred in the US, in New York City. How it occurred precisely at this moment and how the virus managed to get out of the secret, hush-hush laboratory is quite easy to understand. Everyone knows that prisoners are used for military experiments in the U.S. They are promised their freedom if they come out of the experiment alive.<ref name=statereport/>}}\n\nElsewhere in the report, Segal said that his hypothesis was based purely on assumptions, extrapolations, and hearsay and not at all on direct scientific evidence.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe exact relationship of both Segals to the KGB, Stasi, or both at this time\u2014to the extent that it existed\u2014remains unclear. Both publicly denied any involvement of the KGB or Stasi in their work.  The Deputy Director of HVA/X, Wolfgang Mutz, hinted that the HVA had played a role in the publication \u2013 or actually, the photocopying \u2013 and distribution of the Harare brochure in talks with Bulgarian State Security in September 1986.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

This office had registered a \u201csecurity dossier\u201d (''Sicherungsvorgang,'' SVG) \u201cWind\u201d on September 6, 1985, regarding the protection of East German scientists in the areas of AIDS research, genetic engineering and biotechnology from outside \u201cattacks\u201d in the form of espionage or manipulation by foreign agents. This office in HVA/SWT apparently registered both Segals in this dossier as \"contact persons\" under the codename \"Diagnosis\"; whenever other divisions of the Stasi inquired about the Segals, they were directed to this office. HVA/SWT\u2014or \"the security,\" as Jakob Segal called them\u2014gave him at least one piece of advice regarding his study before its printing and distribution. Whether Segal listened to this advice remains unclear. Still, given their official designation as \u201ccontact persons,\u201d they need not have known, at least officially, that they were dealing with the Stasi, although Jakob Segal likely knew or could have guessed, given his past dealings with both the Stasi and the KGB. It is quite possible that HVA/SWT was already coordinating with the KGB regarding Segal\u2019s research \u2013 even without his knowledge \u2013 in the second half of 1985, at the time that \u201cWind\u201d was registered.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

It was clearly his own work, in cooperation with his wife Lilli, although he knew and expected that it would be used for \"propaganda.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

His articles and brochures, the KGB wrote, had attained \"great renown.\" This was especially the case in African countries, where governments and researchers were rejecting as racist assertions by U.S. researchers that AIDS had originated naturally in Africa, where it had spread from monkeys to humans.<ref name=\":3\" /> The KGB wrote the Bulgarians:<blockquote>We are currently resolving the task of bringing the [active] measures down to a more practical level, and in particular, to attain specific political results by exploiting the \u201claboratory version\u201d for AM [active measures] on other issues. So, efforts are being made to intensify anti-base sentiments in countries where American forces are deployed by using slogans suggesting that U.S. soldiers are the most dangerous carriers of the virus. By demonstrating the defeat of the \u201cAfrican version\u201d [of AIDS\u2019 origins], we can whip up anti-American sentiments throughout the states of the continent.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Dissemination methods ===\nThe AIDS story exploded across the world, and was repeated by Soviet newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio broadcasts, and television. It appeared 40 times in Soviet media in 1987 alone. It received coverage in over 80 countries in more than 30 languages,<ref name=statereport/> primarily in leftist and communist media publications, and was found in countries as widespread as [[Bolivia]], [[Grenada]], Pakistan, New Zealand, [[Nigeria]], and [[Malta]]. A few versions made their way into non-communist press in [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].<ref name=statereport/>\n\nDissemination was usually along a recognized pattern: propaganda and disinformation would first appear in a country outside of the USSR and only then be picked up by a Soviet news agency, [[Circular reporting|which attributed it to others' investigative journalism]]. That the story came from a foreign source (not widely known to be Soviet controlled or influenced) added credibility to the allegations, especially in impoverished and less educated countries which generally could not afford access to Western news satellite feeds. To aid in media placement, Soviet propaganda was provided free of charge, and many stories came with cash benefits.<ref name=statereport/> This was particularly the case in India and [[Ghana]], where the Soviet Union maintained a large propaganda and disinformation apparatus for covert media placement.<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==== Soviet narrative ====\nTo explain how AIDS outbreaks in Africa occurred simultaneously, the [[Voice of Russia|Moscow World Service]] announced a discovery by Soviet correspondent Aleksandr Zhukov, who claimed that in the early 1970s, a Pentagon-controlled West German lab in [[Zaire]] \"succeeded in modifying the non-lethal [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|Green Monkey virus]] into the deadly AIDS virus.\" [[Radio Moscow]] also claimed that instead of testing a cholera vaccine, American scientists were actually infecting unwitting Zairians, thus spreading AIDS throughout the continent. These scientists were unaware of the long period before symptom onset, and resumed experimentation on convicts upon return to the U.S., where it then spread when the prisoners escaped.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nClaims that the [[CIA]] had sent \"AIDS-oiled condoms\" to other countries sprang up independently in the African press, well after the disinformation operation started.<ref name=\"infektion\"/> In 1987, a book (''Once Again About the CIA'') was published by the Novosti Press Agency, with the quote:\n\n{{Quote|text=The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology is continuously modernizing its inventory of pathogenic preparations, bacteria and viruses and studying their effect on man in various parts of the world. To this end, the CIA uses American medical centers in foreign countries. A case in point was the Pakistani Medical Research Center in [[Lahore]]\u2026 set up in 1962 allegedly for combating malaria.}}\n\nThe resulting public backlash eventually closed down the legitimate medical research center. Soviet allegations declared the purpose of these research projects, to include that of AIDS, was to \"enlarge the war arsenal.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==Worldwide response to AIDS allegations==\n[[File:Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications.pdf|thumb|''Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications'',<ref>Fletcher Schoen and Christopher J.

The U.S. refused to help as long as the disinformation campaign continued.<ref name=statereport/> The Segal Report and the plenitude of press articles were dismissed by both Western and Soviet virologists as nonsense.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nDr. Meinrad Koch, a West Berlin AIDS expert, stated in 1987 that the Segal report was \"utter nonsense\" and called it an \"evil pseudo-scientific political concoction.\" Other scientists also pointed out flaws and inaccuracies in the Segal Report, including Dr. [[Viktor Zhdanov]] of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow, who was the top Soviet AIDS expert at the time. The president of the [[Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences]] clearly stated that he believed the virus to be of natural origin. Other scientists and doctors from Paris, East and West Berlin, India, and Belgium called the AIDS rumors lies, scientifically unfounded, and otherwise impossible to seriously consider.<ref name=statereport/> Although Segal himself never said \"this is fact\" and was very careful to maintain this line throughout his report, \"such technical qualifiers do not diminish the impact of the charges, however, because when they are replayed, such qualifiers are typically either omitted or overlooked by readers or listeners.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\nU.S. Embassy officials wrote dozens of letters to various newspaper editors and journalists, and held meetings and press conferences to clarify matters. Many of their efforts resulted in newspapers printing retractions and apologies.<ref name=statereport/> Rebuttals appeared in reports to Congress and from the State Department saying that it was impossible at the time to build a virus as complex as AIDS; medical research had only gotten so far as to clone simple viruses. Antibodies were found decades earlier than the reported research started, and the main academic source used for the story (Segal's Report) contained inaccuracies about even such basic things as American geography\u2014Segal said that outbreaks appeared in [[New York City]] because it was the closest big city to Fort Detrick. [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] are all closer, while New York is {{convert|250|mi|km}} away.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] administration also responded indignantly and launched a defensive denial campaign \"aimed at limiting the damage done to its credibility by U.S. efforts to raise world consciousness concerning the scope of Soviet disinformation activities.\"<ref name=statereport/> The Soviet Union interfered with general attempts by U.S. Embassy officials to address misconceptions and expose the Soviet disinformation campaign, to include placing pressure on news agencies that recanted their position. For example, ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'' on December 3, 1986, castigated a Brazilian newspaper which earlier in the year had run a retraction following its publication of the AIDS disinformation story. In 1987, Moscow's [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] news agency disseminated a report datelined [[Brazzaville]] (Congo), calling on the West to put an end to the \"anti-African campaign,\" and repeating the charges that the virus was created in US military laboratories\" while in 1986 ''Literaturnaya Gazeta'' warned specifically against contact with Americans.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nIn 1988, ''Sovetskaya Rossiya'' put out an article defending their right to report different views. The chief of Novosti stated that it drew upon foreign sources for much of the AIDS coverage, and that the press was free under [[glasnost]].<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe [[Mitrokhin Archive]] reveals that\n\n{{quote|text=faced with American protests and the denunciation of the story by the international scientific community, however, Gorbachev and his advisors were clearly concerned that exposure of Soviet disinformation might damage the new Soviet image in the West.

Based on materials in the Bulgarian secret police archives, the card files of the HVA, and documents from or relating to the HVA scattered among the records of other divisions of the Stasi, it has been possible to reconstruct some aspects of the Stasi's involvement in the disinformation campaign. At the beginning of September 1986, the tenth division of the HVA (HVA/X), responsible for organizing and coordinating the HVA's campaigns of [[active measures]], wrote the following in a draft plan for cooperation with Bulgarian State Security:<blockquote><u>Operation \"DENVER\"</u>.  With the goal of exposing the dangers to mankind arising from the research, production, and use of biological weapons, and also in order to strengthen anti-American sentiments in the world and to spark domestic political controversies in the USA, the GDR [<nowiki/>[[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]] side will deliver a scientific study and other materials that prove that AIDS originated in the USA, not in Africa, and that AIDS is a product of the USA\u2019s bioweapons research.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/208947|title=PLAN FOR COMMON AND COORDINATED ACTIVE MEASURES OF THE INTELLIGENCE ORGANS OF THE MOI OF THE PR OF BULGARIA AND THE MFS OF THE GDR FOR 1987 AND 1988|last=HVA/X, MfS|date=3 September 1986|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=23 July 2019}}</ref></blockquote>The KGB confirmed that the East German HVA was playing a central role on various occasions, including in a telegram to the Bulgarians in 1987:<blockquote><u>The AIDS issue</u>\n\nA complex of [active] measures regarding this issue has been carried out since 1985 in cooperation with the [East] German and to some extent the Czech colleagues.

The study had been distributed at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in August\u2013September 1986 in a brochure entitled, \u201cAIDS: USA home-made evil, NOT out of AFRICA.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> The report was quoted heavily by Soviet propagandists, and the Segals were often said to be French researchers to hide their connections to communism. Although both Segals, given the double danger to them as Jews and members of the German Communist Party, had fled into exile in France in 1933, both had attained Soviet citizenship in 1940 on the basis of Jakob's birth in (then Soviet-annexed) Lithuania, and in 1953, they had returned to Germany\u2014specifically, to communist East Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd126674272.html|title=Segal, Jakob - Deutsche Biographie|last=Biographie|first=Deutsche|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|language=de|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n\nIn his report, Jakob Segal postulated that the AIDS virus was synthesized by combining parts of two distantly related retroviruses: [[Visna virus|VISNA]] and [[HTLV-1]].<ref name=\"statereport\" /> An excerpt of the Segal report reads as follows:\n\n{{Quote|text=It is very easy using genetic technologies to unite two parts of completely independent viruses\u2026 but who would be interested in doing this? The military, of course\u2026 In 1977 a special top security lab\u2026 was set up\u2026at the Pentagon's central biological laboratory. One year after that\u2026 the first cases of AIDS occurred in the US, in New York City. How it occurred precisely at this moment and how the virus managed to get out of the secret, hush-hush laboratory is quite easy to understand. Everyone knows that prisoners are used for military experiments in the U.S. They are promised their freedom if they come out of the experiment alive.<ref name=statereport/>}}\n\nElsewhere in the report, Segal said that his hypothesis was based purely on assumptions, extrapolations, and hearsay and not at all on direct scientific evidence.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe exact relationship of both Segals to the KGB, Stasi, or both at this time\u2014to the extent that it existed\u2014remains unclear. Both publicly denied any involvement of the KGB or Stasi in their work.  The Deputy Director of HVA/X, Wolfgang Mutz, hinted that the HVA had played a role in the publication \u2013 or actually, the photocopying \u2013 and distribution of the Harare brochure in talks with Bulgarian State Security in September 1986.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

This office had registered a \u201csecurity dossier\u201d (''Sicherungsvorgang,'' SVG) \u201cWind\u201d on September 6, 1985, regarding the protection of East German scientists in the areas of AIDS research, genetic engineering and biotechnology from outside \u201cattacks\u201d in the form of espionage or manipulation by foreign agents. This office in HVA/SWT apparently registered both Segals in this dossier as \"contact persons\" under the codename \"Diagnosis\"; whenever other divisions of the Stasi inquired about the Segals, they were directed to this office. HVA/SWT\u2014or \"the security,\" as Jakob Segal called them\u2014gave him at least one piece of advice regarding his study before its printing and distribution. Whether Segal listened to this advice remains unclear. Still, given their official designation as \u201ccontact persons,\u201d they need not have known, at least officially, that they were dealing with the Stasi, although Jakob Segal likely knew or could have guessed, given his past dealings with both the Stasi and the KGB. It is quite possible that HVA/SWT was already coordinating with the KGB regarding Segal\u2019s research \u2013 even without his knowledge \u2013 in the second half of 1985, at the time that \u201cWind\u201d was registered.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

His articles and brochures, the KGB wrote, had attained \"great renown.\" This was especially the case in African countries, where governments and researchers were rejecting as racist assertions by U.S. researchers that AIDS had originated naturally in Africa, where it had spread from monkeys to humans.<ref name=\":3\" /> The KGB wrote the Bulgarians:<blockquote>We are currently resolving the task of bringing the [active] measures down to a more practical level, and in particular, to attain specific political results by exploiting the \u201claboratory version\u201d for AM [active measures] on other issues. So, efforts are being made to intensify anti-base sentiments in countries where American forces are deployed by using slogans suggesting that U.S. soldiers are the most dangerous carriers of the virus. By demonstrating the defeat of the \u201cAfrican version\u201d [of AIDS\u2019 origins], we can whip up anti-American sentiments throughout the states of the continent.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Dissemination methods ===\nThe AIDS story exploded across the world, and was repeated by Soviet newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio broadcasts, and television. It appeared 40 times in Soviet media in 1987 alone. It received coverage in over 80 countries in more than 30 languages,<ref name=statereport/> primarily in leftist and communist media publications, and was found in countries as widespread as [[Bolivia]], [[Grenada]], Pakistan, New Zealand, [[Nigeria]], and [[Malta]]. A few versions made their way into non-communist press in [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].<ref name=statereport/>\n\nDissemination was usually along a recognized pattern: propaganda and disinformation would first appear in a country outside of the USSR and only then be picked up by a Soviet news agency, [[Circular reporting|which attributed it to others' investigative journalism]]. That the story came from a foreign source (not widely known to be Soviet controlled or influenced) added credibility to the allegations, especially in impoverished and less educated countries which generally could not afford access to Western news satellite feeds. To aid in media placement, Soviet propaganda was provided free of charge, and many stories came with cash benefits.<ref name=statereport/> This was particularly the case in India and [[Ghana]], where the Soviet Union maintained a large propaganda and disinformation apparatus for covert media placement.<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==== Soviet narrative ====\nTo explain how AIDS outbreaks in Africa occurred simultaneously, the [[Voice of Russia|Moscow World Service]] announced a discovery by Soviet correspondent Aleksandr Zhukov, who claimed that in the early 1970s, a Pentagon-controlled West German lab in [[Zaire]] \"succeeded in modifying the non-lethal [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|Green Monkey virus]] into the deadly AIDS virus.\" [[Radio Moscow]] also claimed that instead of testing a cholera vaccine, American scientists were actually infecting unwitting Zairians, thus spreading AIDS throughout the continent. These scientists were unaware of the long period before symptom onset, and resumed experimentation on convicts upon return to the U.S., where it then spread when the prisoners escaped.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nClaims that the [[CIA]] had sent \"AIDS-oiled condoms\" to other countries sprang up independently in the African press, well after the disinformation operation started.<ref name=\"infektion\"/> In 1987, a book (''Once Again About the CIA'') was published by the Novosti Press Agency, with the quote:\n\n{{Quote|text=The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology is continuously modernizing its inventory of pathogenic preparations, bacteria and viruses and studying their effect on man in various parts of the world. To this end, the CIA uses American medical centers in foreign countries. A case in point was the Pakistani Medical Research Center in [[Lahore]]\u2026 set up in 1962 allegedly for combating malaria.}}\n\nThe resulting public backlash eventually closed down the legitimate medical research center. Soviet allegations declared the purpose of these research projects, to include that of AIDS, was to \"enlarge the war arsenal.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==Worldwide response to AIDS allegations==\n[[File:Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications.pdf|thumb|''Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications'',<ref>Fletcher Schoen and Christopher J.

The U.S. refused to help as long as the disinformation campaign continued.<ref name=statereport/> The Segal Report and the plenitude of press articles were dismissed by both Western and Soviet virologists as nonsense.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nDr. Meinrad Koch, a West Berlin AIDS expert, stated in 1987 that the Segal report was \"utter nonsense\" and called it an \"evil pseudo-scientific political concoction.\" Other scientists also pointed out flaws and inaccuracies in the Segal Report, including Dr. [[Viktor Zhdanov]] of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow, who was the top Soviet AIDS expert at the time. The president of the [[Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences]] clearly stated that he believed the virus to be of natural origin. Other scientists and doctors from Paris, East and West Berlin, India, and Belgium called the AIDS rumors lies, scientifically unfounded, and otherwise impossible to seriously consider.<ref name=statereport/> Although Segal himself never said \"this is fact\" and was very careful to maintain this line throughout his report, \"such technical qualifiers do not diminish the impact of the charges, however, because when they are replayed, such qualifiers are typically either omitted or overlooked by readers or listeners.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\nU.S. Embassy officials wrote dozens of letters to various newspaper editors and journalists, and held meetings and press conferences to clarify matters. Many of their efforts resulted in newspapers printing retractions and apologies.<ref name=statereport/> Rebuttals appeared in reports to Congress and from the State Department saying that it was impossible at the time to build a virus as complex as AIDS; medical research had only gotten so far as to clone simple viruses. Antibodies were found decades earlier than the reported research started, and the main academic source used for the story (Segal's Report) contained inaccuracies about even such basic things as American geography\u2014Segal said that outbreaks appeared in [[New York City]] because it was the closest big city to Fort Detrick. [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] are all closer, while New York is {{convert|250|mi|km}} away.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] administration also responded indignantly and launched a defensive denial campaign \"aimed at limiting the damage done to its credibility by U.S. efforts to raise world consciousness concerning the scope of Soviet disinformation activities.\"<ref name=statereport/> The Soviet Union interfered with general attempts by U.S. Embassy officials to address misconceptions and expose the Soviet disinformation campaign, to include placing pressure on news agencies that recanted their position. For example, ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'' on December 3, 1986, castigated a Brazilian newspaper which earlier in the year had run a retraction following its publication of the AIDS disinformation story. In 1987, Moscow's [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] news agency disseminated a report datelined [[Brazzaville]] (Congo), calling on the West to put an end to the \"anti-African campaign,\" and repeating the charges that the virus was created in US military laboratories\" while in 1986 ''Literaturnaya Gazeta'' warned specifically against contact with Americans.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nIn 1988, ''Sovetskaya Rossiya'' put out an article defending their right to report different views.

After serving for many years as the Irish Bankruptcy judge, he was transferred to the King's Bench\nDivision of the [[High Court of Justice in Ireland]].<ref>Ball, F.

His second son Dr. Cecil Boyd was a noted [[rugby football|rugby]] player.\n\n==Background==\nHe was born on what is now Walworth Road in [[Portobello, Dublin]], the fourth son of Walter Boyd and his second wife Jane MacRory, daughter of Robert MacRory of [[Castledawson]], [[County Londonderry]].<ref>Ball p.380</ref> He was educated at the [[University of Dublin]] where he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1855 and Doctor of Laws in 1864.<ref>Ball p.380</ref> He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1854 and was called to the [[Irish Bar]] in 1856. He took silk in 1877 and became [[Queen's Advocate]] for Ireland the following year. In politics he was a staunch [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]]: his wife's family, the Andersons, played a crucial role in maintaining British rule in Ireland in the late nineteenth century.\n\nHe did not enjoy much of a reputation as a lawyer, but following in the great tradition of [[John Philpot Curran]] and [[Daniel O'Connell]], he was noted for his absolute fearlessness in Court.  Maurice Healy recalls a well-known story that [[William O'Brien (judge)|Mr Justice O'Brien]] angrily asked him: ''where was Dr Boyd's<ref>A reference to his Doctorate in law, not a medical degree.</ref> respect for the Court?''    Boyd replied that the Court ''was receiving the exact degree of respect it deserved''.<ref>Healy, Maurice  ''The Old Munster Circuit''  1939 Mercier Press Reissue 1979 p.32</ref>\n\n==Judge==\nIn 1885 he was appointed the Irish Bankruptcy judge.<ref>Ball p.380</ref> Maurice Healy thought that the office  suited him well: while he was not  an especially good lawyer, he had  a great deal of  common sense, and a remarkable ability to detect  commercial dishonesty. He was also, according to Healy,  a man of great physical courage,  which was an important  consideration at a time when the level of  agrarian unrest in Ireland   meant that his life might be threatened (for several years  he had two policemen assigned to act  as his  [[bodyguards]]).<ref>Healy pp.30\u201331</ref> He had a gift for detecting [[fraud]]; unfortunately, in Healy's view,  his  experience  as a judge  led him to  assume that almost all human beings are dishonest by nature, and  although he did not  lose his essential  kindness or good humour, he became something of a [[cynicism (philosophy)|cynic]].<ref>Healy p.30</ref> He had little patience with legal technicalities: \"I don't want evidence, I want the truth!\" he once thundered at  a barrister  who had unwisely objected to  the judge admitting [[hearsay evidence]].<ref>Healy p.116</ref>\n\nIn 1897 the reorganisation of the High Court led to Boyd's transfer to the King's Bench Division.<ref>Ball p.380</ref> Maurice Healy states that the universal affection and respect in which the Bar held him meant that he could always rely on the support of counsel on both sides to overcome any deficiencies in his own knowledge of the law.<ref>Healy p.31</ref> He was also fortunate that the quality of his judicial colleagues was very high; when he was sitting with more learned judges like [[Christopher Palles]] he would defer to their greater expertise.\n\nHe rarely dealt with criminal cases until his last few years on the Bench.  Towards the end of his career he acquired a reputation for imposing exceptionally severe sentences: some of the  sentences he handed down  while holding  the [[Munster]] [[assize]] in 1910 were so harsh that, according to Healy, the session  became popularly known as \"the Mad Assize\".<ref>Healy p.103</ref> On the other hand, his great kindness of heart meant that he was always willing to recommend a [[pardon|reprieve]] from the [[death penalty]], if he thought that there were any mitigating circumstances in the case.<ref>Healy pp.108\u20139</ref>\n\nHis short judgement in the [[probate]] case, ''Crofts v Beamish'',<ref>[1905] 2 I.R. 345</ref> where three High Court judges were unable to agree on the interpretation of a [[will (law)|will]], gives a flavour of his robust style and forceful personality. Boyd admitted frankly that he had no idea what the [[testator]] meant, and added : \"I do not think he himself knew what he meant.

The resulting governments contained vestiges of [[representative democracy]] (such as parliaments, elections, and sometimes even multiple political parties) to initially conceal the process.<ref name=\"Apple\"/>\n\nOnce in power, each country's Soviet-controlled Communist Party took permanent control of the administration, political organs, police, societal organizations and economic structures to ensure that no effective opposition could arise and to control socioeconomic and political life therein. Party and social [[purges]] were employed along with the extensive use of secret police organizations modeled on the Soviet [[KGB]] to monitor and control local populations.<ref name=\"Apple\"/> While multiple political parties continued to nominally exist in some countries, they were all subordinated to the government, and supported government policies. While elections continued to be held, voters were usually presented with a single candidate.

They made extensive use of local communists, socialists, and their collaborators to wage a campaign of mass violence and mass deportations to camps in order to \"Sovietize\" the areas under their occupation. The Soviet invasion of these areas in 1939 created local allies and produced NKVD officers experienced in imposing the communist system. The Soviet Union began planning the transformation of Eastern Europe even before the 1941 Nazi invasion of the USSR. There is evidence that the USSR did not expect to create a communist bloc quickly or easily. [[Ivan Maiskii]], Soviet foreign minister under Stalin, wrote in 1944 that all European nations would eventually become communist states but only after a period of three to four decades.<ref name=\"Apple\" />\n\nEastern European communist leaders generally participated in \"national front\" coalitions during the 1930s to oppose Nazi expansion.

of everything Russian and the reproduction of their own Communist structural hierarchies in each of the Bloc states.<ref name=\"graubard150\"/>\n\nThe defining characteristic of communism implemented in the Eastern Bloc was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable

Bloc experienced economic mis-development by central planners resulting in those countries following a path of extensive rather than intensive development, and lagged far behind their western European counterparts in per capita Gross Domestic Product.<ref name=\"hardt15\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|pp=15\u201317}}</ref> In addition, media in the Eastern Bloc served as an organ of the state,

Logo.svg|right|thumb|150px|The [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] emblem represented the handshake between Communist [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and Social Democrat [[Otto Grotewohl]] when their parties were forcibly merged in 1946]]\n{{further|Eastern Bloc}}\nThe initial issue arising in countries occupied by the [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 was the manner in which to transform occupation power into control over domestic development.<ref name=\"wettig35\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=35}}</ref> At first, western countries' willingness to support \"antifascist\" action and for \"democratization\" with a socialist element helped Soviet efforts to permit communists in their respective countries to initiate a process of gradual almost imperceptibly slow [[Sovietization]].<ref name=\"wettig35\"/><ref name=\"wettig36\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=36}}</ref>  Because communists were relatively small minorities in all countries but Czechoslovakia,<ref name=\"wettig39\"/> they were initially instructed to form coalitions in their respective countries.<ref name=\"wettig36\"/>\n\nAt the war's end, concealment of the [[Kremlin]]'s role was considered crucial to neutralize resistance and to make the regimes appear not only autochthonous, but also to resemble \"bourgeois democracies\".<ref name=\"wettig39\"/> [[Joseph Stalin]] had already effectively sealed off outside access to the [[Soviet Union]] since 1935 (and until his death), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.<ref name=\"laqueur22\">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}</ref> During this period, and even for 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few miles of Moscow, their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.<ref name=\"laqueur22\"/>  Dissenters who approached such foreigners were arrested.<ref name=\"laqueur23\">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}</ref> For many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not know the number of arrested or executed Soviet citizens, or how poorly the Soviet economy had performed.<ref name=\"laqueur23\"/>\n\nIn the other countries of the Bloc, Stalin stated that the Eastern European version of democracy was a mere modification of western \"[[bourgeois democracy]].\"<ref name=\"wettig37\"/> Consequently, Soviet takeover of control at the outset generally followed a three-stage \"bloc politics\" process: (i) a general coalition of left-wing, antifascist forces; (ii) a bogus coalition in which communists neutralized those in other parties not willing to accept communist supremacy; and (iii) complete communist domination, frequently exercised in a new party formed by the fusion of communist and other leftist groups.<ref name=\"crampton211\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=211}}</ref>  At the same time, Soviet advisers were placed in government institutions, with higher concentrations in the army and the police, while trade agreements gave the USSR a preponderant influence in local economies.<ref name=\"crampton211\"/> The result of the process was that, from 1944 to 1948 in the Eastern Bloc, political parties, organizations, voluntary associations and territorial communities were covertly steered to gradually incapacitate, dissolve, and spend themselves by their own efforts in various processes.<ref name=\"gibianskii33\">{{Harvnb|Gross|1997|p=33}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic reforms===\n{{Further|Eastern bloc black markets}}\nStalin felt that socioeconomic transformation was indispensable to establish Soviet control, reflecting the Marxist-Leninist view that material bases&mdash;the distribution of the means of production&mdash;shaped social and political relations.<ref name=\"wettig36\"/> This \"[[sovietization]]\" involved the gradual assimilation of local political, socioeconomic, and cultural patterns into the Soviet model while severing ties with \u201cbourgeois\u201d Western values and traditions.<ref name=\"frucht756\">{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=756}}</ref>  Moscow trained cadres were placed into crucial power positions to fulfill orders regarding sociopolitical transformation.<ref name=\"wettig36\"/>  Elimination of the [[bourgeoisie]]'s social and financial power by expropriation of landed and industrial property was accorded absolute priority.<ref name=\"wettig37\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=37}}</ref>   These measures were publicly billed as reforms rather than socioeconomic transformations.<ref name=\"wettig37\"/> Throughout the whole of eastern Europe, except for Czechoslovakia, organizations such as trade unions and associations representing various social, professional and other groups, were erected with only one organization for each category, with competition excluded.<ref name=\"wettig37\"/>  Those organizations were managed by communist cadres, though some diversity was permitted initially.<ref name=\"wettig38\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=38}}</ref> Soviet and local concerns formed \"joint stock companies\" permitting Soviet officials to exercise direct control over important sections of the economy.<ref name=\"crampton211\"/>\n\n===Concealment===\n[[File:PKWN Manifest.jpg|thumb|right|Photo of the Polish [[PKWN Manifesto]]]]\n[[File:Mikolajczyk.jpg|right|thumb|Pre-World War II Polish Prime Minister [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] returned to Poland in 1946 after facing arrest following Bloc politics, persecution, and vote rigging]]\n{{further|Eastern Bloc}} \nAt first, the Soviet Union concealed its role, with the transformations appearing as a modification of western \"[[bourgeois democracy]].\"<ref name=\"wettig37\"/> As one young communist was told in East Germany: \"it's got to look democratic, but we must have everything in our control.\"<ref name=\"crampton211\"/>\n\nWith the initial exception of Czechoslovakia, activities by political parties had to adhere to \"Bloc politics\", with parties eventually having to accept membership in an \"antifascist\" \"bloc\" obliging them to act only in mutual \"consensus\".<ref name=\"wettig38\"/>  Moscow cadres in key positions would refuse via veto to provide consensus for opposed changes, while those who opposed communist proposed changes were accused of insubordination to Soviet authorities, frequently followed by harsh punishment.<ref name=\"wettig38\"/> When such measures did not produce the desired effect, occupation officers would directly intervene.<ref name=\"wettig38\"/> Accordingly, elections&mdash;which had been promised to the Western allies&mdash;did not offer a difference in policy choices.<ref name=\"wettig39\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=39}}</ref> \n\nBloc politics eventually forced purported bourgeois politicians and parties to choose between unconditional political surrender and outright rejection.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>  If they chose the former, they would alienate their followers and marginalize themselves, while the latter case led to defamation as deviators from the \"anti-fascist democratic consensus\" and \"traitors\" to the people, followed by ensuring isolation, prosecution, and liquidation.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>\n\nConsequently, the bloc system permitted the Soviet Union to exercise Eastern Bloc domestic control indirectly.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  \"Bourgeois\" politicians willing to follow communist bloc leadership and to support socioeconomic reforms were recruited to further the illusion of classical democracy.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  Similar non-communist officials were put in place in some administration positions, while a reliable communist cadre worked behind the scenes to control the apparatus and decision-making process.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  Crucial departments such as those responsible for personnel, education, general police, secret police, and youth, were strictly communist run.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/> From the outset, the multiparty system established by Soviet occupation authorities was planned to be temporary.<ref name=\"wettig41\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=41}}</ref> Two kinds of alliances were envisaged: permanent \"natural\" alliances with related social forces such as peasants willing to submit to communist vanguard parties and temporary accords with bourgeois parties necessary for temporary objectives.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  Parties, such as [[Social Democrats]], were seen as belonging to the permanent natural category, but would be eventually expected to undergo transformations.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>   Moscow cadres distinguished \"progressive forces\"  from \"reactionary elements\", and rendered both powerless through self-emasculation or future self-sacrifice.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>  Such procedures were repeated continuously until communists had gained unlimited power, while only politicians who were unconditionally supportive of Soviet policy remained.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>\n\n==Political systems==\n\n===\"People's democracy\"===\nDespite the initial institutional design of communism implemented by [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Eastern Bloc (see [[Stalinism]]), subsequent development varied across countries.<ref name=\"hardt11\"/>  In [[satellite states]], after peace treaties were initially concluded, opposition was essentially liquidated, fundamental steps toward socialism were enforced, and Kremlin leaders sought to strengthen control therein.<ref name=\"wettig108\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=108\u20139}}</ref> While communism came to power in the Soviet Union following the [[Russian civil war]], of some embarrassment to the ruling regimes was that, in the rest of the Eastern Bloc, it came to power with the occupation of the [[Red Army]].<ref name=\"crampton241\"/> What emerged is what Hungarian communist [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]] (who was later executed) called \"a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] without the Soviet form,\" a \"people's democracy.\"<ref name=\"crampton241\"/> The defining characteristic of communism implemented therein was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.<ref name=\"hardt11\"/>  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed \"[[bourgeois democracy]]\" in Soviet parlance), and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.<ref name=\"hardt12\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}</ref>  The resulting states aspired to total control of a political center backed by an extensive and active repressive apparatus, and a central justification of ostensibly [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/>\n\n===Vestiges of \"bourgeois democracy\"===\nVestigial democratic institutions were never entirely destroyed, resulting in facade of representative institutions. Parliaments rubber-stamped decisions made by ruling parties.  So little attention was paid to them that some of those serving in parliaments were actually dead and officials would sometimes openly state that they would seat members who had lost elections.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/> Constitutions were promulgated but never enforced.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/> Government institutions practiced [[democratic centralism]], where subordinate organs of the party and state unconditionally supported the decisions of senior party leaders.<ref name=\"crampton243\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=243}}</ref> Decisions of consequence were made by the ruling communist parties, which were not political parties in the western sense, but apparatuses for totalitarian control of the state and society.<ref name=\"crampton246\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=246}}</ref> They did not represent sectional interests, they imposed them.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/> Parliaments were elected, but their meetings occurred only a few days per year and they served to only create legitimacy for politburo decisions.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/>\n\n===Ruling parties===\n[[File:R\u00e1kosi M\u00e1ty\u00e1s fortepan 56324.jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[People's Republic of Hungary]] Stalinist leader

Communist Parties held congresses every five years, not long after the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] had held its congress, to elect central committees and endorse new party programs, though \"emergency\" congresses could be called by central committees.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>  Attendance at party congresses was frequently given as a reward for long service.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>  Parties also sometimes held national conferences to address specific issues.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>\n\nThe [[Central Committee]]s usually met in full, or plenary, sessions two to three times per year to elect members of the politburo or praesidium and the communist party \"secretariat\", which numbered 15-20 senior party individuals who each was in charge of a department of the party secretariat.<ref name=\"crampton244\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=244}}</ref>  These departments were either party \"shadows\" of the actual government departments they ended up governing (e.g., agriculture, foreign affairs, education, etc.) or party specific institutions in charge of cadres or a party control commission that investigated any alleged infringements of party discipline.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>\n\nThe [[General Secretary]] or First Secretary of the Central Committee was the most powerful figure in each regime.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>  He exercised his day-to-day authority through the politburo or presidium, which generally possessed 10-15 full members.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/> During the Stalinist period, the head of the party also led the executive branch, with variations in the practice occurring after Stalin's death, though executive authority always resided in the party's highest organs.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/>  In [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]] after the mid-1960s, no politburo existed and, instead, General Secretary [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] nominated a small permanent executive committee from which he nominated a small permanent bureau consisting of himself, his wife, and four to five other members.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>  In general, the longer the First or General Secretary was in office, the more powerful he became, and he could generally retain power as long as he remained healthy.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>  The degree of leadership freedom varied, with Ceau\u015fescu facing little debate, while [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s [[Todor Zhivkov]] could undertake actions such as forcing Bulgarian names on ethnic Turks without even discussing the matter.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Beriozka-gastronom.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bureaucrat carries bags after a purchase from [[Beryozka]] Gastronom, a store in which premium goods could be bought using foreign currency]] -->\nThe party over which the [[politburo]] held sway was not a mass party but, comporting with [[Leninist]] tradition, a smaller selective party of between three percent (e.g., [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]]) and fourteen percent (e.g., [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]) of the country's population who had accepted total obedience.<ref name=\"crampton245\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=245}}</ref>  For example, a Polish communist described faith in the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] as that it \"means that his faith in it is uncritical at every stage, no matter what the party is saying.  It is a person with the ability to adapt his mentality and his conscience in such a way that he can unreservedly accept the dogma that the party is never wrong, even though it is wrong all the time.\"<ref name=\"crampton245\"/>  Entry usually required a period of probation.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/> Those who secured membership in this selective party received considerable rewards, such as access to special lower priced shops with a greater selection of goods, special schools, holiday facilities, cinemas, homes, furniture, works of art, and official cars with special license plates so that police and others could identify these members from a distance.<ref name=\"crampton245\"/> These members, also called [[nomenklatura]], also obtained permission to travel abroad, which was rarely given to the general public. Envelopes containing banknotes, and sometimes foreign hard currency, were not infrequently passed out to certain party or politburo members.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/>  After the confiscation through

\"building communism\" in the Eastern Bloc included liquidation of class enemies and constant vigilance against counterrevolutionaries, especially within the Communist parties themselves.<ref

labor camps and mines.<ref name=\"bideleux476\"/>  The evolution of the resulting harshness of purges in Czechoslovakia, like much of its history after 1948, was a function of the late takeover by the communists, with many of the purges focusing on the sizable numbers of party members with prior memberships in other parties.<ref name=\"crampton270\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=270}}</ref>  Party leader [[Klement Gottwald]]'s early claims that Czechoslovakia was different from the rest of the Eastern Bloc created jealousy and additional danger later when [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was showing an

Eastern Bloc leaders.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/>  In Poland, when the local leadership resisted Soviet pressure for show trials, the Soviets demanded the construction of more prisons, including one containing a special wing for high-ranking party members.<ref name=\"crampton264\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=264}}</ref>  The intensity of the purges varied by country, with thorough purges in places

Czechoslovakia's parties that enemy agents had penetrated high into party ranks, and when a puzzled [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]] and [[Klement Gottwald]] inquired what they could do, Stalin's NKVD agents arrived to help prepare subsequent trials. The Czechoslovakian party subsequently arrested Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd himself, [[Vladim\u00edr Clementis]], Ladislav Novomesk\u00fd and [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] (Clementis was later executed).<ref name=\"crampton262\"/> Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd and eleven others were convicted together of being \"Trotskyist-zionist-titoist-bourgeois-nationalist traitors\" in one series of [[show trials]], after which they were executed and their ashes were mixed with material being used to fill roads on the outskirts of Prague.<ref name=\"crampton262\"/> By the time of the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trials, the Kremlin had been arguing that Israel, like Yugoslavia, had bitten the Soviet hand that had fed it, and thus the trials took an overtly anti-Semitic tone, with eleven of the fourteen defendants tried with Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd being Jewish.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>\n\nThe Soviets directed show trial methods, including a procedure in which confessions and \"evidence\" from leading witnesses could be extracted by any means, including threatening to torture the witnesses\u2019 wives and children.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/> The higher ranking the party member, generally the more harsh the torture that was inflicted upon him.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/> For the show trial of Hungarian Interior Minister [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], who one year earlier attempted to force a confession of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]] in his show trial, regarding \"Vladimir\" the questioner of K\u00e1d\u00e1r:<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>\n\n{{cquote|Vladimir had but one argument: blows.

Once in the interrogation room, the inquisitors made no pretense about attempting to seek real evidence, making it clear that their only task was to extract a confession that would be used to convince other people of the defendant's guilt.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>  Many dedicated party members accepted the argument that they could perform one last service to the party by allowing themselves to be convicted of crimes that they had not committed.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>  Even after the party reneged on a deal that was supposed to have spared L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk, Rajk allegedly yelled just before his execution \"long live the party!\"<ref name=\"crampton265\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=265}}</ref>  For those not executed, degradation and humiliation continued for years in prison or labor camps.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>\n\nThe evidence was often not just non-existent but absurd, with Hungarian [[George Paloczi-Horv\u00e1th]]\u2019s party interrogators delightedly exclaiming \"We knew all the time\u2014we have it here in writing\u2014that you met professor Szentgy\u00f6rgyi not in [[Istanbul]], but in [[Constantinople]].\"<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>  In another case, the Hungarian [[\u00c1VH]] secret police also condemned another party member as a Nazi accomplice with a document that had actually been previously displayed in glass cabinet of the Institute of the Working Class Movement as an example of a Gestapo forgery.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/> The trials themselves were \"shows\", with each participant having to learn a script and conduct repeated rehearsals before the performance.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>  In the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial, when the judge skipped one of the scripted questions, the better-rehearsed Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd answered the one which should have been asked.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n!<center>Some of the notable [[show trials]] in the Eastern Bloc after 1944</center>\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;background:#B0C4DE\"|Member\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Party\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Notes\n|-\n|align=left|[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]]|| [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] || Hungarian Foreign Minister;

The latter contained every post in each country that was important to the smooth application of party policy, including military posts, administrative positions, directors of local enterprises, social organization administrators, newspapers, etc.<ref name=\"crampton249\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=249}}</ref>  In [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], the ''nomenklatura'' lists were thought to contain 100,000 post listings, while the number estimated in Poland was 2-3 times that figure.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/> The names of those that the party considered to be trustworthy enough to secure a ''nomenklatura'' post were compiled on the ''cadre'' list.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>  One did not have to be a party member to be on the cadre list, but any sign of unconventional behavior would mean exclusion from the list.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>  The considerable amount of information disseminated to the party from police or trusted observers ensured that the ''cadre'' lists were timely and comprehensive.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>  The end result was that anyone aspiring to have an influential or rewarding job had to conform to party dictates.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>\n\n===De-Stalinization===\nSome relaxation of Soviet control occurred after Stalin's death in 1953 and the subsequent [[de-stalinization]].<ref name=\"turnock1\">{{Harvnb|Turnock|1997|p=1}}</ref> State brutality and repression waned in the Bloc.<ref name=\"roht83\"/>  The Red Army withdrew from the Balkans, though not from [[East Germany]] and countries needed for transit purposes.<ref name=\"turnock1\"/> Continuing maintenance of communist power was guaranteed by the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], such as in the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], on the grounds that a threat to the system in one country was a challenge to the alliance as a whole.<ref name=\"turnock1\"/>\n\n[[File:07Albanisch makedonische Grenze02.jpg|thumb|right|One of over 700,000 bunkers built by [[Enver Hoxha]] in [[Albania]]]]\nAs with [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]], [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] took a different course than most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc.

countries,<ref name=\"hardt1\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=1}}</ref> communist structures existed in different manifestations of strength that also varied over time.<ref name=\"hardt18\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=18}}</ref> In such Communist systems, centralized and unelected state apparatuses, command economies, and scarcity or absence of independent civil associations specifically combined to tightly restrict the repertoire of action for those looking to defend their interests or press demands on the government.<ref name=\"sharman2\">{{Harvnb|Sharman|2003|p=2}}</ref> These features did not evolve, but rather were intentionally imposed over a relatively short span of time.<ref name=\"sharman2\"/>\n\nAs in the Soviet Union, culture was subordinated to political needs and creativity was secondary to [[socialist realism]].<ref name=\"crampton240\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=240}}</ref> The legal system and education were redesigned on Soviet lines.<ref name=\"crampton241\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=241}}</ref> In addition to emigration restrictions, civil society, defined as a domain of political action outside the party's state control, was not allowed to firmly take root, with the possible exception of [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] in the 1980s.<ref name=\"hardt18\"/>  While the institutional designs of the communist systems were based on the rejection of rule of law, the legal infrastructure was not immune to change reflecting decaying ideology and the substitution of autonomous law.<ref name=\"hardt18\"/>\n\nWhile institutional changes creating some freedoms occurred, a change toward effective [[constitutionalism]] could not occur without the collapse of the communist political regimes.<ref name=\"hardt18\"/>  Market-oriented reforms could not work without functioning markets.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/> Such systems' subordination of society was not so much the result of recurrent state triumphs over rival groups as it was intermittent state triumphs combined with state-imposed structures that broke requisite links and occupied the social space necessary for rival groups to initially form.<ref name=\"sharman3\">{{Harvnb|Sharman|2003|p=3}}</ref>\n\n===Political dissent===\n{{further|Eastern Bloc information dissemination}}\nCommunist regimes in the Eastern Bloc viewed even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the bases underlying Communist power therein.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xiv}}</ref>  The central pillar on which the monopoly power of the Communist elite was based was the belief of the administrative classes\u2014mid-level leadership cadres in the party apparatus, industry, security organs, education and state administration\u2014in the legitimacy of the Communist Party.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>  The perceived danger posed by dissidence and opposition was less that of the possible mobilization of broad open protest movements undermining a regime than that political nonconformism would undermine the reliability of the administrative classes responsible for carrying the party leadership's directives.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>\n\nAccordingly, the suppression of dissidence and opposition was viewed as a central prerequisite for the security of Communist power, though the enormous expense at which the population in certain countries were kept under secret surveillance may not have been rational.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>  The degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and time throughout the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>  Following a [[totalitarian]] initial phase, a post-totalitarian period followed the death of Stalin in which the primary method of Communist rule shifted from wide scale terror to selective repression and ideological and sociopolitical strategies of legitimation and the securing of loyalty.<ref name=\"Pollackxv\">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xv}}</ref>\n\nPost-totalitarian phase repression varied across Eastern Bloc countries according to the degree of internal coherence and the social anchoring of the Communist elites in each country.<ref name=\"Pollackxvi\">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xvi}}</ref> Trial by jury was replaced by a tribunal of a professional judge and two lay assessors that were dependable party actors.<ref name=\"crampton247\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}</ref> The features of such Communist systems combined to structure the social and political environment to raise the cost of open protest, often to a prohibitive level.<ref name=\"sharman3\"/>  While resistance existed, it occurred mainly in the form of individual measures predicated on acceptance of the system as a whole that paradoxically often further atrophied the avenues of collective redress against the state, such as workers intentionally wasting time on the job or stealing state resources.<ref name=\"sharman3\"/>\n\n===Class categories===\nCitizens were classified by socialist origin and class, with the standard categories being: [[worker]], [[peasant]], [[intelligentsia]], [[Petty bourgeois|petty employee]], others and [[class enemies]].<ref name=\"crampton248\"/>  In order to gain a more obedient future intelligentsia, the children of class enemies were restricted to no more than primary education, while those of the fourth and fifth categories would find it difficult to gain entrance into a university.<ref name=\"crampton248\"/>  Criminal codes could also be graded on a class basis, with the class origin of the convicted determining how dangerous to society the crime had been.<ref name=\"crampton248\"/>\n\n===Broad social purges===\nIn addition to party purges, more widespread social [[purges]] occurred, and were aimed with equal or greater intensity at all levels of society.<ref name=\"crampton267\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=267}}</ref> As with the party purges, the social purges were justified theoretically by the Stalinist doctrine that the class struggle intensifies in the immediate aftermath of the socialist revolution and in the first stages of the construction of socialism.<ref

The [[East Germany|East German]] [[Stasi]] became the Soviet [[KGB]]'s most important surrogate following Lenin's statement that \"the principal link in the chain of revolution is the German link, and the success of world revolution depends more on Germany than upon any other country.\"<ref name=\"koehler30\"/> In 1947, Stalin told Edvard Kardelj, then prime minister of Yugoslavia, \"We Russians will never get out of Germany.\"<ref name=\"koehler30\"/>  The [[NKVD]] at first maintained a number of former [[Nazi]] concentration camps, such as Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen, to house former Nazis.<ref name=\"koehler31\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=31}}</ref>  After the forced merger of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] thousands of anti-Nazi social democrats and communists that opposed the merger also ended up in those camps.<ref name=\"koehler31\"/> [[Erich Mielke]], a key operator for the Soviets after the war, built the Stasi into a vast secret police and espionage organization.<ref name=\"koehler31\"/> Mielke became the longest-serving state security chief in the Eastern bloc, and his relationship with the Soviet secret police dated back to 1931, when he had fled Germany for Moscow after murdering two Berlin policemen.<ref name=\"koehler31\"/>  Although Mielke's Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957, until 1990 the KGB continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates, each with his own office inside the Stasi's Berlin compound, and in each of the fifteen Stasi district headquarters around East Germany.<ref name=\"koehler74\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=74}}</ref>  Collaboration was so close that the KGB invited the Stasi to establish operational bases in Moscow and Leningrad to monitor visiting East German tourists and Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as \"Chekists of the Soviet Union.\"<ref name=\"koehler74\"/>  In 1978, Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers they enjoyed in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"koehler74\"/>\n\nAll information acquired worldwide by the intelligence and security services in the Eastern bloc was stored in the Soviet computer [[SOUD]] (''System of Joint Acquisition of Enemy Data'').<ref name=\"koehler80\"/> The SOUD became a valuable KGB asset for the Stasi.<ref name=\"koehler80\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=80}}</ref> Stasi engineers had actually created the system using stolen and illegally obtained Western technology, but the Soviets insisted that it be based in Moscow.<ref name=\"koehler80\"/>\n\n===Stasi

employed 120,000 full-time agents and an official estimate of 100,000 informants to monitor a country that possessed only 16 million inhabitants.<ref name=\"philipsen10\">{{Harvnb|Philipsen|1993|p=10}}</ref>  Between 1950 and 1989, the Stasi employed a total of 274,000 persons.<ref name=\"koehler8\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=8}}</ref>  In terms of total ''inoffizielle Mitarbeiter'' (IMs) Stasi informants, by 1995, 174,000 had been identified, which approximated 2.5% of East Germany's population between the ages of 18 and 60.<ref name=\"koehler8\"/> While these calculations were from official records, because many such records were destroyed, there were likely closer to 500,000 Stasi informers.<ref name=\"koehler8\"/> A former Stasi colonel estimated that the figure could be as high as 2 million if occasional informants were included.<ref name=\"koehler8\"/>\n\nThe result was a society in which residents often did not know whom to trust, and in which few attempted to share their private thoughts with anyone but close friends or colleagues.<ref name=\"philipsen10\"/> A popular saying in East Germany was that whenever three people engaged in a conversation, one was bound to be a Stasi informant.<ref name=\"philipsen10\"/>   Stasi efforts with one agent per 166 citizens dwarfed, for example, the [[Nazi]] [[Gestapo]], which employed only 40,000 officials to watch a population of 80 million (one officer per 2,000 citizens) and the Soviet [[KGB]], which employed 480,000 full-time agents to oversee a nation of 280 million residents (one agent per 5,830 citizens).<ref name=\"koehler9\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=9}}</ref>  When informants were included, the Stasi had one spy per 66 citizens of East Germany.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/>  When part-time informer adults were included, the figures reached approximately one spy per 6.5 citizens.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/>\n\nFull-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants and one tenant in every apartment building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the [[Volkspolizei]] (Vopo).<ref name=\"koehler9\"/> Spies reported every relative or friend that stayed the night at another's apartment.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/> Tiny holes were bored in apartment and hotel room walls through which Stasi agents filmed citizens with special video cameras.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/> Similarly, schools, universities, and hospitals were extensively infiltrated.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/>\n\nPolitical offenses usually came under broad crimes such as \"Treasonable Relaying of Information\", \"Treasonable Agent Activity\" and \"Interference in Activities of the State or Society.\"<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> Defendants usually were persons who had requested (nominally) legal exit permits from East Germany or contacted a Western consulate to inquire about emigration procedures.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> Sentences of up to two and a half years' hard labor were not unusual as punishment for such inquiries.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> Those accused of \"propaganda hostile to the state\" could be those that once stated that it was not necessary to station tanks at the border, referred to border fortifications as \"nonsense\" or received [[West German]] television programs and relayed the contents to others.<ref name=\"koehler19\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=19}}</ref> Writing to friends in the west about wishes to emigrate, which the Stasi could intercept, could draw a conviction for \"establishing illegal contacts.\"<ref name=\"koehler19\"/>  In addition, it was a crime to fail to denounce fellow citizens, such as informers who failed to report friends stating they wished to escape to the west.<ref name=\"koehler19\"/>  After the mid-1950s, Stasi executions were carried out in strict secrecy, usually by guillotine and, in later years, by a single pistol shot to the neck.<ref name=\"koehler18\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=18}}</ref> In most instances, the relatives of the executed were not informed of either the sentence or the execution.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> The corpses were cremated and the ashes buried secretly, sometimes at construction sites.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/>\n\nThe Stasi also focused upon the allies of the ruling communist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]].<ref name=\"koehler127\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=127}}</ref> For example, during the Soviet-backed forced merger of the SED, the Stasi arrested 5,000 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] members that disapproved of the merger.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>  400 died from a mix of executions, malnutrition or disappearing.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>  200 of them were later sentenced to a total of 10,000 years jail time.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>  Until 1950, all such sentences were pronounced by Soviet military tribunals in trials that lasted no more than ten minutes each.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>\n\nWhile the Stasi had only 4,000 members in 1953, it grew considerably over the years to 52,707 in 1973.<ref name=\"koehler142\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=142}}</ref>  Its ranks swelled much more quickly after [[Eastern Bloc]] countries signed the 1975 [[Helsinki accords]], which [[Erich Honecker]] viewed as a grave threat to his regime because they contained language binding signatories to respect \"human and basic rights,   including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and conviction.<ref name=\"koehler142\"/>  Stasi size was immediately increased by 10,000.<ref name=\"koehler142\"/> Mielke was accorded new, wide-ranging powers while the Stasi became the leadership's instrument of power to an extent not seen in the Eastern Bloc since [[Stalin's death]], with the exception of the [[Securitate]] in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] under [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].<ref name=\"koehler142\"/>  The Stasi then set up 24 internment camps throughout East Germany to house six categories of persons to be arrested.<ref name=\"koehler143\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=143}}</ref>\n\nMielke then issued ''Richtlinie 1/76'', a standard operating procedure manual outlining surveillance of the population down to the last detail.<ref name=\"koehler143\"/>  Stasi Division M employed officers at every post office to surreptitiously open all letters and parcels sent to, or received from, a non-communist country.<ref name=\"koehler144\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=144}}</ref> Writing samples were taken from letters that could be used to match with writing on any dissident pamphlets.<ref name=\"koehler145\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=145}}</ref>  Those questioned by the Stasi were forced to put special cloths under the arms that were later stored in sealed and numbered cans in a massive warehouse for later use by bloodhounds in the event of a manhunt.<ref name=\"koehler144\"/>  The Stasi also sprayed a special chemical on sidewalks in front of their offices that would adhere to the shoes of those leaving and permit dogs more easily to track them.<ref name=\"koehler145\"/>  In the late 1970s, when certain western news organizations were allowed to employ offices in East Berlin, they were required to hire all employees from a specified labour pool, all of whom were Stasi informants.<ref

While elections continued to be held, voters were usually presented with a single candidate.

They made extensive use of local communists, socialists, and their collaborators to wage a campaign of mass violence and mass deportations to camps in order to \"Sovietize\" the areas under their occupation. The Soviet invasion of these areas in 1939 created local allies and produced NKVD officers experienced in imposing the communist system. The Soviet Union began planning the transformation of Eastern Europe even before the 1941 Nazi invasion of the USSR. There is evidence that the USSR did not expect to create a communist bloc quickly or easily.

control over domestic development.<ref name=\"wettig35\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=35}}</ref> At first, western countries' willingness to support \"antifascist\" action and for \"democratization\" with a socialist element helped Soviet efforts to permit communists in their respective countries to initiate a process of gradual almost imperceptibly slow [[Sovietization]].<ref name=\"wettig35\"/><ref name=\"wettig36\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=36}}</ref>  Because communists were relatively small minorities in all countries but Czechoslovakia,<ref name=\"wettig39\"/> they were initially instructed to form coalitions in their respective countries.<ref name=\"wettig36\"/>\n\nAt the war's end, concealment of the [[Kremlin]]'s role was considered crucial to neutralize resistance and to make the regimes appear not only autochthonous, but also to resemble \"bourgeois democracies\".<ref name=\"wettig39\"/> [[Joseph Stalin]] had already effectively sealed off outside access to the [[Soviet Union]] since 1935 (and until his death), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.<ref name=\"laqueur22\">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}</ref> During this period, and even for 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few miles of Moscow, their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.<ref name=\"laqueur22\"/>  Dissenters who approached such foreigners were arrested.<ref name=\"laqueur23\">{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}</ref> For many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not know the number of arrested or executed Soviet citizens, or how poorly the Soviet economy had performed.<ref name=\"laqueur23\"/>\n\nIn the other countries of the Bloc, Stalin stated that the Eastern European version of democracy was a mere modification of western \"[[bourgeois democracy]].\"<ref name=\"wettig37\"/> Consequently, Soviet takeover of control at the outset generally followed a three-stage \"bloc politics\" process: (i) a general coalition of left-wing, antifascist forces; (ii) a bogus coalition in which communists neutralized those in other parties not willing to accept communist supremacy; and (iii) complete communist domination, frequently exercised in a new party formed by the fusion of communist and other leftist groups.<ref name=\"crampton211\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=211}}</ref>  At the same time, Soviet advisers were placed in government institutions, with higher concentrations in the army and the police, while trade agreements gave the USSR a preponderant influence in local economies.<ref name=\"crampton211\"/> The result of the process was that, from 1944 to 1948 in the Eastern Bloc, political parties, organizations, voluntary associations and territorial communities were covertly steered to gradually incapacitate, dissolve, and spend themselves by their own efforts in various processes.<ref name=\"gibianskii33\">{{Harvnb|Gross|1997|p=33}}</ref>\n\n===Socioeconomic reforms===\n{{Further|Eastern bloc black markets}}\nStalin felt that socioeconomic transformation was indispensable to

absolute priority.<ref name=\"wettig37\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=37}}</ref>   These measures were publicly billed as reforms rather than socioeconomic transformations.<ref name=\"wettig37\"/> Throughout the whole of eastern Europe, except for Czechoslovakia, organizations such as trade unions and associations representing various social, professional and other groups, were erected with only one organization for each category, with competition excluded.<ref name=\"wettig37\"/>  Those organizations were managed by communist cadres, though some diversity was permitted initially.<ref

Prime Minister [[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]] returned to Poland in 1946 after facing arrest following Bloc politics, persecution, and vote rigging]]\n{{further|Eastern Bloc}} \nAt first, the Soviet Union concealed its role, with the transformations appearing as a modification of western \"[[bourgeois democracy]].\"<ref name=\"wettig37\"/> As one young communist was told in East Germany: \"it's got to look democratic, but we must have everything in our control.\"<ref name=\"crampton211\"/>\n\nWith the initial exception of Czechoslovakia, activities by political parties had to adhere to \"Bloc politics\", with parties eventually having to accept membership in an \"antifascist\" \"bloc\" obliging them to act only in mutual \"consensus\".<ref name=\"wettig38\"/>  Moscow cadres in key positions would refuse via veto to provide consensus for opposed changes, while those who opposed communist proposed changes were accused of insubordination to Soviet authorities, frequently followed by harsh punishment.<ref name=\"wettig38\"/> When such measures did not produce the desired effect, occupation officers would directly intervene.<ref name=\"wettig38\"/> Accordingly, elections&mdash;which had been promised to the Western allies&mdash;did not offer a difference in policy choices.<ref name=\"wettig39\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=39}}</ref> \n\nBloc politics eventually forced purported bourgeois politicians and parties to choose between unconditional political surrender and outright rejection.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>  If they chose the former, they would alienate their followers and marginalize themselves, while the latter case led to defamation as deviators from the \"anti-fascist democratic consensus\" and \"traitors\" to the people, followed by ensuring isolation, prosecution, and liquidation.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>\n\nConsequently, the bloc system permitted the Soviet Union to exercise Eastern Bloc domestic control indirectly.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  \"Bourgeois\" politicians willing to follow communist bloc leadership and to support socioeconomic reforms were recruited to further the illusion of classical democracy.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  Similar non-communist officials were put in place in some administration positions, while a reliable communist cadre worked behind the scenes to control the apparatus and decision-making process.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  Crucial departments such as those responsible for personnel, education, general police, secret police, and youth, were strictly communist run.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/> From the outset, the multiparty system established by Soviet occupation authorities was planned to be temporary.<ref name=\"wettig41\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=41}}</ref> Two kinds of alliances were envisaged: permanent \"natural\" alliances with related social forces such as peasants willing to submit to communist vanguard parties and temporary accords with bourgeois parties necessary for temporary objectives.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>  Parties, such as [[Social Democrats]], were seen as belonging to the permanent natural category, but would be eventually expected to undergo transformations.<ref name=\"wettig39\"/>   Moscow cadres distinguished \"progressive forces\"  from \"reactionary elements\", and rendered both powerless through self-emasculation or future self-sacrifice.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>  Such procedures were repeated continuously until communists had gained unlimited power, while only politicians who were unconditionally supportive of Soviet policy remained.<ref name=\"wettig41\"/>\n\n==Political systems==\n\n===\"People's democracy\"===\nDespite the initial institutional design of communism implemented by [[Joseph Stalin]] in the Eastern Bloc (see [[Stalinism]]), subsequent development varied across countries.<ref name=\"hardt11\"/>  In [[satellite states]], after peace treaties were initially concluded, opposition was essentially liquidated, fundamental steps toward socialism were enforced, and Kremlin leaders sought to strengthen control therein.<ref name=\"wettig108\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=108\u20139}}</ref> While communism came to power in the Soviet Union following the [[Russian civil war]], of some embarrassment to the ruling regimes was that, in the rest of the Eastern Bloc, it came to power with the occupation of the [[Red Army]].<ref name=\"crampton241\"/> What emerged is what Hungarian communist [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]] (who was later executed) called \"a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] without the Soviet form,\" a \"people's democracy.\"<ref name=\"crampton241\"/> The defining characteristic of communism implemented therein was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.<ref name=\"hardt11\"/>  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], democratic governance (dubbed \"[[bourgeois democracy]]\" in Soviet parlance), and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.<ref name=\"hardt12\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}</ref>  The resulting states aspired to total control of a political center backed by an extensive and active repressive apparatus, and a central justification of ostensibly [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/>\n\n===Vestiges of \"bourgeois democracy\"===\nVestigial democratic institutions were never entirely destroyed, resulting in facade of representative institutions. Parliaments rubber-stamped decisions made by ruling parties.  So little attention was paid to them that some of those serving in parliaments were actually dead and officials would sometimes openly state that they would seat members who had lost elections.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/> Constitutions were promulgated but never enforced.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/> Government institutions practiced [[democratic centralism]], where subordinate organs of the party and state unconditionally supported the decisions of senior party leaders.<ref name=\"crampton243\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=243}}</ref> Decisions of consequence were made by the ruling communist parties, which were not political parties in the western sense, but apparatuses for totalitarian control of the state and society.<ref name=\"crampton246\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=246}}</ref> They did not represent sectional interests, they imposed them.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/> Parliaments were elected, but their meetings occurred only a few days per year and they served to only create legitimacy for politburo decisions.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/>\n\n===Ruling parties===\n[[File:R\u00e1kosi M\u00e1ty\u00e1s fortepan 56324.jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[People's Republic of Hungary]] Stalinist leader

1956 Hungarian Revolt'', Stanford University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8047-5606-6}}, page 9-12</ref> who was the [[General Secretary]] of the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]]]\nNon-Soviet Eastern Bloc Communist Parties held congresses every five years, not long after the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] had held its congress, to elect central committees and endorse new party programs, though \"emergency\" congresses could be called by central committees.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>  Attendance at party congresses was frequently given as a reward for long service.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>  Parties also sometimes held national conferences to address specific issues.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>\n\nThe [[Central Committee]]s usually met in full, or plenary, sessions two to three times per year to elect members of the politburo or praesidium and the communist party \"secretariat\", which numbered 15-20 senior party individuals who each was in charge of a department of the party secretariat.<ref name=\"crampton244\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=244}}</ref>  These departments were either party \"shadows\" of the actual government departments they ended up governing (e.g., agriculture, foreign affairs, education, etc.) or party specific institutions in charge of cadres or a party control commission that investigated any alleged infringements of party discipline.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>\n\nThe [[General Secretary]] or First Secretary of the Central Committee was the most powerful figure in each regime.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>  He exercised his day-to-day authority through the politburo or presidium, which generally possessed 10-15 full members.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/> During the Stalinist period, the head of the party also led the executive branch, with variations in the practice occurring after Stalin's death, though executive authority always resided in the party's highest organs.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/>  In [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]] after the mid-1960s, no politburo existed and, instead, General Secretary [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]] nominated a small permanent executive committee from which he nominated a small permanent bureau consisting of himself, his wife, and four to five other members.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>  In general, the longer the First or General Secretary was in office, the more powerful he became, and he could generally retain power as long as he remained healthy.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>  The degree of leadership freedom varied, with Ceau\u015fescu facing little debate, while [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s [[Todor Zhivkov]] could undertake actions such as forcing Bulgarian names on ethnic Turks without even discussing the matter.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Beriozka-gastronom.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] bureaucrat carries bags after a purchase from [[Beryozka]] Gastronom, a store in which premium goods could be bought using foreign currency]] -->\nThe party over which the [[politburo]] held sway was not a mass party but, comporting with [[Leninist]] tradition, a smaller selective party of between three percent (e.g., [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]]) and fourteen percent (e.g., [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]]) of the country's population who had accepted total obedience.<ref name=\"crampton245\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=245}}</ref>  For example, a Polish communist described faith in the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] as that it \"means that his faith in it is uncritical at every stage, no matter what the party is saying.  It is a person with the ability to adapt his mentality and his conscience in such a way that he can unreservedly accept the dogma that the party is never wrong, even though it is wrong all the time.\"<ref name=\"crampton245\"/>  Entry usually required a period of probation.<ref name=\"crampton244\"/> Those who secured membership in this selective party received considerable rewards, such as access to special lower priced shops with a greater selection of goods, special schools, holiday facilities, cinemas, homes, furniture, works of art, and official cars with special license plates so that police and others could identify these members from a distance.<ref name=\"crampton245\"/> These members, also called [[nomenklatura]], also obtained permission to travel abroad, which was rarely given to the general public. Envelopes containing banknotes, and sometimes foreign hard currency, were not infrequently passed out to certain party or politburo members.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/>  After the confiscation through nationalizations from prior owners following Soviet occupation, the party at first possessed considerable additional property and real estate to give members.<ref name=\"crampton246\"/>  All members possessed a party card or book in which were recorded attendance at meetings, service to the party, and any deviation from party conduct.<ref name=\"crampton245\"/> Periodically, these cards would be inspected, frequently as a prelude to a culling or purge of those considered undesirable or insufficiently committed.<ref name=\"crampton245\"/>\n\nThe Communist Party was at the center of the political system in the Eastern Bloc, with its leading role being absolute political rule with virtually no political discussion.<ref name=\"crampton242\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=242}}</ref>  Most of the parties in non-Soviet Eastern Bloc countries differed from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in that they were technically coalitions.<ref name=\"crampton242\"/> Only in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania (and only after 1965) did the parties use the word \"communist\" in their name.<ref name=\"crampton242\"/>  The ruling parties in the Eastern Bloc

legitimize the existence of a national front or some similar umbrella organization.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>  The organization of the party was based on the \"territorial-production\" principle, meaning that the lowest level unit could be based either in an area or in a place of work.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>  The next highest level was territorial, into districts, towns, regions and states.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>  Each level had its own committees, bureau and secretariat.<ref name=\"crampton243\"/>\n\n===Purges and show trials===\nIn accordance with Soviet directives, \"building communism\" in the Eastern Bloc included liquidation of class enemies and constant vigilance against counterrevolutionaries, especially within the Communist parties themselves.<ref name=\"roht83\"/>  In the late 1940s and early 1950s, more frequently after the campaign to route out \"[[Titoism|Titoists]]\" after the 1948 [[Tito-Stalin split]], protests occurred, with many of those taking part being workers, intellectuals, dissatisfied young men inducted into the peasantry as part of [[collectivization]]s and those who were originally most enthusiastic about Communist systems.<ref name=\"bideleux476\">{{Harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|2007|p=477}}</ref><ref name=\"crampton261\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=261}}</ref>  In response, in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], the central committee held a \"vigilance plenum\" against nationalists.<ref name=\"crampton262\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=262}}</ref> One of the methods of control involved several party [[purge]]s between 1948 and 1953, including 90,000 purged in Bulgaria, 200,000 in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]] (about one third of party), 200,000 in Hungary, 300,000 in [[East Germany]], 370,000 in Poland (about one quarter of party members) and 550,000 in Czechoslovakia (30% of the party).<ref name=\"bideleux476\"/><ref name=\"crampton262\"/>  In [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], approximately 150,000 were also imprisoned, with 2,000 summarily executed.<ref name=\"bideleux476\"/> In the [[Estonian SSR]], a purge of \"bourgeois nationalists\" from the Estonian Communist party occurred from 1949 to 1951.<ref name=\"oconnorxx\">{{Harvnb|O'Connor|2003|p=xx-xxi}}</ref> In [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], approximately 130,000 people were sent to prisons, labor camps and mines.<ref name=\"bideleux476\"/>  The evolution of the resulting harshness of purges in Czechoslovakia, like much of its history after 1948, was a function of the late takeover by the communists, with many of the purges focusing on the sizable numbers of party members with prior memberships in other parties.<ref name=\"crampton270\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=270}}</ref>  Party leader [[Klement Gottwald]]'s early claims that Czechoslovakia was different from the rest of the Eastern Bloc created jealousy and additional danger later when [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was showing an almost paranoiac desire for unity and uniformity.<ref name=\"crampton270\"/>\n\nNine copies of reports, confessions and other documents in all countries' purges were circulated to Soviet and other Eastern Bloc leaders.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/>  In Poland, when the local leadership resisted Soviet pressure for show trials, the Soviets demanded the construction of more prisons, including one containing a special wing for high-ranking party members.<ref name=\"crampton264\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=264}}</ref>  The intensity of the purges varied by country, with thorough purges in places with a relatively popular party in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, and less thorough purges in places where the party was initially less well-established, such as Poland, Romania and East Germany.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>\n\nAny member with a western connection was immediately vulnerable, which included large numbers of people who had spent years in exile in the West during the Nazi-occupation of Czechoslovakia and Hungary.<ref name=\"crampton263\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=263}}</ref>  Many veterans of the [[Spanish Civil War]] were imprisoned or killed because they were tainted by their western experiences.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/>  Persons with western wives also were the targets of persecution.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/>  In addition to connections with Tito or Yugoslavia, persons who had previously belonged to non-communist parties merged in the Bloc politics process were also at risk, as were members from a non-working-class background.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/>\n\nIn addition to rank-and-file member purges, prominent communists were purged, with some subjected to public [[show trials]].<ref name=\"crampton262\"/>  These were more likely to be instigated, and sometimes orchestrated, by the [[Kremlin]] or even Stalin, as he had done in the [[Moscow Trials]] of the [[Great Purge]] in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/> They included [[Ko\u00e7i Xoxe]] in Albania and [[Traicho Kostov]] in Bulgaria, who were both purged and arrested.<ref name=\"crampton261\"/> After Kostov was executed, Bulgarian leaders sent Stalin a telegram thanking him for the help.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/>  In Romania, [[Lucre\u0163iu P\u0103tr\u0103\u015fcanu]], [[Ana Pauker]] and [[Vasile Luca]] were arrested, with P\u0103tr\u0103\u015fcanu being executed.<ref name=\"crampton262\"/>   Stalin's NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and his [[\u00c1VH]] head the way the [[show trial]] of Hungarian Foreign Minister [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]], who was later executed.<ref name=\"crampton263\"/>  The Rajk trials led Moscow to warn Czechoslovakia's parties that enemy agents had penetrated high into party ranks, and when a puzzled [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]] and [[Klement Gottwald]] inquired what they could do, Stalin's NKVD agents arrived to help prepare subsequent trials. The Czechoslovakian party subsequently arrested Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd himself, [[Vladim\u00edr Clementis]], Ladislav Novomesk\u00fd and [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] (Clementis was later executed).<ref name=\"crampton262\"/> Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd and eleven others were convicted together of being \"Trotskyist-zionist-titoist-bourgeois-nationalist traitors\" in one series of [[show trials]], after which they were executed and their ashes were mixed with material being used to fill roads on the outskirts of Prague.<ref name=\"crampton262\"/> By the time of the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trials, the Kremlin had been arguing that Israel, like Yugoslavia, had bitten the Soviet hand that had fed it, and thus the trials took an overtly anti-Semitic tone, with eleven of the fourteen defendants tried with Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd being Jewish.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>\n\nThe Soviets directed show trial methods, including a procedure in which confessions and \"evidence\" from leading witnesses could be extracted by any means, including threatening to torture the witnesses\u2019 wives and children.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/> The higher ranking the party member, generally the more harsh the torture that was inflicted upon him.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/> For the show trial of Hungarian Interior Minister [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], who one year earlier attempted to force a confession of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]] in his show trial, regarding \"Vladimir\" the questioner of K\u00e1d\u00e1r:<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>\n\n{{cquote|Vladimir had but one argument: blows. They had begun to beat K\u00e1d\u00e1r. They had smeared his body with mercury to prevent his pores from breathing. He had been writhing on the floor when a newcomer had arrived.

Two henchmen pried K\u00e1d\u00e1r\u2019s teeth apart, and the colonel, negligently, as if this were the most natural thing in the world, urinated into his mouth.}}\nAfter this trial, K\u00e1d\u00e1r later rose to General Secretary of the ruling [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] when [[Imre Nagy]] was executed. Once in the interrogation room, the inquisitors made no pretense about attempting to seek real evidence, making it clear that their only task was to extract a confession that would be used to convince other people of the defendant's guilt.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>  Many dedicated party members accepted the argument that they could perform one last service to the party by allowing themselves to be convicted of crimes that they had not committed.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>  Even after the party reneged on a deal that was supposed to have spared L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk, Rajk allegedly yelled just before his execution \"long live the party!\"<ref name=\"crampton265\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=265}}</ref>  For those not executed, degradation and humiliation continued for years in prison or labor camps.<ref name=\"crampton264\"/>\n\nThe evidence was often not just non-existent but absurd, with Hungarian [[George Paloczi-Horv\u00e1th]]\u2019s party interrogators delightedly exclaiming \"We knew all the time\u2014we have it here in writing\u2014that you met professor Szentgy\u00f6rgyi not in [[Istanbul]], but in [[Constantinople]].\"<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>  In another case, the Hungarian [[\u00c1VH]] secret police also condemned another party member as a Nazi accomplice with a document that had actually been previously displayed in glass cabinet of the Institute of the Working Class Movement as an example of a Gestapo forgery.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/> The trials themselves were \"shows\", with each participant having to learn a script and conduct repeated rehearsals before the performance.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>  In the Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial, when the judge skipped one of the scripted questions, the better-rehearsed Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd answered the one which should have been asked.<ref name=\"crampton265\"/>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n!<center>Some of the notable [[show trials]] in the Eastern Bloc after 1944</center>\n|-\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;background:#B0C4DE\"|Member\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Party\n!style=\"background:#B0C4DE\"|Notes\n|-\n|align=left|[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Rajk]]|| [[Hungarian Working People's Party]] || Hungarian Foreign Minister;

The latter contained every post in each country that was important to the smooth application of party policy, including military posts, administrative positions, directors of local enterprises, social organization administrators, newspapers, etc.<ref name=\"crampton249\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=249}}</ref>  In [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], the ''nomenklatura'' lists were thought to contain 100,000 post listings, while the number estimated in Poland was 2-3 times that figure.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/> The names of those that the party considered to be trustworthy enough to secure a ''nomenklatura'' post were compiled on the ''cadre'' list.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>  One did not have to be a party member to be on the cadre list, but any sign of unconventional behavior would mean exclusion from the list.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>  The considerable amount of information disseminated to the party from police or trusted observers ensured that the ''cadre'' lists were timely and comprehensive.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>  The end result was that anyone aspiring to have an influential or rewarding job had to conform to party dictates.<ref name=\"crampton249\"/>\n\n===De-Stalinization===\nSome relaxation of Soviet control occurred after Stalin's death in 1953 and the subsequent [[de-stalinization]].<ref name=\"turnock1\">{{Harvnb|Turnock|1997|p=1}}</ref> State brutality and repression waned in the Bloc.<ref name=\"roht83\"/>  The Red Army withdrew from the Balkans, though not from [[East Germany]] and countries needed for transit purposes.<ref name=\"turnock1\"/> Continuing maintenance of communist power was guaranteed by the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], such as in the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], on the grounds that a threat to the system in one country was a challenge to the alliance as a whole.<ref name=\"turnock1\"/>\n\n[[File:07Albanisch makedonische Grenze02.jpg|thumb|right|One of over 700,000 bunkers built by [[Enver Hoxha]] in [[Albania]]]]\nAs with [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]], [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] took a different course than most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc.  Because of Party of Labour of Albania First Secretary [[Enver Hoxha]]'s dogmatic Stalinist adherence, Albania broke with the Soviet Union in 1960 following the Soviet de-stalinization.<ref

China seeking close ties with the United States,<ref name=\"crampton356\"/> Albania also severed ties with China in 1978.<ref name=\"olsen19\"/>\n\n{{Main|Bunkers in Albania}}\nThe cult of personality intensified around Hoxha, who became increasingly paranoid about foreign intrigue and conspiracy.<ref name=\"olsen19\"/> Hoxha tolerated no dissent and thousands of Albanians were executed, sent to state labor camps or exiled to remote areas for work.<ref name=\"olsen20\">{{Harvnb|Olsen|2000|p=20}}</ref> After a purge in the military and the economic bureaucracy, in 1976, Albania implemented a rigidly Marxist-Leninist constitution that not only made the party the leading force in state and society, but also limited private property and forbade foreign loans.<ref

of a huge arsenal of weapons and the construction of more than 700,000 concrete military bunkers for a country with only 3 million citizens.<ref name=\"olsen19\"/>\n\n==Political repression==\n{{further|Political repression in the Soviet Union|Human rights in the Soviet Union|Soviet democracy|Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Gulag|Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc|Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|Samizdat|Sharashka}}\nWhile the initial institution of communism destroyed most of the prior institutional and organizational diversity of the Eastern Bloc countries,<ref name=\"hardt1\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=1}}</ref> communist structures existed in different manifestations of strength that also varied over time.<ref name=\"hardt18\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=18}}</ref> In such Communist systems, centralized and unelected state apparatuses, command economies, and scarcity or absence of independent civil associations specifically combined to tightly restrict the repertoire of action for those looking to defend their interests or press demands on the government.<ref name=\"sharman2\">{{Harvnb|Sharman|2003|p=2}}</ref> These features did not evolve, but rather were intentionally imposed over a relatively short span of time.<ref name=\"sharman2\"/>\n\nAs in the Soviet Union, culture was subordinated to political needs and creativity was secondary to [[socialist realism]].<ref name=\"crampton240\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=240}}</ref> The legal system and education were redesigned on Soviet lines.<ref name=\"crampton241\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=241}}</ref> In addition to emigration restrictions, civil society, defined as a domain of political action outside the party's state control, was not allowed to firmly take root, with the possible exception of [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] in the 1980s.<ref name=\"hardt18\"/>  While the institutional designs of the communist systems were based on the rejection of rule of law, the legal infrastructure was not immune to change reflecting decaying ideology and the substitution of autonomous law.<ref name=\"hardt18\"/>\n\nWhile institutional changes creating some freedoms occurred, a change toward effective [[constitutionalism]] could not occur without the collapse of the communist political regimes.<ref name=\"hardt18\"/>  Market-oriented reforms could not work without functioning markets.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/> Such systems' subordination of society was not so much the result of recurrent state triumphs over rival groups as it was intermittent state triumphs combined with state-imposed structures that broke requisite links and occupied the social space necessary for rival groups to initially form.<ref name=\"sharman3\">{{Harvnb|Sharman|2003|p=3}}</ref>\n\n===Political dissent===\n{{further|Eastern Bloc information dissemination}}\nCommunist regimes in the Eastern Bloc viewed even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the bases underlying Communist power therein.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xiv}}</ref>  The central pillar on which the monopoly power of the Communist elite was based was the belief of the administrative classes\u2014mid-level leadership cadres in the party apparatus, industry, security organs, education and state administration\u2014in the legitimacy of the Communist Party.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>  The perceived danger posed by dissidence and opposition was less that of the possible mobilization of broad open protest movements undermining a regime than that political nonconformism would undermine the reliability of the administrative classes responsible for carrying the party leadership's directives.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>\n\nAccordingly, the suppression of dissidence and opposition was viewed as a central prerequisite for the security of Communist power, though the enormous expense at which the population in certain countries were kept under secret surveillance may not have been rational.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>  The degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and time throughout the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>  Following a [[totalitarian]] initial phase, a post-totalitarian period followed the death of Stalin in which the primary method of Communist rule shifted from wide scale terror to selective repression and ideological and sociopolitical strategies of legitimation and the securing of loyalty.<ref name=\"Pollackxv\">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xv}}</ref>\n\nPost-totalitarian phase repression varied across Eastern Bloc countries according to the degree of internal coherence and the social anchoring of the Communist elites in each country.<ref name=\"Pollackxvi\">{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xvi}}</ref> Trial by jury was replaced by a tribunal of a professional judge and two lay assessors that were dependable party actors.<ref name=\"crampton247\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}</ref> The features of such Communist systems combined to structure the social and political environment to raise the cost of open protest, often to a prohibitive level.<ref name=\"sharman3\"/>  While resistance existed, it occurred mainly in the form of individual measures predicated on acceptance of the system as a whole that paradoxically often further atrophied the avenues of collective redress against the state, such as workers intentionally wasting time on the job or stealing state resources.<ref name=\"sharman3\"/>\n\n===Class categories===\nCitizens were classified by socialist origin and class, with the standard categories being: [[worker]], [[peasant]], [[intelligentsia]], [[Petty bourgeois|petty employee]], others and [[class enemies]].<ref name=\"crampton248\"/>  In order to gain a more obedient future intelligentsia, the children of class enemies were restricted to no more than primary education, while those of the fourth and fifth categories would find it difficult to gain entrance into a university.<ref name=\"crampton248\"/>  Criminal codes could also be graded on a class basis, with the class origin of the convicted determining how dangerous to society the crime had been.<ref name=\"crampton248\"/>\n\n===Broad social purges===\nIn addition to party purges, more widespread social [[purges]] occurred, and were aimed with equal or greater intensity at all levels of society.<ref name=\"crampton267\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=267}}</ref> As with the party purges, the social purges were justified theoretically by the Stalinist doctrine that the class struggle intensifies in the immediate aftermath of the socialist revolution and in the first stages of the construction of socialism.<ref name=\"crampton268\"/> Consequently, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois attitudes arose leading, for example, to the reliance upon home production and the black market in the resulting [[shortage economy|shortage economies]].<ref name=\"crampton268\"/> When added to the perceived external dangers of the [[Cold War]], and especially following the paranoia arising from the [[Tito-Stalin split]], an emphasis was put on stopping the internal dangers of petty-bourgeois activities which might foment additional resistance and popular sympathy of the masses for the west.<ref name=\"crampton269\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=269}}</ref>\n\nThese social purges constituted generalized episodes of terror intended to be seen as such in order to establish order and control.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  No person was safe from the purges' effects and denunciations were rife.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  The definitions of crime employed in such purges were broad and vague, including the possession of goods in short supply being construed as hoarding.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  It was the responsibility of all citizens to integrate into their daily lives the responsibility for administering the purges.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  A former [[People's Republic of Romania|Romanian]] [[Securitate]] leader stated:<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>{{cquote|This was achieved by a simple device: a factory, a local government department, a professional organization was given a quota of people to be weeded out, which might mean sacking, sending to the mines or

The steering committee of the organization, or the man responsible for personnel matters, knew that if they did not comply they would themselves be the victims. So they did comply, telling everybody that they saved ninety-eight good people by selecting two sacrificial lambs who were anyhow \u2018not much good\u2019, were spoiling things for everybody by working too hard, drinking too much or too little, were odd because they refused to sleep with the right person, or simply, and this was always a safe argument, were Jews.}}\n\nIn Budapest, [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, vans transported purge targets, who by 1953, numbered approximately 700,000.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  Of those, 98,000 were branded as spies and saboteurs, 5,000 of which were executed.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  In [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] between 1948 and 1954, approximately 150,000 targets were arrested.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  Similar proportions of the population suffered in other Eastern Bloc states.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>\n\n===Civil society groups===\nAs with the party purges, any institution with western connections was particularly vulnerable.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/> Eastern Bloc branches of organizations with western contacts, such as the boy scouts, the girl guides and the international federation of professional and business women, were closed.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  Churches were subjected to attack, including the Uniate church in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] and Romania, Protestants in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary.<ref name=\"crampton267\"/>  People that constituted former \"class enemies\" because of their social upbringing were at risk, as well as those with prior memberships in non-communist parties.<ref name=\"crampton268\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=268}}</ref>\n\nWhile the purges quelled outward manifestations of dissatisfaction, they also caused severe economic dislocations.<ref name=\"crampton272\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=272}}</ref>  Large construction projects were launched with insufficient capital such that unpaid prisoners were required to serve in place of modern equipment.<ref name=\"crampton272\"/> Disruption of the trained administrative and management elites also caused harm.<ref name=\"crampton272\"/> So many workers were dismissed from established professions that they had to be replaced by hastily trained younger workers that did not possess questionable class origins.<ref name=\"crampton272\"/> A Czechoslovakian noted:<ref name=\"crampton272\"/>{{cquote|The highly qualified professional people are laying roads, building bridges and operating machines, and the dumb clots\u2014whose fathers used to dig, sweep or bricklay\u2014are on top, telling the others where to lay the roads, what to produce and how to spend the country\u2019s money. The consequence is the roads look like plowed fields, we make things we can\u2019t sell and the bridges can\u2019t be used for traffic\u2026. Then they wonder why the economy is going downhill like a ten-ton lorry with the brakes off.}}\n\nThe purges often coincided with the introduction of the first ''Five Year Plans'' in the non-Soviet members of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"crampton271\"/>  The objectives of those plans were considered beyond political rapproche even where they were absurd, such that workers that did not fulfill targets were targeted and blamed for economic woes, while at the same time, the ultimate responsibility for the economic shortcomings would be placed on prominent victims of the political purge.<ref name=\"crampton271\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=271}}</ref>  In [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[Gheorghiu-Dej]] admitted that 80,000 peasants had been accused of siding with the class enemy because they resisted [[collectivization]], while purged party elite [[Ana Pauker]] was blamed for this \"distortion\".<ref name=\"crampton271\"/>\n\nIn addition, sizable resources were employed in the purge, such as in Hungary, where almost one million adults were employed to record, control, indoctrinate, spy on and sometimes kill targets of the purge.<ref name=\"crampton272\"/> Unlike the repressions under Nazi occupation, no ongoing war existed that could bring an end to the tribulations of the Eastern Bloc, and morale severely suffered as a consequence.<ref name=\"crampton273\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=273}}</ref>  Because the party later had to admit the mistakes of much that occurred during the purges after [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, the purges also destroyed the moral base upon which the party operated.<ref name=\"crampton273\"/>  In doing so, the party abrogated its prior Leninist claim to moral infallibility for the working class.<ref name=\"crampton273\"/>\n\n==Secret police==\n[[File:SovietPrisonDoorsTallinn.JPG|thumb|KGB prison doors on display in the Museum of Occupations, Tallinn, Estonia.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-33349-0002, Neustrelitz, Jahrestag der DDR, Volkspolizei.jpg|thumb|Officers of the East German [[Volkspolizei]] parading through the streets of Neustrelitz in 1955.

The [[East Germany|East German]] [[Stasi]] became the Soviet [[KGB]]'s most important surrogate following Lenin's statement that \"the principal link in the chain of revolution is the German link, and the success of world revolution depends more on Germany than upon any other country.\"<ref name=\"koehler30\"/> In 1947, Stalin told Edvard Kardelj, then prime minister of Yugoslavia, \"We Russians will never get out of Germany.\"<ref name=\"koehler30\"/>  The [[NKVD]] at first maintained a number of former [[Nazi]] concentration camps, such as Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen, to house former Nazis.<ref name=\"koehler31\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=31}}</ref>  After the forced merger of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] thousands of anti-Nazi social democrats and communists that opposed the merger also ended up in those camps.<ref name=\"koehler31\"/> [[Erich Mielke]], a key operator for the Soviets after the war, built the Stasi into a vast secret police and espionage organization.<ref name=\"koehler31\"/> Mielke became the longest-serving state security chief in the Eastern bloc, and his relationship with the Soviet secret police dated back to 1931, when he had fled Germany for Moscow after murdering two Berlin policemen.<ref name=\"koehler31\"/>  Although Mielke's Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957, until 1990 the KGB continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates, each with his own office inside the Stasi's Berlin compound, and in each of the fifteen Stasi district headquarters around East Germany.<ref name=\"koehler74\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=74}}</ref>  Collaboration was so close that the KGB invited the Stasi to establish operational bases in Moscow and Leningrad to monitor visiting East German tourists and Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as \"Chekists of the Soviet Union.\"<ref name=\"koehler74\"/>  In 1978, Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers they enjoyed in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"koehler74\"/>\n\nAll information acquired worldwide by the intelligence and security services in the Eastern bloc was stored in the Soviet computer [[SOUD]] (''System of Joint Acquisition of Enemy Data'').<ref name=\"koehler80\"/> The SOUD became a valuable KGB asset for the Stasi.<ref name=\"koehler80\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=80}}</ref> Stasi engineers had actually created the system using stolen and illegally obtained Western technology, but the Soviets insisted that it be based in Moscow.<ref name=\"koehler80\"/>\n\n===Stasi operations===\n[[File:GDR Stasi Mikrofone Sennheiser.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stasi]] construction bugs employed in new buildings]]\n[[File:GDR Stasi Camera.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stasi]] quiet camera that could take pictures through a 1mm hole in a wall]]\n[[File:GDR Stasi Dep M 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stasi]] automated machine to reglue envelopes after mail had been opened for examination]]\n\nThe Stasi employed 120,000 full-time agents and an official estimate of 100,000 informants to monitor a country that possessed only 16 million inhabitants.<ref name=\"philipsen10\">{{Harvnb|Philipsen|1993|p=10}}</ref>  Between 1950 and 1989, the Stasi employed a total of 274,000 persons.<ref name=\"koehler8\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=8}}</ref>  In terms of total ''inoffizielle Mitarbeiter'' (IMs) Stasi informants, by 1995, 174,000 had been identified, which approximated 2.5% of East Germany's population between the ages of 18 and 60.<ref name=\"koehler8\"/> While these calculations were from official records, because many such records were destroyed, there were likely closer to 500,000 Stasi informers.<ref name=\"koehler8\"/> A former Stasi colonel estimated that the figure could be as high as 2 million if occasional informants were included.<ref name=\"koehler8\"/>\n\nThe result was a society in which residents often did not know whom to trust, and in which few attempted to share their private thoughts with anyone but close friends or colleagues.<ref name=\"philipsen10\"/> A popular saying in East Germany was that whenever three people engaged in a conversation, one was bound to be a Stasi informant.<ref name=\"philipsen10\"/>   Stasi efforts with one agent per 166 citizens dwarfed, for example, the [[Nazi]] [[Gestapo]], which employed only 40,000 officials to watch a population of 80 million (one officer per 2,000 citizens) and the Soviet [[KGB]], which employed 480,000 full-time agents to oversee a nation of 280 million residents (one agent per 5,830 citizens).<ref name=\"koehler9\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=9}}</ref>  When informants were included, the Stasi had one spy per 66 citizens of East Germany.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/>  When part-time informer adults were included, the figures reached approximately one spy per 6.5 citizens.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/>\n\nFull-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants and one tenant in every apartment building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the [[Volkspolizei]] (Vopo).<ref name=\"koehler9\"/> Spies reported every relative or friend that stayed the night at another's apartment.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/> Tiny holes were bored in apartment and hotel room walls through which Stasi agents filmed citizens with special video cameras.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/> Similarly, schools, universities, and hospitals were extensively infiltrated.<ref name=\"koehler9\"/>\n\nPolitical offenses usually came under broad crimes such as \"Treasonable Relaying of Information\", \"Treasonable Agent Activity\" and \"Interference in Activities of the State or Society.\"<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> Defendants usually were persons who had requested (nominally) legal exit permits from East Germany or contacted a Western consulate to inquire about emigration procedures.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> Sentences of up to two and a half years' hard labor were not unusual as punishment for such inquiries.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> Those accused of \"propaganda hostile to the state\" could be those that once stated that it was not necessary to station tanks at the border, referred to border fortifications as \"nonsense\" or received [[West German]] television programs and relayed the contents to others.<ref name=\"koehler19\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=19}}</ref> Writing to friends in the west about wishes to emigrate, which the Stasi could intercept, could draw a conviction for \"establishing illegal contacts.\"<ref name=\"koehler19\"/>  In addition, it was a crime to fail to denounce fellow citizens, such as informers who failed to report friends stating they wished to escape to the west.<ref name=\"koehler19\"/>  After the mid-1950s, Stasi executions were carried out in strict secrecy, usually by guillotine and, in later years, by a single pistol shot to the neck.<ref name=\"koehler18\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=18}}</ref> In most instances, the relatives of the executed were not informed of either the sentence or the execution.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/> The corpses were cremated and the ashes buried secretly, sometimes at construction sites.<ref name=\"koehler18\"/>\n\nThe Stasi also focused upon the allies of the ruling communist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]].<ref name=\"koehler127\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=127}}</ref> For example, during the Soviet-backed forced merger of the SED, the Stasi arrested 5,000 [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] members that disapproved of the merger.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>  400 died from a mix of executions, malnutrition or disappearing.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>  200 of them were later sentenced to a total of 10,000 years jail time.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>  Until 1950, all such sentences were pronounced by Soviet military tribunals in trials that lasted no more than ten minutes each.<ref name=\"koehler127\"/>\n\nWhile the Stasi had only 4,000 members in 1953, it grew considerably over the years to 52,707 in 1973.<ref name=\"koehler142\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=142}}</ref>  Its ranks swelled much more quickly after [[Eastern Bloc]] countries signed the 1975 [[Helsinki accords]], which [[Erich Honecker]] viewed as a grave threat to his regime because they contained language binding signatories to respect \"human and basic rights,   including freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and conviction.<ref name=\"koehler142\"/>  Stasi size was immediately increased by 10,000.<ref name=\"koehler142\"/> Mielke was accorded new, wide-ranging powers while the Stasi became the leadership's instrument of power to an extent not seen in the Eastern Bloc since [[Stalin's death]], with

name=\"koehler78\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=78}}</ref>  All telephone, telegraph and mail traffic in and out of Poland was put under Stasi control, while a massive Stasi Tenth Department of the Second Main Directorate (counterintelligence) was created to monitor Poland.<ref name=\"koehler79\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=79}}</ref>  With worries throughout the Eastern Bloc of a possible collapse if communism fell in any country, the Stasi Tenth Department dispatched operational groups to [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] and [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]].<ref name=\"koehler79\"/>  The Tenth Department, however, could not monitor the large number of discontented citizens in the Eastern Bloc in the late 1980s, with the first significant breach coming Hungary when the government therein ordered the dismantling of fortifications and barbed wire barriers along its border with Austria in August 1989.<ref name=\"koehler79\"/> Word spread rapidly to East Germany, where thousands seeking freedom poured into Hungary.<ref name=\"koehler79\"/>  Hungary ignored Stasi threats regarding closure of the border.<ref name=\"koehler79\"/>  Thereafter, the battle was effectively lost, with East Germany beginning the dismantling of the [[Berlin Wall]] months later.<ref name=\"koehler79\"/>\n\nBefore German unification, the last East German government ordered the burning of thousands of Stasi computer records to attempt to protect against later prosecution.<ref name=\"koehler20\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=20}}</ref>  In addition, they shredded thousands of espionage files and placed the remains in 172,000 paper sacks.<ref name=\"koehler20\"/>  Examination of what remains of the vast Stasi files is difficult because of their enormous size.<ref

German]] government occurred weekly.<ref name=\"koehler150\">{{Harvnb|Koehler|2000|p=150}}</ref> It became clear that the entire West German government had been infested by the East German spy organization, as was every political party, West Germany's industry, banks, the church, and the news media.<ref name=\"koehler150\"/> One female Stasi mole in the BND, an East German agent for seventeen years, had been entrusted with the job of preparing the daily secret intelligence summary for West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]].<ref name=\"koehler150\"/>  Stasi archivists estimate that at least 20,000 West Germans had spied for the Stasi and that that estimate may be conservative.<ref name=\"koehler150\"/>  After German reunification, the examination by former targets of their

When he declared bankruptcy in 1798, the land was surrendered to the [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]]. A French sea captain named [[Stephen Girard]] purchased Morris' lands for $30,000, including 68 tracts east of Morris'. He had learned that there was [[anthracite]] coal in the region.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe Centralia coal deposits were largely overlooked before the construction of the Mine Run Railroad in 1854. In 1832, Johnathan Faust opened the Bull's Head Tavern in what was called [[Roaring Creek Township, Pennsylvania|Roaring Creek Township]]; this gave the town its first name, Bull's Head. In 1842, Centralia's land was bought by the Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Alexander Rae, a mining engineer, moved his family in and began planning a village, laying out streets and lots for development. Rae named the town Centreville, but in 1865 changed it to Centralia because the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office]] already had a Centreville in Schuylkill County. The Mine Run Railroad was built in 1854 to transport coal out of the valley.<ref name=\"DeKok\">{{cite book |title=Unseen Danger; A Tragedy of People, Government, and the Centralia Mine Fire |last=DeKok |first=David |year=1986 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-595-09270-3 |page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== Mining begins ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Censign.jpg|thumb|220px]]\n\nThe first two mines in Centralia opened in 1856, the Locust Run Mine and the Coal Ridge Mine. Afterward came the Hazeldell Colliery Mine in 1860, the Centralia Mine in 1862, and the Continental Mine in 1863. The Continental was located on Stephen Girard's former estate. Branching from the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], the [[Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad]] was constructed to Centralia in 1865; it enabled transport and expansion of Centralia's coal sales to markets in eastern Pennsylvania.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nCentralia was incorporated as a borough in 1866. Its principal employer was the [[anthracite coal]] industry. Alexander Rae, the town's founder, was murdered in his buggy by members of the [[Molly Maguires]] on October 17, 1868, during a trip between Centralia and [[Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania|Mount Carmel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.bloomu.edu/Archives/SC/MollieMaguires/mollieindex.htm|title=The Murder of Alexander W. Rea|publisher=}}</ref> Three men were eventually convicted of his death and were hanged in the county seat of [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]], on March 25, 1878.\n\nSeveral other murders and incidents of arson also took place during the violence, as Centralia was a hotbed of Molly Maguires activity during the 1860s to organize a mineworkers union in order to improve wages and working conditions. A legend among locals in Centralia tells that Father Daniel Ignatius McDermott, the first [[Roman Catholic]] priest to call Centralia home, cursed the land in retaliation for being assaulted by three members of the Maguires in 1869. McDermott said that there would be a day when St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church would be the only structure remaining in Centralia. Many of the Molly Maguires' leaders were hanged in 1877, ending their crimes. Legends say that a number of descendants of the Molly Maguires still lived in Centralia up until the 1980s.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nAccording to numbers of Federal census records, the town of Centralia reached its maximum population of 2,761 in 1890. At its peak, the town had seven churches, five hotels, 27 saloons, two theaters, a bank, a post office, and 14 general and grocery stores. Thirty-seven years later the production of anthracite coal had reached its peak in Pennsylvania. In the following years, production declined, as many young miners from Centralia enlisted in the military when the US entered [[World War I]].\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] resulted in the Lehigh Valley Coal Company closing five of its Centralia-local mines. Bootleg miners continued mining in several idle mines, using techniques such as what was called \"pillar-robbing,\" where miners would extract coal from coal pillars left in mines to support their roofs. This caused the collapse of many idle mines, further complicating the prevention of the mine fire in 1962. Efforts to seal off the abandoned mines ran into the collapsed areas.\n\nIn 1950, Centralia Council acquired the rights to all anthracite coal beneath Centralia through a state law passed in 1949 that enabled the transaction. That year, the federal census counted 1,986 residents in Centralia.\n\n[[Coal mining]] continued in Centralia until the 1960s, when most of the companies shut down. [[Bootleg mining]] continued until 1982, and [[Strip mining|strip]] and [[open-pit mining]] are still active in the area. An underground mine about three miles to the west employs about 40 people.\n[[Image:PA CENTRALIA OLD.PNG|thumb|right|Centralia area showing conditions before mine fire]]\n\nRail service ended in 1966. Centralia operated its own school district, including elementary schools and a high school. There were also two [[Catholic school|Catholic parochial schools]]. By 1980, it had 1,012 residents. Another 500 or 600 lived nearby.<ref name=\"Krajick\" />\n\n=== Mine fire ===\n{{Main|Centralia mine fire}}\n[[Image:Old Mine Fire 1969.jpg|thumb|right|A small part of the Centralia mine fire as it appeared after being exposed during an excavation in 1969]]\n\n====Triggers====\nAnalysts disagree about the specific cause of the Centralia fire. David Dekok, author of ''Fire Underground: The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire'', concluded that it started with an attempt to clean up the town landfill. In May 1962, the Centralia Borough Council hired five members of the volunteer fire company to clean up the town landfill, located in an abandoned [[surface mining|strip-mine pit]] next to the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] Cemetery just outside the borough limits. This had been done prior to [[Memorial Day]] in previous years, when the landfill was in a different location.\n\nOn May 27, 1962, the firefighters, as they had in the past, set the dump on fire and let it burn for some time. Unlike in previous years, however, the fire was not fully extinguished. An unsealed opening in the pit allowed the fire to enter the labyrinth of abandoned coal mines beneath Centralia.<ref>David Dekok, 'Unseen Danger'' and successor edition, ''Fire Underground: The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire''</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nBy contrast, other sources<ref>{{cite web|last=Quigley|first=Joan|title=''The Day the Earth Caved In'' |url=http://www.thedaytheearthcavedin.com/|accessdate=2020-03-13|page=8|format=www|year=2007}}</ref> claim that the fire had started the previous day, when a trash hauler dumped hot ash or coal discarded from coal burners into the open trash pit. She noted that borough council minutes from June 4, 1962, referred to ''two'' fires at the dump and that five firefighters had submitted bills for \"fighting the fire at the landfill area.\" The borough, by law, was responsible for installing a fire-resistant clay barrier between each layer of the landfill,<ref>{{cite web|title=Abandoned Mines in Pennsylvania|url=http://www.mbm-law.net/newsletter-articles/subsidence-abandoned-mines-in-pennsylvania/1224/|website=Maiello, Brungo & Maiello|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}</ref> but fell behind schedule, leaving the barrier incomplete. This allowed the hot coals to penetrate the vein of coal underneath the pit and start the subsequent subterranean fire.<ref name=\"Quigley\">{{cite book |last=Quigley |first=Joan |title=The Day the Earth Caved In: An American Mining Tragedy |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |url=https://archive.org/details/dayearthcavedina00quig |isbn=978-1-4000-6180-8 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Quigley |first=Joan |title=Chapter Notes to ''The Day the Earth Caved In'' |url=http://www.thedaytheearthcavedin.com/chapter_notes_2007.doc |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |page=8 |format=DOC |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother theory proposes that the Bast Colliery fire of 1932 was never fully extinguished, and that fire reached the landfill area by 1962; however, a miner named Frank Jurgill Sr. disputes that theory. Jurgill claims he operated a [[Bootleg mining|bootleg mine]] with his brother near the landfill from 1960 to 1962. If the Bast Colliery fire had not been extinguished, the brothers would likely have been overcome or killed by the noxious gases via many interconnected tunnels in the area.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Immediate effects====\nIn 1979, locals became aware of the scale of the problem when a gas-station owner, then-mayor John Coddington, inserted a dipstick into one of his underground tanks to check the fuel level. When he withdrew it, it seemed hot. He lowered a thermometer into the tank on a string and was shocked to discover that the temperature of the gasoline in the tank was {{Convert|172|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1|lk=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2014/06/04/centralia_a_town_in_pennsylvania_destroyed_by_a_mine_fire.html |title=How an Underground Fire Destroyed an Entire Town |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=August 2, 2014 |last=Morton |first=Ella}}</ref>\n\nStatewide attention to the fire began to increase, culminating in 1981 when a 12-year-old resident named Todd Domboski fell into a [[sinkhole]], {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide by {{Convert|150|ft|m}} deep, that suddenly opened beneath his feet in a backyard. His cousin, 14-year-old Eric Wolfgang, pulled Domboski out of the hole and saved his life. The plume of hot steam billowing from the hole was tested and found to contain a lethal level of [[carbon monoxide]].<ref name=\"csmonitor\">{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Bright-Green/2010/0205/Centralia-Pa.-How-an-underground-coal-fire-erased-a-town |title=Centralia, Pa.: How an underground coal fire erased a town |work=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=August 5, 2013 |first=Eoin |last=O'Carroll}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there was physical, visible evidence of the fire, residents of Centralia were bitterly divided over the question of whether or not the fire posed a direct threat to the town. In ''The Real Disaster is Above Ground,'' Steve Kroll-Smith and Steve Couch identified at least six community groups, each organized around varying interpretations of the amount and kind of risk posed by the fire. In 1983, the [[U.S. Congress]] allocated more than $42 million for relocation efforts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Amos|first1=Owen|title=The church that thrives in a ghost town|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42781736|accessdate=25 January 2018|work=BBC News|date=25 January 2018}}</ref> Nearly all of the residents accepted the government's buyout offers. More than 1,000 people moved out of the town and 500 structures were demolished.

In 1770, during the construction of the Reading Road, which stretched from [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] to Fort Augusta (present-day [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania|Sunbury]]), settlers surveyed and explored the land.

When he declared bankruptcy in 1798, the land was surrendered to the [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]]. A French sea captain named [[Stephen Girard]] purchased Morris' lands for $30,000, including 68 tracts east of Morris'. He had learned that there was [[anthracite]] coal in the region.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nThe Centralia coal deposits were largely overlooked before the construction of the Mine Run Railroad in 1854. In 1832, Johnathan Faust opened the Bull's Head Tavern in what was called [[Roaring Creek Township, Pennsylvania|Roaring Creek Township]]; this gave the town its first name, Bull's Head. In 1842, Centralia's land was bought by the Locust Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Alexander Rae, a mining engineer, moved his family in and began planning a village, laying out streets and lots for development. Rae named the town Centreville, but in 1865 changed it to Centralia because the [[United States Post Office Department|U.S. Post Office]] already had a Centreville in Schuylkill County. The Mine Run Railroad was built in 1854 to transport coal out of the valley.<ref name=\"DeKok\">{{cite book |title=Unseen Danger; A Tragedy of People, Government, and the Centralia Mine Fire |last=DeKok |first=David |year=1986 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-595-09270-3 |page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== Mining begins ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Censign.jpg|thumb|220px]]\n\nThe first two mines in Centralia opened in 1856, the Locust Run Mine and the Coal Ridge Mine. Afterward came the Hazeldell Colliery Mine in 1860, the Centralia Mine in 1862, and the Continental Mine in 1863. The Continental was located on Stephen Girard's former estate. Branching from the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], the [[Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad]] was constructed to Centralia in 1865; it enabled transport and expansion of Centralia's coal sales to markets in eastern Pennsylvania.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nCentralia was incorporated as a borough in 1866. Its principal employer was the [[anthracite coal]] industry. Alexander Rae, the town's founder, was murdered in his buggy by members of the [[Molly Maguires]] on October 17, 1868, during a trip between Centralia and [[Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania|Mount Carmel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.bloomu.edu/Archives/SC/MollieMaguires/mollieindex.htm|title=The Murder of Alexander W. Rea|publisher=}}</ref> Three men were eventually convicted of his death and were hanged in the county seat of [[Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania|Bloomsburg]], on March 25, 1878.\n\nSeveral other murders and incidents of arson also took place during the violence, as Centralia was a hotbed of Molly Maguires activity during the 1860s to organize a mineworkers union in order to improve wages and working conditions. A legend among locals in Centralia tells that Father Daniel Ignatius McDermott, the first [[Roman Catholic]] priest to call Centralia home, cursed the land in retaliation for being assaulted by three members of the Maguires in 1869. McDermott said that there would be a day when St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church would be the only structure remaining in Centralia. Many of the Molly Maguires' leaders were hanged in 1877, ending their crimes. Legends say that a number of descendants of the Molly Maguires still lived in Centralia up until the 1980s.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nAccording to numbers of Federal census records, the town of Centralia reached its maximum population of 2,761 in 1890. At its peak, the town had seven churches, five hotels, 27 saloons, two theaters, a bank, a post office, and 14 general and grocery stores. Thirty-seven years later the production of anthracite coal had reached its peak in Pennsylvania. In the following years, production declined, as many young miners from Centralia enlisted in the military when the US entered [[World War I]].\n\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] resulted in the Lehigh Valley Coal Company closing five of its Centralia-local mines. Bootleg miners continued mining in several idle mines, using techniques such as what was called \"pillar-robbing,\" where miners would extract coal from coal pillars left in mines to support their roofs. This caused the collapse of many idle mines, further complicating the prevention of the mine fire in 1962. Efforts to seal off the abandoned mines ran into the collapsed areas.\n\nIn 1950, Centralia Council acquired the rights to all anthracite coal beneath Centralia through a state law passed in 1949 that enabled the transaction. That year, the federal census counted 1,986 residents in Centralia.\n\n[[Coal mining]] continued in Centralia until the 1960s, when most of the companies shut down. [[Bootleg mining]] continued until 1982, and [[Strip mining|strip]] and [[open-pit mining]] are still active in the area. An underground mine about three miles to the west employs about 40 people.\n[[Image:PA CENTRALIA OLD.PNG|thumb|right|Centralia area showing conditions before mine fire]]\n\nRail service ended in 1966. Centralia operated its own school district, including elementary schools and a high school. There were also two [[Catholic school|Catholic parochial schools]]. By 1980, it had 1,012 residents. Another 500 or 600 lived nearby.<ref name=\"Krajick\" />\n\n=== Mine fire ===\n{{Main|Centralia mine fire}}\n[[Image:Old Mine Fire 1969.jpg|thumb|right|A small part of the Centralia mine fire as it appeared after being exposed during an excavation in 1969]]\n\n====Triggers====\nAnalysts disagree about the specific cause of the Centralia fire. David Dekok, author of ''Fire Underground: The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire'', concluded that it started with an attempt to clean up the town landfill. In May 1962, the Centralia Borough Council hired five members of the volunteer fire company to clean up the town landfill, located in an abandoned [[surface mining|strip-mine pit]] next to the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows|Odd Fellows]] Cemetery just outside the borough limits. This had been done prior to [[Memorial Day]] in previous years, when the landfill was in a different location.\n\nOn May 27, 1962, the firefighters, as they had in the past, set the dump on fire and let it burn for some time. Unlike in previous years, however, the fire was not fully extinguished. An unsealed opening in the pit allowed the fire to enter the labyrinth of abandoned coal mines beneath Centralia.<ref>David Dekok, 'Unseen Danger'' and successor edition, ''Fire Underground: The Ongoing Tragedy of the Centralia Mine Fire''</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nBy contrast, other sources<ref>{{cite web|last=Quigley|first=Joan|title=''The Day the Earth Caved In'' |url=http://www.thedaytheearthcavedin.com/|accessdate=2020-03-13|page=8|format=www|year=2007}}</ref> claim that the fire had started the previous day, when a trash hauler dumped hot ash or coal discarded from coal burners into the open trash pit. She noted that borough council minutes from June 4, 1962, referred to ''two'' fires at the dump and that five firefighters had submitted bills for \"fighting the fire at the landfill area.\" The borough, by law, was responsible for installing a fire-resistant clay barrier between each layer of the landfill,<ref>{{cite web|title=Abandoned Mines in Pennsylvania|url=http://www.mbm-law.net/newsletter-articles/subsidence-abandoned-mines-in-pennsylvania/1224/|website=Maiello, Brungo & Maiello|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}</ref> but fell behind schedule, leaving the barrier incomplete. This allowed the hot coals to penetrate the vein of coal underneath the pit and start the subsequent subterranean fire.<ref name=\"Quigley\">{{cite book |last=Quigley |first=Joan |title=The Day the Earth Caved In: An American Mining Tragedy |location=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |url=https://archive.org/details/dayearthcavedina00quig |isbn=978-1-4000-6180-8 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Quigley |first=Joan |title=Chapter Notes to ''The Day the Earth Caved In'' |url=http://www.thedaytheearthcavedin.com/chapter_notes_2007.doc |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |page=8 |format=DOC |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother theory proposes that the Bast Colliery fire of 1932 was never fully extinguished, and that fire reached the landfill area by 1962; however, a miner named Frank Jurgill Sr. disputes that theory. Jurgill claims he operated a [[Bootleg mining|bootleg mine]] with his brother near the landfill from 1960 to 1962. If the Bast Colliery fire had not been extinguished, the brothers would likely have been overcome or killed by the noxious gases via many interconnected tunnels in the area.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Immediate effects====\nIn 1979, locals became aware of the scale of the problem when a gas-station owner, then-mayor John Coddington, inserted a dipstick into one of his underground tanks to check the fuel level. When he withdrew it, it seemed hot. He lowered a thermometer into the tank on a string and was shocked to discover that the temperature of the gasoline in the tank was {{Convert|172|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|1|lk=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2014/06/04/centralia_a_town_in_pennsylvania_destroyed_by_a_mine_fire.html |title=How an Underground Fire Destroyed an Entire Town |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=August 2, 2014 |last=Morton |first=Ella}}</ref>\n\nStatewide attention to the fire began to increase, culminating in 1981 when a 12-year-old resident named Todd Domboski fell into a [[sinkhole]], {{convert|4|ft|m}} wide by {{Convert|150|ft|m}} deep, that suddenly opened beneath his feet in a backyard. His cousin, 14-year-old Eric Wolfgang, pulled Domboski out of the hole and saved his life.

Several signs warn of underground fire, unstable ground, and dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Additional smoke and steam can be seen coming from an abandoned portion of [[Pennsylvania Route 61]], the area just behind the hilltop cemetery, and other cracks in the ground scattered about the area. Route 61 was repaired several times until it was closed.\n\nThe current route was formerly a detour around the damaged portion during the repairs and became a permanent route in 1993; mounds of dirt were placed at both ends of the former route, effectively blocking the road. Pedestrian traffic is still possible due to a small opening about two feet wide at the north side of the road. The underground fire is still burning and may continue to do so for 250 years.<ref name=\"csmonitor\"/>  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania did not renew the relocation contract at the end of 2005.<ref>''[[Reading Eagle]]'', January 3, 2006</ref>\n\nThe last remaining house on Locust Avenue was demolished in September 2007. It was notable for a period for the five chimney-like support [[buttress]]es along each of two opposite sides of the house. The house had formerly been supported by a row of adjacent buildings. Another house with similar buttresses was visible from the northern side of the cemetery, just north of the burning, partially subsumed hillside.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offroaders.com/album/centralia/ghosttown.htm |title=A modern day Ghost Town, Centralia Pennsylvania |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nResidents John Comarnisky and John Lokitis, Jr. were evicted in May and July 2009, respectively.
