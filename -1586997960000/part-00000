It is located in the northeastern tip of the county, on the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of [[Long Island]]. The population was 21,968 at the 2010 census. The town also contains a [[Political subdivisions of New York State#Hamlet|hamlet]] named [[Southold (CDP), New York|Southold]], which was settled in 1640.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Southold NY Presby PHS831.jpg|thumb|left|Southold Presbyterian Church and Founders' Monument, Southold, N.Y.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Southold_NY_Presby_PHS831.jpg Presbyterian Historical Society, Wikimedia Commons]</ref>]]\n\nAlgonquian-speaking tribes, related to those in New England across Long Island Sound, lived in eastern Long Island before European colonization. The western portion of the island was occupied by bands of [[Lenape]], whose language was also one of the [[Algonquian languages]].\n\nIn surrounding areas, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonists had established early settlements to the northwest: on the upper Hudson River was [[Fort Orange]], founded in 1615 (later renamed [[Albany, New York|Albany]] by the English); and New Amsterdam (later renamed [[Manhattan]]) in 1625. [[Lion Gardiner]] established a manor on [[Gardiners Island]] in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] in 1639. Just across from Long Island, the [[Connecticut Colony]], or Connecticut River Colony, was established in 1636.  The [[Puritan]]s established New Haven Colony separately in 1638, even though it was largely surrounded by Connecticut Colony. [[New Haven Colony]] was a theocracy, governed only by church members.\n\nEnglish [[Puritans]] from [[New Haven Colony]] settled in Southold on October 21, 1640. They had purchased the land in the summer of 1640 from the group of Indians related to the [[Pequot]] of New England, who lived in the territory they called ''Corchaug'' (now Cutchogue){{Where|date=December 2017|reason= Long Island?}}. Settlers spelled the Indian name of what became Southold as ''Yennicott''.  In most histories Southold is reported as the first English settlement on [[Long Island]] in the future [[New York State]]. Under the leadership of the Reverend [[John Youngs]], with Peter Hallock, the settlement consisted of the families of Barnabas Horton, John Budd, John Conklin, John Swazy, William Wells, and John Tuthill.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1650, the [[Treaty of Hartford (1650)|Treaty of Hartford]] established a boundary between Dutch and English claims{{clarify|date=December 2017|reason=Which claims?}} roughly through Oyster Bay on the North Shore. The Dutch colony was the western part of Long Island, and the English dominated the east. The population of Southold at that point was about 180. The harbor at [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport]], on the North Fork, became important in trade, fishing, and [[whaling]], because it rarely froze over. Settlers developed the interior land for agricultural purposes.\n\nBoth New Haven Colony and Connecticut Colony had sought to establish Southold as a [[theocracy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The New Haven Colony did not permit other churches to operate at all, while the Connecticut Colony allowed freedom of religion. New Haven supervised Southold until 1662, when New Haven towns began shifting their allegiance to the surrounding Connecticut Colony.  By 1664, New Haven colonists all had decided to join Connecticut, and the New Haven colony ceased to exist.  Southold was supervised by the [[Connecticut Colony]] until 1674.\n\nWhen the Dutch took control of the [[colony of New York]] in 1673, the English-settled eastern towns, including Southold, East Hampton, and Southampton, refused to submit; the Dutch attempted to force the matter by arms, and the colonists of the towns repelled them, with assistance from Connecticut. When New York was retaken by the English in 1674, these eastern towns preferred to stay part of Connecticut. Although Connecticut agreed, the government of [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] forced the matter for them to be part of the Province of New York. Governor Sir [[Edmund Andros]] threatened to eliminate the residents' rights to land if they did not yield, which they did by 1676.<ref>Richard Mather Bayles, ''Sketches of Suffolk County, Historical and Descriptive, with a Historical Outline of Long Island'', 1874</ref> The Duke of York had a grudge against Connecticut. New Haven had hidden three of the judges who sentenced his father [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to death in 1649.\n\nThe town called as its second minister Rev. Joshua Hobart, a [[Harvard College|Harvard]] graduate from [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], and son of Rev. Peter Hobart. The latter was the founding minister of [[Old Ship Church]], the nation's oldest church in continuous use.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BlgVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA173&dq=%22joshua+hobart%22+hingham&ei=u4wgSfjlLIWekwT4ycG5C Epher Whitaker, ''A History of Southold, L.I.''], Orange, NJ: Press of the Orange Chronicle, 1881</ref> Rev.

[[John Youngs]], the minister who was one of the founders of the Town, was born and brought up in Southwold, England. Youngs was a member of St. Margaret's Church in nearby [[Reydon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BlgVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=southold+history&ei=L7AgSdGFA5O2kwSg_umICQ#PPA23,M1 Epher Whittaker, ''History of Southold, L.I.: Its First Century''], Southold, Printed for the Author, 1881</ref>  Within the Town's limits is an area known as [[Reydon Shores, New York|Reydon Shores]], perhaps a reference to the Reydon, England known by Youngs. The Town's name also may refer to a \"holding\" to the south [of New Haven]), from whence the original settlers hailed.\n\nIn the meantime, the population of Southold grew from 180 in 1650 to 880 by 1698.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Long Island Rail Road]] extended its line on the North Shore to Greenport. This enabled summer vacationers to travel to the destination by train. Due to the light on the North Fork from water on both sides, the area attracted many artists, including [[William Merritt Chase]].\n\nThe area was agricultural, and long dominated by for potato farming. In the late 20th century, large areas of the North Fork were redeveloped as vineyards. This area of Long Island has developed a respectable wine industry. In November 1994, the village of [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport]] voted to [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York#Police department disbanded|abolish its police department]] and contract with the [[Southold Town Police Department|Southold Town Police]] for law enforcement.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is at the northeastern end of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on a [[peninsula]] called the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] and its extensions [[Plum Island (New York)|Plum Island]], and [[Fishers Island]]. The [[Long Island Sound]] separates the town from [[Connecticut]]. The eastern end of the peninsula, near [[Orient Point]], is north of the [[Shelter Island (town), New York|Town of Shelter Island]], but the town is separated from the [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York|South Fork]] of Long Island by the Great Peconic Bay and the Little Peconic Bay. The western end of the town is the border of the [[Riverhead, New York|Town of Riverhead]]. It is twenty-one miles from Orient Point to the border with Riverhead. [[Robins Island]], a protected open space in Great Peconic Bay, is also part of the Town of Southold.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Town of Southold Local Waterfront Revitalization Program: Southold LWRP Maps|year=2003|publisher=Division of Coastal Resources, New York State Department of State|url=http://docs.dos.ny.gov/communitieswaterfronts/LWRP/Southold_T/Amendment1/Final/Maps/Southold%20LWRP%20Maps.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218015450/http://docs.dos.ny.gov/communitieswaterfronts/LWRP/Southold_T/Amendment1/Final/Maps/Southold%20LWRP%20Maps.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 404.5&nbsp;square miles (1,047.6&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which, 53.7&nbsp;square miles (139.1&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 350.8&nbsp;square miles (908.5&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it (86%) is water.

It is located in the northeastern tip of the county, on the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] of [[Long Island]]. The population was 21,968 at the 2010 census. The town also contains a [[Political subdivisions of New York State#Hamlet|hamlet]] named [[Southold (CDP), New York|Southold]], which was settled in 1640.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Southold NY Presby PHS831.jpg|thumb|left|Southold Presbyterian Church and Founders' Monument, Southold, N.Y.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Southold_NY_Presby_PHS831.jpg Presbyterian Historical Society, Wikimedia Commons]</ref>]]\n\nAlgonquian-speaking tribes, related to those in New England across Long Island Sound, lived in eastern Long Island before European colonization. The western portion of the island was occupied by bands of [[Lenape]], whose language was also one of the [[Algonquian languages]].\n\nIn surrounding areas, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonists had established early settlements to the northwest: on the upper Hudson River was [[Fort Orange]], founded in 1615 (later renamed [[Albany, New York|Albany]] by the English); and New Amsterdam (later renamed [[Manhattan]]) in 1625. [[Lion Gardiner]] established a manor on [[Gardiners Island]] in [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] in 1639. Just across from Long Island, the [[Connecticut Colony]], or Connecticut River Colony, was established in 1636.  The [[Puritan]]s established New Haven Colony separately in 1638, even though it was largely surrounded by Connecticut Colony. [[New Haven Colony]] was a theocracy, governed only by church members.\n\nEnglish [[Puritans]] from [[New Haven Colony]] settled in Southold on October 21, 1640. They had purchased the land in the summer of 1640 from the group of Indians related to the [[Pequot]] of New England, who lived in the territory they called ''Corchaug'' (now Cutchogue){{Where|date=December 2017|reason= Long Island?}}. Settlers spelled the Indian name of what became Southold as ''Yennicott''.  In most histories Southold is reported as the first English settlement on [[Long Island]] in the future [[New York State]]. Under the leadership of the Reverend [[John Youngs]], with Peter Hallock, the settlement consisted of the families of Barnabas Horton, John Budd, John Conklin, John Swazy, William Wells, and John Tuthill.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn 1650, the [[Treaty of Hartford (1650)|Treaty of Hartford]] established a boundary between Dutch and English claims{{clarify|date=December 2017|reason=Which claims?}} roughly through Oyster Bay on the North Shore. The Dutch colony was the western part of Long Island, and the English dominated the east. The population of Southold at that point was about 180. The harbor at [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport]], on the North Fork, became important in trade, fishing, and [[whaling]], because it rarely froze over. Settlers developed the interior land for agricultural purposes.\n\nBoth New Haven Colony and Connecticut Colony had sought to establish Southold as a [[theocracy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The New Haven Colony did not permit other churches to operate at all, while the Connecticut Colony allowed freedom of religion. New Haven supervised Southold until 1662, when New Haven towns began shifting their allegiance to the surrounding Connecticut Colony.  By 1664, New Haven colonists all had decided to join Connecticut, and the New Haven colony ceased to exist.  Southold was supervised by the [[Connecticut Colony]] until 1674.\n\nWhen the Dutch took control of the [[colony of New York]] in 1673, the English-settled eastern towns, including Southold, East Hampton, and Southampton, refused to submit; the Dutch attempted to force the matter by arms, and the colonists of the towns repelled them, with assistance from Connecticut. When New York was retaken by the English in 1674, these eastern towns preferred to stay part of Connecticut. Although Connecticut agreed, the government of [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]] forced the matter for them to be part of the Province of New York. Governor Sir [[Edmund Andros]] threatened to eliminate the residents' rights to land if they did not yield, which they did by 1676.<ref>Richard Mather Bayles, ''Sketches of Suffolk County, Historical and Descriptive, with a Historical Outline of Long Island'', 1874</ref> The Duke of York had a grudge against Connecticut. New Haven had hidden three of the judges who sentenced his father [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to death in 1649.\n\nThe town called as its second minister Rev. Joshua Hobart, a [[Harvard College|Harvard]] graduate from [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], and son of Rev. Peter Hobart. The latter was the founding minister of [[Old Ship Church]], the nation's oldest church in continuous use.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BlgVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA173&dq=%22joshua+hobart%22+hingham&ei=u4wgSfjlLIWekwT4ycG5C Epher Whitaker, ''A History of Southold, L.I.''], Orange, NJ: Press of the Orange Chronicle, 1881</ref> Rev.

[[John Youngs]], the minister who was one of the founders of the Town, was born and brought up in Southwold, England. Youngs was a member of St. Margaret's Church in nearby [[Reydon]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BlgVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=southold+history&ei=L7AgSdGFA5O2kwSg_umICQ#PPA23,M1 Epher Whittaker, ''History of Southold, L.I.: Its First Century''], Southold, Printed for the Author, 1881</ref>  Within the Town's limits is an area known as [[Reydon Shores, New York|Reydon Shores]], perhaps a reference to the Reydon, England known by Youngs. The Town's name also may refer to a \"holding\" to the south [of New Haven]), from whence the original settlers hailed.\n\nIn the meantime, the population of Southold grew from 180 in 1650 to 880 by 1698.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Long Island Rail Road]] extended its line on the North Shore to Greenport. This enabled summer vacationers to travel to the destination by train. Due to the light on the North Fork from water on both sides, the area attracted many artists, including [[William Merritt Chase]].\n\nThe area was agricultural, and long dominated by for potato farming. In the late 20th century, large areas of the North Fork were redeveloped as vineyards. This area of Long Island has developed a respectable wine industry. In November 1994, the village of [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York|Greenport]] voted to [[Greenport, Suffolk County, New York#Police department disbanded|abolish its police department]] and contract with the [[Southold Town Police Department|Southold Town Police]] for law enforcement.\n\n==Geography==\nThe town is at the northeastern end of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on a [[peninsula]] called the [[North Fork, Suffolk County, New York|North Fork]] and its extensions [[Plum Island (New York)|Plum Island]], and [[Fishers Island]]. The [[Long Island Sound]] separates the town from [[Connecticut]]. The eastern end of the peninsula, near [[Orient Point]], is north of the [[Shelter Island (town), New York|Town of Shelter Island]], but the town is separated from the [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York|South Fork]] of Long Island by the Great Peconic Bay and the Little Peconic Bay. The western end of the town is the border of the [[Riverhead, New York|Town of Riverhead]]. It is twenty-one miles from Orient Point to the border with Riverhead. [[Robins Island]], a protected open space in Great Peconic Bay, is also part of the Town of Southold.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Town of Southold Local Waterfront Revitalization Program: Southold LWRP Maps|year=2003|publisher=Division of Coastal Resources, New York State Department of State|url=http://docs.dos.ny.gov/communitieswaterfronts/LWRP/Southold_T/Amendment1/Final/Maps/Southold%20LWRP%20Maps.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218015450/http://docs.dos.ny.gov/communitieswaterfronts/LWRP/Southold_T/Amendment1/Final/Maps/Southold%20LWRP%20Maps.pdf|archivedate=18 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of 404.5&nbsp;square miles (1,047.6&nbsp;km\u00b2), of which, 53.7&nbsp;square miles (139.1&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it is land and 350.8&nbsp;square miles (908.5&nbsp;km\u00b2) of it (86%) is water.

The language is spoken to a much lesser degree in the northern Mexican states of [[Sonora]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Coahuila]], and [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]].  Those languages are spoken by various groups of [[Apache]] and [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] peoples. Elsewhere, Athabaskan is spoken by many indigenous groups of peoples in Alaska, Canada, Oregon and northern California.\n\nSelf-designations for Western Apache and Navajo are ''Nnee biy\u00e1ti\u2019'' or ''Ndee biy\u00e1ti\u2019,'' and {{spell-nv|Din\u00e9 bizaad}} or {{spell-nv|Naabeeh\u00f3 bizaad}}, respectively.\n\nThere are several well-known historical people whose first language was Southern Athabaskan. [[Geronimo]] (Goyaa\u0142\u00e9) who spoke [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language|Chiricahua]] was a famous raider and war leader. [[Manuelito]] spoke [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and is famous for his leadership during and after the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]].\n\n==Family division==\nThe seven Southern Athabaskan languages can be divided into two groups according to the classification of [[Harry Hoijer]]: (I) Plains and (II) Southwestern.  [[Plains Apache]] is the only member of the Plains Apache group. The Southwestern group can be further divided into two subgroups (A) Western and (B) Eastern.  The Western subgroup consists of [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Mescalero]], and [[Chiricahua]].  The Eastern subgroup consists of [[Jicarilla language|Jicarilla]] and [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan]].\n\nI. '''[[Plains Apache language|Plains Apache]]''' ({{sc|aka}} Kiowa\u2013Apache) (in Apache: '''Naishan''')\n\nII. Southwestern\n: A. Western\n:: 1. Chiricahua-Mescalero or '''Ndee Bizaa'''\n::: a. '''[[Chiricahua language|Chiricahua]]'''\n:::: i. Chiricahua proper\n:::: ii. Warm Springs\n::: b. '''[[Mescalero language|Mescalero]]'''\n:: 2. '''[[Navajo language|Navajo]]''' ({{sc|aka}} Navahu\u02d9) (in Navajo: '''Naabeeh\u00f3 bizaad''', '''Din\u00e9 bizaad''')\n:: 3. '''[[Western Apache language|Western Apache]]''' ({{sc|aka}} Coyotero Apache) (in Apache: '''Nd\u00e9\u00e9 biy\u00e1ti, Nnee biyati''') \n::: a. [[Tonto Apache|Tonto]] (in Apache: '''Dilzh\u0119\u0301\u2019\u00e9''')\n:::: i. Northern Tonto\n:::: ii. Southern Tonto\n::: b. [[White Mountain Apache|White Mountain]]\n::: c. [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos]]\n::: d. [[Apache|Cibecue]] (\u02c0a\u02d9pa\u010du)\n: B. Eastern\n:: 1. '''[[Jicarilla language|Jicarilla]]''' ({{sc|aka}} Hikariya Apache) (in Apache: '''Ab\u00e1achi, Ab\u00e1achi mizaa''')\n:: 2. '''[[Lipan language|Lipan]]'''\n\nHoijer's classification is based primarily on the differences of the pronunciation of the initial [[consonant]] of noun and verb stems. His earlier 1938 classification had only two branches with Plains Apache grouped together with the other Eastern languages (i.e. with Jicarilla and Lipan).\n\nMescalero and Chiricahua are considered different languages{{by whom|date=March 2013}} even though they are mutually intelligible ([[Ethnologue]] considers them the same language).  Western Apache (especially the Dilzhe'e [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]) and Navajo are closer to each other than either is to Mescalero/Chiricahua.  Lipan Apache and Plains Apache are nearly extinct (in fact Lipan may already be extinct).  Chiricahua is severely endangered.  Mescalero, Jicarilla, and Western Apache are considered endangered as well, but fortunately children are still learning the languages although the number of child speakers continues to decline.  Navajo is one of the most vigorous North American languages, but use among first-graders has declined from 90% to 30% in recent years (1998 N.Y. Times, April 8, p. A1).<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/09/us/indians-striving-to-save-their-languages.html Brooke, James. \"Indians Striving to Save Their Languages.\" New York Times, p. A1, April 9, 1998.</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice}}\nAll Southern Athabaskan languages are somewhat similar in their [[phonology]]. The following description will concentrate on [[Western Apache]]. One can expect minor variations for other related languages (such as [[Navajo language#Sounds|Navajo]], [[Jicarilla Apache#Consonants|Jicarilla]], [[Chiricahua#Consonants|Chiricahua]]).\n\n=== Consonants ===\nSouthern Athabaskan languages generally have a consonant inventory similar to the set of 33 consonants below (based mostly on Western Apache):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!

This glottal stop is never written at the beginning of a word.\n# Some words are pronounced either as '''''d''''' or '''''n''''' or '''''nd''''', depending on the dialect of the speaker.  This is represented in the consonant table above as {{IPA|[\u207fd]}}.  The same is true with '''''b''''' and '''''m''''' in a few words.\n# In many words '''''n''''' can occur in a syllable by itself in which case it is a syllabic {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}.  This is not indicated in the spelling.\n\n===Vowels===\nSouthern Athabaskan languages have four vowels of contrasting tongue dimensions (as written in a general \"practical\" orthography):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"| &nbsp; '''Front''' &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| '''Central'''\n| align=\"center\"| &nbsp; '''Back''' &nbsp;\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| &nbsp; '''High''' &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|i}}\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| &nbsp; '''Mid''' &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|e}}\n| &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|o}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| &nbsp; '''Low''' &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|a}}\n| &nbsp;\n|}\n\nThese vowels may also be short or long and oral (non-nasal) or nasal. Nasal vowels are indicated by an [[ogonek]] (or nasal hook) diacritic '''\u02db''' in Western Apache, Navajo, Mescalero, and Chiricahua; in Jicarilla, the nasal vowels are indicated by underlining the vowel, results in 16 different vowels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n! align=\"center\" | High-Front\n! align=\"center\" | Mid-Front\n! align=\"center\" | Mid-Back\n! align=\"center\" | Low-Central\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | '''Oral '''\n| short\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|i}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|e}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|o}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|a}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | long\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|ii}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|ee}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|oo}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|aa}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | ''' Nasal '''\n| short\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u012f}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0119}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u01eb}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0105}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | long\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u012f\u012f}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0119\u0119}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u01eb\u01eb}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0105\u0105}}\n|}\n\nIPA equivalents for Western Apache oral vowels:\n\n'''{{IPA|i}}''' = {{IPA|[\u026a]}},\n'''{{IPA|ii}}''' = {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}},\n'''{{IPA|e}}''' = {{IPA|[\u025b]}},\n'''{{IPA|ee}}''' = {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}},\n'''{{IPA|o}}''' = {{IPA|[o]}},\n'''{{IPA|oo}}''' = {{IPA|[\u028a\u02d0]}},\n'''{{IPA|a}}''' = {{IPA|[\u0250]}},\n'''{{IPA|aa}}''' = {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}}.\n\nIn [[Western Apache]], there is a practice where orthographic vowels '''''o''''' and '''''oo''''' are written as '''''u''''' in certain contexts.  These contexts do not include nasalized vowels, so nasal '''''u''''' never occurs in the orthography.  This practice continues into the present (perhaps somewhat inconsistently).\n\nHowever, in [[Harry Hoijer]] and other American linguists' work all '''o'''-vowels are written as '''''o'''''.  Similarly, Navajo does not use orthographic '''''u''''', consistently writing this vowel as '''''o'''''.\n\nIn [[Chiricahua]] and [[Mescalero]], this vowel is written as '''''u''''' in all contexts (including nasalized '''\u0173''').\n\nOther practices may be used in other Apachean languages.\n\n===Tone===\nSouthern Athabaskan languages are [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] languages.  Hoijer and other linguists analyze Southern Athabaskan languages as having four tones (using Americanist transcription system):\n\n* '''''high'''''  (marked with acute accent '''\u00b4''', Example: '''\u00e1''')\n* '''''low'''''  (marked with grave accent '''`''', Example: '''\u00e0''')\n* '''''rising'''''  (marked with h\u00e1\u010dek '''\u02c7''', Example: '''\u01ce''')\n* '''''falling'''''  (marked with circumflex '''\u02c6''', Example: '''\u00e2''')\n\nRising and falling tones are less common in the language (often occurring over morpheme boundaries) and often occur on long vowels.  Vowels can carry tone as well as syllabic '''n''' (Example: '''\u0144''').\n\nThe practical orthography has tried to simplify the [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist transcription]] system by representing only high tone with an acute accent and leaving low tone unmarked:\n\n* high tone:  '''\u00e1'''\n* low tone:  '''a'''\n\nThen, '''niziz''' is written instead of the previous '''n\u00ecz\u00ecz'''.\n\nAdditionally, rising tone on long vowels is indicated by an unmarked first vowel and an acute accent on the second. It is vice versa for falling tone:\n\n* rising: '''a\u00e1'''  (instead of Americanist: '''\u01ce\u00b7''')\n* falling: '''\u00e1a'''  (instead of Americanist: '''\u00e2\u00b7''')\n\nNasal vowels carry tone as well, resulting in a two diacritics on vowels with high tone: '''\u0105\u0301''' (presenting problems for computerization).  Recently, de Reuse (2006) has found that Western Apache also has a mid tone, which he indicates with a macron diacritic '''\u00af''', as in '''\u014d''', '''\u01ed'''.  In [[Chiricahua]], a falling tone can occur on a syllabic '''n''': '''n\u0302'''.\n\nHere are some vowel contrasts involving nasalization, tone, and length from [[Chiricahua|Chiricahua Apache]]:\n\n: '''cha\u0327a\u0327'''  &nbsp;'feces'\n: '''chaa'''  &nbsp;'beaver'\n: '''shiban'''  &nbsp;'my buckskin'\n: '''shib\u00e1n'''  &nbsp;'my bread'\n: '''bik\u2019ai\u2019'''  &nbsp;'his hip'\n: '''b\u00edk\u2019ai\u2019'''  &nbsp;'his stepmother'\n: '''hah\u2019aa\u0142'''  &nbsp;'you two are going to chew it'\n: '''hah\u2019a\u0142'''  &nbsp;'you two are chewing it'\n\n===Comparative phonology===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe Southern Athabascan branch was defined by [[Harry Hoijer]] primarily according to its [[Sound change|merger]] of [[Word stem|stem]]-initial [[consonant]]s of the Proto-Athabascan series ''{{IPA|*k\u032f}}'' and ''{{IPA|*c}}'' into ''{{IPA|*c}}'' (in addition to the widespread merger of ''{{IPA|*\u010d}}'' and ''{{IPA|*\u010d\u02b7}}'' into ''{{IPA|*\u010d}}'' also found in many [[Northern Athabascan]] languages).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"3\"  style=\"text-align: center; margin-left:1em\"\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n!

Thus, as can be seen in the example below, when the Western languages have noun or verb stems that start with ''t'', the related forms in the Eastern languages will start with a ''k'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-left:1em\"\n!\n! colspan=\"4\" | ''Western''\n! colspan=\"3\" | ''Eastern''\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n!\n!

Thus, some stems that originally started with ''*k\u032f'' in Proto-Athabascan start with ''ch'' in Plains Apache, but the other languages start with ''ts''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"3\"  style=\"text-align: center; margin-left:1em\"\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n!

Other linguists, particularly [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]] (1973), have noted that a classification based only on the initial consonants of noun and verb stems is arbitrary and when other [[sound correspondence]]s are considered the relationships between the languages appear to be more complex. Additionally, it has been pointed out by Martin Huld (1983) that since Plains Apache does not merge Proto-Athabascan ''{{IPA|*k\u032f/*c}}'', Plains Apache cannot be considered an Apachean language as defined by Hoijer.\n\nOther differences and similarities among the Southern Athabaskan languages can be observed in the following modified and abbreviated [[Swadesh list]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"4\"  style=\"margin-left:1em\"\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

The language is spoken to a much lesser degree in the northern Mexican states of [[Sonora]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Coahuila]], and [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]].  Those languages are spoken by various groups of [[Apache]] and [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] peoples. Elsewhere, Athabaskan is spoken by many indigenous groups of peoples in Alaska, Canada, Oregon and northern California.\n\nSelf-designations for Western Apache and Navajo are ''Nnee biy\u00e1ti\u2019'' or ''Ndee biy\u00e1ti\u2019,'' and {{spell-nv|Din\u00e9 bizaad}} or {{spell-nv|Naabeeh\u00f3 bizaad}}, respectively.\n\nThere are several well-known historical people whose first language was Southern Athabaskan. [[Geronimo]] (Goyaa\u0142\u00e9) who spoke [[Mescalero-Chiricahua language|Chiricahua]] was a famous raider and war leader. [[Manuelito]] spoke [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and is famous for his leadership during and after the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]].\n\n==Family division==\nThe seven Southern Athabaskan languages can be divided into two groups according to the classification of [[Harry Hoijer]]: (I) Plains and (II) Southwestern.  [[Plains Apache]] is the only member of the Plains Apache group. The Southwestern group can be further divided into two subgroups (A) Western and (B) Eastern.  The Western subgroup consists of [[Western Apache language|Western Apache]], [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Mescalero]], and [[Chiricahua]].  The Eastern subgroup consists of [[Jicarilla language|Jicarilla]] and [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan]].\n\nI.

'''[[Lipan language|Lipan]]'''\n\nHoijer's classification is based primarily on the differences of the pronunciation of the initial [[consonant]] of noun and verb stems. His earlier 1938 classification had only two branches with Plains Apache grouped together with the other Eastern languages (i.e. with Jicarilla and Lipan).\n\nMescalero and Chiricahua are considered different languages{{by whom|date=March 2013}} even though they are mutually intelligible ([[Ethnologue]] considers them the same language).  Western Apache (especially the Dilzhe'e [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]) and Navajo are closer to each other than either is to Mescalero/Chiricahua.  Lipan Apache and Plains Apache are nearly extinct (in fact Lipan may already be extinct).  Chiricahua is severely endangered.  Mescalero, Jicarilla, and Western Apache are considered endangered as well, but fortunately children are still learning the languages although the number of child speakers continues to decline.  Navajo is one of the most vigorous North American languages, but use among first-graders has declined from 90% to 30% in recent years (1998 N.Y. Times, April 8, p. A1)<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/09/us/indians-striving-to-save-their-languages.html Brooke, James. \"Indians Striving to Save Their Languages.\" New York Times, p. A1, April 9, 1998.</ref>.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice}}\nAll Southern Athabaskan languages are somewhat similar in their [[phonology]]. The following description will concentrate on [[Western Apache]]. One can expect minor variations for other related languages (such as [[Navajo language#Sounds|Navajo]], [[Jicarilla Apache#Consonants|Jicarilla]], [[Chiricahua#Consonants|Chiricahua]]).\n\n=== Consonants ===\nSouthern Athabaskan languages generally have a consonant inventory similar to the set of 33 consonants below (based mostly on Western Apache):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; line-height: 1.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!

This glottal stop is never written at the beginning of a word.\n# Some words are pronounced either as '''''d''''' or '''''n''''' or '''''nd''''', depending on the dialect of the speaker.  This is represented in the consonant table above as {{IPA|[\u207fd]}}.  The same is true with '''''b''''' and '''''m''''' in a few words.\n# In many words '''''n''''' can occur in a syllable by itself in which case it is a syllabic {{IPA|[n\u0329]}}.  This is not indicated in the spelling.\n\n===Vowels===\nSouthern Athabaskan languages have four vowels of contrasting tongue dimensions (as written in a general \"practical\" orthography):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"| &nbsp; '''Front''' &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| '''Central'''\n| align=\"center\"| &nbsp; '''Back''' &nbsp;\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| &nbsp; '''High''' &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|i}}\n| &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| &nbsp; '''Mid''' &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|e}}\n| &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|o}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\"| &nbsp; '''Low''' &nbsp;\n| &nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"| {{IPA|a}}\n| &nbsp;\n|}\n\nThese vowels may also be short or long and oral (non-nasal) or nasal. Nasal vowels are indicated by an [[ogonek]] (or nasal hook) diacritic '''\u02db''' in Western Apache, Navajo, Mescalero, and Chiricahua; in Jicarilla, the nasal vowels are indicated by underlining the vowel, results in 16 different vowels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | &nbsp;\n! align=\"center\" | High-Front\n! align=\"center\" | Mid-Front\n! align=\"center\" | Mid-Back\n! align=\"center\" | Low-Central\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | '''Oral '''\n| short\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|i}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|e}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|o}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|a}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | long\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|ii}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|ee}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|oo}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|aa}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | ''' Nasal '''\n| short\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u012f}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0119}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u01eb}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0105}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | long\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u012f\u012f}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0119\u0119}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u01eb\u01eb}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u0105\u0105}}\n|}\n\nIPA equivalents for Western Apache oral vowels:\n\n'''{{IPA|i}}''' = {{IPA|[\u026a]}},\n'''{{IPA|ii}}''' = {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}},\n'''{{IPA|e}}''' = {{IPA|[\u025b]}},\n'''{{IPA|ee}}''' = {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0]}},\n'''{{IPA|o}}''' = {{IPA|[o]}},\n'''{{IPA|oo}}''' = {{IPA|[\u028a\u02d0]}},\n'''{{IPA|a}}''' = {{IPA|[\u0250]}},\n'''{{IPA|aa}}''' = {{IPA|[\u0251\u02d0]}}.\n\nIn [[Western Apache]], there is a practice where orthographic vowels '''''o''''' and '''''oo''''' are written as '''''u''''' in certain contexts.  These contexts do not include nasalized vowels, so nasal '''''u''''' never occurs in the orthography.  This practice continues into the present (perhaps somewhat inconsistently).\n\nHowever, in [[Harry Hoijer]] and other American linguists' work all '''o'''-vowels are written as '''''o'''''.  Similarly, Navajo does not use orthographic '''''u''''', consistently writing this vowel as '''''o'''''.\n\nIn [[Chiricahua]] and [[Mescalero]], this vowel is written as '''''u''''' in all contexts (including nasalized '''\u0173''').\n\nOther practices may be used in other Apachean languages.\n\n===Tone===\nSouthern Athabaskan languages are [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] languages.  Hoijer and other linguists analyze Southern Athabaskan languages as having four tones (using Americanist transcription system):\n\n* '''''high'''''  (marked with acute accent '''\u00b4''', Example: '''\u00e1''')\n* '''''low'''''  (marked with grave accent '''`''', Example: '''\u00e0''')\n* '''''rising'''''  (marked with h\u00e1\u010dek '''\u02c7''', Example: '''\u01ce''')\n* '''''falling'''''  (marked with circumflex '''\u02c6''', Example: '''\u00e2''')\n\nRising and falling tones are less common in the language (often occurring over morpheme boundaries) and often occur on long vowels.  Vowels can carry tone as well as syllabic '''n''' (Example: '''\u0144''').\n\nThe practical orthography has tried to simplify the [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist transcription]] system by representing only high tone with an acute accent and leaving low tone unmarked:\n\n* high tone:  '''\u00e1'''\n* low tone:  '''a'''\n\nThen, '''niziz''' is written instead of the previous '''n\u00ecz\u00ecz'''.\n\nAdditionally, rising tone on long vowels is indicated by an unmarked first vowel and an acute accent on the second. It is vice versa for falling tone:\n\n* rising: '''a\u00e1'''  (instead of Americanist: '''\u01ce\u00b7''')\n* falling: '''\u00e1a'''  (instead of Americanist: '''\u00e2\u00b7''')\n\nNasal vowels carry tone as well, resulting in a two diacritics on vowels with high tone: '''\u0105\u0301''' (presenting problems for computerization).  Recently, de Reuse (2006) has found that Western Apache also has a mid tone, which he indicates with a macron diacritic '''\u00af''', as in '''\u014d''', '''\u01ed'''.  In [[Chiricahua]], a falling tone can occur on a syllabic '''n''': '''n\u0302'''.\n\nHere are some vowel contrasts involving nasalization, tone, and length from [[Chiricahua|Chiricahua Apache]]:\n\n: '''cha\u0327a\u0327'''  &nbsp;'feces'\n: '''chaa'''  &nbsp;'beaver'\n: '''shiban'''  &nbsp;'my buckskin'\n: '''shib\u00e1n'''  &nbsp;'my bread'\n: '''bik\u2019ai\u2019'''  &nbsp;'his hip'\n: '''b\u00edk\u2019ai\u2019'''  &nbsp;'his stepmother'\n: '''hah\u2019aa\u0142'''  &nbsp;'you two are going to chew it'\n: '''hah\u2019a\u0142'''  &nbsp;'you two are chewing it'\n\n===Comparative phonology===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe Southern Athabascan branch was defined by [[Harry Hoijer]] primarily according to its [[Sound change|merger]] of [[Word stem|stem]]-initial [[consonant]]s of the Proto-Athabascan series ''{{IPA|*k\u032f}}'' and ''{{IPA|*c}}'' into ''{{IPA|*c}}'' (in addition to the widespread merger of ''{{IPA|*\u010d}}'' and ''{{IPA|*\u010d\u02b7}}'' into ''{{IPA|*\u010d}}'' also found in many [[Northern Athabascan]] languages).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"3\"  style=\"text-align: center; margin-left:1em\"\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n!

Thus, as can be seen in the example below, when the Western languages have noun or verb stems that start with ''t'', the related forms in the Eastern languages will start with a ''k'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-left:1em\"\n!\n! colspan=\"4\" | ''Western''\n! colspan=\"3\" | ''Eastern''\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n!\n!

Thus, some stems that originally started with ''*k\u032f'' in Proto-Athabascan start with ''ch'' in Plains Apache, but the other languages start with ''ts''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"3\"  style=\"text-align: center; margin-left:1em\"\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n!

Other linguists, particularly [[Michael E. Krauss|Michael Krauss]] (1973), have noted that a classification based only on the initial consonants of noun and verb stems is arbitrary and when other [[sound correspondence]]s are considered the relationships between the languages appear to be more complex. Additionally, it has been pointed out by Martin Huld (1983) that since Plains Apache does not merge Proto-Athabascan ''{{IPA|*k\u032f/*c}}'', Plains Apache cannot be considered an Apachean language as defined by Hoijer.\n\nOther differences and similarities among the Southern Athabaskan languages can be observed in the following modified and abbreviated [[Swadesh list]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"4\"  style=\"margin-left:1em\"\n|- style=\"line-height:1.2em\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

The main temple and the ''jagamohana'' differed in size, decorative themes, and design. It was the main temple's trunk, called the ''gandhi'' in medieval Hindu architecture texts, that was ruined long ago. The sanctum of the main temple is now without a roof and most of the original parts.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=27\u201329}}\n\nOn the east side of the main temple is the ''Nata mandira'' (lit. dance temple). It stands on a high, intricately carved platform. The relief on the platform is similar in style to that found on the surviving walls of the temple.<ref name=\"Harle1994p251\"/> According to historical texts, there was an ''Aruna stambha'' (lit. Aruna's pillar) between the main temple and the Nata mandira, but it is no longer there because it was moved to the Jagannatha at Puri sometime during the troubled history of this temple.<ref name=\"Harle1994p251\"/> According to Harle, the texts suggest that originally the complex was enclosed within a wall {{convert|865|ft}} by {{convert|540|ft}}, with gateways on three sides.<ref name=\"Harle1994p251\"/>\n\nThe stone temple was made from three types of stone.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=29\u201331}} [[Chlorite group|Chlorite]] was used for the door lintel and frames as well as some sculptures. [[Laterite]] was used for the core of the platform and staircases near the foundation. [[Khondalite]] was used for other parts of the temple. According to Mitra, the Khondalite stone weathers faster over time, and this may have contributed to erosion and accelerated the damage when parts of the temples were destroyed.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=29\u201331}} None of these stones occur naturally nearby, and the architects and artisans must have procured and moved the stones from distant sources, probably using the rivers and water channels near the site.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=29\u201331}} The masons then created [[ashlar]], wherein the stones were polished and finished so as to make joints hardly visible.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=29\u201331}}\n\nThe original temple had a main [[sanctum sanctorum]] (''[[Vimanam (tower)|vimana]]''), which is estimated to have been {{convert|229|ft}}<ref name=officialkonark2 /> tall.

The carvings include purely decorative geometric patterns and plant motifs.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=31\u201333}} Some panels show images from the life of the king such as one showing him receiving counsel from a [[guru]], where the artists symbolically portrayed the king as much smaller than the guru, with the king's sword resting on the ground next to him.<ref>[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25164/king-narasimha-and-his-spiritual-relief-panel/ King Narasimha and his spiritual advisor: Konarak Temple], V&A Museum, UK; Quote: \"In this Konarak sculpture Narasimha is depicted with his guru, probably the yogi Acharyraja. As king, Narasimha, named after the 'man-lion' incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, ruled Odisha and neighbouring regions of eastern India from 1238 to 1264. He held political control over the region in which the Sun temple was constructed and was the actual patron of the temple, yet he is shown as smaller than his guru. The guru sits cross-legged, with one arm raised in a gesture of explanation. The bearded king, seated in the centre of the sculpture, is stripped of all royal symbols. His sword lies on the ground in front of him. Instead of a weapon he holds a palm-leaf manuscript, the original medium for transcribing sacred texts in India. Beside the king are two attendants: one sits reading a palm-leaf manuscript; the other stands with his hands joined together in a demonstration of reverence. On the lower register, on a smaller scale, four warriors stand with shields and weapons.\"</ref>\n\nThe ''upana'' ([[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]) layer at the bottom of the platform contains friezes of elephants, marching soldiers, musicians, and images depicting the secular life of the people, including hunting scenes, a caravan of domesticated animals, people carrying supplies on their head or with the help of a bullock cart, travelers preparing a meal along the roadside, and festive processions.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=38\u201341}} On other walls are found images depicting the daily life of the elite as well as the common people. For example, girls are shown wringing their wet hair, standing by a tree, looking from a window, playing with pets, putting on [[Cosmetics|makeup]] while looking into a mirror, playing musical instruments such as the ''vina'', chasing away a monkey who is trying to snatch items, a family taking leave of their elderly grandmother who seems dressed for a pilgrimage, a mother blessing her son, a teacher with students, a yogi during a standing ''asana'', a warrior being greeted with a [[namaste]], a mother with her child, an old woman with a walking stick and a bowl in her hands, comical characters, among others.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=41\u201347, 61\u201364}}\n\nThe Konark temple is also known for its erotic sculptures of ''[[maithuna]]s''.<ref name=mithuna>{{cite web |url= http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_konark_mithuna.asp|title=Konarak Sun Temple: Mithuna Sculptures|publisher = Archaeological Survey of India|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> These show couples in various stages of courtship and intimacy, and in some cases coital themes. Notorious in the colonial era for their uninhibited celebration of sexuality, these images are included with other aspects of human life as well as deities that are typically associated with [[tantra]]. This led some to propose that the erotic sculptures are linked to the ''vama marga'' (left hand tantra) tradition.<ref name=\"Harle1994p251\"/> However, this is not supported by local literary sources, and these images may be the same ''kama'' and ''mithuna'' scenes found integrated into the art of many Hindu temples.<ref name=\"Harle1994p251\"/> The erotic sculptures are found on the temple's [[Shikhara]], and these illustrate all the ''bandhas'' (''mudra'' forms) described in the ''[[Kamasutra]]''.{{sfn|Ananda K Coomaraswamy|1985|p=116}}\n\nOther large sculptures were a part of the gateways of the temple complex. These include life-size lions subduing elephants, elephants subduing demons, and horses. A major pillar dedicated to Aruna, called the ''Aruna Stambha'', used to stand in front of the eastern stairs of the porch. This, too, was intricately carved with horizontal friezes and motifs. It now stands in front of the Jagannatha temple at Puri.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=79\u201381}}\n\n===Hindu deities===\nThe upper levels and terrace of the Konark Sun temple contain larger and more significant works of art than the lower level. These include images of musicians and mythological narratives as well as sculptures of Hindu deities, including [[Durga]] in her [[Mahishasuramardini]] aspect killing the shape-shifting buffalo demon ([[Shaktism]]), [[Vishnu]] in his Jagannatha form ([[Vaishnavism]]), and [[Shiva]] as a (largely damaged) [[Lingam|linga]] ([[Shaivism]]). Some of the better-preserved friezes and sculptures were removed and relocated to museums in Europe and major cities of India before 1940.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=46\u201348}}\n\nThe Hindu deities are also depicted in other parts of the temple. For example, the medallions of the chariot wheels of the Surya temple, as well as the ''anuratha'' artwork of the ''jagamohana'', show Vishnu, Shiva, Gajalakshmi, Parvati, Krishna, Narasimha, and other gods and goddesses.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=49\u201351}} Also found on the ''jagamohana'' are sculptures of Vedic deities such as [[Indra]], [[Agni]], [[Kubera]], [[Varuna]], and [[\u00c2dityas]].{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=52\u201354, 65\u201367}}\n\n===Style===\nThe temple follows the traditional style of [[Kalinga architecture]].

It was discovered during excavations carried out between 1900 and 1910. Early theories assumed that it was dedicated to Surya's wife and thus named the Mayadevi Temple. However, later studies suggested that it was also a Surya temple, albeit an older one that was fused into the complex when the monumental temple was built.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=86\u201389}} This temple also has numerous carvings and a square ''mandapa'' is overlain by a ''sapta-ratha''. The sanctum of this Surya temple features a [[Nataraja]]. Other deities in the interior include a damaged Surya holding a lotus, along with Agni, Varuna, Vishnu, and Vayu.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=86\u201393}}\n*'''[[Vaishnava]] Temple'''{{snd}}Located southwest of the so-called Mayadevi Temple, it was discovered during excavations in 1956. This discovery was significant because it confirmed that the Konark Sun Temple complex revered all the major Hindu traditions, and was not an exclusive worship place for the ''[[saura]]'' cult as previously believed.

The carvings include purely decorative geometric patterns and plant motifs.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=31\u201333}} Some panels show images from the life of the king such as one showing him receiving counsel from a [[guru]], where the artists symbolically portrayed the king as much smaller than the guru, with the king's sword resting on the ground next to him.<ref>[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25164/king-narasimha-and-his-spiritual-relief-panel/ King Narasimha and his spiritual advisor: Konarak Temple], V&A Museum, UK; Quote: \"In this Konarak sculpture Narasimha is depicted with his guru, probably the yogi Acharyraja. As king, Narasimha, named after the 'man-lion' incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, ruled Odisha and neighbouring regions of eastern India from 1238 to 1264. He held political control over the region in which the Sun temple was constructed and was the actual patron of the temple, yet he is shown as smaller than his guru. The guru sits cross-legged, with one arm raised in a gesture of explanation. The bearded king, seated in the centre of the sculpture, is stripped of all royal symbols. His sword lies on the ground in front of him. Instead of a weapon he holds a palm-leaf manuscript, the original medium for transcribing sacred texts in India. Beside the king are two attendants: one sits reading a palm-leaf manuscript; the other stands with his hands joined together in a demonstration of reverence. On the lower register, on a smaller scale, four warriors stand with shields and weapons.\"</ref>\n\nThe ''upana'' ([[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]) layer at the bottom of the platform contains friezes of elephants, marching soldiers, musicians, and images depicting the secular life of the people, including hunting scenes, a caravan of domesticated animals, people carrying supplies on their head or with the help of a bullock cart, travelers preparing a meal along the roadside, and festive processions.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=38\u201341}} On other walls are found images depicting the daily life of the elite as well as the common people. For example, girls are shown wringing their wet hair, standing by a tree, looking from a window, playing with pets, putting on [[Cosmetics|makeup]] while looking into a mirror, playing musical instruments such as the ''vina'', chasing away a monkey who is trying to snatch items, a family taking leave of their elderly grandmother who seems dressed for a pilgrimage, a mother blessing her son, a teacher with students, a yogi during a standing ''asana'', a warrior being greeted with a [[namaste]], a mother with her child, an old woman with a walking stick and a bowl in her hands, comical characters, among others.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=41\u201347, 61\u201364}}\n\nThe Konark temple is also known for its erotic sculptures of ''[[maithuna]]s''.<ref name=mithuna>{{cite web |url= http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_konark_mithuna.asp|title=Konarak Sun Temple: Mithuna Sculptures|publisher = Archaeological Survey of India|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> These show couples in various stages of courtship and intimacy, and in some cases coital themes. Notorious in the colonial era for their uninhibited celebration of sexuality, these images are included with other aspects of human life as well as deities that are typically associated with [[tantra]]. This led some to propose that the erotic sculptures are linked to the ''vama marga'' (left hand tantra) tradition.<ref name=\"Harle1994p251\"/> However, this is not supported by local literary sources, and these images may be the same ''kama'' and ''mithuna'' scenes found integrated into the art of many Hindu temples.<ref name=\"Harle1994p251\"/> The erotic sculptures are found on the temple's [[Shikhara]], and these illustrate all the ''bandhas'' (''mudra'' forms) described in the ''[[Kamasutra]]''.{{sfn|Ananda K Coomaraswamy|1985|p=116}}\n\nOther large sculptures were a part of the gateways of the temple complex. These include life-size lions subduing elephants, elephants subduing demons, and horses. A major pillar dedicated to Aruna, called the ''Aruna Stambha'', used to stand in front of the eastern stairs of the porch. This, too, was intricately carved with horizontal friezes and motifs. It now stands in front of the Jagannatha temple at Puri.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=79\u201381}}\n\n===Hindu deities===\nThe upper levels and terrace of the Konark Sun temple contain larger and more significant works of art than the lower level. These include images of musicians and mythological narratives as well as sculptures of Hindu deities, including [[Durga]] in her [[Mahishasuramardini]] aspect killing the shape-shifting buffalo demon ([[Shaktism]]), [[Vishnu]] in his Jagannatha form ([[Vaishnavism]]), and [[Shiva]] as a (largely damaged) [[Lingam|linga]] ([[Shaivism]]).

Some of these include:\n\n*'''Mayadevi Temple'''{{snd}}Located west-southwest from the entrance of the main temple,{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=86\u201389}} it has been dated to the late 11th century, earlier than the main temple.<ref name=konarkasi>{{cite web |url= http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_konark.asp|title=World Heritage Sites: Konarak Sun Temple|publisher = Archaeological Survey of India|accessdate=17 May 2013}}</ref> It consists of a sanctuary, a ''mandapa'' and, before it, an open platform. It was discovered during excavations carried out between 1900 and 1910. Early theories assumed that it was dedicated to Surya's wife and thus named the Mayadevi Temple. However, later studies suggested that it was also a Surya temple, albeit an older one that was fused into the complex when the monumental temple was built.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=86\u201389}} This temple also has numerous carvings and a square ''mandapa'' is overlain by a ''sapta-ratha''. The sanctum of this Surya temple features a [[Nataraja]]. Other deities in the interior include a damaged Surya holding a lotus, along with Agni, Varuna, Vishnu, and Vayu.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=86\u201393}}\n*'''[[Vaishnava]] Temple'''{{snd}}Located southwest of the so-called Mayadevi Temple, it was discovered during excavations in 1956. This discovery was significant because it confirmed that the Konark Sun Temple complex revered all the major Hindu traditions, and was not an exclusive worship place for the ''[[saura]]'' cult as previously believed. This is a small temple with sculptures of [[Balarama]], [[Varaha]], and [[Vamana]]\u2013[[Trivikrama]] in its sanctum, marking it as a Vaishnavite temple. These images are shown as wearing ''dhoti'' and a lot of jewelry. The sanctum's primary idol is missing, as are images from some niches in the temple.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=96\u2013100}} The site's significance as a place of Vaishnavism pilgrimage is attested to in Vaishnava texts. For example, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Krishna Chaitanya]], the early 16th-century scholar and founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, visited the Konark temple and prayed on its premises.<ref name=\"Ramaswami1971p161\"/>\n*'''Kitchen'''{{snd}}This monument is found south of the ''bhoga mandapa'' (feeding hall). It, too, was discovered in excavations in the 1950s. It includes means to bring water, cisterns to store water, drains, a cooking floor, depressions in the floor probably for pounding spices or grains, as well several triple ovens (''chulahs'') for cooking. This structure may have been for festive occasions or a part of a community feeding hall.{{sfn|Debala Mitra|1968|pp=101\u2013103}} According to Thomas Donaldson, the kitchen complex may have been added a little later than the original temple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Donaldson|title=Konark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJBNAAAAYAAJ| year=2005|publisher= Oxford University Press|isbn= 978-0-19-567591-7|pages=34, 75}}</ref>\n*'''Well 1'''{{snd}}This monument is located north of the kitchen, towards its eastern flank, was probably built to supply water to the community kitchen and ''bhoga mandapa''.

This is contradicted by textual evidence and evidence from inscriptions.

Tourists flocked to the South Street's nightlife and the \"neighborhood\" community aspect was gradually lost.\n\nSouth Street remains a popular hangout area for teens, college students, and [[twentysomething (term)|twentysomethings]] with its assortment of bars, [[take-out]] eateries, [[sex shop]]s, gift shops, and retailers catering to [[hip hop fashion]], [[punk fashion]], and/or [[urban culture]].  A few restaurants and independent [[boutique]]s targeting a slightly more mature clientele are interspersed with these businesses, such as Accent on Animals, a pet supply store, and South Street Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant. Starting in the late 1990s, the street saw the establishment of various [[chain store]]s, including [[Johnny Rockets]], two [[Starbucks]] locations, [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]], [[Rita's Italian Ice]], [[Super Fresh]], [[Whole Foods]], [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]], and [[Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|Fine Wine & Good Spirits]].

Portions of the video for this song were filmed on South Street. Zipperhead has since relocated to South 4th St. and been renamed to Crash Bang Boom. A few years after Zipperhead founder and building landlord Rick Millan sold the business to local musician Rob Windfelder of the rock band Live Not On Evil and his business partner Stefanie Jollis, the store was relocated and renamed.\n\n[[Green Day]] made their Philadelphia debut on January 23, 1993 at J.C.

Despite no longer being a literal border, South Street remained a liminal space where cultures collided. The African-American theater district of western South Street, the Jewish shops, nearby Italian businesses, and visitors from other parts of the city combined to create a place described by [[William Gardner Smith]] in his 1954 book ''South Street'' as a lively zone of contact between many different ethnicities.

During this time, the neighborhood also served as an artists' haven and a hub of [[Beat Generation|Beat subculture]] and, later, [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], [[bohemianism]], and the [[hippie movement]] in Philadelphia, establishing a lasting association of South Street with [[avant-garde]] and [[alternative culture|alternative subcultures]].<ref name=\"icons\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6Iii1MNkXoC&pg=PA86&dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDyuqXqu7LAhXIZCYKHXmWB2A4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&f=false|title=Philadelphia Icons: 50 Classic Views of the City of Brotherly Love|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|date=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"frommers\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WR5OAQAAIAAJ&q=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&dq=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbyJLarO7LAhWEMSYKHecyDf8Q6AEIOzAF|title=Frommer's Philadelphia & the Amish Country|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lauren|date=2009|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref><ref name=\"keech\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beMxAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA71&dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&f=false|title=The Best Flea, Antique, Vintage, and New-Style Markets in America|last1=Keech|first1=Pamela|date=2013|publisher=New York Review of Books}}</ref><ref name=\"mann\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASTKVQDpbYYC&pg=PA10&dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&f=false|title=Blinded by the Lyrics: Behind the Lines of Rock and Roll's Most Baffling Songs|last1=Mann|first1=Brett|date=2005|publisher=Citadel Press}}</ref><ref name=\"hunter\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMHcDciM3kMC&pg=PA190&dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIUTAJ#v=onepage&q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&f=false|title=Black Citymakers: How The Philadelphia Negro Changed Urban America|last1=Hunter|first1=Marcus Anthony|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA}}</ref> \n\nIt was not uncommon for South Philadelphians to \"[[bar hopping|bar-hop]]\" across the clubs, listening to live bands along the way. This community of fans helped attract recording contracts for many artists, including [[Kenn Kweder]], the \"bard of South Street\"; [[George Thorogood]]; and [[Robert Hazard]]. From the mid to late 1970s into the 1980s, South Street's reputation as a musical, artistic, and [[countercultural]] hub was further solidified as it became the center of Philadelphia's [[punk scene]] and [[punk rock|punk]] and [[alternative rock]] music communities, with venues such as JC Dobbs and stores such as Zipperhead catering to the burgeoning scene.<ref name=\"amorosi\">{{cite web|last1=Amorosi|first1=A.D.|title=Where They Were Then|url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2002-10-17/cover3.shtml|website=Philadelphia City Paper|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"laird\">{{cite book|last1=Laird|first1=R.F.|title=The Boomer Bible|date=1991|publisher=Workman Publishing|url=https://archive.org/details/boomerbible00lair|url-access=registration|quote=south street philadelphia punk scene.}}</ref><ref name=\"ivory\">{{cite book|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|title=Philadelphia Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places|date=2007|publisher=Globe Pequot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7VhpHPjcscC&pg=PA65&dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiTp4n1qO7LAhUDQyYKHXGeArwQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&f=false}}</ref> \n\nIn 1976, [[Jim's Steaks]] of [[West Philadelphia]]  expanded to 400 South Street, becoming the notable restaurant's first franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimssteaks.com/jim-s-steaks--history.html|title=Jim's Steaks History|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, South Street became one of the city's main tourist attractions anchored by the [[Theatre of Living Arts]] (TLA) which began as an [[Art film|arthouse]] theater and then was reborn as a live music venue. Tourists flocked to the South Street's nightlife and the \"neighborhood\" community aspect was gradually lost.\n\nSouth Street remains a popular hangout area for teens, college students, and [[twentysomething (term)|twentysomethings]] with its assortment of bars, [[take-out]] eateries, [[sex shop]]s, gift shops, and retailers catering to [[hip hop fashion]], [[punk fashion]], and/or [[urban culture]].  A few restaurants and independent [[boutique]]s targeting a slightly more mature clientele are interspersed with these businesses, such as Accent on Animals, a pet supply store, and South Street Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant. Starting in the late 1990s, the street saw the establishment of various [[chain store]]s, including [[Johnny Rockets]], two [[Starbucks]] locations, [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]], [[Rita's Italian Ice]], [[Super Fresh]], [[Whole Foods]], [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]], and [[Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|Fine Wine & Good Spirits]].  South Street is adjacent to [[Headhouse Square]], a notable plaza with various shops and restaurants.\n\nArtist [[Isaiah Zagar]] has made South Street his home since the late 1960s and his mosaic work can be seen in multiple places along South Street including his large installation [[Philadelphia's Magic Gardens]] between 10th Street and 11th Street.\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Zipperhead south street philly.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Zipperhead (now relocated and changed name) was mentioned in the song \"Punk Rock Girl\" by the [[Dead Milkmen]].]]\n[[The Orlons]], a music group from Philadelphia, released a 1963 song based on (and entitled) \"[[South Street (song)|South Street]]\", which begins with the line \"Where do all the hippies meet?\"  Another Philadelphia-area band, [[The Dovells]] also mentioned South Street in their 1963 hit \"[[You Can't Sit Down]]\".\n\nPhiladelphia band [[Need New Body]] has a song called \"So St RX\" which is about South Street.\n\n[[Fear (band)|Fear]]'s 1982 song \"[[The Record (album)|I Don't Care About You]]\", which name-checks the neighborhoods associated with the punk movement in the United States in the early 1980s, begins with the line, \"I'm from South Street Philadelphia\" (also relevant to writer/vocalist [[Lee Ving]] who was born in the city).\n\n[[The Dead Milkmen]]'s 1988 song \"Punk Rock Girl\" makes references to Zipperhead (a punk rock/alternative clothing and accessories store) and The Philadelphia Pizza Company., Ltd, both of which were located on South Street. Portions of the video for this song were filmed on South Street. Zipperhead has since relocated to South 4th St. and been renamed to Crash Bang Boom. A few years after Zipperhead founder and building landlord Rick Millan sold the business to local musician Rob Windfelder of the rock band Live Not On Evil and his business partner Stefanie Jollis, the store was relocated and renamed.\n\n[[Green Day]] made their Philadelphia debut on January 23, 1993 at J.C. Dobbs on the 300 block of South Street. The band had not yet signed with Reprise and the club oversold the 125-capacity venue. Late arrivals paid to enter the second floor and watch the live video feed.

The line has been planned to restore passenger rail service between [[Boston]] and the towns of [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]], [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]], [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]], [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]], and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]], on the south coast of [[Massachusetts]].  It would restore passenger service to some of the southern lines of the former [[Old Colony Railroad]] and the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] (service along the [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|southeastern lines]] was largely restored in 1997 and 2007).\n\nAfter previous service was discontinued in 1958, the project surfaced in the 1980s.  A full planning process was held starting in 1990 but was suspended in 2002 due to increasing costs.<ref name=\"srpedd\" />  Planning restarted in 2007 and in March 2017, the project was split into two phases.  Phase 1 provides interim service to Fall River and New Bedford while the northern section of the line is built in Phase 2.<ref name=\"gears\" />  Several separately-funded projects were constructed between 2013 and 2019 in preparation for the project.  Phase 1 construction began on July 2, 2019 with a projected cost of $1.047 billion and completion at the end of 2023.<ref name=\":112\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-celebrates-south-coast-rail-groundbreaking|title=Baker-Polito Administration Celebrates South Coast Rail Groundbreaking|website=Mass.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>  Total cost of the program is estimated at $3.42 billion with completion in 2030.<ref name=\"june2016\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==Project history==\n[[File:1846 Map OCRR-FRRR.jpg|thumb|left|Route of the Fall River Railroad and the original Old Colony Railroad in 1846]]\n\n===Previous service===\nThe lines planned for commuter rail service date largely from the 1840s and were later part of the Old Colony Railroad network.  The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the entire Old Colony system beginning in 1893, and ran commuter and intercity service to Fall River and New Bedford. In the early 20th century, trains took a shorter route through Easton. However, in the 1930s, trains were routed through Mansfield on the Boston & Providence mainline, further to the west. Service finally ended in 1958.<ref>Karr, Ronald Dale (1995). The Rail Lines of Southern New England.

Since the [[Taunton Branch Railroad|Mansfield Branch]] was permanently severed by a grade separation project in the 1950s, three possible routes to the South Coast were placed under consideration: an extension of the Stoughton Branch of the [[Providence/Stoughton Line]] past {{stl|MBTA|Stoughton}}, a route following the Providence Line to {{stl|MBTA|Attleboro}} and then branching onto the [[Attleboro Secondary]], and a route following the [[Middleborough/Lakeville Line|Old Colony mainline]] to Middleborough then the [[Middleboro Secondary]] westwards. (All three routes used the same lines from Taunton south to Fall River and New Bedford). By 1988, the MBTA was tentatively planning to extend service to Taunton via Stoughton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36783631/the_boston_globe/ |title=MBTA plans for big increase in rail service |newspaper=Boston Globe |author=Howe, Peter J. |date=January 24, 1988 |via=Newspapers.com |page=B1}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nThe first serious study, completed in January 1990, concluded that the Stoughton Branch was the most viable route.

It would restore passenger service to some of the southern lines of the former [[Old Colony Railroad]] and the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] (service along the [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|southeastern lines]] was largely restored in 1997 and 2007).\n\nAfter previous service was discontinued in 1958, the project surfaced in the 1980s.  A full planning process was held starting in 1990 but was suspended in 2002 due to increasing costs.<ref name=\"srpedd\" />  Planning restarted in 2007 and in March 2017, the project was split into two phases.  Phase 1 provides interim service to Fall River and New Bedford while the northern section of the line is built in Phase 2.<ref name=\"gears\" />  Several separately-funded projects were constructed between 2013 and 2019 in preparation for the project.  Phase 1 construction began on July 2, 2019 with a projected cost of $1.047 billion and completion at the end of 2023.<ref name=\":112\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-celebrates-south-coast-rail-groundbreaking|title=Baker-Polito Administration Celebrates South Coast Rail Groundbreaking|website=Mass.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>  Total cost of the program is estimated at $3.42 billion with completion in 2030.<ref name=\"june2016\" /><ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==Project history==\n[[File:1846 Map OCRR-FRRR.jpg|thumb|left|Route of the Fall River Railroad and the original Old Colony Railroad in 1846]]\n\n===Previous service===\nThe lines planned for commuter rail service date largely from the 1840s and were later part of the Old Colony Railroad network.  The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad leased the entire Old Colony system beginning in 1893, and ran commuter and intercity service to Fall River and New Bedford. In the early 20th century, trains took a shorter route through Easton. However, in the 1930s, trains were routed through Mansfield on the Boston & Providence mainline, further to the west. Service finally ended in 1958.<ref>Karr, Ronald Dale (1995). The Rail Lines of Southern New England.

Since the [[Taunton Branch Railroad|Mansfield Branch]] was permanently severed by a grade separation project in the 1950s, three possible routes to the South Coast were placed under consideration: an extension of the Stoughton Branch of the [[Providence/Stoughton Line]] past {{stl|MBTA|Stoughton}}, a route following the Providence Line to {{stl|MBTA|Attleboro}} and then branching onto the [[Attleboro Secondary]], and a route following the [[Middleborough/Lakeville Line|Old Colony mainline]] to Middleborough then the [[Middleboro Secondary]] westwards. (All three routes used the same lines from Taunton south to Fall River and New Bedford). By 1988, the MBTA was tentatively planning to extend service to Taunton via Stoughton.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/36783631/the_boston_globe/ |title=MBTA plans for big increase in rail service |newspaper=Boston Globe |author=Howe, Peter J. |date=January 24, 1988 |via=Newspapers.com |page=B1}} {{open access}}</ref>\n\nThe first serious study, completed in January 1990, concluded that the Stoughton Branch was the most viable route.

William H. Allen & Co. London. pg. 493</ref>\n\n====Liquid measures====\nThe country didn't have a unified system of liquid measurement in the 19th century because the Afrikaners used the Dutch gallon and the British used the Imperial gallon. When measuring alcohol, the British system was used only for ale and beer and the Dutch system was used only for wine, brandy and distilled spirits. This was due to specialization in the two colonies, which were not united until 1910. Vintning was more common among the Boer farmers of the Western Cape, who dominated the industry. Meanwhile, the British farmers grew grain that could be brewed into beer. Wine was for export and beer, which was perishable, was for domestic consumption. Each community used their own standard measurement systems to store, sell and ship their wares.\n\n=====Ale & beer=====\nThe ''firkin'', ''kilderkin'', barrel, ''hogshead'', and ''butt'' were traditional British measurements of capacity for standard ale and beer containers. They were  based on the British ale gallon. (Once there were different measures for ale and beer before the Ale gallon measure became standard for both in 1688; the Ale gallon then became the Imperial gallon in 1824). \n\n:1 ''firkin'' [9 Imp. gal.]: A Dutch word meaning \"little Fourth\"; a measure that was a fourth of a barrel. A small cask similar to the ''anker''. \n:1 ''kilderkin'' = 2 ''firkins'' [18 Imp. gal.]: A Dutch word meaning \"little [[quintal]]\"; a measure that was a half of a barrel.\n:1 barrel = 4 ''firkins'' = 2 ''kilderkins'' [36 Imp. gal.]\n:1 ''hogshead'' = 6 ''firkins'' = 3 ''kilderkins'' [54 Imp. gal.]: \n:1 ''butt'' = 12 ''firkins'' = 6 ''kilderkins'' = 3 barrels = 2 ''hogsheads'' [108 Imp. gal.]\n\nBeer bottles in South Africa were different than in other countries. \n:''Dumpie'' [340 ml, 11.98 (\u224812) Imp. fl. oz.]: A short-necked recyclable beer-bottle with a rounded body; the word is a nickname for a person who is short and fat. It used to be 12 Imperial ounces [341 ml] (3/5 of an Imperial pint), like the Canadian \"stumpy\" beer bottles. It was rounded down to 340 ml when South Africa converted to the metric system in 1970. The 340ml capacity also became the standard volume for beer and soda cans until 2007, when the bottling plants converted to the 330 ml European standard. It has since been replaced by long-necked 330 ml beer bottles. \n:\"Quart\" [750 ml, 0.659 (\u22480.66) Imp. fl. qt.]: The standard 750ml wine bottle (about 2/3 of an Imperial quart) was also used for beer until 2008. Wine bottles were more fragile than the heavier ''Dumpies'', making them harder to recycle. Under the [[South African Breweries]] (SAB) Project Calabash initiative<ref>[https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/178/27455.html '''BizCommunity.com''', {{overline|Packaging News}}, ''Project Calabash sees end of an era for iconic quart bottle'' (15 August 2008)]</ref> in 2008 a new 750ml bottle that was longer lasting and easier to recycle was introduced. It has a cylindrical body with a necked-down conical neck, resembling a scaled-up Pilsner beer pint bottle.\n\n=====Wine=====\nThe [[Dutch East India company]] used the [[Cape of Good Hope]] as a waystation between Europe and the East Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Dutch sailors drank the local wine to combat scurvy and exported barrels of it back to Europe. This was followed by the British government's policy of encouraging the wine and brandy industry in South Africa in the early- to mid-19th century through subsidies and low tariffs. (Their recent isolation during [[Napoleon]]'s [[Continental System]] impressed upon them that they would potentially need alternative sources of European commodities in the future.) \n\nThe ''kanne'', ''anker'', ''ahm'', and ''legger'' are obsolete 17th century Dutch measurements of capacity that were used for standard containers of wine and spirits. The standard \"Dutch gallon\" used was based on that of Amsterdam.<ref>Martin, Robert Montgomery.''Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire in the West Indies, South America, North America, Asia, Austral-Asia, and Europe'' (1839). William H. Allen & Co. London. pg. 493</ref> They were typically sold in ''ankers'', half-aums, and ''leggers''<ref>Briggs, William.''Clive's South African arithmetics - Standard IV''(1907).

William H. Allen & Co. London. pg. 493</ref>\n\n====Liquid measures====\nThe country didn't have a unified system of liquid measurement in the 19th century because the Afrikaners used the Dutch gallon and the British used the Imperial gallon. When measuring alcohol, the British system was used only for ale and beer and the Dutch system was used only for wine, brandy and distilled spirits. This was due to specialization in the two colonies, which were not united until 1910. Vintning was more common among the Boer farmers of the Western Cape, who dominated the industry. Meanwhile, the British farmers grew grain that could be brewed into beer. Wine was for export and beer, which was perishable, was for domestic consumption. Each community used their own standard measurement systems to store, sell and ship their wares.\n\n=====Ale & beer=====\nThe ''firkin'', ''kilderkin'', barrel, ''hogshead'', and ''butt'' were traditional British measurements of capacity for standard ale and beer containers. They were  based on the British ale gallon. (Once there were different measures for ale and beer before the Ale gallon measure became standard for both in 1688; the Ale gallon then became the Imperial gallon in 1824). \n\n:1 ''firkin'' [9 Imp. gal.]: A Dutch word meaning \"little Fourth\"; a measure that was a fourth of a barrel. A small cask similar to the ''anker''. \n:1 ''kilderkin'' = 2 ''firkins'' [18 Imp. gal.]: A Dutch word meaning \"little [[quintal]]\"; a measure that was a half of a barrel.\n:1 barrel = 4 ''firkins'' = 2 ''kilderkins'' [36 Imp. gal.]\n:1 ''hogshead'' = 6 ''firkins'' = 3 ''kilderkins'' [54 Imp. gal.]: \n:1 ''butt'' = 12 ''firkins'' = 6 ''kilderkins'' = 3 barrels = 2 ''hogsheads'' [108 Imp. gal.]\n\nBeer bottles in South Africa were different than in other countries. \n:''Dumpie'' [340 ml, 11.98 (\u224812) Imp. fl. oz.]: A short-necked recyclable beer-bottle with a rounded body; the word is a nickname for a person who is short and fat. It used to be 12 Imperial ounces [341 ml] (3/5 of an Imperial pint), like the Canadian \"stumpy\" beer bottles. It was rounded down to 340 ml when South Africa converted to the metric system in 1970. The 340ml capacity also became the standard volume for beer and soda cans until 2007, when the bottling plants converted to the 330 ml European standard. It has since been replaced by long-necked 330 ml beer bottles. \n:\"Quart\" [750 ml, 0.659 (\u22480.66) Imp. fl. qt.]: The standard 750ml wine bottle (about 2/3 of an Imperial quart) was also used for beer until 2008. Wine bottles were more fragile than the heavier ''Dumpies'', making them harder to recycle. Under the [[South African Breweries]] (SAB) Project Calabash initiative<ref>[https://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/178/27455.html '''BizCommunity.com''', {{overline|Packaging News}}, ''Project Calabash sees end of an era for iconic quart bottle'' (15 August 2008)]</ref> in 2008 a new 750ml bottle that was longer lasting and easier to recycle was introduced. It has a cylindrical body with a necked-down conical neck, resembling a scaled-up Pilsner beer pint bottle.\n\n=====Wine=====\nThe [[Dutch East India company]] used the [[Cape of Good Hope]] as a waystation between Europe and the East Indies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Dutch sailors drank the local wine to combat scurvy and exported barrels of it back to Europe. This was followed by the British government's policy of encouraging the wine and brandy industry in South Africa in the early- to mid-19th century through subsidies and low tariffs. (Their recent isolation during [[Napoleon]]'s [[Continental System]] impressed upon them that they would potentially need alternative sources of European commodities in the future.) \n\nThe ''kanne'', ''anker'', ''ahm'', and ''legger'' are obsolete 17th century Dutch measurements of capacity that were used for standard containers of wine and spirits. The standard \"Dutch gallon\" used was based on that of Amsterdam<ref>Martin, Robert Montgomery.''Statistics of the Colonies of the British Empire in the West Indies, South America, North America, Asia, Austral-Asia, and Europe'' (1839). William H. Allen & Co. London. pg. 493</ref>. They were typically sold in ''ankers'', half-aums, and ''leggers''<ref>Briggs, William.''Clive's South African arithmetics - Standard IV''(1907).

Merkin had a \"huge incentive not to disclose Madoff's role, especially to investors like Zuckerman\" because he charged clients \"substantial fees\" to manage both his [[Ascot Partners LP]] and Gabriel Capital. The lawsuit claims over US$40 million in losses for placing his assets with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC without his knowledge. Zuckerman invested US$25 million with Merkin's Ascot Fund in 2006 through his Charitable Remainder Trust or CRT Investments Limited and personally invested US$15 million with Merkin's Gabriel Capital. Merkin charged Zuckerman a 1.5% fee and imposed significant \"lock-up restrictions on redemptions\", but his agreement with Gabriel Capital contains an [[arbitration]] clause against Merkin for his lost personal US$15 million investment.
