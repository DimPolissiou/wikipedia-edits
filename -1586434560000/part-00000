Synagogues have a large place for prayer (the main [[sanctuary]]) and may also have smaller rooms for study and sometimes a social hall and officeeds. Some have a separate room for [[Torah study]], called the {{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9}} ''[[beth midrash]]'', lit. \"house of study\".\n\nSynagogues are disgusting dirty spaces used for the purpose of eating, reading of the [[Tuutet] (the entire [[Hebrew Bibjle]], including the [[Torah]]), study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for [[Jewish prayer|worship]]. [[Halakha]] holds that communal Jewish fart can be carried out wherever ten grams of rice and sugar (a [[minyan]]) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain proooayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]].\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], the word appears 56 times, mostly in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], but also in the [[Gospel of John]] ({{Bibleref2|John 9:22; 18:20}}) and the [[Book of Revelation]] ({{Bibleref2|Rev. 2:9; 3:9}}). It is used in the sense of 'assembly' in the [[Epistle of James]] ({{Bibleref2|James 2:2}}). im coming for you....\n\n==Terminology==\n[[Israelis]] use the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''{{transl|he|beyt knesset}}'' \"house of assembly\". [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have traditionally used the [[Yiddish]] term ''{{transl|yi|shul}}'' (cognate with the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Schule}}, 'school') in everyday speech. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Romaniote Jews]] generally use the term ''kal'' (from the Hebrew ''\u1e32ahal'', meaning \"community\"). [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jews]] call the synagogue a {{lang|es|sinagoga}} and Portuguese Jews call it an {{lang|pt|esnoga}}. [[Persian Jews]] and some [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]] also use the term ''[[kenesa]]'', which is derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and some [[Mizrahi Jews]] use ''kenis''.  Some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews use the word ''temple''. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''synagogue'' is used in [[English language|English]] ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and most [[Romance languages|Romance]] languages) to cover the preceding possibilities.<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm Judaism 101: Synagogues, Shuls and Temples]. Jewfaq.org.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Synagogue_de_la_Ghriba_Djerba_11.jpg|thumb|[[El Ghriba synagogue]], [[Djerba]],  Tunisia]]\nAlthough synagogues existed a long time before the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, communal worship in the time while the Temple still stood centered around the ''[[korban]]ot'' (\"sacrificial offerings\") brought by the ''[[kohen|kohanim]]'' (\"priests\") in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The all-day [[Yom Kippur]] service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the ''kohen gadol'' (\"[[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]\") as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]] (586\u2013537&nbsp;BCE){{citation needed|date=July 2018}} the men of the [[Great Assembly]]{{dubious|No proof it ever existed, possible date of creation hardly reaches that far back, no source quoted. Rubbish.|date=July 2018}} formalized and standardized the language of the Jewish prayers. Prior to that people prayed as they saw fit, with each individual praying in his or her own way, and there were no standard prayers that were recited.\n\n[[Johanan ben Zakai]], one of the leaders at the end of the Second Temple era, promulgated the idea of creating individual houses of worship in whatever locale Jews found themselves. This contributed to the continuity of the Jewish people by maintaining a unique identity and a portable way of worship despite the destruction of the Temple, according to many historians.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSynagogues in the sense of purpose-built spaces for worship, or rooms originally constructed for some other purpose but reserved for formal, communal prayer, however, existed long before the destruction of the Second Temple.<ref name=\"pohick\">{{cite web |author=Donald D.

Synagogues have been constructed by ancient Jewish kings, by wealthy patrons, as part of a wide range of human institutions including secular educational institutions, governments, and hotels, by the entire community of Jews living in a particular place, or by sub-groups of Jews arrayed according to occupation, ethnicity (i.e. the Sephardic, Polish or Persian Jews of a town), style of religious observance (i.e., a Reform or an Orthodox synagogue), or by the followers of a particular rabbi.\n\nIt has been theorized that the synagogue became a place of worship in the region upon the destruction of the Second Temple during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]; however, others speculate that there had been places of prayer, apart from the Temple, during the Hellenistic period.

For Jews living in the wake of the Revolt, the synagogue functioned as a \"portable system of worship\".

They are swept and sprinkled [with water] to lay the dust.

In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.\n\nHistorically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in [[Kaifeng|Kaifeng, China]] looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with [[mud\u00e9jar]] plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] are typical [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structures.\n\nWith the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries, which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions, synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Neo-Byzantine]], [[Romanesque Revival]], [[Moorish Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], and [[Greek Revival]]. There are [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues and even one [[Mayan Revival]] synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.\n\nIn the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.<gallery>\nFile:Synagogue Aleppo.jpg|[[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], [[Aleppo]], Syria (5th century)\nFile:Kochi Jewish Synagogue C.jpg|[[Paradesi Synagogue]], [[Kochi]], India (1568)\nFile:A\u0161kena\u0161ka sinagoga (14143483781).jpg|Sarajevo Synagogue, [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina (1902)\nFile:Sofia Synagogue 11c.jpg|[[Sofia Synagogue]], [[Sofia]], Bulgaria (1909)\nFile:Frank Lloyd Wright - Beth Sholom Synagogue - Elkins Park, PA (7175161021).jpg|[[Beth Sholom Congregation (Elkins Park, Pennsylvania)|Beth Sholom Congregation]], [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania|Elkins Park]], USA (1959)\nFile:Synagoge muenchen(softeis) ShiftN cropped.jpg|[[Ohel Jakob synagogue (Munich)|Ohel Jakob synagogue]], Munich, Germany (2006)\n</gallery>\n\n==Interior elements==\n===Bimah (platform)===\nAll synagogues contain a ''[[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]]'', a large, raised, reader's platform (called {{lang|he-Latn|te\u1e07ah}} (reading dais) by Sephardim), where the Torah scroll is placed to be read.

In Sephardic synagogues, the table for reading the Torah (reading dais) was commonly placed at the opposite side of the room from the Torah Ark, leaving the center of the floor empty for the use of a ceremonial procession carrying the Torah between the Ark and the reading table.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/365934/jewish/The-Bimah-The-Synagogue-Platform.htm|title=The Bimah: The Synagogue Platform|website=www.chabad.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> Most contemporary synagogues feature a lectern for the rabbi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/synagogue-background-and-overview|title=Synagogue Background & Overview|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref>\n\n===Torah Ark===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nThe [[Torah Ark]], called in Hebrew {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9}} ''Aron Kodesh'' or 'holy chest', and alternatively called the ''heikhal''\u2014{{Hebrew|\u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05dc}} or 'temple' by [[Sephardim|Sephardic Jews]], is a cabinet in which the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept.\n\nThe ark in a synagogue is almost always positioned in such a way such that those who face it are facing towards [[Jerusalem]]. Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face [[Mizrah|east]], while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.\n\nThe Ark is reminiscent of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which held the tablets inscribed with the [[Ten Commandments]]. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the [[Holy of Holies]]. The Ark is often closed with an ornate curtain, the {{lang|he-Latn|[[parochet]]}} {{Hebrew|\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05db\u05ea}}, which hangs outside or inside the ark doors.\n\n===Eternal Light===\n[[File:Abudarham_Synagogue_Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|[[Sanctuary lamp|Ner tamid]] of the [[Abudarham Synagogue]] in [[Gibraltar]]]]\nOther traditional features include a continually lit lamp or lantern, usually electric in contemporary synagogues, called the {{lang|he-Latn|[[ner tamid]]}} ({{Hebrew|\u05e0\u05e8 \u05ea\u05de\u05d9\u05d3}}), the \"Eternal Light\", used as a way to honor the Divine Presence.<ref>[https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/365933/jewish/Ner-Tamid-The-Eternal-Light.htm \"Ner Tamid: The Eternal Light.\"] ''Chabad''.  28 August 2018.</ref>\n\n===Inner decoration===\nA synagogue may be decorated with artwork, but in the Rabbinic and Orthodox tradition, three-dimensional sculptures and depictions of the human body are not allowed as these are considered akin to idolatry.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Seating===\nOriginally, synagogues were made devoid of much furniture, the Jewish congregants in [[Spain]], the [[Maghreb]] (North Africa), [[Babylonia]], the [[Land of Israel]] and [[Yemen]] having a custom to sit upon the floor, which had been strewn with mats and cushions, rather than upon chairs or benches. In other European towns and cities, however, Jewish congregants would sit upon chairs and benches.<ref>[[Maimonides]], [[Mishne Torah]] (''Hil. Tefillah'' 11:4), who wrote: \"Synagogues and houses of study must be treated with respect. They are swept and sprinkled to lay the dust. In Spain and in the Maghreb (North Africa), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to kindle lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor on which the worshipers sit.

He then said, 'Had I not gone to the synagogue, my sandals would not have gone-off.'\u201d The custom of never entering a synagogue while wearing one's shoes is also mentioned in the [[Cairo Geniza]] manuscripts: \"While he is yet outside, let him take-off his shoes or sandals from his feet and then enter barefoot, since such is the way of servants to walk barefoot before their lords... We have a minor sanctuary, and we are required to behave with sanctity and fear [in it], as it says: ''And you shall fear my hallowed place''.\" (v.

A room or building that is used this way can become a dedicated small synagogue or prayer room.

Synagogues have a large place for prayer (the main [[sanctuary]]) and may also have smaller rooms for study and sometimes a social hall and offices. Some have a separate room for [[Torah study]], called the {{Hebrew|\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9}} ''[[beth midrash]]'', lit. \"house of study\".\n\nSynagogues are consecrated spaces used for the purpose of prayer, reading of the [[Tanakh]] (the entire [[Hebrew Bible]], including the [[Torah]]), study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for [[Jewish prayer|worship]]. [[Halakha]] holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews (a [[minyan]]) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue does not replace the long-since destroyed [[Temple in Jerusalem]].\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], the word appears 56 times, mostly in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], but also in the [[Gospel of John]] ({{Bibleref2|John 9:22; 18:20}}) and the [[Book of Revelation]] ({{Bibleref2|Rev. 2:9; 3:9}}). It is used in the sense of 'assembly' in the [[Epistle of James]] ({{Bibleref2|James 2:2}}).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[Israelis]] use the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term ''{{transl|he|beyt knesset}}'' \"house of assembly\". [[Ashkenazi Jews]] have traditionally used the [[Yiddish]] term ''{{transl|yi|shul}}'' (cognate with the [[German language|German]] {{lang|de|Schule}}, 'school') in everyday speech. [[Sephardi Jews]] and [[Romaniote Jews]] generally use the term ''kal'' (from the Hebrew ''\u1e32ahal'', meaning \"community\"). [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jews]] call the synagogue a {{lang|es|sinagoga}} and Portuguese Jews call it an {{lang|pt|esnoga}}. [[Persian Jews]] and some [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]] also use the term ''[[kenesa]]'', which is derived from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and some [[Mizrahi Jews]] use ''kenis''.  Some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews use the word ''temple''. The [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''synagogue'' is used in [[English language|English]] ([[German language|German]], [[French language|French]] and most [[Romance languages|Romance]] languages) to cover the preceding possibilities.<ref>[http://www.jewfaq.org/shul.htm Judaism 101: Synagogues, Shuls and Temples]. Jewfaq.org.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Synagogue_de_la_Ghriba_Djerba_11.jpg|thumb|[[El Ghriba synagogue]], [[Djerba]],  Tunisia]]\nAlthough synagogues existed a long time before the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, communal worship in the time while the Temple still stood centered around the ''[[korban]]ot'' (\"sacrificial offerings\") brought by the ''[[kohen|kohanim]]'' (\"priests\") in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The all-day [[Yom Kippur]] service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the ''kohen gadol'' (\"[[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]\") as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]] (586\u2013537&nbsp;BCE){{citation needed|date=July 2018}} the men of the [[Great Assembly]]{{dubious|No proof it ever existed, possible date of creation hardly reaches that far back, no source quoted.

In fact, the influence from other local religious buildings can often be seen in synagogue arches, domes and towers.\n\nHistorically, synagogues were built in the prevailing architectural style of their time and place. Thus, the synagogue in [[Kaifeng|Kaifeng, China]] looked very like Chinese temples of that region and era, with its outer wall and open garden in which several buildings were arranged. The styles of the earliest synagogues resembled the temples of other cults of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The surviving synagogues of medieval Spain are embellished with [[mud\u00e9jar]] plasterwork. The surviving medieval synagogues in [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] are typical [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] structures.\n\nWith the emancipation of Jews in Western European countries, which not only enabled Jews to enter fields of enterprise from which they were formerly barred, but gave them the right to build synagogues without needing special permissions, synagogue architecture blossomed. Large Jewish communities wished to show not only their wealth but also their newly acquired status as citizens by constructing magnificent synagogues. These were built across Western Europe and in the United States in all of the historicist or revival styles then in fashion. Thus there were [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Neo-Byzantine]], [[Romanesque Revival]], [[Moorish Revival]], [[Gothic Revival]], and [[Greek Revival]]. There are [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues and even one [[Mayan Revival]] synagogue. In the 19th century and early 20th century heyday of historicist architecture, however, most historicist synagogues, even the most magnificent ones, did not attempt a pure style, or even any particular style, and are best described as eclectic.\n\nIn the post-war era, synagogue architecture abandoned historicist styles for modernism.<gallery>\nFile:Synagogue Aleppo.jpg|[[Central Synagogue of Aleppo]], [[Aleppo]], Syria (5th century)\nFile:Kochi Jewish Synagogue C.jpg|[[Paradesi Synagogue]], [[Kochi]], India (1568)\nFile:A\u0161kena\u0161ka sinagoga (14143483781).jpg|Sarajevo Synagogue, [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia and Herzegovina (1902)\nFile:Sofia Synagogue 11c.jpg|[[Sofia Synagogue]], [[Sofia]], Bulgaria (1909)\nFile:Frank Lloyd Wright - Beth Sholom Synagogue - Elkins Park, PA (7175161021).jpg|[[Beth Sholom Congregation (Elkins Park, Pennsylvania)|Beth Sholom Congregation]], [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania|Elkins Park]], USA (1959)\nFile:Synagoge muenchen(softeis) ShiftN cropped.jpg|[[Ohel Jakob synagogue (Munich)|Ohel Jakob synagogue]], Munich, Germany (2006)\n</gallery>\n\n==Interior elements==\n===Bimah (platform)===\nAll synagogues contain a ''[[Bema#Judaism|Bimah]]'', a large, raised, reader's platform (called {{lang|he-Latn|te\u1e07ah}} (reading dais) by Sephardim), where the Torah scroll is placed to be read.

Thus, sanctuary seating plans in the Western world generally face [[Mizrah|east]], while those east of Israel face west. Sanctuaries in Israel face towards Jerusalem. Occasionally synagogues face other directions for structural reasons; in such cases, some individuals might turn to face Jerusalem when standing for prayers, but the congregation as a whole does not.\n\nThe Ark is reminiscent of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which held the tablets inscribed with the [[Ten Commandments]]. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue, equivalent to the [[Holy of Holies]].

As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\nAllan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The Vacy bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\nThe Vacy bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. The Vacy Bridge over Paterson River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Vacy bridge is valued by the people of the Patterson and Vacy districts.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare; in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is representative of Allan truss

Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The Vacy bridge is located in the Hunter region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\nThe Vacy bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. The Vacy Bridge over Paterson River was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Vacy bridge is valued by the people of the Patterson and Vacy districts.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nRare; in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge is representative of Allan truss bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1483/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n* [[Hunter Region]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|date=2007|title=Vacy Bridge over Paterson River|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019597}}\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Vacy Bridge over Paterson River|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301025}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Vacy Bridge over Paterson River|dno=5051387|id=01483|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Truss bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:1898 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1898]]\n[[Category:Dungog Shire]]\n[[Category:Allan truss bridges|Vacy]]\n[[Category:Bridges designed by Percy Allan]]\n[[Category:Wooden bridges in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAttribution:{{Hunter Region places and items of interest}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_River_bridge,_Vacy"}

Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]]. Unlike their predecessor, the Jesuits began their work on Mi'kma'ki by learning the local language and living alongside the [[Mi'kmaq]] in order to instruct and convert them to Catholicism.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.74</ref>\n\nIn 1620, [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]] purchased a tract of land in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] from Sir [[William Vaughan (writer)|William Vaughan]] and established a colony, calling it Avalon, after the legendary spot where [[Christianity]] was introduced to Britain.<ref name=\"Browne, William Hand\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9kwOAAAAIAAJ |title=George Calvert and Cecilius Calvert: Barons Baltimore of Baltimore|publisher=New York: Dodd, Mead, and Company|accessdate=2013-01-23|year=1890}}</ref> In 1627 Calvert brought two Catholic priests to Avalon. This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]]. The [[Province of Avalon|Colony of Avalon]] was thus the first [[North America]]n jurisdiction to practice religious tolerance.<ref name=\"Sir George Calvert\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/avalon.html|title=Sir George Calvert and the Colony of Avalon|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2013-01-23}}</ref>\n\n===British Rule in Canada===\nIn the way of the Canada Conquest in 1759, New France became a British colony. Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s. In the fall of 1998, Newfoundland officially adopted a non-denominational school system, following two referenda and judgements by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and its Court of Appeal that constitutionally recognized the end of provincially-funded Catholic schools.<ref>The Collapse of Denominational Education\" in ''Heritage Newfoundland & Labrador'' by Jenny Higgins, 2011. \u2013, accessed May 29, 2018. https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/collapse-denominational-education.php</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\nIt appears that across Canada the [[Catholic Church]] is declining, resulting in [[Deconsecration|closures]] of more and more churches in all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of country. Identification with [[Catholicism]] (as well as to other sects of [[Christianity]]) in Canada is also declining.

Beginning in 1013, [[Norway]] (presumably also intended to include all her colonies, like [[Orkney]], as later under [[Denmark-Norway]]), came into [[personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of England]], in the rule of [[Sweyn Forkbeard]].\n\nIn 1497, when [[John Cabot]] landed on the same island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], just on the [[Avalon Peninsula]] and nowhere near [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], he raised the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Pope|Papal]] banners and claimed the land for his sponsor King [[Henry VII of England]], while recognizing the religious authority of the Catholic Church.<ref>P D'Epiro, M.D. Pinkowish, \"Sprezzatura: 50 ways Italian genius shaped the world\" pp. 179\u2013180</ref> A letter of John Day states that Cabot landed on 24 June 1497 and \"he landed at only one spot of the mainland, near the place where land was first sighted, and they disembarked there with a crucifix and raised banners with the arms of the Holy Father and those of the King of England\".<ref name=\"The John Day Letter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/exploration/john-day.php|title= The John Day Letter|publisher=heritage.nf.ca|accessdate=2018-05-14}}</ref>\nIn 1608, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded the first Catholic colony in [[Quebec City]].\n\n[[Missionary]] work among Indigenous peoples began in the early 1610s as a stipulated condition to the colonization projects of the King of France. Historian Robert Choquette credits secular priest Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9 as the first to perform dozens of baptisms on Indigenous peoples, which impacted the religious landscape of [[Mi'kma'ki]]. Jess\u00e9 Flech\u00e9's ministry was criticized by Jesuits who believed Flech\u00e9 erred in baptizing neophytes without teaching them the Catholic faith beforehand.<ref>Choquette, Robert. ''Canada's Religions: An Historical Introduction''. Ottawa: University of Ottawa Press (2004) p.63</ref> In 1611, the [[Society of Jesus]] started its missionary work in [[Acadia]].

This was the first continuous Catholic ministry in [[British North America]]. Despite the severe religious conflicts of the period, Calvert secured the right of Catholics to practice their religion unimpeded in Newfoundland, and embraced the novel principle of religious [[toleration|tolerance]], which he wrote into the Charter of Avalon and the later [[Province of Maryland#Founding charter|Charter of Maryland]].

Nevertheless, the [[Catholic Church]] continued to grow in [[Canada]] due to the flexibility imposed on the British regime in Canada by the [[Head of state|sovereigns]] of the [[United Kingdom]] who always spoke in favor of the protection of [[Catholicism]] and [[French-speaking]] people in Canada.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/catholicism |title=Catholicism |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk6KBIoZf4A</ref> This historical perspective still influences Canadian society today.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/why-is-canada-the-most-tolerant-country-in-the-world-luck/article19427921|title=Why is Canada the most tolerant country in the world?

Although the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation Agreement of 1867]] guaranteed the status of Catholic schools where they had been legalized, disputes erupted in numerous provinces, especially in the [[Manitoba]] [[Manitoba Schools Question|Schools Question]]  in the 1890s and [[Ontario]] in the 1910s.<ref>Margaret Prang, \"Clerics, Politicians, and the Bilingual Schools Issue in Ontario, 1910\u20131917.\" ''Canadian Historical Review'' 41.4 (1960): 281-307.</ref> In Ontario, [[Regulation 17]] was a regulation by the Ontario Ministry of Education, that restricted the use of French as a language of instruction to the first two years of schooling. French Canada reacted vehemently and resisted the implementation of the Regulation. This conflict, which was first rooted in linguistic and cultural questions, transformed into a religious divide. In 1915, Ontario clergy was divided between French Canadian and Irish allegiances, with the Irish supporting the position of the provincial government. [[Pope Benedict XV]] asked his Canadian representative to study the divide in order to reestablish unity among the Catholic church in the province of Ontario.<ref>Bock, Michel.

The fact that the Irish Catholics formed coalition with the anti-French Protestants further infuriated the French.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe Irish Catholics collaborated with Protestants inside Canada, on the school issue: they opposed French language Catholic schools. The Irish had a significant advantage since they were favoured by the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Irish Catholicism was \"[[ultramontanism|ultramontane]]\", which meant its adherents professed total obedience to the Pope. By contrast, the French bishops in Canada kept their distance from the Vatican. In the form of [[Regulation 17]] this became the central issue that finally alienated the French in Quebec from the Canadian Anglophone establishment during the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon L.

Tensions were [[Manitoba Schools Question|especially high in Manitoba]] at the end of the 19th century.  In [[Alberta]] in the 1920s, a new Irish bishop undermined French language Catholic schooling, and removed the Francophile order of teaching sisters.<ref>Henry Wostenberg, \"Language Controversy in the Red Deer Catholic Parish, 1924-1932\" ''Alberta History'' (2013) 61#4 [https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-349221834/language-controversy-in-the-red-deer-catholic-parish online]</ref>\n\n=== Newfoundland ===\nIn the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (which was an independent dominion before joining Canada in 1949), politics was polarized around religious lines, with the Protestants confronting the Irish Catholics.<ref>{{cite book|author=John P.

The Protestants narrowly elected [[Hugh Hoyles]] as the Conservative Prime Minister. Hoyles suddenly reversed his long record of militant Protestant activism and worked to defuse tensions. He shared patronage and power with the Catholics; all jobs and patronage were split between the various religious bodies on a per capita basis. This 'denominational compromise' was further extended to education when all religious schools were put on the basis which the Catholics had enjoyed since the 1840s.<ref>Frederick Jones, \"HOYLES, Sir HUGH WILLIAM,\" in ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography'' vol. 11, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003\u2013, accessed May 25, 2015. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/hoyles_hugh_william_11E.html.</ref> Newfoundland's denominational schools were funded by the province until the late 1990s. In the fall of 1998, Newfoundland officially adopted a non-denominational school system, following two referenda and judgements by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and its Court of Appeal that constitutionally recognized the end of provincially-funded Catholic schools.<ref>The Collapse of Denominational Education\" in ''Heritage Newfoundland & Labrador'' by Jenny Higgins, 2011. \u2013, accessed May 29, 2018. https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/collapse-denominational-education.php</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\nIt appears that across Canada the [[Catholic Church]] is declining, resulting in [[Deconsecration|closures]] of more and more churches in all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of country. Identification with [[Catholicism]] (as well as to other sects of [[Christianity]]) in Canada is also declining.
