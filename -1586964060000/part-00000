Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:\n\n<blockquote>[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.</blockquote>\n\n[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.\n\n[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' (c. 1530) by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]\n\nIn Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.\n\n[[File:Robert Willemsz de Baudous - Zlatno doba.jpg|thumb|Robert Willemsz de Baudous: Golden Age, etching, cca 1598.]]\n\nThe [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.\n\n===Arcadia===\nA tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]\n\n==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==\nWriting in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.\n\nVirgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:\n<poem>''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;\n''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:\n''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;\n''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''</poem>\n<poem>'''Translation:'''\n''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung\n''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll\n''Of circling centuries begins anew:\n''Astraea returns,\n''Returns old Saturn's reign,\n''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''<ref>[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&layout=&loc=4.1 5-8)]</ref></poem>\n\nSomewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:\n<poem>\n''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen\n''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.\n''Even this was impious; for the common stock\n''They gathered, and the earth of her own will\n''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''</poem>\n<poem>\n''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni\n''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum\n''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus\n''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125\u201328])</poem>\n\nThis view, which identifies a [[State of nature|State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:\n<poem>\n''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,\n''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:\n''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.\n''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''\n''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;\n''Needless was written law, where none opprest:\n''The law of Man was written in his breast.''<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, \"Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]</ref></poem>\n\nThe Graeco-Roman concept of the \"natural man\" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.<ref>See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on \"The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality\" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)</ref>\n\n==\"Soft\" and \"hard\" primitivism in Arcadia==\nIn his famous essay, \"[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition\",<ref>\"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition,\" in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297\u201398.</ref> [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, \"that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy\":\n\n<blockquote>\nThere had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a \"Gegen-Konstruktion\" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed \"soft\" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas<ref>[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A.O. Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).</ref> conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness \u2013 in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, \"hard\" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts \u2013 in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nArcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of \u201csoft\" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.</blockquote>\n\n==Other Golden Ages==\nThere are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.<ref>Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.</ref>\n\n===Hindu===\nThe Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.\n\nThe [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: <blockquote>Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.</blockquote>\n\nSatya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.<ref>Matsya Purana</ref>\nKnowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga \"because it was the time when all people were happy\".\n\n===Brahma Kumaris===\nThe [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.<ref name=\"4ages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama. The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.\n\nGolden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Norse===\nThe [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally \"Golden Age\") was used in [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]] to describe the period after [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Giml\u00e9]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.\n\n===Bible===\nThere is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.\n\n{{quote|31 \"Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue \u2013 an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>|Daniel 2: 31-35}}\n\nThe interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36\u201345.\n\n===Fantasy===\nIn modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.\n\nFor example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the end of the world, the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].\n\nIn ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the \"Age of Legends\" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] \u2013 trained channelers \u2013 were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole \u2013 The Bore \u2013 being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.\n\nAnother example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.\n\nThe Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> and [[J.

During this age, peace and harmony prevailed in that people did not have to work to feed themselves for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as \"guardians\". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.\n\nIn classical Greek mythology, the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35\u201337|isbn=9780140171990}}</ref> In some versions of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled.

But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars.\" ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).</ref>\n\nEuropean [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.<ref>Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.</ref>\n\n==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==\nThe earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE\u2013350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109\u2013126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:\n\n<blockquote>[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.</blockquote>\n\n[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.\n\n[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' (c. 1530) by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]\n\nIn Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.\n\n[[File:Robert Willemsz de Baudous - Zlatno doba.jpg|thumb|Robert Willemsz de Baudous: Golden Age, etching, cca 1598.]]\n\nThe [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.\n\n===Arcadia===\nA tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]\n\n==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==\nWriting in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.\n\nVirgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:\n<poem>''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;\n''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:\n''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;\n''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''</poem>\n<poem>'''Translation:'''\n''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung\n''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll\n''Of circling centuries begins anew:\n''Astraea returns,\n''Returns old Saturn's reign,\n''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''<ref>[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&layout=&loc=4.1 5-8)]</ref></poem>\n\nSomewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:\n<poem>\n''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen\n''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.\n''Even this was impious; for the common stock\n''They gathered, and the earth of her own will\n''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''</poem>\n<poem>\n''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni\n''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum\n''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus\n''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125\u201328])</poem>\n\nThis view, which identifies a [[State of nature|State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:\n<poem>\n''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,\n''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:\n''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.\n''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''\n''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;\n''Needless was written law, where none opprest:\n''The law of Man was written in his breast.''<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, \"Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]</ref></poem>\n\nThe Graeco-Roman concept of the \"natural man\" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.<ref>See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on \"The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality\" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)</ref>\n\n==\"Soft\" and \"hard\" primitivism in Arcadia==\nIn his famous essay, \"[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition\",<ref>\"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition,\" in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297\u201398.</ref> [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, \"that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy\":\n\n<blockquote>\nThere had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a \"Gegen-Konstruktion\" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed \"soft\" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas<ref>[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A.O. Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).</ref> conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness \u2013 in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, \"hard\" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts \u2013 in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nArcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of \u201csoft\" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.</blockquote>\n\n==Other Golden Ages==\nThere are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.<ref>Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.</ref>\n\n===Hindu===\nThe Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.\n\nThe [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: <blockquote>Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.</blockquote>\n\nSatya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.<ref>Matsya Purana</ref>\nKnowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga \"because it was the time when all people were happy\".\n\n===Brahma Kumaris===\nThe [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.<ref name=\"4ages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama. The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.\n\nGolden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Norse===\nThe [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally \"Golden Age\") was used in [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]] to describe the period after [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Giml\u00e9]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.\n\n===Bible===\nThere is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.\n\n{{quote|31 \"Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue \u2013 an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>|Daniel 2: 31-35}}\n\nThe interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36\u201345.\n\n===Fantasy===\nIn modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.\n\nFor example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the end of the world, the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].\n\nIn ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the \"Age of Legends\" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] \u2013 trained channelers \u2013 were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole \u2013 The Bore \u2013 being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.\n\nAnother example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.\n\nThe Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> and [[J.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles. In 1950, Dal\u00ed created a special \"costume for the year 2045\" with [[Christian Dior]].<ref name=\"designws\">[http://www.designws.com/pagina/1dalieng.htm Dal\u00ed Rotterdam Museum Boijmans].

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nDal\u00ed worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss Dali's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nDal\u00ed worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!

The [[Old Church Slavonic]] (or Old Cyrillic) spelling is {{Script|Cyrs|\u0407\u03c9\u0430\u043d}}.\n\nIt is the Slavic relative of the Latin name ''[[Johannes]]'', corresponding to English ''[[John (first name)|John]]''.<ref>[http://www.mfnames.com/mnames/i/origin-and-meaning-of-ivan.htm MFnames.com - Origin and Meaning of Ivan]</ref>\nThis Slavic version of the name originates from New Testament Greek ''{{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2]]}}'' (''I\u014d\u00e1nn\u0113s'') rather than from the Latin ''Io(h)annes''.

The name is ultimately derived from the Biblical [[Hebrew]] name \u05d9\u05d5\u05d7\u05e0\u05df ({{IPA-he|jo\u03c7anan|pron}}), short for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d7\u05e0\u05df ({{IPA-he|j\u0259ho\u03c7anan|pron}}), meaning \"God is merciful\".

Lawrence has made numerous post-''Mama's Family'' guest TV show appearances in her famed Thelma Harper/Mama role.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Lawrence appeared as the character in a special sketch for ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/movies-specials-more/video/categories/betty-whites-second-annual-90th-birthday-party|title=Video Gallery|publisher=NBC|accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> In addition, she regularly hosts an untelevised stage show, titled ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\n==Early life==\nLawrence was born Vicki Ann Axelrad in [[Inglewood, California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delafont.com/specialty_acts/Vicki-Lawrence.htm |title=VICKI LAWRENCE booking \u2013 Celebrity Actors, Comedians \u2013 Corporate Entertainment Booking|publisher=Delafont.com |date=1949-03-26|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> the daughter of Anne Alene (n\u00e9e Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for [[Max Factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Vicki-Lawrence.html|title=Vicki Lawrence Biography |publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> The family surname was legally changed to \"Lawrence\" when Vicki was young.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> She is a graduate of [[Morningside High School]] in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a [[dental hygienist]]. She attended [[UCLA]] while on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', and  changed her major to [[theater arts]], but dropped out after two years.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group [[The Young Americans]]. She stayed with the group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, performing at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], and performing on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter's ball. A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking resemblance to a young [[Carol Burnett]]. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence's mother urged her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence's father's name in the phone book, called him, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on [[Carol Burnett Show|her upcoming show]]. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got the part, specifically for playing Chrissy in the \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nAfter Lawrence was given the job on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', both Burnett and [[Harvey Korman]] took her under their wings. Korman taught her various sketch comedy skills, such as listening not just for a cue line, and also coached her in other areas, such as speaking in different accents. Lawrence has credited Korman and Burnett with being her mentors, and has referred to her experience on the show as the \"[[Harvard University|Harvard]] school of comedy\". Lawrence has stated that she learned show business from Burnett and looked up to her very much, and that the two share a very close friendship.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Acting===\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|right|225px|On ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', L-R: [[Carol Burnett]], Vicki Lawrence, and [[Dinah Shore]] in the sketch \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\", 1977.]]\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper, 2009]]\nAs a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After ''The Carol Burnett Show'' ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.\n\nHer portrayal of the Mama character on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"The Family\" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]'', elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the [[Eunice Higgins]] character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\nLawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Major Dad]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''. Between the NBC and syndication runs of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot ''Anything for Love'', which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred [[Lauren Tewes]] and [[Rebeca Arthur]]. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and [[Tim Conway]] in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on ''Nunsense Jamboree'' that originally aired on TNN in 1998.\n\nLawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of [[Robby Ray Stewart]] and grandmother of [[Jackson Stewart (character)|Jackson]] and [[Miley Stewart]]) in the hit [[Disney]] series ''Hannah Montana'' alongside [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and his daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].\n\nLawrence played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio. Lawrence played Dan's old high-school flame, Phyllis, in an episode of ''Roseanne''. She also appeared in a special celebrity-edition episode of the [[Anne Robinson]] version of ''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]''. Playing for a charity, she made it to the final two, but ended up losing to [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]\n\n===Music===\nAs a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated ''Johnny Mann's Stand Up And Cheer'' program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit, \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", a song written by her first husband [[Bobby Russell]], which was released on [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] in November 1972. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314 314\u2013315]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314\n}}</ref> During the last episode of the sixth season of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (March 24, 1973), Lawrence received her gold record by surprise from Carol Burnett. Her first LP, ''[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (Vicki Lawrence album)|The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]'', was issued soon after the single went gold. The song was re-recorded by [[Reba McEntire]] for her 1991 album [[For My Broken Heart]]. McEntire released the track as a single to country radio in 1992 and it peaked at #12 on the country chart, aided in part by a highly cinematic music video.\n\n\"He Did With Me\", Lawrence's followup to \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", reached number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the [[adult contemporary music]] charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. She followed it up there with \"Ships in the Night\" (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed one last minor U.S. chart entry on the [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] label with \"The Other Woman\" (number 81).\n\nIn 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, ''Ships in the Night''. The label was in the process of being bought out by [[Arista Records|Arista]], and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrence's first two LPs were released as a single CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.\n\nShe released a [[disco]] album entitled ''Newborn Woman'' late in 1979. The album produced the minor disco hit \"Don't Stop the Music\".\n\n===Hosting and other work===\nAs an emcee, she hosted the daytime NBC version of the game show ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', as well as an unsold pilot for [[Mark Goodson]] Productions, 1990's ''Body Talk'', and has also appeared often as a popular panelist on such game shows as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Password Plus]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'', and various incarnations of the [[Pyramid (game show)|''Pyramid'' game show]], where she was known for verbally sparring with host [[Dick Clark]] on numerous occasions. She also appeared on the 1986-89 version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', where she appeared both as herself and in character as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper. Lawrence was nominated a number of times for a [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host]] for the eponymous ''[[Vicki!]]'' (1992\u20131994), but the show ended after two seasons amid creative battles with her syndicator. In 1997, she hosted ''[[Fox After Breakfast]],'' which was renamed ''The Vicki Lawrence Show'',<ref name=\"Fox After Breakfast\">{{cite web |last1=Levin |first1=Mark |title=Fox remakes \u2018Breakfast\u2019|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-remakes-breakfast-1116678259/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref> but was cancelled five weeks later due to low ratings.<ref name=\"Vicki Lawrence Show\">{{cite web |last1=Littlton |first1=Cynthia |title=Fox axes \u2018Vicki\u2019; ankles ayem|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-axes-vicki-ankles-ayem-111662675/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>  \n\nShe tours the country with her \"two-woman\" show with the first half as herself and the second half done as Mama.  She can also be seen on TV in an infomercial for the Big Boss Grill. She is also known for her voice-over work as Flo on the animated series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]''.\n\nIn 2018, Lawrence was seen promoting ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and other classic television series on the [[MeTV]] television network.\n\n==Personal life==\nLawrence was married to singer and songwriter Bobby Russell from 1972 to 1974. Lawrence's second husband is Hollywood make-up artist Al Schultz, to whom she has been married since November 16, 1974, and with whom she has two children, Courtney Allison Schultz (born May 5, 1975) and Garrett Lawrence Schultz (born July 3, 1977).\n\nLawrence and her family appeared on ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' in July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity Family Feud:Joey Lawrence vs. Mario Lopez/Ed Asner vs. Vicki Lawrence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4854762|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=2015-08-02}}</ref>\n\nLawrence was diagnosed with [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]] (CIU) around 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIU&You|url=http://www.ciuandyou.com|publisher=Ciuandyou.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref> She teamed with the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]] and has become the spokesperson for the campaign CIU & You.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedienne, Actress Vicki Lawrence Teams Up with AAFA To Talk About Chronic Skin Condition|url=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7388251-aafa-ciu-and-you-campaign|publisher=Multivu.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared on ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' in 2015 to relay her story and talk about CIU and promote the CIU & You campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=VICKI LAWRENCE\u2019S CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION|url=http://www.thedoctorstv.com/articles/2959-vicki-lawrence-s-chronic-health-condition|publisher=Thedoctorstv.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Selected film and television roles\n|-\n!

One such character was \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" matriarch [[Thelma Harper|Thelma Harper/Mama]], the cold, unaffectionate mother of the neurotic, misfortunate, [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]] (Burnett) although Lawrence is 16 years younger than Burnett. Thelma Harper was the central character of the television situation comedy series  ''[[Mama's Family]]'' on [[NBC]] and, later, in first-run syndication. She also starred in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom series ''[[The Cool Kids (TV series)|The Cool Kids]]''.\n\nIn 1973, she became a [[one-hit wonder]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. chart]] with \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\". It reached number one on both the United States and Canada charts. Lawrence has multiple [[Emmy Award]] nominations, winning one in 1976.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/1976/outstanding-continuing-or-single-performance-by-a-supporting-actress-in-variety-or-music|title=Nominees/Winners|work=Television Academy|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref>\n\nShe is also a multiple [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominee, all for ''The Carol Burnett Show''. Lawrence has made numerous post-''Mama's Family'' guest TV show appearances in her famed Thelma Harper/Mama role.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Lawrence appeared as the character in a special sketch for ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/movies-specials-more/video/categories/betty-whites-second-annual-90th-birthday-party|title=Video Gallery|publisher=NBC|accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref> In addition, she regularly hosts an untelevised stage show, titled ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\n==Early life==\nLawrence was born Vicki Ann Axelrad in [[Inglewood, California]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delafont.com/specialty_acts/Vicki-Lawrence.htm |title=VICKI LAWRENCE booking \u2013 Celebrity Actors, Comedians \u2013 Corporate Entertainment Booking|publisher=Delafont.com |date=1949-03-26|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> the daughter of Anne Alene (n\u00e9e Loyd) and Howard Axelrad, a certified public accountant for [[Max Factor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Vicki-Lawrence.html|title=Vicki Lawrence Biography |publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=2012-03-31}}</ref> The family surname was legally changed to \"Lawrence\" when Vicki was young.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref> She is a graduate of [[Morningside High School]] in Inglewood, class of 1967. Lawrence had originally planned on being a [[dental hygienist]]. She attended [[UCLA]] while on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', and  changed her major to [[theater arts]], but dropped out after two years.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn high school, she auditioned for and got into the musical group [[The Young Americans]]. She stayed with the group almost until the end of high school. By being with the group, she gained experience from touring, performing at the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], coming in contact with noteworthy performers such as [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], and performing on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nIn her senior year, she entered the Miss Fireball of Inglewood contest for the local firefighter's ball. A reporter for a local newspaper wrote a story about the contest and stated that Lawrence bore a striking resemblance to a young [[Carol Burnett]]. An avid fan letter-writer, Lawrence's mother urged her to write a letter, which Lawrence did, including the newspaper article.\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Burnett found Lawrence's father's name in the phone book, called him, and said she would go to see the Miss Fireball contest. Lawrence won the contest and Burnett was called to the stage to crown her. Coincidentally, Burnett was looking for an actress to play her younger sister on [[Carol Burnett Show|her upcoming show]]. After a few months and auditions, Lawrence got the part, specifically for playing Chrissy in the \"Carol and Sis\" sketches.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\nAfter Lawrence was given the job on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', both Burnett and [[Harvey Korman]] took her under their wings. Korman taught her various sketch comedy skills, such as listening not just for a cue line, and also coached her in other areas, such as speaking in different accents. Lawrence has credited Korman and Burnett with being her mentors, and has referred to her experience on the show as the \"[[Harvard University|Harvard]] school of comedy\". Lawrence has stated that she learned show business from Burnett and looked up to her very much, and that the two share a very close friendship.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Acting===\n[[File:Carol Burnett Vicki Lawrence Dinah Shore Carol Burnett Show 1977.JPG|thumb|right|225px|On ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', L-R: [[Carol Burnett]], Vicki Lawrence, and [[Dinah Shore]] in the sketch \"[[Went with the Wind!]]\", 1977.]]\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper, 2009]]\nAs a comedian and actress, Lawrence is known for her work on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', of which she was a part from 1967 to 1978. She was the only cast member, except for Burnett herself, who stayed on the show for the entire 11 seasons. After ''The Carol Burnett Show'' ended in 1978, Lawrence and her husband Al Schultz moved with their children to Maui, Hawaii, but after a few years, returned to Los Angeles, where they have remained.\n\nHer portrayal of the Mama character on ''The Carol Burnett Show's'' \"The Family\" sketches was so popular that NBC subsequently created the sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]'', elaborating on the Mama character. (Burnett reprised the [[Eunice Higgins]] character for the sitcom from time to time.) The series ran from 1983 to 1985 on NBC; after its cancellation from NBC, it was renewed from 1986 to 1990 in first-run syndication. The show was more successful in the renewed version. She also reprised the Mama character on stage for ''Vicki Lawrence & Mama: A Two-Woman Show''.\n\nLawrence has made appearances on other programs, such as the sitcoms ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'', ''[[Major Dad]]'', ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''. Between the NBC and syndication runs of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', Lawrence starred in the 1985 comedy pilot ''Anything for Love'', which aired as a special on CBS that summer and co-starred [[Lauren Tewes]] and [[Rebeca Arthur]]. Lawrence has also appeared with Burnett, Korman, and [[Tim Conway]] in the Burnett show retrospectives that were broadcast in 1993, 2001, and 2004. Lawrence played Sister Mary Paul (Sister Amnesia) in the TV special based on ''Nunsense Jamboree'' that originally aired on TNN in 1998.\n\nLawrence played Mamaw Stewart (the mother of [[Robby Ray Stewart]] and grandmother of [[Jackson Stewart (character)|Jackson]] and [[Miley Stewart]]) in the hit [[Disney]] series ''Hannah Montana'' alongside [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and his daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].\n\nLawrence played as Mama in an Ohio commercial, promoting a constitutional amendment that would permit casino gambling in Ohio. Lawrence played Dan's old high-school flame, Phyllis, in an episode of ''Roseanne''. She also appeared in a special celebrity-edition episode of the [[Anne Robinson]] version of ''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|The Weakest Link]]''. Playing for a charity, she made it to the final two, but ended up losing to [[Ed Begley, Jr.]]\n\n===Music===\nAs a singer, Lawrence got her start as one of the scores of hopefuls on the syndicated ''Johnny Mann's Stand Up And Cheer'' program. However, she is most known for her number-one hit, \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", a song written by her first husband [[Bobby Russell]], which was released on [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] in November 1972. It sold over two million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in April 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314 314\u2013315]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/314\n}}</ref> During the last episode of the sixth season of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' (March 24, 1973), Lawrence received her gold record by surprise from Carol Burnett. Her first LP, ''[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia (Vicki Lawrence album)|The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]'', was issued soon after the single went gold. The song was re-recorded by [[Reba McEntire]] for her 1991 album [[For My Broken Heart]]. McEntire released the track as a single to country radio in 1992 and it peaked at #12 on the country chart, aided in part by a highly cinematic music video.\n\n\"He Did With Me\", Lawrence's followup to \"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\", reached number 75 in the United States, although it reached the top 20 of the [[adult contemporary music]] charts and also became her biggest hit in Australia, peaking at number one there in November 1973. She followed it up there with \"Ships in the Night\" (1974). In the fall of 1975, Lawrence managed one last minor U.S. chart entry on the [[Private Stock Records|Private Stock]] label with \"The Other Woman\" (number 81).\n\nIn 1974, she recorded her second LP for Bell Records, ''Ships in the Night''. The label was in the process of being bought out by [[Arista Records|Arista]], and the LP was not released in the U.S. The LP was, however, released in Australia, where she continued to have chart success. Lawrence's first two LPs were released as a single CD with bonus tracks on April 1, 2014, by Real Gone Music.\n\nShe released a [[disco]] album entitled ''Newborn Woman'' late in 1979. The album produced the minor disco hit \"Don't Stop the Music\".\n\n===Hosting and other work===\nAs an emcee, she hosted the daytime NBC version of the game show ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', as well as an unsold pilot for [[Mark Goodson]] Productions, 1990's ''Body Talk'', and has also appeared often as a popular panelist on such game shows as ''[[Match Game]]'', ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Password Plus]]'', ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'', and various incarnations of the [[Pyramid (game show)|''Pyramid'' game show]], where she was known for verbally sparring with host [[Dick Clark]] on numerous occasions. She also appeared on the 1986-89 version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', where she appeared both as herself and in character as Thelma \"Mama\" Harper. Lawrence was nominated a number of times for a [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Host]] for the eponymous ''[[Vicki!]]'' (1992\u20131994), but the show ended after two seasons amid creative battles with her syndicator. In 1997, she hosted ''[[Fox After Breakfast]],'' which was renamed ''The Vicki Lawrence Show'',<ref name=\"Fox After Breakfast\">{{cite web |last1=Levin |first1=Mark |title=Fox remakes \u2018Breakfast\u2019|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-remakes-breakfast-1116678259/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref> but was cancelled five weeks later due to low ratings.<ref name=\"Vicki Lawrence Show\">{{cite web |last1=Littlton |first1=Cynthia |title=Fox axes \u2018Vicki\u2019; ankles ayem|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/fox-axes-vicki-ankles-ayem-111662675/ |website=Variety |accessdate=August 15, 2019}}</ref>  \n\nShe tours the country with her \"two-woman\" show with the first half as herself and the second half done as Mama.  She can also be seen on TV in an infomercial for the Big Boss Grill. She is also known for her voice-over work as Flo on the animated series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]''.\n\nIn 2018, Lawrence was seen promoting ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and other classic television series on the [[MeTV]] television network.\n\n==Personal life==\nLawrence was married to singer and songwriter Bobby Russell from 1972 to 1974. Lawrence's second husband is Hollywood make-up artist Al Schultz, to whom she has been married since November 16, 1974, and with whom she has two children, Courtney Allison Schultz (born May 5, 1975) and Garrett Lawrence Schultz (born July 3, 1977).\n\nLawrence and her family appeared on ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' in July 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrity Family Feud:Joey Lawrence vs. Mario Lopez/Ed Asner vs. Vicki Lawrence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4854762|publisher=IMDB.com|accessdate=2015-08-02}}</ref>\n\nLawrence was diagnosed with [[chronic idiopathic urticaria]] (CIU) around 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=CIU&You|url=http://www.ciuandyou.com|publisher=Ciuandyou.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref> She teamed with the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]] and has become the spokesperson for the campaign CIU & You.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comedienne, Actress Vicki Lawrence Teams Up with AAFA To Talk About Chronic Skin Condition|url=http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7388251-aafa-ciu-and-you-campaign|publisher=Multivu.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\nShe appeared on ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' in 2015 to relay her story and talk about CIU and promote the CIU & You campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=VICKI LAWRENCE\u2019S CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION|url=http://www.thedoctorstv.com/articles/2959-vicki-lawrence-s-chronic-health-condition|publisher=Thedoctorstv.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Selected film and television roles\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "URL", "text_new": "{{short description|Web address to a particular file or page}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{other uses}}\nA '''Uniform Resource Locator''' ('''URL'''), colloquially termed a '''web address''',{{sfnp|W3C|2009}} is a reference to a [[web resource]] that specifies its location on a [[computer network]] and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zzz.buzz/2017/09/19/forward-and-backslashes-in-urls/|title=Forward and Backslashes in URLs|website=zzz.buzz|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>{{sfnp|RFC 3986|2005}} although many people use the two terms interchangeably.{{sfnp|Joint W3C/IETF URI Planning Interest Group|2002}}{{efn|A URL implies the means to access an indicated resource and is denoted by a protocol or an access mechanism, which is not true of every URI.{{sfnp|RFC 2396|1998}}{{sfnp|Joint W3C/IETF URI Planning Interest Group|2002}}  Thus <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//www.example.com</code> is a URL, while <code>www.example.com</code> is not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://danielmiessler.com/study/url-uri/#gs.Hs64zOs|title=The Difference Between URLs and URIs|last=Miessler|first=Daniel}}</ref>}} URLs occur most commonly to reference [[web page]]s ([[http]]), but are also used for file transfer ([[File Transfer Protocol|ftp]]), email ([[mailto]]), database access ([[Java Database Connectivity|JDBC]]), and many other applications.\n\nMost [[web browser]]s display the URL of a web page above the page in an [[address bar]]. A typical URL could have the form <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//www.example.com/index.html</code>, which indicates a protocol (<code>http</code>), a [[hostname]] (<code>www.example.com</code>), and a file name (<code>index.html</code>).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Uniform Resource Locator.svg|thumb|Uniform Resource Locator simple example]]\nUniform Resource Locators were defined in {{IETF RFC|1738}} in 1994 by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], and the URI working group of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF),{{sfnp|W3C|1994}} as an outcome of collaboration started at the IETF Living Documents [[Birds of a feather (computing)|birds of a feather]] session in 1992.{{sfnp|IETF|1992}}{{sfnp|Berners-Lee|1994}}\n\nThe format combines the pre-existing system of [[domain name]]s (created in 1985) with [[Path (computing)|file path]] syntax, where [[Slash (punctuation)|slashes]] are used to separate [[Folder (computing)|directory]] and [[filename]]s. Conventions already existed where server names could be prefixed to complete file paths, preceded by a double slash (<code>//</code>).{{sfnp|Berners-Lee|2000}}\n\nBerners-Lee later expressed regret at the use of dots to separate the parts of the [[domain name]] within [[URI]]s, wishing he had used slashes throughout,{{sfnp|Berners-Lee|2000}} and also said that, given the colon following the first component of a URI, the two slashes before the domain name were unnecessary.{{sfnp|BBC News|2009}}\n\nAn early (1993) draft of the HTML Specification<ref>{{cite techreport |title=Hypertext Markup Language (draft RFCxxx) |first1=Tim |last1=Berners-Lee |first2=Daniel |last2=Connolly |date=March 1993 |page=28 |url=https://www.ucc.ie/archive/curia/dtds/html-spec.ps}}</ref> referred to \"Universal\" Resource Locators.

URLs using the <code>https</code> scheme require that requests and responses be made over a [[HTTPS|secure connection to the website]].\n\n==Internationalized URL==\nInternet users are distributed throughout the world using a wide variety of languages and alphabets and expect to be able to create URLs in their own local alphabets. An Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) is a form of URL that includes Unicode characters.  All modern browsers support IRIs. The parts of the URL requiring special treatment for different alphabets are the domain name and path.{{sfnp|W3C|2008}}{{sfnp|W3C|2014}}\n\nThe domain name in the IRI is known as an [[Internationalized Domain Name|Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)]]. Web and Internet software automatically convert the domain name into [[punycode]] usable by the Domain Name System; for example, the Chinese URL <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//\u4f8b\u5b50.\u5377\u7b52\u7eb8</code> becomes <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//xn--fsqu00a.xn--3lr804guic/</code>. The <code>xn--</code> indicates that the character was not originally ASCII.{{sfnp|IANA|2003}}\n\nThe URL path name can also be specified by the user in the local writing system.  If not already encoded, it is converted to [[UTF-8]], and any characters not part of the basic URL character set are escaped as [[hexadecimal]] using [[percent-encoding]]; for example, the Japanese URL <code><nowiki> http:</nowiki>//example.com/\u5f15\u304d\u5272\u308a.html</code> becomes <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//example.com/%E5%BC%95%E3%81%8D%E5%89%B2%E3%82%8A.html</code>. The target computer decodes the address and displays the page.{{sfnp|W3C|2008}}\n\n==Protocol-relative URLs {{anchor|prurl}}<!--section is linked from other pages-->==\nProtocol-relative links (PRL), also known as protocol-relative URLs (PRURL), are URLs that have no protocol specified. For example, <code>//example.com</code> will use the protocol of the current page, typically HTTP or HTTPS.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u2sBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA193 |title=Secure Development for Mobile Apps: How to Design and Code Secure Mobile Applications with PHP and JavaScript |publisher=CRC Press |author= J.

A typical URL could have the form <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//www.example.com/index.html</code>, which indicates a protocol (<code>http</code>), a [[hostname]] (<code>www.example.com</code>), and a file name (<code>index.html</code>).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Uniform Resource Locator.svg|thumb|Uniform Resource Locator simple example]]\nUniform Resource Locators were defined in {{IETF RFC|1738}} in 1994 by [[Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], and the URI working group of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF),{{sfnp|W3C|1994}} as an outcome of collaboration started at the IETF Living Documents [[Birds of a feather (computing)|birds of a feather]] session in 1992.{{sfnp|IETF|1992}}{{sfnp|Berners-Lee|1994}}\n\nThe format combines the pre-existing system of [[domain name]]s (created in 1985) with [[Path (computing)|file path]] syntax, where [[Slash (punctuation)|slashes]] are used to separate [[Folder (computing)|directory]] and [[filename]]s. Conventions already existed where server names could be prefixed to complete file paths, preceded by a double slash (<code>//</code>).{{sfnp|Berners-Lee|2000}}\n\nBerners-Lee later expressed regret at the use of dots to separate the parts of the [[domain name]] within [[URI]]s, wishing he had used slashes throughout,{{sfnp|Berners-Lee|2000}} and also said that, given the colon following the first component of a URI, the two slashes before the domain name were unnecessary.{{sfnp|BBC News|2009}}\n\nAn early (1993) draft of the HTML Specification<ref>{{cite techreport |title=Hypertext Markup Language (draft RFCxxx) |first1=Tim |last1=Berners-Lee |first2=Daniel |last2=Connolly |date=March 1993 |page=28 |url=https://www.ucc.ie/archive/curia/dtds/html-spec.ps}}</ref> referred to \"Universal\" Resource Locators.

URLs using the <code>https</code> scheme require that requests and responses be made over a [[HTTPS|secure connection to the website]].\n\n==Internationalized URL==\nInternet users are distributed throughout the world using a wide variety of languages and alphabets and expect to be able to create URLs in their own local alphabets. An Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) is a form of URL that includes Unicode characters.  All modern browsers support IRIs. The parts of the URL requiring special treatment for different alphabets are the domain name and path.{{sfnp|W3C|2008}}{{sfnp|W3C|2014}}\n\nThe domain name in the IRI is known as an [[Internationalized Domain Name|Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)]]. Web and Internet software automatically convert the domain name into [[punycode]] usable by the Domain Name System; for example, the Chinese URL <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//\u4f8b\u5b50.\u5377\u7b52\u7eb8</code> becomes <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//xn--fsqu00a.xn--3lr804guic/</code>. The <code>xn--</code> indicates that the character was not originally ASCII.{{sfnp|IANA|2003}}\n\nThe URL path name can also be specified by the user in the local writing system.  If not already encoded, it is converted to [[UTF-8]], and any characters not part of the basic URL character set are escaped as [[hexadecimal]] using [[percent-encoding]]; for example, the Japanese URL <code><nowiki> http:</nowiki>//example.com/\u5f15\u304d\u5272\u308a.html</code> becomes <code><nowiki>http:</nowiki>//example.com/%E5%BC%95%E3%81%8D%E5%89%B2%E3%82%8A.html</code>. The target computer decodes the address and displays the page.{{sfnp|W3C|2008}}\n\n==Protocol-relative URLs {{anchor|prurl}}<!--section is linked from other pages-->==\nProtocol-relative links (PRL), also known as protocol-relative URLs (PRURL), are URLs that have no protocol specified. For example, <code>//example.com</code> will use the protocol of the current page, typically HTTP or HTTPS.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u2sBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA193 |title=Secure Development for Mobile Apps: How to Design and Code Secure Mobile Applications with PHP and JavaScript |publisher=CRC Press |author= J.

Not every probability distribution has a defined mean; see the [[Cauchy distribution]] for an example. Moreover, for some distributions the mean is infinite.\n\nFor a finite population, the '''population mean''' of a property is equal to the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height is equal to the sum of the heights of every individual divided by the total number of individuals.

In other applications, they represent a measure for the reliability of the influence upon the mean by the respective values.\n\n===Truncated mean===\nSometimes a set of numbers might contain outliers, i.e., data values which are much lower or much higher than the others.\nOften, outliers are erroneous data caused by [[artifact (observational)|artifacts]]. In this case, one can use a [[truncated mean]]. It involves discarding given parts of the data at the top or the bottom end, typically an equal amount at each end and then taking the arithmetic mean of the remaining data. The number of values removed is indicated as a percentage of the total number of values.\n\n===Interquartile mean===\nThe [[interquartile mean]] is a specific example of a truncated mean. It is simply the arithmetic mean after removing the lowest and the highest quarter of values.\n: <math>\\bar{x} = \\frac{2}{n} \\;\\sum_{i = \\frac{n}{4} + 1}^{\\frac{3}{4}n}\\!\\! x_i</math>\n\nassuming the values have been ordered, so is simply a specific example of a weighted mean for a specific set of weights.\n\n===Mean of a function===\n{{main|Mean of a function}}\nIn some circumstances mathematicians may calculate a mean of an infinite (even an [[uncountable]]) set of values. This can happen when calculating the mean value <math>y_\\text{ave}</math> of a function <math>f(x)</math>. Intuitively this can be thought of as calculating the area under a section of a curve and then dividing by the length of that section. This can be done crudely by counting squares on graph paper or more precisely by [[integral|integration]]. The integration formula is written as:\n\n: <math>y_\\text{ave}(a, b) = \\frac{1}{b - a} \\int\\limits_a^b\\! f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nCare must be taken to make sure that the integral converges. But the mean may be finite even if the function itself tends to infinity at some points.\n\n===Mean of angles and cyclical quantities===\n[[Angle]]s, times of day, and other cyclical quantities require [[modular arithmetic]] to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, there will not be a unique mean. For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that no mean exists. Consider a [[color wheel]]\u2014there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a [[Mean of circular quantities|specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities]].\n\n=== Fr\u00e9chet mean ===\nThe [[Fr\u00e9chet mean]] gives a manner for determining the \"center\" of a mass distribution on a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] or, more generally, [[Riemannian manifold]]. Unlike many other means, the Fr\u00e9chet mean is defined on a space whose elements cannot necessarily be added together or multiplied by scalars.\nIt is sometimes also known as the '''Karcher mean''' (named after Hermann Karcher).\n\n===Other means===\n{{main cat|Means}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Arithmetic-geometric mean]]\n*[[Arithmetic-harmonic mean]]\n*[[Ces\u00e0ro mean]]\n*[[Chisini mean]]\n*[[Contraharmonic mean]]\n*[[Elementary symmetric mean]]\n*[[Geometric-harmonic mean]]\n*[[Grand mean]]\n*[[Heinz mean]]\n*[[Heronian mean]]\n*[[Identric mean]]\n*[[Lehmer mean]]\n*[[Logarithmic mean]]\n*[[Moving average]]\n*[[Neuman\u2013S\u00e1ndor mean]]\n*[[Root mean square]] (quadratic mean)\n*[[R\u00e9nyi's entropy]] (a [[generalized f-mean]])\n*[[Spherical mean]]\n*[[Stolarsky mean]]\n*[[Weighted geometric mean]]\n*[[Weighted harmonic mean]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Distribution of the sample mean==\n{{main|Standard error of the mean}}\n\nThe arithmetic mean of a [[Statistical population|population]], or population mean, is often denoted ''\u03bc''.

The sample mean is a [[random variable]], not a constant, since its calculated value will randomly differ depending on which members of the population are sampled, and consequently it will have its own distribution.

{"title_page": "Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII", "text_new": "{{Main article|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s.

The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis]] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]], to the Vatican, it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval.

This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision.

[[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made, to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refusing to participate were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" assumed all functions of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained only gradually ground in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost three thousand and three-hundred [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]] and [[newspapers]]. 11.500 [[Religious]] were asked to leave their convents and monasteries and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreements with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism were the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]]. They resulted in a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After coup of the communist party in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/>\nPope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and received him in the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d, mentally and physically, beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]]... The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956, when, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] he was freed. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Imperial Japan had developed [[State Shinto]] as the Imperial religion and promoted the notion of the [[Arahitogami|divinity of the Emperor]].

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations, interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded, by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis]] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion, that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]], to the Vatican, it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within month of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943, within a short interval.

This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living.

At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the Papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> He{{Clarify|date=May 2019}} also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested.

The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nAfter the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce major results, aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which he claimed{{Clarify|post-text=(who claimed?)|date=May 2019}} was identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic Churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. Catholic Lithuania suffered especially in the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war, in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.\nPope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. [[Cum Jam Lustri]] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issues [[Poloniae Annalibus]], giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end.

[[Gloriosam Reginam]] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory of the queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nIn 1957, Pope Pius addressed with ''[[Invicti athletae]]'' in strong words the Polish episcopate, which celebrated the 300th. Anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] through the Russians. \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church\" The Pope asks for endurance and bravery.

After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made, to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refusing to participate were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" assumed all functions of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained only gradually ground in the country.

The Church attempted to come to agreements with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism were the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]]. They resulted in a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944.

None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d, mentally and physically, beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]]...

Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

His parents, Br\u00edgida Garc\u00eda and Marcelino Ju\u00e1rez, were [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] [[peasant]]s and died of complications of diabetes when he was three years old.

In the city, where his sister worked as a cook, he took a job as a domestic servant for Antonio Maza.<ref name=\"Presidencia\" />\n\nHis formal education began when a lay Franciscan and bookbinder, Antonio Salanueva, was impressed by Ju\u00e1rez's intelligence and desire for learning. Salanueva arranged for his placement at the city's seminary so that he could train to become a priest. His earlier education was rudimentary, but he began studying Latin, completing the secondary curriculum too young to be ordained.  Ju\u00e1rez had no calling to become a priest and began studying law at the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez Autonomous University of Oaxaca|Institute of Sciences and Arts]], founded in 1827 in the state capital. It was a center of liberal intellectual life in Oaxaca and Ju\u00e1rez graduated from it in 1834.  Even prior to his graduation, he sought political office, and was elected to the Oaxaca city council in 1831. In 1841, he was appointed a civil judge.<ref name=StevensP333/>\n\nIn 1843, when he was in his late 30s, Ju\u00e1rez married [[Margarita Maza]], the daughter of his sister's patron. The family was of European origin and part of Oaxaca's upper-class society. With the marriage Ju\u00e1rez gained social standing.

His political affiliation with liberalism developed at the Institute of Arts and Science and his ability to rise in Oaxaca state politics was due to the lack of an entrenched political class of [[criollo people|criollos]], Mexicans of European descent. The relative openness of the system allowed him and other newcomers to enter politics and gain patronage.<ref>Hamnett, ''Ju\u00e1rez'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref> He developed a political base and gained an understanding of political maneuvering.

Faced with growing opposition, Santa Anna was forced to resign in 1855.\n\n===The Liberal Reform===\n[[File:Juan Alvarez.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Juan \u00c1lvarez]], liberal strongman, who formed a provisional government after the ouster of Santa Anna in 1855.]]\nWith Santa Anna's resignation, Ju\u00e1rez had returned to Mexico and became part of the activist ''liberales'' (Liberals). A provisional government was formed under General [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]], inaugurating the period known as [[La Reforma]], or Liberal Reform. Ju\u00e1rez served as Minister of Justice and ecclesiastical affairs, and it was during this time that Ju\u00e1rez drafted the law named after him, the [[Ju\u00e1rez Law]], which declared all citizens equal before the law and restricted the privileges (''fueros'') of the Catholic Church and the Mexican army. President \u00c1lvarez signed the draft into law in 1855.<ref name=StevensP334>Stevens, \"Benito Ju\u00e1rez\", p. 334.</ref> The Reform laws sponsored by the ''puro'' (pure) wing of the Liberal Party curtailed the power of the Catholic Church, confiscating Church land, and restricting the military, while trying to create a modern civil society and capitalist economy based on the model of the United States. The Ley Ju\u00e1rez was subsequently incorporated into the Mexican [[Constitution of 1857]], but Ju\u00e1rez had no role in that document's drafting, since he had returned to Oaxaca where he served again as governor.<ref name=StevensP334/>\n\n[[File:TAYLOR (1894) Juarez (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Undated photo of Ju\u00e1rez.]]\nThe new liberal [[Constitution of 1857]] was promulgated and the new President, [[Ignacio Comonfort]], appointed Ju\u00e1rez as Minister of Government in November 1857. He was then elected President of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court of Justice]], an office that virtually put its holder as the successor to the President of the Republic.<ref name=StevensP334/> Conservatives led by General [[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Zuloaga]], with the backing of the military and the clergy and under the slogan ''Religi\u00f3n y Fueros'' (Religion and Privilege), launched a revolt under the [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico#Plan of Tacubaya|Plan of Tacubaya]] on 17 December 1857. Comonfort sought to placate the rebels by appointing several conservatives to the Cabinet, dissolving the Congress, and implementing most of the Tacubaya Plan. Ju\u00e1rez, Ignacio Olvera, and many other liberal deputies and ministers were arrested. The actions did not go far enough for the rebels, and on 11 January 1858, Zuloaga demanded Comonfort's resignation. Comonfort then re-established the Congress, liberated all prisoners and then resigned as President. The conservative forces proclaimed Zuloaga as President on 21 January.\n\n===Interim President (1857-1861)===\n\nMeanwhile, under the terms of the 1857 Constitution, the President of the Supreme Court of Justice became interim President of Mexico until a new election could be held. Ju\u00e1rez was thus acknowledged as president by liberals on 15 January 1858 and assumed leadership of the Liberal side of the civil war known as the [[Reform War]] (''Guerra de Reforma''), (1858\u201360).\n\n====Reform War (1858-1860)====\n\nAs Zuloaga's men were in control of Mexico City, Ju\u00e1rez and his government fled, first to [[Quer\u00e9taro]] and later to [[Veracruz]], whose customs revenues were used to fund the government's expenditure.\n\n====In Veracruz====\n[[File:Benito_Juarez_Oleo_(480x600).png|thumb|right|225px|Benito Juarez, President of Mexico.]]\n\nOn May 4, 1858, Ju\u00e1rez arrived in Veracruz<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mexico: An Encyclopedia of Contemporary Culture and History|last=|first=|publisher=abc-clio|year=2004|isbn=|location=Denver, Colorado; Oxford, England|pages=245\u2013246}}</ref> where the government of Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Zamora was stationed with [[Ignacio de la Llave|General Ignacio de la Llave]]. His wife and children were waiting for his arrival on the dock of the Veracruz\u2019s port, along with a large part of the population that had flooded the pier to greet him. There, Ju\u00e1rez lived many months without any unexpected occurrences until [[Miguel Miram\u00f3n]]\u2019s attack who finally found and moved toward the port on March 30, 1859. On April 6th, Ju\u00e1rez received a diplomatic representative of the United States Government: [[Robert Milligan McLane]]. Following this visit, a treaty between the US and Ju\u00e1rez's government, the [[McLane\u2013Ocampo Treaty|McLane-Ocampo Treaty]], was signed in December 1859, although President [[James Buchanan]] was unable to secure ratification of the treaty by the US Congress. Nevertheless, the aid received enabled the liberals to overcome the conservatives' initial military advantage; Ju\u00e1rez's government successfully defended Veracruz from assault twice during 1860 and recaptured Mexico City on 1 January 1861.\n\n====Nationalization of clerical wealth====\n\nOn July 12 of 1859, Ju\u00e1rez decreed the first regulations of the \u201cLaw of Nationalization of the Ecclesiastical Wealth.\u201d This enactment prohibited the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]] from having properties in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Life of Benito Juarez: Constitutional President of Mexico|last=Burke|first=Ulick Ralph|publisher=Remington and Company|year=1894|isbn=|location=London and Sydney|pages=94\u201396}}</ref> Because of Ju\u00e1rez's Law of Nationalization, the Catholic Church and the regular army supported the Conservatives in the Reform War. On the other hand, the Liberals had the support of several state governments in the north and central-west of the country, as well as that of Buchanan's government.\n\nDue to the initial weakness of the Ju\u00e1rez administration, conservatives F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Zuloaga and Leonardo M\u00e1rquez had the opportunity to reclaim power. To resolve this, Ju\u00e1rez petitioned Congress to be given emergency powers. The liberal members of Congress denied the petition with the main argument being that the country was under a current constitutional government that had been achieved only through a very bloody civil war. It was not consistent for Ju\u00e1rez, who had implemented that constitution, now to wish to violate the legal functions of the Constitution by giving himself dictatorial powers. However, after two groups of conservatives ambushed and killed [[Melchor Ocampo|Ocampo]] and later [[Santos Degollado]] in 1861, the liberals were outraged and Ju\u00e1rez took \"extreme measures\" to deal with the conservatives. After the scandal of Ocampo's murder, the liberal-majority Congress gave Ju\u00e1rez the money and power that he needed to finish off the conservatives.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Concise History of Mexico|last=Hamnett|first=Brian R.|publisher=Cambridge|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}</ref>\n\nJu\u00e1rez had excellent finances during his administration. His Government achieved a budget deficit of 400,000 pesos every month. However, he was only able to collect one million pesos by selling church lands.\n\n[[File:Benito_Ju\u00e1rez,_siglo_XIX,_\u00f3leo_sobre_tela.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Presidency of the Republic.]]\n[[File:Retrato_de_Benito_Ju\u00e1rez,_1861-1862.png|thumb|left|Picture of Benito Ju\u00e1rez, 1861-1862. Nacional History Museum. Castle of Chapultepec.]]\n\n===Constitutional Presidency (1861-1862)===\n\nAfter the defeat of the Conservatives on the battlefield, in March 1861 elections were held with Ju\u00e1rez elected President in his own right under the Constitution of 1857. However, the Liberals' celebrations of 1861 were short-lived. The war had severely damaged Mexico's infrastructure and crippled its economy. Even though the Conservatives had been defeated, they would not disappear, and the Ju\u00e1rez government had to respond to pressures from these factions. He was forced to grant amnesty to captured Conservative guerrillas still resisting the Ju\u00e1rez government, even though they had executed captured Liberals, including [[Melchor Ocampo]] and [[Santos Degollado]]. In the wake of the civil war and the demobilization of combatants, Ju\u00e1rez established the Rural Guard or [[Rurales]], aimed at bringing public security, particularly as banditry and rural unrest grew. Many brigands and bandits had allied themselves with the Liberal cause during the civil war. With that conflict concluded, many became guerrillas and bandits again, when the government jobs they demanded as rewards for their services to the Republic were not forthcoming. Ju\u00e1rez's Minister of the Interior, Francisco Zarco, oversaw the founding of the ''Rurales''. The creation of the police force controlled by the President was done quietly because it violated federalist principles of traditional Liberalism, which gave little power to the central government and much to Mexican states. The force's creation was an indication that Ju\u00e1rez was becoming more of a centralist as he confronted rural unrest. As a pragmatic solution, the force consisted of former bandits converted into policemen.<ref>Paul J. Vanderwood, ''Disorder and Progress: Bandits, Police, and Mexican Development''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1981, pp. 46\u201350.</ref>\n\nJu\u00e1rez's government also faced international dangers. In view of the government's desperate financial straits, Ju\u00e1rez canceled repayments of interest on foreign loans that had been taken out by the defeated conservatives. Spain, Britain and France, angry over unpaid Mexican debts, sent a joint expeditionary force that seized the Veracruz Customs House in December 1861. Spain and Britain soon withdrew after they realized that the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] intended to overthrow the Ju\u00e1rez government and establish a [[Second Mexican Empire]], with the support of the remnants of the Conservative side in the Reform War. Thus began the [[French intervention in Mexico|French invasion]] in 1862 and the outbreak of an even longer war, with Liberals attempting to oust the foreign invaders and their Conservative allies and save the Republic.\n\n==French Intervention (1862\u201367)==\n[[File:BenitoJuarez.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Benito Juarez]]\n\nAlthough republican forces under [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] won an initial victory over the monarchists on 5 May 1862, the [[Battle of Puebla]], celebrated annually as [[Cinco de Mayo]], forcing the French to retreat to the coast for a year, the French advanced again in 1863, and captured Mexico City.  Ju\u00e1rez and his elected government fled the capital and became a government in exile, with little power or territorial control. Ju\u00e1rez headed north, first to [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], then to the arid northern city of El Paso del Norte, present day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], and finally to the capital of the state, [[Chihuahua City]], where he set up his cabinet. There, he would remain for the next two and a half years. Meanwhile, Maximilian von Habsburg, younger brother of Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria]], was proclaimed Emperor as [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] on 20 April 1864 with the backing of [[Napoleon III]] and a group of Mexican conservatives.\n\nBefore Ju\u00e1rez fled, Congress granted him an emergency extension of his presidency, which would go into effect in 1865, when his term expired, and would last until 1867, when the last of Maximilian's forces were defeated.\n\n[[File:Paseo Ju\u00e1rez \"El Llano\" 04.JPG|thumb|right|Sculpture of Ju\u00e1rez in the Historic Center of Oaxaca. Ju\u00e1rez holds a Mexican flag with one hand and with the other is pointing at Maximilian's Crown which remains in the soil, representing the defeat of imperialism.]]\nIn response to the French invasion and the elevation of Maximilian as Emperor of Mexico with the support of Mexican conservatives, Ju\u00e1rez sent General [[Pl\u00e1cido Vega y Daza]] to California to gather [[Mexican American]] sympathy for the plight of republican Mexico. Maximilian offered Ju\u00e1rez amnesty and later even the post of prime minister, but Ju\u00e1rez refused to accept a government \"imposed by foreigners\" or a monarchy. The government of the United States was sympathetic to Ju\u00e1rez, refusing to recognize Maximilian and opposing the French invasion as a violation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], but its attention was entirely taken up by the [[American Civil War]]. Ju\u00e1rez's wife, [[Margarita Maza]], and their children spent the invasion in exile in New York where she met several times with U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who received her as the First Lady of Mexico. Although much has been made of a connection between Ju\u00e1rez and [[Abraham Lincoln]], as two presidents who shared humble social origins, a law career, a rapidly-ascending political career in their home states, and a presidency that began under the auspices of a civil war that made long-lasting reform a necessity, they never met nor exchanged correspondence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Leonard |title=Lincoln and Juarez-A Brief Reassessment of Their Relationship |journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review |date=1968 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201380 |doi=10.2307/2511401 |jstor=2511401 }}</ref> Following the end of the war, U.S. President [[Andrew Johnson]] demanded the French evacuate Mexico and imposed a naval blockade in February 1866.\n\nWhen Johnson could get no support in Congress, he allegedly had the Army \"lose\" some supplies (including rifles) \"near\" (across) the border with Mexico, according to U.S. General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s journal account.<ref>(General Philip Sheridan wrote in his journal about how he \"misplaced\" about 30,000 muskets).

Maximilian's liberal views had cost him support from Mexican conservatives as well. In 1867, the last of the Emperor's forces were defeated and Maximilian was sentenced to death by a military court, a retaliation for Maximilian's earlier orders for the execution of republican soldiers (although some historians point to the fact that the original \"Black Decree\" was from Ju\u00e1rez \u2013 who had people executed, without trial, for \"helping\" his enemies, whereas Maximilian often pardoned people who had actually fought against him). Despite national and international pleas for amnesty, Ju\u00e1rez refused to commute the sentence, and Maximilian was [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on 19 June 1867 at [[Cerro de las Campanas]] in Quer\u00e9taro. His last words had been \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\". His body was returned to [[Vienna]] for burial.\n\n==Restored Republic (1867-1872)==\n[[File:Benito Juarez 1.jpg|thumb|right|Daguerreotype of Benito Ju\u00e1rez as president of Mexico.]]\n\nThe period following the expulsion of the French and up to the revolt of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] in 1876 are now commonly known in Mexico as the \"Restored Republic\". The period includes the last years of the Ju\u00e1rez presidency and following his death in 1872, that of Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada. Ju\u00e1rez did not leave power following the end of the French invasion. He won in a relatively clean manner the 1867 election and immediately requested and obtained special powers from Congress to rule by decree. Despite being forbidden to do so by the 1857 constitution, Ju\u00e1rez once again ran for re-election in 1871.\n\nHe began instituting major reforms that had constitutional force because of the Constitution of 1857 that could not be implemented due to the War of the Reform 1858\u20131860, and the French Intervention (1862\u201367). One such reform was in education.  An elite preparatory school was founded in Mexico City in 1868, the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria|National Preparatory School]].\n\nAmid fraud charges and widespread controversy, he was re-elected for a new term in 1871. During his last two terms, he used the office of the presidency to ensure electoral success, obtain personal gains and suppress revolts by opponents, such as [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]].\n\nOn February 7, 1866, Juarez was elected as a Companion of the Third Class (i.e. honorary member) of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] (MOLLUS).  MOLLUS is a hereditary military society originally composed of officers who served in the Union armed forces during the [[American Civil War]] and now composed of their descedants.  Juarez was one of the very few foreigners to be elected to membership in the Order.  He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 156.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:PanteonSanFernando20141102 ohs05.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Benito Ju\u00e1rez. The remains of his wife [[Margarita Maza]] are buried in the same mausoleum.]]\nJu\u00e1rez died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on July 18, 1872, while reading a newspaper at his desk in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in Mexico City, aged 66. He was succeeded by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]], the head of the Supreme Court and a close political ally.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Mexico.DF.HemicicloJuarez.01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Benito Ju\u00e1rez Hemicycle|Monument to Ju\u00e1rez]] in central Mexico City, built by his old political rival [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] to commemorate the centenary of Ju\u00e1rez's 1806 birth.]]\nToday Benito Ju\u00e1rez is remembered as being a progressive reformer dedicated to democracy, equal rights for his nation's indigenous peoples, his antipathy toward organized religion, especially the Catholic Church, and what he regarded as defense of national sovereignty. The period of his leadership is known in Mexican history as ''La Reforma del Norte'' (The Reform of the North), and constituted a liberal political and social revolution with major institutional consequences: the expropriation of church lands, the subordination of the army to [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]], liquidation of peasant communal land holdings, the separation of church and state in public affairs, and also the almost-complete disenfranchisement of bishops, priests, nuns and lay brothers, codified in the \"[[Ju\u00e1rez Law]]\" or \"Ley Ju\u00e1rez\".<ref>{{cite web |title=La ley Ju\u00e1rez, de 23 de noviembre de 1855 |url=http://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/libros/2/999/19.pdf }}</ref>\n\n''[[La Reforma]]'' represented the triumph of Mexico's liberal, federalist, [[Anti-clericalism in Latin America#Reform War|anti-clerical]], and pro-capitalist forces over the conservative, centralist, [[Corporatism|corporatist]], and [[Theocracy|theocratic]] elements that sought to reconstitute a locally-run version of the old colonial system. It replaced a semi-feudal social system with a more market-driven one, but following Ju\u00e1rez's death, the lack of adequate democratic and institutional stability soon led to a return to centralized autocracy and economic exploitation under the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. The ''Porfiriato'' (1876\u20131911), in turn, collapsed at the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\n==Historical memory==\n'''Ju\u00e1rez Complex National Palace'''\n\nIn the National Palace in Mexico City, where he lived while in power, there is a small museum in his honour.

Salanueva arranged for his placement at the city's seminary so that he could train to become a priest. His earlier education was rudimentary, but he began studying Latin, completing the secondary curriculum too young to be ordained.  Ju\u00e1rez had no calling to become a priest and began studying law at the [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez Autonomous University of Oaxaca|Institute of Sciences and Arts]], founded in 1827 in the state capital. It was a center of liberal intellectual life in Oaxaca and Ju\u00e1rez graduated from it in 1834.  Even prior to his graduation, he sought political office, and was elected to the Oaxaca city council in 1831. In 1841, he was appointed a civil judge.<ref name=StevensP333/>\n\nIn 1843, when he was in his late 30s, Ju\u00e1rez married [[Margarita Maza]], the daughter of his sister's patron.

His political affiliation with liberalism developed at the Institute of Arts and Science and his ability to rise in Oaxaca state politics was due to the lack of an entrenched political class of [[criollo people|criollos]], Mexicans of European descent. The relative openness of the system allowed him and other newcomers to enter politics and gain patronage.<ref>Hamnett, ''Ju\u00e1rez'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref> He developed a political base and gained an understanding of political maneuvering.

Faced with growing opposition, Santa Anna was forced to resign in 1855.\n\n===The Liberal Reform===\n[[File:Juan Alvarez.PNG|thumb|right|upright|[[Juan \u00c1lvarez]], liberal strongman, who formed a provisional government after the ouster of Santa Anna in 1855.]]\nWith Santa Anna's resignation, Ju\u00e1rez had returned to Mexico and became part of the activist ''liberales'' (Liberals). A provisional government was formed under General [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]], inaugurating the period known as [[La Reforma]], or Liberal Reform. Ju\u00e1rez served as Minister of Justice and ecclesiastical affairs, and it was during this time that Ju\u00e1rez drafted the law named after him, the [[Ju\u00e1rez Law]], which declared all citizens equal before the law and restricted the privileges (''fueros'') of the Catholic Church and the Mexican army. President \u00c1lvarez signed the draft into law in 1855.<ref name=StevensP334>Stevens, \"Benito Ju\u00e1rez\", p. 334.</ref> The Reform laws sponsored by the ''puro'' (pure) wing of the Liberal Party curtailed the power of the Catholic Church, confiscating Church land, and restricting the military, while trying to create a modern civil society and capitalist economy based on the model of the United States. The Ley Ju\u00e1rez was subsequently incorporated into the Mexican [[Constitution of 1857]], but Ju\u00e1rez had no role in that document's drafting, since he had returned to Oaxaca where he served again as governor.<ref name=StevensP334/>\n\n[[File:TAYLOR (1894) Juarez (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Undated photo of Ju\u00e1rez.]]\nThe new liberal [[Constitution of 1857]] was promulgated and the new President, [[Ignacio Comonfort]], appointed Ju\u00e1rez as Minister of Government in November 1857. He was then elected President of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court of Justice]], an office that virtually put its holder as the successor to the President of the Republic.<ref name=StevensP334/> Conservatives led by General [[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Zuloaga]], with the backing of the military and the clergy and under the slogan ''Religi\u00f3n y Fueros'' (Religion and Privilege), launched a revolt under the [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico#Plan of Tacubaya|Plan of Tacubaya]] on 17 December 1857. Comonfort sought to placate the rebels by appointing several conservatives to the Cabinet, dissolving the Congress, and implementing most of the Tacubaya Plan. Ju\u00e1rez, Ignacio Olvera, and many other liberal deputies and ministers were arrested. The actions did not go far enough for the rebels, and on 11 January 1858, Zuloaga demanded Comonfort's resignation. Comonfort then re-established the Congress, liberated all prisoners and then resigned as President. The conservative forces proclaimed Zuloaga as President on 21 January.\n\n===Interim President (1857-1861)===\n\nMeanwhile, under the terms of the 1857 Constitution, the President of the Supreme Court of Justice became interim President of Mexico until a new election could be held. Ju\u00e1rez was thus acknowledged as president by liberals on 15 January 1858 and assumed leadership of the Liberal side of the civil war known as the [[Reform War]] (''Guerra de Reforma''), (1858\u201360).\n\n====Reform War (1858-1860)====\n\nAs Zuloaga's men were in control of Mexico City, Ju\u00e1rez and his government fled, first to [[Quer\u00e9taro]] and later to [[Veracruz]], whose customs revenues were used to fund the government's expenditure.\n\n====In Veracruz====\n[[File:Benito_Juarez_Oleo_(480x600).png|thumb|right|225px|Benito Juarez, President of Mexico.]]\n\nOn May 4, 1858, Ju\u00e1rez arrived in Veracruz<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mexico: An Encyclopedia of Contemporary Culture and History|last=|first=|publisher=abc-clio|year=2004|isbn=|location=Denver, Colorado; Oxford, England|pages=245\u2013246}}</ref> where the government of Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Zamora was stationed with [[Ignacio de la Llave|General Ignacio de la Llave]]. His wife and children were waiting for his arrival on the dock of the Veracruz\u2019s port, along with a large part of the population that had flooded the pier to greet him. There, Ju\u00e1rez lived many months without any unexpected occurrences until [[Miguel Miram\u00f3n]]\u2019s attack who finally found and moved toward the port on March 30, 1859. On April 6th, Ju\u00e1rez received a diplomatic representative of the United States Government: [[Robert Milligan McLane]]. Following this visit, a treaty between the US and Ju\u00e1rez's government, the [[McLane\u2013Ocampo Treaty|McLane-Ocampo Treaty]], was signed in December 1859, although President [[James Buchanan]] was unable to secure ratification of the treaty by the US Congress. Nevertheless, the aid received enabled the liberals to overcome the conservatives' initial military advantage; Ju\u00e1rez's government successfully defended Veracruz from assault twice during 1860 and recaptured Mexico City on 1 January 1861.\n\n====Nationalization of clerical wealth====\n\nOn July 12 of 1859, Ju\u00e1rez decreed the first regulations of the \u201cLaw of Nationalization of the Ecclesiastical Wealth.\u201d This enactment prohibited the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]] from having properties in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Life of Benito Juarez: Constitutional President of Mexico|last=Burke|first=Ulick Ralph|publisher=Remington and Company|year=1894|isbn=|location=London and Sydney|pages=94\u201396}}</ref> Because of Ju\u00e1rez's Law of Nationalization, the Catholic Church and the regular army supported the Conservatives in the Reform War. On the other hand, the Liberals had the support of several state governments in the north and central-west of the country, as well as that of Buchanan's government.\n\nDue to the initial weakness of the Ju\u00e1rez administration, conservatives F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Zuloaga and Leonardo M\u00e1rquez had the opportunity to reclaim power. To resolve this, Ju\u00e1rez petitioned Congress to be given emergency powers. The liberal members of Congress denied the petition with the main argument being that the country was under a current constitutional government that had been achieved only through a very bloody civil war. It was not consistent for Ju\u00e1rez, who had implemented that constitution, now to wish to violate the legal functions of the Constitution by giving himself dictatorial powers. However, after two groups of conservatives ambushed and killed [[Melchor Ocampo|Ocampo]] and later [[Santos Degollado]] in 1861, the liberals were outraged and Ju\u00e1rez took \"extreme measures\" to deal with the conservatives. After the scandal of Ocampo's murder, the liberal-majority Congress gave Ju\u00e1rez the money and power that he needed to finish off the conservatives.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Concise History of Mexico|last=Hamnett|first=Brian R.|publisher=Cambridge|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}</ref>\n\nJu\u00e1rez had excellent finances during his administration. His Government achieved a budget deficit of 400,000 pesos every month. However, he was only able to collect one million pesos by selling church lands.\n\n[[File:Benito_Ju\u00e1rez,_siglo_XIX,_\u00f3leo_sobre_tela.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Presidency of the Republic.]]\n[[File:Retrato_de_Benito_Ju\u00e1rez,_1861-1862.png|thumb|left|Picture of Benito Ju\u00e1rez, 1861-1862. Nacional History Museum. Castle of Chapultepec.]]\n\n===Constitutional Presidency (1861-1862)===\n\nAfter the defeat of the Conservatives on the battlefield, in March 1861 elections were held with Ju\u00e1rez elected President in his own right under the Constitution of 1857. However, the Liberals' celebrations of 1861 were short-lived. The war had severely damaged Mexico's infrastructure and crippled its economy. Even though the Conservatives had been defeated, they would not disappear, and the Ju\u00e1rez government had to respond to pressures from these factions. He was forced to grant amnesty to captured Conservative guerrillas still resisting the Ju\u00e1rez government, even though they had executed captured Liberals, including [[Melchor Ocampo]] and [[Santos Degollado]]. In the wake of the civil war and the demobilization of combatants, Ju\u00e1rez established the Rural Guard or [[Rurales]], aimed at bringing public security, particularly as banditry and rural unrest grew. Many brigands and bandits had allied themselves with the Liberal cause during the civil war. With that conflict concluded, many became guerrillas and bandits again, when the government jobs they demanded as rewards for their services to the Republic were not forthcoming. Ju\u00e1rez's Minister of the Interior, Francisco Zarco, oversaw the founding of the ''Rurales''. The creation of the police force controlled by the President was done quietly because it violated federalist principles of traditional Liberalism, which gave little power to the central government and much to Mexican states. The force's creation was an indication that Ju\u00e1rez was becoming more of a centralist as he confronted rural unrest. As a pragmatic solution, the force consisted of former bandits converted into policemen.<ref>Paul J. Vanderwood, ''Disorder and Progress: Bandits, Police, and Mexican Development''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1981, pp. 46\u201350.</ref>\n\nJu\u00e1rez's government also faced international dangers. In view of the government's desperate financial straits, Ju\u00e1rez canceled repayments of interest on foreign loans that had been taken out by the defeated conservatives. Spain, Britain and France, angry over unpaid Mexican debts, sent a joint expeditionary force that seized the Veracruz Customs House in December 1861. Spain and Britain soon withdrew after they realized that the French Emperor [[Napoleon III]] intended to overthrow the Ju\u00e1rez government and establish a [[Second Mexican Empire]], with the support of the remnants of the Conservative side in the Reform War. Thus began the [[French intervention in Mexico|French invasion]] in 1862 and the outbreak of an even longer war, with Liberals attempting to oust the foreign invaders and their Conservative allies and save the Republic.\n\n==French Intervention (1862\u201367)==\n[[File:BenitoJuarez.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Benito Juarez]]\n\nAlthough republican forces under [[Ignacio Zaragoza]] won an initial victory over the monarchists on 5 May 1862, the [[Battle of Puebla]], celebrated annually as [[Cinco de Mayo]], forcing the French to retreat to the coast for a year, the French advanced again in 1863, and captured Mexico City.  Ju\u00e1rez and his elected government fled the capital and became a government in exile, with little power or territorial control. Ju\u00e1rez headed north, first to [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], then to the arid northern city of El Paso del Norte, present day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], and finally to the capital of the state, [[Chihuahua City]], where he set up his cabinet. There, he would remain for the next two and a half years. Meanwhile, Maximilian von Habsburg, younger brother of Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria]], was proclaimed Emperor as [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] on 20 April 1864 with the backing of [[Napoleon III]] and a group of Mexican conservatives.\n\nBefore Ju\u00e1rez fled, Congress granted him an emergency extension of his presidency, which would go into effect in 1865, when his term expired, and would last until 1867, when the last of Maximilian's forces were defeated.\n\n[[File:Paseo Ju\u00e1rez \"El Llano\" 04.JPG|thumb|right|Sculpture of Ju\u00e1rez in the Historic Center of Oaxaca. Ju\u00e1rez holds a Mexican flag with one hand and with the other is pointing at Maximilian's Crown which remains in the soil, representing the defeat of imperialism.]]\nIn response to the French invasion and the elevation of Maximilian as Emperor of Mexico with the support of Mexican conservatives, Ju\u00e1rez sent General [[Pl\u00e1cido Vega y Daza]] to California to gather [[Mexican American]] sympathy for the plight of republican Mexico. Maximilian offered Ju\u00e1rez amnesty and later even the post of prime minister, but Ju\u00e1rez refused to accept a government \"imposed by foreigners\" or a monarchy. The government of the United States was sympathetic to Ju\u00e1rez, refusing to recognize Maximilian and opposing the French invasion as a violation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], but its attention was entirely taken up by the [[American Civil War]]. Ju\u00e1rez's wife, [[Margarita Maza]], and their children spent the invasion in exile in New York where she met several times with U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who received her as the First Lady of Mexico. Although much has been made of a connection between Ju\u00e1rez and [[Abraham Lincoln]], as two presidents who shared humble social origins, a law career, a rapidly-ascending political career in their home states, and a presidency that began under the auspices of a civil war that made long-lasting reform a necessity, they never met nor exchanged correspondence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Leonard |title=Lincoln and Juarez-A Brief Reassessment of Their Relationship |journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review |date=1968 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=75\u201380 |doi=10.2307/2511401 |jstor=2511401 }}</ref> Following the end of the war, U.S. President [[Andrew Johnson]] demanded the French evacuate Mexico and imposed a naval blockade in February 1866.\n\nWhen Johnson could get no support in Congress, he allegedly had the Army \"lose\" some supplies (including rifles) \"near\" (across) the border with Mexico, according to U.S. General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s journal account.<ref>(General Philip Sheridan wrote in his journal about how he \"misplaced\" about 30,000 muskets).

Maximilian's liberal views had cost him support from Mexican conservatives as well. In 1867, the last of the Emperor's forces were defeated and Maximilian was sentenced to death by a military court, a retaliation for Maximilian's earlier orders for the execution of republican soldiers (although some historians point to the fact that the original \"Black Decree\" was from Ju\u00e1rez \u2013 who had people executed, without trial, for \"helping\" his enemies, whereas Maximilian often pardoned people who had actually fought against him). Despite national and international pleas for amnesty, Ju\u00e1rez refused to commute the sentence, and Maximilian was [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on 19 June 1867 at [[Cerro de las Campanas]] in Quer\u00e9taro. His last words had been \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\". His body was returned to [[Vienna]] for burial.\n\n==Restored Republic (1867-1872)==\n[[File:Benito Juarez 1.jpg|thumb|right|Daguerreotype of Benito Ju\u00e1rez as president of Mexico.]]\n\nThe period following the expulsion of the French and up to the revolt of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] in 1876 are now commonly known in Mexico as the \"Restored Republic\". The period includes the last years of the Ju\u00e1rez presidency and following his death in 1872, that of Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada. Ju\u00e1rez did not leave power following the end of the French invasion. He won in a relatively clean manner the 1867 election and immediately requested and obtained special powers from Congress to rule by decree. Despite being forbidden to do so by the 1857 constitution, Ju\u00e1rez once again ran for re-election in 1871.\n\nHe began instituting major reforms that had constitutional force because of the Constitution of 1857 that could not be implemented due to the War of the Reform 1858\u20131860, and the French Intervention (1862\u201367). One such reform was in education.  An elite preparatory school was founded in Mexico City in 1868, the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria|National Preparatory School]].\n\nAmid fraud charges and widespread controversy, he was re-elected for a new term in 1871. During his last two terms, he used the office of the presidency to ensure electoral success, obtain personal gains and suppress revolts by opponents, such as [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]].\n\nOn February 7, 1866, Juarez was elected as a Companion of the Third Class (i.e. honorary member) of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] (MOLLUS).  MOLLUS is a hereditary military society originally composed of officers who served in the Union armed forces during the [[American Civil War]] and now composed of their descedants.  Juarez was one of the very few foreigners to be elected to membership in the Order.  He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 156.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:PanteonSanFernando20141102 ohs05.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Benito Ju\u00e1rez. The remains of his wife [[Margarita Maza]] are buried in the same mausoleum.]]\nJu\u00e1rez died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on July 18, 1872, while reading a newspaper at his desk in the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in Mexico City, aged 66. He was succeeded by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]], the head of the Supreme Court and a close political ally.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Mexico.DF.HemicicloJuarez.01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Benito Ju\u00e1rez Hemicycle|Monument to Ju\u00e1rez]] in central Mexico City, built by his old political rival [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] to commemorate the centenary of Ju\u00e1rez's 1806 birth.]]\nToday Benito Ju\u00e1rez is remembered as being a progressive reformer dedicated to democracy, equal rights for his nation's indigenous peoples, his antipathy toward organized religion, especially the Catholic Church, and what he regarded as defense of national sovereignty. The period of his leadership is known in Mexican history as ''La Reforma del Norte'' (The Reform of the North), and constituted a liberal political and social revolution with major institutional consequences: the expropriation of church lands, the subordination of the army to [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]], liquidation of peasant communal land holdings, the separation of church and state in public affairs, and also the almost-complete disenfranchisement of bishops, priests, nuns and lay brothers, codified in the \"[[Ju\u00e1rez Law]]\" or \"Ley Ju\u00e1rez\".<ref>{{cite web |title=La ley Ju\u00e1rez, de 23 de noviembre de 1855 |url=http://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/libros/2/999/19.pdf }}</ref>\n\n''[[La Reforma]]'' represented the triumph of Mexico's liberal, federalist, [[Anti-clericalism in Latin America#Reform War|anti-clerical]], and pro-capitalist forces over the conservative, centralist, [[Corporatism|corporatist]], and [[Theocracy|theocratic]] elements that sought to reconstitute a locally-run version of the old colonial system. It replaced a semi-feudal social system with a more market-driven one, but following Ju\u00e1rez's death, the lack of adequate democratic and institutional stability soon led to a return to centralized autocracy and economic exploitation under the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]. The ''Porfiriato'' (1876\u20131911), in turn, collapsed at the beginning of the [[Mexican Revolution]].\n\n==Historical memory==\n'''Ju\u00e1rez Complex National Palace'''\n\nIn the National Palace in Mexico City, where he lived while in power, there is a small museum in his honour.
