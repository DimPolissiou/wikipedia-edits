Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as \"gay\" or \"straight\" rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter in order to maintain a person's [[sexual identity]] and sense of community; a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a \"gay man\" and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual man in [[heteronormative]] society.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=[[SpringerLink]] |doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0737-2_14 |title = Denial|pages=219\u2013230 |year = 1989|last1 = Friedman|first1 = Richard C.|isbn=978-1-4612-8057-6 |chapter=Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men }}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[Bisexual.org]], author and columnist Zachary Zane cites a study showing that 20.7% of straight-identified men watched [[gay pornography]] and 7.5% reported having sex with a man in the past six months, while 55% of gay-identified men had watched heterosexual pornography and 0.7% reported having sex with a woman in the past six months. He argues that some of the straight-identified men are actually gay or bisexual but are erasing their bisexuality due to internalized biphobia and denial in order to claim a straight identity label. Pointing out that the majority of gay-identified men watched heterosexual pornography but few had recent heterosexual sex, he suggests that many self-identified gay men have sexual fantasies about women and in an ideal world would be openly bisexual and freely explore sex with women, but society pressures gay men to \"pick a side\" so those men \"subsequently have picked being gay\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zane|first1=Zachary|title=1 in 5 Straight-Identifying Men Watch Same-sex Porn: Are They All Closeted|url=https://bisexual.org/1-in-5-straight-identifying-men-watch-same-sex-porn-are-they-all-closeted/|website=Bisexual.org|publisher=The American Institute of Bisexuality|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBisexual author and activist [[Robyn Ochs]] has argued that gay men are less possessive of their \"gay\" label than [[lesbians]] are of their label. She argues that there is less hostility to bisexual men who identify as gay than bisexual women who identify as lesbian, that there is a great deal of [[sexual fluidity]] between gay men and bisexual men, and that consequently more gay-identified men openly admit to being attracted to and having sex with women. However, Ochs also argues that many bisexual men identify as gay in order to politically align themselves with the gay community. She says that since coming out is so difficult for gay men, many do not want to come out a second time as bisexual; the existence of male bisexuality can be threatening to some gay men because it raises the possibility that they themselves might be bisexual.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robynochs.com/biphobia-it-goes-more-than-two-ways/ |title=BIPHOBIA: IT GOES MORE THAN TWO WAYS |publisher=[[Robyn Ochs|robynochs.com]] |accessdate=2017-10-22|date=2015-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nGay male activist [[Carl Wittman]], writing in his \"Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto\", argued that gay men should identify as \"gay\" rather than as \"bisexual\", even if they sleep with women. Stating that gay men should only become bisexual once society accepts homosexuality, he wrote that:{{quote|Bisexuality is good; it is the capacity to love people of either sex. The reason so few of us are bisexual is because society made such a big stink about homosexuality that we got forced into seeing ourselves as either straight or non-straight. Also, many gays go turned off to the ways men are supposed to act with women and vice-versa, which is pretty f---ed-up. Gays will begin to turn on to women when 1) it's something that we do because we want to, and not because we should, and 2) when women's liberation changes the nature of heterosexual relationships. We continue to call ourselves homosexual, not bisexual, even if we do make it with the opposite sex also, because saying \"Oh, I'm Bi\" is a copout for a gay. We get told it's OK to sleep with guys as long as we sleep with women, too, and that's still putting homosexuality down. We'll be gay until everyone has forgotten that it's an issue.

Despite being bisexual in fantasy and activity, these men identify as \"gay\" or \"straight\" rather than as bisexual. This erasure of bisexuality is sometimes caused by denying the significance of an erotic encounter in order to maintain a person's [[sexual identity]] and sense of community; a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a woman in order to maintain his identity as a \"gay man\" and his membership in the gay community, or a man might downplay having had sexual fantasies or encounters with a man in order to maintain his status as a heterosexual man in [[heteronormative]] society.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=[[SpringerLink]] |doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0737-2_14 |title = Denial|pages=219\u2013230 |year = 1989|last1 = Friedman|first1 = Richard C.|isbn=978-1-4612-8057-6 |chapter=Denial in the Development of Homosexual Men }}</ref>\n\nWriting for [[Bisexual.org]], author and columnist Zachary Zane cites a study showing that 20.7% of straight-identified men watched [[gay pornography]] and 7.5% reported having sex with a man in the past six months, while 55% of gay-identified men had watched heterosexual pornography and 0.7% reported having sex with a woman in the past six months. He argues that some of the straight-identified men are actually gay or bisexual but are erasing their bisexuality due to internalized biphobia and denial in order to claim a straight identity label. Pointing out that the majority of gay-identified men watched heterosexual pornography but few had recent heterosexual sex, he suggests that many self-identified gay men have sexual fantasies about women and in an ideal world would be openly bisexual and freely explore sex with women, but society pressures gay men to \"pick a side\" so those men \"subsequently have picked being gay\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zane|first1=Zachary|title=1 in 5 Straight-Identifying Men Watch Same-sex Porn: Are They All Closeted|url=https://bisexual.org/1-in-5-straight-identifying-men-watch-same-sex-porn-are-they-all-closeted/|website=Bisexual.org|publisher=The American Institute of Bisexuality|date=October 20, 2016|accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nBisexual author and activist [[Robyn Ochs]] has argued that gay men are less possessive of their \"gay\" label than [[lesbians]] are of their label. She argues that there is less hostility to bisexual men who identify as gay than bisexual women who identify as lesbian, that there is a great deal of [[sexual fluidity]] between gay men and bisexual men, and that consequently more gay-identified men openly admit to being attracted to and having sex with women. However, Ochs also argues that many bisexual men identify as gay in order to politically align themselves with the gay community. She says that since coming out is so difficult for gay men, many do not want to come out a second time as bisexual; the existence of male bisexuality can be threatening to some gay men because it raises the possibility that they themselves might be bisexual.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robynochs.com/biphobia-it-goes-more-than-two-ways/ |title=BIPHOBIA: IT GOES MORE THAN TWO WAYS |publisher=[[Robyn Ochs|robynochs.com]] |accessdate=2017-10-22|date=2015-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nGay male activist [[Carl Wittman]], writing in his \"Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto\", argued that gay men should identify as \"gay\" rather than as \"bisexual\", even if they sleep with women. Stating that gay men should only become bisexual once society accepts homosexuality, he wrote that:{{quote|Bisexuality is good; it is the capacity to love people of either sex. The reason so few of us are bisexual is because society made such a big stink about homosexuality that we got forced into seeing ourselves as either straight or non-straight. Also, many gays go turned off to the ways men are supposed to act with women and vice-versa, which is pretty f---ed-up. Gays will begin to turn on to women when 1) it's something that we do because we want to, and not because we should, and 2) when women's liberation changes the nature of heterosexual relationships. We continue to call ourselves homosexual, not bisexual, even if we do make it with the opposite sex also, because saying \"Oh, I'm Bi\" is a copout for a gay. We get told it's OK to sleep with guys as long as we sleep with women, too, and that's still putting homosexuality down. We'll be gay until everyone has forgotten that it's an issue.

Custody issues arise due to the belief that bisexual people are too unstable to be parents, while bisexuals seeking asylum from countries hostile to LGBT individuals are viewed with suspicion, including not being \"gay enough.\" This is due to a common assumption within the legal community that a person can only be legitimately attracted to one gender; therefore, a bisexual asylum-seeker is more likely to be considered a fraud.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|LGBT}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Bialogue]]\n* [[Bisexual politics]]\n* [[Denialism]]\n* [[False dichotomy]]\n* [[Heteronormativity]]\n* [[Heterosexism]]\n* [[Homonegativity]]\n* [[Homophobia]]\n*[[Lesbian erasure]]\n*[[Pansexuality]]\n*[[Social invisibility]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n<!-- If a reading source is used as a citation in the article, please remove it from this section. -->\n\n* {{cite web|last1=Aaron|first1=Michael|title=Beyond Binary: How Bisexuality Shifts Orientation Science|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/standard-deviations/201705/beyond-binary-how-bisexuality-shifts-orientation-science|work=[[Psychology Today]]|date=May 8, 2017}}\n* {{cite web|last1=Barkved|first1=Kayti|title=Bisexuality and pansexuality are two different identities|url=http://www.thephoenixnews.com/2014/11/bisexuality-and-pansexuality-are-two-different-identities/|work=The Phoenix|publisher=[[University of British Columbia Okanagan]]|date=November 3, 2014}}\n* {{cite web|last1=Carey|first1=Benedict|title=Straight, Gay or Lying?

Under the laws of war, soldiers acting on their own recognizance without operating in chain of command, are brigands, liable to be tried under civilian laws as common criminals. However, on occasions brigands are not mere malefactors, but may be the last resort of people subject to invasion.\n\nBad administration and suitable terrain encourage the development of brigands. Historical examples of brigands (often called so by their enemies) have existed in territories of France, Greece and the Balkans, India, mainland Italy, Mexico, Sicily and Spain. In parts of the United States of America there was a considerable amount of a certain kind of brigandage.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe English word ''brigant'' (also ''brigaunt'') was introduced as early as 1400, via [[Old French]] '' [[wikt:brigand|brigand]]'' from Italian ''brigante'' \"trooper, skirmisher, foot soldier\". The Italian word is from a verb ''brigare'' \"to brawl, fight\" (whence also ''[[brigade]]'').{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}\n\nFor a ''bandito'' or ''bando'' a man declared [[outlaw]] by proclamation,{{sfn|Rickards|2000|p=39}} see the article [[Bandit]].\n\n==Laws of war==\nTowards the end of wars, irreconcilables may refuse to accept the loss of their cause, and may continue hostilities using irregular tactics. Upon capture by the victorious side, whether the capturing power has to recognize them as soldiers (who must be treated as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]) or as brigands (who can be tried under civilian law as common criminals) depends on whether the detainees \"respect the laws and customs of war\" and whether they operate within a chain of command and are \"not persons acting on their own responsibility\".{{sfn|Axinn|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xMC5bIE-q7QC&pg=PA73#PPA89,M1 89]}}{{sfn|Elsea|2005|loc=CRS-17, CRS-29}}{{sfn|Lieber|Lieber|Shelly|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7eRfPo2jvx8C&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95 95]}}\n\n== Resistance ==\n{{see also|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}\nIn certain conditions the brigand has not been a mere malefactor. Brigandage may be, and not infrequently has been, the last resort of a people subject to invasion.\n\nThe Calabrians who fought for [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]], and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[Conscription|levies]], which maintained the national resistance against the French from 1808 to 1814, were called brigands by their enemies.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}  \"''It is you who are the thieves''\",{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}} was the defence of the [[Calabria]]n who was tried as a brigand by a [[France|French]] [[court-martial]] during the reign of [[Joachim Murat]] in [[Naples]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}\n\nIn the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[History of the Balkans#The Ottoman Empire (15th to 19th c.)|rule]], the brigands (called ''[[klepht]]s'' by the [[Greeks]] and ''hayduks'' or ''haydutzi'' by the [[South Slavs|Slavs]]) had some claim to believe themselves the representatives of their people against oppressors. The only approach to an attempt to maintain order was the [[Right to arms|permission given to part of the population to carry arms]] in order to repress the klephts. They were hence called ''armatoli''. In fact the armatole tended to act more as allies than enemies of the klephts.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}\n\n==Causes==\nThe conditions which favour the development of brigandage may be summed up as [[political corruption|bad administration]]{{efn|{{quote|[...] it would be going much too far to say that the absence of an efficient police is the sole cause of brigandage in countries not subject to foreign invasion, or where the state is not very feeble. [...] But there have been times and countries in which the law and its administration have been so far regarded as enemies by people who were not themselves criminals, that all who defied them have been sure of a measure of sympathy. Then and there it was that brigandage has flourished, and has been difficult to extirpate.|{{harvnb|Hannay|1911|p=563}}}}\n}} and to a lesser degree, terrain that permits easy escape from the incumbents.{{efn|\"in a less degree, the possession of convenient hiding-places.

[[Rapparees]], Irish guerrillas of a later generation, fought for King [[James II of England|James II]] after the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]] and on his defeat degenerated into brigands.\n\n==Terrain==\n[[File:Glatt-R\u00e4uber8113.jpg|thumb|[[Xaver Hohenleiter]] and his robber band]]\nThe forests of [[England]] gave cover to the outlaws, who were flatteringly portrayed in the ballads of [[Robin Hood]].

The first were large bands of discharged [[mercenary]] soldiers who pillaged the country. The second were ruffians who forced their victims to pay ransom by holding their feet in fires.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}\n\nIn the years preceding the [[French Revolution]], the royal government was defied by the troops of [[Smuggling|smugglers]] and brigands known as ''faux saulniers'', unauthorized [[salt]]-sellers, and gangs of [[Poaching|poachers]] haunted the king's preserves round [[Paris]]. The salt monopoly and the excessive preservation of the game were so oppressive that the peasantry were provoked to violent resistance and to brigandage. The offenders enjoyed a large measure of public sympathy, and were warned or concealed by the population, even when they were not actively supported.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=564}}\n\n[[s:Author:David Hannay|David Hannay]] writing in the 1911 edition of the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] stated that in \"[[Corsica]] the ''maquis'' has never been without its brigand hero, because industry has been stagnant, family feuds persist, and the government has never quite succeeded in persuading the people to support the law.

Under the laws of war soldiers acting on their own recognisance without operating in chain of command are brigands and are liable to be tried under civilian laws as common criminals. However, on occasions brigands are not mere malfactors, but may be the last resort of people subject to invasion.\n\nBad administration and suitable terrain encourage the development of brigands. Historical examples of brigands (often called so by their enemies) have existed in the France, Greece and the Balkans, India, mainland Italy, Mexico, Sicily and Spain. In parts of the United States of America   \nthere was a considerable amount of a certain kind of brigandage.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe English word ''brigant'' (also ''brigaunt'') was introduced as early as 1400, via [[Old French]] '' [[wikt:brigand|brigand]]'' from Italian ''brigante'' \"trooper, skirmisher, foot soldier\". The Italian word is from a verb ''brigare'' \"to brawl, fight\" (whence also ''[[brigade]]'').{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}\n\nFor a ''bandito'' or ''bando'' a man declared [[outlaw]] by proclamation,{{sfn|Rickards|2000|p=39}} see the article [[Bandit]].\n\n==Laws of war==\nTowards the end of wars, irreconcilables may refuse to accept the loss of their cause, and may continue hostilities using irregular tactics. Upon capture by the victorious side, whether the capturing power has to recognize them as soldiers (who must be treated as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]) or as brigands (who can be tried under civilian law as common criminals) depends on whether the detainees \"respect the laws and customs of war\" and whether they operate within a chain of command and are \"not persons acting on their own responsibility\".{{sfn|Axinn|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xMC5bIE-q7QC&pg=PA73#PPA89,M1 89]}}{{sfn|Elsea|2005|loc=CRS-17, CRS-29}}{{sfn|Lieber|Lieber|Shelly|1983|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7eRfPo2jvx8C&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95 95]}}\n\n== Resistance ==\n{{see also|Brigandage in the Two Sicilies}}\nIn certain conditions the brigand has not been a mere malefactor. Brigandage may be, and not infrequently has been, the last resort of a people subject to invasion.\n\nThe Calabrians who fought for [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]], and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[Conscription|levies]], which maintained the national resistance against the French from 1808 to 1814, were called brigands by their enemies.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}  \"''It is you who are the thieves''\",{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}} was the defence of the [[Calabria]]n who was tried as a brigand by a [[France|French]] [[court-martial]] during the reign of [[Joachim Murat]] in [[Naples]].{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}\n\nIn the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]], under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[History of the Balkans#The Ottoman Empire (15th to 19th c.)|rule]], the brigands (called ''[[klepht]]s'' by the [[Greeks]] and ''hayduks'' or ''haydutzi'' by the [[South Slavs|Slavs]]) had some claim to believe themselves the representatives of their people against oppressors. The only approach to an attempt to maintain order was the [[Right to arms|permission given to part of the population to carry arms]] in order to repress the klephts. They were hence called ''armatoli''. In fact the armatole tended to act more as allies than enemies of the klephts.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=563}}\n\n==Causes==\nThe conditions which favour the development of brigandage may be summed up as [[political corruption|bad administration]]{{efn|{{quote|[...] it would be going much too far to say that the absence of an efficient police is the sole cause of brigandage in countries not subject to foreign invasion, or where the state is not very feeble.

{"title_page": "Aerobic decomposition", "text_new": "#redirect [[Decomposition]]When organic materials decompose in the presence of oxygen, the process is called \u201caerobic.\u201d The aerobic process is most common in nature. For example, it takes place on ground surfaces such as the forest floor, where droppings from trees and animals are converted into a relatively stable humus. There is no accompanying bad smell when there is adequate oxygen present.\n\nDrawing of a man turning a compost pile with a garden fork.In aerobic decomposition, living organisms, which use oxygen, feed upon the organic matter. They use the nitrogen, phosphorus, some of the carbon, and other required nutrients. Much of the carbon serves as a source of energy for the organisms and is burned up and respired as carbon dioxide (C02). Since carbon serves both as a source of energy and as an element in the cell protoplasm, much more carbon than nitrogen is needed. Generally about two-thirds of carbon is respired as C02, while the other third is combined with nitrogen in the living cells. However, if the excess of carbon over nitrogen (C:N ratio) in organic materials being decomposed is too great, biological activity diminishes. Several cycles of organisms are then required to burn most of the carbon.\n\nWhen some of the organisms die, their stored nitrogen and carbon becomes available to other organisms. As other organisms use the nitrogen from the dead cells to form new cell material, once more excess carbon is converted to C02. Thus, the amount of carbon is reduced and the limited amount of nitrogen is recycled. Finally, when the ratio of available carbon to available nitrogen is in sufficient balance, nitrogen is released as ammonia. Under favorable conditions, some ammonia may oxidize to nitrate. Phosphorus, potash, and various micro-nutrients are also essential for biological growth. These are normally present in more than adequate amounts in compostable materials and present no problem.\n\nDuring composting a great deal of energy is released in the form of heat in the oxidation of the carbon to C02. For example, if a gram-molecule of glucose is dissimilated under aerobic conditions, 484 to 674 kilogram calories (kcal) of heat may be released. If the organic material is in a pile or is otherwise arranged to provide some insulation, the temperature of the material during decomposition will rise to over 170\u00b0F. If the temperature exceeds 162\u00b0F to 172\u00b0F, however, the bacterial activity is decreased and stabilization is slowed down.\n\nDrawing of a themometer in a compost pile.\n\nInitially, mesophilic organisms, which live in temperatures of 50\u00b0F to 115\u00b0F, colonize in the materials. When the temperature exceeds about 120\u00b0F, thermophilic organisms, which grow and thrive in the temperature range 115\u00b0F to 160\u00b0F., develop and replace the mesophilic bacteria in the decomposition material. Only a few groups of thermophiles carry on any activity above 160\u00b0F.\n\nOxidation at thermophilic temperatures takesplace more rapidly than at mesophilic temperatures and, hence, a shorter time is required for decomposition (stabilization). The high temperatures will destroy pathogenic bacteria, protozoa (microscopic one-celled animals), and weed seeds, which are detrimental to health or agriculture when the final compost is used.\n\nAerobic oxidation of organic matter produces no objectionable odor. If odors are noticeable, either the process is not entirely aerobic or there are some special conditions or materials present which are creating an odor. Aerobic decomposition or composting can be accomplished in pits, bins, stacks, or piles, if adequate oxygen is provided. Turning the material at intervals or other techniques for adding oxygen is useful in maintaining aerobic conditions.\n\nCompost piles under aerobic conditions attain a temperature of 140\u00b0F to 160\u00b0F in one to five days depending upon the material and the condition of the composting operation. This temperature can also be maintained for several days before further aeration. The heat necessary to produce and maintain this temperature must come from aerobic decomposition which requires oxygen. After a period of time, the material will become anaerobic unless it is aerated.\n\nIn this manual the term \u201caerobic composting\u201d will be used in its commonly accepted meaning of that process. It requires a considerable amount of oxygen and produces none of the characteristic features of anaerobic putrefaction. In its modern sense, aerobic composting can be defined as a process in which, under suitable environmental conditions, aerobic organisms, principally thermophilic, utilize considerable amounts of oxygen in decomposing organic matter to a fairly stable humus\n", "text_old": "#redirect [[Decomposition]]\n", "name_user": "556envydd", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aerobic_decomposition&redirect=no"}
