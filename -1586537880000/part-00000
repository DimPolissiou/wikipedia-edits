The population continued to rise at a steady pace: in 1811 the population was 337 and in 1821 it was recorded at 396.

According to \"Dr Marjorie Bloy\"  he estimated that there was a \"population increase between 1801\u201331 was as much as 50%\" in England; this could explain the sudden population boom.

The next recorded census was only thirty years later in 1881, and here it shows us that the population has dropped by 149 people between 1851 and 1881. You could speculate that this could have been due to the 1954 Cholera outbreak that occurred throughout England, as there is no significant boundary change or any other aspects that could have caused such a dramatic drop in the population. After this dramatic drop the population once again grew to 489. However, from 1891 onwards the population continued to decline at a relatively steady rate up until the 1960s, where it was 280.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyke through time Total Population|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10254449/cube/TOT_POP|website=visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt had a population of 362 according to the 2011 Census.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyke (Parish) key figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11123310&c=Eyke&d=16&e=62&g=6467060&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1422366105207&enc=1|website=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> Comparing this to the Suffolk Coastal region where the population is 124,298<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics (Eyke)|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11123310&c=Eyke&d=16&e=62&g=6467060&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1422366105207&enc=1|website=neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> this shows that Eyke holds only 0.29% of the population of Suffolk in 2011.\n\n== Occupational structure in 1881 ==\nThe occupational structure of Eyke in 1881, the graph shows us the number of occupational orders in both the male and female sector in 1881. The first notable differences the data suggests is the number of females in the Domestic services which is 9 compared to zero men. This is as expected as during this time period. Women tended to be employed to care for the children and look after the general upkeep of a household, either by being employed as a maid, servant or similar occupation. If you compare this number 9 to the total female population in 1881 \"179\" you could assume the general houses of Eyke were not that large, as the majority of households did not have the need to employ persons in the domestic services.\n\nAgriculture was the leading employer in 1881 with 56 males employed within this sector and no females. This was due to agriculture being a manual labour-intensive job, and you can assume{{original research inline|date=June 2019}} from the data this would have discouraged females from both wanting and being employed in this field.<ref>{{cite web|title=1881 Occupational Orders|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10254449/cube/OCC_ORDER1881|website=visionofbritain.org.uk|publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> If we compare the 1881 data to modern day data from 2011 you can see that employment in the agricultural sector has decreased significantly. According to the 2011 Census data there are as little as 18 people employed with in \"agriculture or agriculture related trades\". This suggests that the majority of the population have moved away from conventional employment and moved towards modern day jobs, this could be assumed to be due to the rise in technology with better-paying and less labour-intensive jobs available.{{original research inline|date=June 2019}}\n\nIt can be seen from the 2011 Census data that this could be true as the highest sector for employment is now \"Managers, Directors and Senior Officials\" at 27. Another assumption could be due to a higher range and more diversity of jobs available.{{original research inline|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Housing in Eyke  ==\nFrom looking at the 2011 Census data we can see there are a total of 154 households in Eyke, these range from people living on their own to groups and family. We can presume that the Area of Eyke is generally well-off, as 81 households are detached houses and 52 semi-detached. There are no recorded shared dwellings and only 1 recorded \"Caravan or Other Mobile Temporary Structure\". Looking at the General health of the people of Eyke according to the 2011 Census data, the majority of the population are either in \"good health or very good health\" with 192 in very good health and 114 in good health.<ref>{{cite web|title=General Health, 2011|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=11123310&c=eyke&d=16&e=61&g=6467060&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1429092983034&enc=1&dsFamilyId=2503|website=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref> This data suggests that overall Eyke has good public health and suggests a good level of health services are available.{{original research inline|date=June 2019}}\n\n== All Saints Church ==\n[[File:All Saints church Eyke.jpg|thumb|All Saints Church]]\n\nThe church is a Norman structure of the 12th century, and is dedicated to All Saints.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyke|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/SFK/Eyke/|website=GENUKI UK and Ireland Genealogy|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref> The Church was founded in 1538.<ref>{{cite web|title=All Saints, Eyke- Church of England|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/cgi-bin/churchentry?CCC=SFK,ID=1910|website=genuki.org.uk/|accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom Suffolk Churches, an online journey through the churches of Suffolk one travellers account of the All Saints Church in Eyke was this, \"All Saints sits quietly, with no tower to lead you to it from afar.

However, from 1891 onwards the population continued to decline at a relatively steady rate up until the 1960s, where it was 280.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyke through time Total Population|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10254449/cube/TOT_POP|website=visionofbritain.org.uk|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt had a population of 362 according to the 2011 Census.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eyke (Parish) key figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11123310&c=Eyke&d=16&e=62&g=6467060&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1422366105207&enc=1|website=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> Comparing this to the Suffolk Coastal region where the population is 124,298<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics (Eyke)|url=https://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11123310&c=Eyke&d=16&e=62&g=6467060&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1422366105207&enc=1|website=neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> this shows that Eyke holds only 0.29% of the population of Suffolk in 2011.\n\n== Occupational structure in 1881 ==\nThe occupational structure of Eyke in 1881, the graph shows us the number of occupational orders in both the male and female sector in 1881. The first notable differences the data suggests is the number of females in the Domestic services which is 9 compared to zero men. This is as expected as during this time period. Women tended to be employed to care for the children and look after the general upkeep of a household, either by being employed as a maid, servant or similar occupation. If you compare this number 9 to the total female population in 1881 \"179\" you could assume the general houses of Eyke were not that large, as the majority of households did not have the need to employ persons in the domestic services.\n\nAgriculture was the leading employer in 1881 with 56 males employed within this sector and no females. This was due to agriculture being a manual labour-intensive job, and you can assume{{original research inline|date=June 2019}} from the data this would have discouraged females from both wanting and being employed in this field.<ref>{{cite web|title=1881 Occupational Orders|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10254449/cube/OCC_ORDER1881|website=visionofbritain.org.uk|publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref> If we compare the 1881 data to modern day data from 2011 you can see that employment in the agricultural sector has decreased significantly. According to the 2011 Census data there are as little as 18 people employed with in \"agriculture or agriculture related trades\". This suggests that the majority of the population have moved away from conventional employment and moved towards modern day jobs, this could be assumed to be due to the rise in technology with better-paying and less labour-intensive jobs available.{{original research inline|date=June 2019}}\n\nIt can be seen from the 2011 Census data that this could be true as the highest sector for employment is now \"Managers, Directors and Senior Officials\" at 27. Another assumption could be due to a higher range and more diversity of jobs available.{{original research inline|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Housing in Eyke  ==\nFrom looking at the 2011 Census data we can see there are a total of 154 households in Eyke, these range from people living on their own to groups and family. We can presume that the Area of Eyke is generally well-off, as 81 households are detached houses and 52 semi-detached. There are no recorded shared dwellings and only 1 recorded \"Caravan or Other Mobile Temporary Structure\".

The reports are reviewed to judge the suitability of an officer before a promotion or a posting in the union or state governments. The report is compiled annually and is initiated by the officers themselves, designated as the reporting officer, who list their achievements, completion of assigned activities and targets for the year. The report is then modified and commented on by the reviewing officer, usually the superior of the reporting officer. Reports are forwarded by the reviewing officer to the accepting authority, who conducts a final review of the report.<ref name=\"Profile IAS\" />\n\n==Major concerns and reforms==\n=== Shortage of officers ===\nIt was reported in 2017 that there is a shortage of about 1,700{{Nbsp}}IAS officers in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170802/jsp/nation/story_165137.jsp|title=IAS and IPS grapple with officer shortage|last=Siddiqui|first=Imran Ahmed|date=1 August 2017|website=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|publication-place=[[New Delhi]]|oclc=271717941|access-date=18 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024952/https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170802/jsp/nation/story_165137.jsp|archive-date=31 January 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shortage-of-around-3000-ias-ips-and-ifs-officers/articleshow/58193744.cms|title=Shortage of around 3,000 IAS, IPS and IFS officers|date=15 April 2017|website=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman & Co.

The reports are reviewed to judge the suitability of an officer before a promotion or a posting in the union or state governments. The report is compiled annually and is initiated by the officers themselves, designated as the reporting officer, who list their achievements, completion of assigned activities and targets for the year. The report is then modified and commented on by the reviewing officer, usually the superior of the reporting officer. Reports are forwarded by the reviewing officer to the accepting authority, who conducts a final review of the report.<ref name=\"Profile IAS\" />\n\n==Major concerns and reforms==\n=== Shortage of officers ===\nIt was reported in 2017 that there is a shortage of about 1,700{{Nbsp}}IAS officers in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170802/jsp/nation/story_165137.jsp|title=IAS and IPS grapple with officer shortage|last=Siddiqui|first=Imran Ahmed|date=1 August 2017|website=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]|publication-place=[[New Delhi]]|oclc=271717941|access-date=18 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131024952/https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170802/jsp/nation/story_165137.jsp|archive-date=31 January 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shortage-of-around-3000-ias-ips-and-ifs-officers/articleshow/58193744.cms|title=Shortage of around 3,000 IAS, IPS and IFS officers|date=15 April 2017|website=[[The Times of India]]|publisher=[[Bennett, Coleman & Co.

Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It is characterised by the presence of abundant Cuartz sediments, along with the pesence of Red Clays. The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

During this age, peace and harmony prevailed in that people did not have to work to feed themselves for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as \"guardians\". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.\n\nIn classical Greek mythology, the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35\u201337|isbn=9780140171990}}</ref> In some versions of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age. But in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, she fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], holding the scales of Justice, or [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].<ref>\"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars.\" ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).</ref>\n\nEuropean [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.<ref>Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.</ref>\n\n==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==\nThe earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE\u2013350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109\u2013126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:\n\n<blockquote>[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.</blockquote>\n\n[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.\n\n[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' (c. 1530) by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]\n\nIn Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.\n\n[[File:Robert Willemsz de Baudous - Zlatno doba.jpg|thumb|Robert Willemsz de Baudous: Golden Age, etching, cca 1598.]]\n\nThe [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.\n\n===Arcadia===\nA tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]\n\n==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==\nWriting in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.\n\nVirgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:\n<poem>''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;\n''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:\n''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;\n''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''</poem>\n<poem>'''Translation:'''\n''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung\n''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll\n''Of circling centuries begins anew:\n''Astraea returns,\n''Returns old Saturn's reign,\n''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''<ref>[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&layout=&loc=4.1 5-8)]</ref></poem>\n\nSomewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:\n<poem>\n''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen\n''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.\n''Even this was impious; for the common stock\n''They gathered, and the earth of her own will\n''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''</poem>\n<poem>\n''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni\n''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum\n''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus\n''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125\u201328])</poem>\n\nThis view, which identifies a [[State of nature|State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:\n<poem>\n''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,\n''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:\n''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.\n''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''\n''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;\n''Needless was written law, where none opprest:\n''The law of Man was written in his breast.''<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, \"Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]</ref></poem>\n\nThe Graeco-Roman concept of the \"natural man\" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.<ref>See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on \"The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality\" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)</ref>\n\n==\"Soft\" and \"hard\" primitivism in Arcadia==\nIn his famous essay, \"[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition\",<ref>\"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition,\" in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297\u201398.</ref> [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, \"that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy\":\n\n<blockquote>\nThere had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a \"Gegen-Konstruktion\" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed \"soft\" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas<ref>[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A.O. Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).</ref> conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness \u2013 in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, \"hard\" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts \u2013 in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nArcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of \u201csoft\" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.</blockquote>\n\n==Other Golden Ages==\nThere are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.<ref>Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.</ref>\n\n===Hindu===\nThe Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.\n\nThe [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: <blockquote>Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.</blockquote>\n\nSatya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.<ref>Matsya Purana</ref>\nKnowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga \"because it was the time when all people were happy\".\n\n===Brahma Kumaris===\nThe [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.<ref name=\"4ages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama. The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.\n\nGolden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Norse===\nThe [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally \"Golden Age\") was used in [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]] to describe the period after [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Giml\u00e9]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]].

It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer.

R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the end of the world, the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].\n\nIn ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the \"Age of Legends\" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] \u2013 trained channelers \u2013 were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole \u2013 The Bore \u2013 being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.\n\nAnother example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.\n\nThe Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> and [[J.

During this age, peace and harmony prevailed in that people did not have to work to feed themselves for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as \"guardians\". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.\n\nIn classical Greek mythology, the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35\u201337|isbn=9780140171990}}</ref> In some versions of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age. But in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, she fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], holding the scales of Justice, or [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].<ref>\"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars.\" ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).</ref>\n\nEuropean [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.<ref>Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.</ref>\n\n==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==\nThe earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE\u2013350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109\u2013126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:\n\n<blockquote>[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.</blockquote>\n\n[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.\n\n[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' (c. 1530) by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]\n\nIn Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.\n\n[[File:Robert Willemsz de Baudous - Zlatno doba.jpg|thumb|Robert Willemsz de Baudous: Golden Age, etching, cca 1598.]]\n\nThe [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.\n\n===Arcadia===\nA tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]\n\n==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==\nWriting in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.\n\nVirgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:\n<poem>''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;\n''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:\n''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;\n''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''</poem>\n<poem>'''Translation:'''\n''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung\n''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll\n''Of circling centuries begins anew:\n''Astraea returns,\n''Returns old Saturn's reign,\n''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''<ref>[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&layout=&loc=4.1 5-8)]</ref></poem>\n\nSomewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:\n<poem>\n''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen\n''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.\n''Even this was impious; for the common stock\n''They gathered, and the earth of her own will\n''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''</poem>\n<poem>\n''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni\n''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum\n''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus\n''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125\u201328])</poem>\n\nThis view, which identifies a [[State of nature|State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:\n<poem>\n''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,\n''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:\n''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.\n''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''\n''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;\n''Needless was written law, where none opprest:\n''The law of Man was written in his breast.''<ref>[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, \"Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]</ref></poem>\n\nThe Graeco-Roman concept of the \"natural man\" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.<ref>See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on \"The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality\" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)</ref>\n\n==\"Soft\" and \"hard\" primitivism in Arcadia==\nIn his famous essay, \"[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition\",<ref>\"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition,\" in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297\u201398.</ref> [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, \"that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy\":\n\n<blockquote>\nThere had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a \"Gegen-Konstruktion\" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed \"soft\" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas<ref>[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A.O. Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).</ref> conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness \u2013 in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, \"hard\" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts \u2013 in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nArcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of \u201csoft\" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.</blockquote>\n\n==Other Golden Ages==\nThere are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.<ref>Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.</ref>\n\n===Hindu===\nThe Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.\n\nThe [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: <blockquote>Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.</blockquote>\n\nSatya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.<ref>Matsya Purana</ref>\nKnowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga \"because it was the time when all people were happy\".\n\n===Brahma Kumaris===\nThe [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.<ref name=\"4ages\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama. The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.\n\nGolden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris\u00ae Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Norse===\nThe [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally \"Golden Age\") was used in [[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]] to describe the period after [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Giml\u00e9]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.\n\n===Bible===\nThere is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.\n\n{{quote|31 \"Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue \u2013 an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>|Daniel 2: 31-35}}\n\nThe interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36\u201345.\n\n===Fantasy===\nIn modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.\n\nFor example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the end of the world, the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].\n\nIn ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the \"Age of Legends\" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] \u2013 trained channelers \u2013 were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole \u2013 The Bore \u2013 being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.\n\nAnother example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.\n\nThe Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}</ref> [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> and [[J.

In the [[liner notes]] to the 1993 reissue of ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]'', it was said by an unnamed member of the group that they \"nailed\" the album.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> By this point, Aerosmith had matured as a band, and Steven Tyler made [[sexual intercourse|sex]] the primary focus of his songwriting on the album.\n\nAccording to Douglas, \"Aerosmith was a different band when we started the third album. They'd been playing ''Get Your Wings'' on the road for a year and had become better players - different. It showed in the riffs that Joe [Perry] and Brad [Whitford] brought back from the road for the next album. ''Toys in the Attic'' was a much more sophisticated record than the other stuff they'd done.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=226}} In the band memoir ''Walk This Way'', guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] stated, \"When we started to make ''Toys in the Attic'', our confidence was built up from constant touring.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=227}} In his autobiography, Perry elaborated:\n\n{{quote|Our first two albums were basically {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} songs we'd been playing for years live in the clubs. With ''Toys'', we started from scratch. Making this record, we learned to be recording artists and write songs on a deadline. In the process, we began to see just what Aerosmith could accomplish. With everyone throwing in ideas, ''Toys'' was our breakthrough. That breakthrough was facilitated by Jack Douglas{{nbsp}}... In the studio he moved into the slot of the sixth member of the band.{{sfn|Perry|Ritz|p=146|2014}}}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{listen\n| type = music\n| filename = Walk This Way (Aerosmith) sample.ogg \n| title = \"Walk This Way\" \n| description = 20-second sample}}\n\nAerosmith's third album includes some of their best-known songs, including \"Walk This Way\", \"Sweet Emotion\" and the rollicking title track. \"Walk This Way\" starts with a two-measure drum beat intro by [[Joey Kramer]], followed by the well-known guitar riff by Perry. The song proceeds with the main riff made famous by Perry and [[Brad Whitford]] on guitar with [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] on an early 1960s Fender Jazz bass. The song continues with rapid-fire lyrics by [[Steven Tyler]]. The song originated in December 1974 during a sound check when Aerosmith was opening for [[the Guess Who]] in Honolulu, Hawaii. During the sound check, Perry was \"fooling around with riffs and thinking about [[the Meters]]\", a group guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] had turned him on to. Loving \"their riffy New Orleans [[funk]], especially '[[Cissy Strut]]' and 'People Say'\", he asked the drummer \"to lay down something flat with a groove on the drums.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The guitar [[riff]] to what would become \"Walk This Way\" just \"came off [his] hands.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Needing a bridge, he: {{quote|played another riff and went there. But I didn't want the song to have a typical, boring 1, 4, 5 chord progression. After playing the first riff in the key of C, I shifted to E before returning to C for the verse and chorus. By the end of the sound check, I had the basics of a song.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nWhen singer Steven Tyler heard Perry playing that riff he \"ran out and sat behind the drums and [they] jammed.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Tyler [[scat singing|scatted]] \"nonsensical words initially to feel where the lyrics should go before adding them later.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} When the group was halfway through recording ''Toys in the Attic'' in early 1975 at Record Plant in New York City, they found themselves stuck for material. They had written three or four songs for the album, having \"to write the rest in the studio.\" They decided to give the song Perry had come up with in Hawaii a try, but it didn't have lyrics or a title yet.{{sfn|Myers|2016}} In 1997, Perry recalled that the idea for the funky, [[James Brown]]-influenced \"Walk This Way\" was inspired by the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', which the band had gone to see around the time they were working on the track:\n\n{{quote|We were working on that song and we took a break to go see the movie in [[Times Square]]... and we came to the part where [[Marty Feldman]] as Igor limps down the steps of the train platform and says to [[Gene Wilder]], \"Walk this way,\" which Gene does with the same hideous limp. We fell over ourselves because it was so funny in a recognizably [[Three Stooges]] mode.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nAt the hotel that night, Tyler wrote lyrics for the song, but left them in the cab on the way to the studio next morning. He says: \"I must have been stoned. All the blood drained out of my face, but no one believed me. They thought I never got around to writing them.\" Upset, he took a cassette tape with the instrumental track we had recorded and a portable tape player with headphones and \"disappeared into the stairwell.\" He \"grabbed a few No. 2 pencils\" but forgot to take paper. He wrote the lyrics on the wall at \"the Record Plant's top floor and then down a few stairs of the back stairway.\" After \"two or three hours\" he \"ran downstairs for a legal pad and ran back up and copied them down.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The lyrics, which tell the story of a high-school boy losing his virginity, are sung quite fast by Tyler, with heavy emphasis being placed on the rhyming lyrics.\n\nIt was bassist Tom Hamilton who came up with the main lick on \"Sweet Emotion\". In 1997 during a band interview with Alan Di Perna of ''[[Guitar World]]'' the members discussed the evolution of the song, which owes a debt to the [[Jeff Beck]] composition \"Rice Pudding\" from the album ''[[Beck-Ola]]''.<ref name=\"diperna\"/> Hamilton recalled:\n\n{{quote|I wrote that line on bass, and I realized I should think of some guitar parts for it if I was ever going to get a chance to present it to the band. I didn't think I ever would{{nbsp}}... Steven had the idea of taking that intro riff, which became the chorus bass line under the \"sweet emotion\" part, and transposing it into the key of E, and making it a really heavy [[Led Zeppelin]]esque thing.<ref name=\"diperna\"/>}}\n\nMany Aerosmith fans believe that Tyler wrote all of the lyrics to \"Sweet Emotion\" about the tension and hatred between the band members and Joe Perry's wife. Tyler himself has said that only some of the lyrics were inspired by Perry's wife. It was stated in Aerosmith's tell-all autobiography ''[[Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith|Walk This Way]]'' and in an episode of ''[[Behind the Music]]'' that growing feuds between the band members' wives (including an incident involving \"spilt milk\" where Elyssa Perry threw milk over Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry) may have helped lead to the band's original lineup dissolving in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"VH1\"/>\n\nHamilton and Tyler also collaborated on \"Uncle Salty\", with Tyler recalling in his 2001 autobiography, \"Here I was thinking about an orphanage when I wrote those lyrics. I'd try to make the melody weep from the sadness felt when a child is abandoned.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}} Of the title track, Tyler added, \"Joe was jamming a riff and I started yelling, 'Toys, toys, toys{{nbsp}}...' Organic, immediate, infectious{{nbsp}}... I just started singing and it fit like chocolate and peanut butter. Joe plays his ass off on that song.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}}\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious recording on the album is \"You See Me Crying\", a complex piano ballad that was heavily orchestrated. Jack Douglas brought in a [[symphony orchestra]] for the song, which was conducted by [[Mike Mainieri]]. The song itself was written by Tyler and outside collaborator Don Solomon. Some of the band members became frustrated with the song, which took a long time to complete, due to the many complex drum and guitar parts. The band's label, [[Columbia Records]], was nonetheless very impressed with the song and the recording process. [[Bruce Lundvall]], then-president of Columbia Records walked in on the recording sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' when the band was working on the song and remarked: \"You guys got an incredible thing going here. I just came from a [[Herbie Hancock]] session and this is much more fun.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}} While Aerosmith were planning the \"Back in the Saddle\" concert tour and recording the ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'' album during 1984, a radio DJ played the song. Tyler, who was suffering memory loss at the time from years of drug use, liked \"You See Me Crying\" so much, he suggested his group record a cover version, only to be told by his bandmate Perry, \"It's ''us'', fuckhead.\"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011|p=119}}\n\nThe album also features a cover of [[Bullmoose Jackson]]'s \"Big Ten-Inch Record,\" originally an old R&B song recorded in 1952 and first heard by the band on a tape from [[Dr. Demento]]'s radio show on [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]]. Rather than produce a rock reimagining, Aerosmith's cover largely stays true to the original song, down to its jazz-style instrumentation. In the liner notes to ''[[Pandora's Box (album)|Pandora's Box]]'', Tyler insists that he sings \"'''cept'' on my big ten inch...\" not ''suck'' on my big ten inch,\" but laments that no one on earth believes him.<ref name=\"Pandora\"/>\n\nIn the 1997, Tyler shared his memories about writing and recording several of the LP's tracks with author [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]]:\n\n*\"No More No More\": \"On a song like 'No More No More', the lyrics came from my verbal diarrhea, a mishmash that I made up and eventually changed the lyrics to something cool{{nbsp}}... about life on the road: boredom, disillusion, [[Holiday Inn]]s, stalemate, jailbait. My diary.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=230}}\n*\"You See Me Crying\": \"This was when we had a string orchestra in to work on 'You See Me Crying', which I wrote with Don Solomon, a big production conducted by Mike Maineri.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}}\n*\"Sweet Emotion\": \"Frank Connally sold us to Leber-Krebs for what{{snd}}I don't know{{nbsp}}... On 'Sweet Emotion', we used these backward handclaps and four of us in the studio chanting, 'Fuck you, Frank.' If you play it backward, you can hear this.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=233}}\n*\"Uncle Salty\": \"Salty worked in a home for lost children and had his way with this little girl. That's what it's about. I'm the little girl, the orphaned boy. I put myself in that place. I'm Uncle Salty too.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n*\"Adam's Apple\": I don't remember anything except I arranged it and must have fought for credit. And I originally wanted to call the album ''Love at First Bite'' after the line in the song.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1975, the band started working at [[Record Plant Studios|The Record Plant]] in New York City for the album that became ''Toys in the Attic''. The sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' were produced by Douglas without Colcord{{snd}}the album was [[audio engineering|engineered]] by Jay Messina with assistant engineers Rod O'Brien, Corky Stasiak and Dave Thoener. The songs for ''Toys in the Attic'' were recorded with a Spectrasonics mixing board and a [[multitrack recording|16-track]] tape recorder.<ref name=\"notes1\" />\n\nPerry has stated that he wanted to call the LP ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'', which would be used for their next studio album.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AM1\" />\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n|rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev3score = (B+)<ref name=\"Christgau\" />\n|rev4 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"RS\" />\n}}\nContemporary reviews were originally mixed. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Gordon Fletcher compared negatively ''Toys in the Attic'' to ''Get Your Wings'' which, in his opinion, was \"testimony to the band\u2019s raw abilities\"; he criticised Douglas' production and wrote that, despite \"some good moments,\" the band did not avoid \"instances of directionless meandering and downright weak material.\"<ref name=\"RS 1975\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] was more positive and remarked the progress Aerosmith had done in such a short time, both musically and lyrically.<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> [[Greg Kot]] called the album a landmark of hard rock.<ref name=\"RS\" />\n\nReviews have become more positive over time. [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] remarked how Aerosmith \"finally perfected their mix of Stonesy raunch and Zeppelin-esque riffing\", thanks to \"a combination of an increased sense of songwriting skills and purpose\", creating on the album a new style which \"fully embraced sleaziness\" in Tyler's lyrics, backed by \"an appropriately greasy\" music.<ref name=\"AM1\" /> In his review for ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', Ben Mitchell found \"Aerosmith firing on all coke-clogged cylinders\" on ''Toys in the Attic'', he lauded all the songs in the album and called the arrangement of \"You See Me Crying\" \"a typical \u201970s rock extravagance.\"<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n\nWhen ''Toys in the Attic'' was released in April 1975,{{sfn|Huxley|2005|loc=eBook}} it eventually peaked at No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, 63 positions higher than ''Get Your Wings''.<ref name=\"AM2\" /> The single release of \"Sweet Emotion\" became a minor hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] reaching No. 36 in 1975 and \"Walk This Way\" reached No. 10 on the Hot 100 in 1977.<ref name=\"AM3\" />\n\nThe album would gain renewed attention in 1986, 11 years after its release, when [[hip-hop]] group [[Run DMC]] covered \"Walk This Way,\" which helped revive Aerosmith's then-flagging career as well as propel rap music to the mainstream.\n\nAerosmith make reference to the album and its lyrics in the song \"[[Legendary Child]]\" recorded in 2011. The line \"But we traded them toys for other joys\" refers to the title of the album and their struggles with addiction. It may also be referring to the title track of the same name. The line \"I took a chance at the high school dance never knowing wrong from right\" references lyrics from the songs \"Walk This Way\" and \"Adam's Apple\" respectively.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side one\n| title1 = [[Toys in the Attic (song)|Toys in the Attic]]\n| writer1 = [[Steven Tyler]], [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]\n| length1 = 3:07\n| title2 = Uncle Salty\n| writer2 = Tyler, [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]]\n| length2 = 4:09\n| title3 = Adam's Apple\n| writer3 = Tyler\n| length3 = 4:33\n| title4 = [[Walk This Way]]\n| writer4 = Tyler, Perry\n| length4 = 3:40\n| title5 = Big Ten Inch Record\n| writer5 = Fred Weismantel\n| length5 = 2:16\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Side two\n| title1 = [[Sweet Emotion]]\n| writer1 = Tyler, Hamilton\n| length1 = 4:34\n| title2 = No More No More\n| writer2 = Tyler, Perry\n| length2 = 4:34\n| title3 = Round and Round\n| writer3 = Tyler, [[Brad Whitford]]\n| length3 = 5:03\n| title4 = [[You See Me Crying]]\n| writer4 = Tyler, Don Solomon\n| length4 = 5:12\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\nPer liner notes.<ref name=\"notes1\" />  Track numbers refer to CD and digital releases of the album.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''Aerosmith'''\n*[[Steven Tyler]]{{snd}}vocals, keyboards, harmonica, percussion\n*[[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]{{snd}}lead guitar (except track 8, second solo on track 9), rhythm guitar on track 8, acoustic guitar, [[slide guitar]], backing vocals, percussion\n*[[Brad Whitford]]{{snd}}rhythm guitar (except tracks 8-9), lead guitar (track 8, first and coda solo on track 9)\n*[[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]]{{snd}}bass guitar, rhythm guitar (track 2)\n*[[Joey Kramer]]{{snd}}drums, percussion\n\n'''Additional musicians'''\n*Scott Cushnie \u2013 [[piano]] on \"Big Ten Inch Record\", and \"No More No More\"\n*Jay Messina \u2013 [[marimba|bass marimba]] on \"Sweet Emotion\"\n*[[Mike Mainieri]] -

In the [[liner notes]] to the 1993 reissue of ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]'', it was said by an unnamed member of the group that they \"nailed\" the album.<ref name=\"notes2\" /> By this point, Aerosmith had matured as a band, and Steven Tyler made [[sexual intercourse|sex]] the primary focus of his songwriting on the album.\n\nAccording to Douglas, \"Aerosmith was a different band when we started the third album. They'd been playing ''Get Your Wings'' on the road for a year and had become better players - different. It showed in the riffs that Joe [Perry] and Brad [Whitford] brought back from the road for the next album. ''Toys in the Attic'' was a much more sophisticated record than the other stuff they'd done.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=226}} In the band memoir ''Walk This Way'', guitarist [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] stated, \"When we started to make ''Toys in the Attic'', our confidence was built up from constant touring.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=227}} In his autobiography, Perry elaborated:\n\n{{quote|Our first two albums were basically {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} songs we'd been playing for years live in the clubs. With ''Toys'', we started from scratch. Making this record, we learned to be recording artists and write songs on a deadline. In the process, we began to see just what Aerosmith could accomplish. With everyone throwing in ideas, ''Toys'' was our breakthrough. That breakthrough was facilitated by Jack Douglas{{nbsp}}... In the studio he moved into the slot of the sixth member of the band.{{sfn|Perry|Ritz|p=146|2014}}}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{listen\n| type = music\n| filename = Walk This Way (Aerosmith) sample.ogg \n| title = \"Walk This Way\" \n| description = 20-second sample}}\n\nAerosmith's third album includes some of their best-known songs, including \"Walk This Way\", \"Sweet Emotion\" and the rollicking title track. \"Walk This Way\" starts with a two-measure drum beat intro by [[Joey Kramer]], followed by the well-known guitar riff by Perry. The song proceeds with the main riff made famous by Perry and [[Brad Whitford]] on guitar with [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] on an early 1960\u2019s Fender Jazz bass. The song continues with rapid-fire lyrics by [[Steven Tyler]]. The song originated in December 1974 during a sound check when Aerosmith was opening for [[the Guess Who]] in Honolulu, Hawaii. During the sound check, Perry was \"fooling around with riffs and thinking about [[the Meters]]\", a group guitarist [[Jeff Beck]] had turned him on to. Loving \"their riffy New Orleans [[funk]], especially '[[Cissy Strut]]' and 'People Say'\", he asked the drummer \"to lay down something flat with a groove on the drums.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The guitar [[riff]] to what would become \"Walk This Way\" just \"came off [his] hands.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Needing a bridge, he: {{quote|played another riff and went there. But I didn't want the song to have a typical, boring 1, 4, 5 chord progression. After playing the first riff in the key of C, I shifted to E before returning to C for the verse and chorus. By the end of the sound check, I had the basics of a song.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nWhen singer Steven Tyler heard Perry playing that riff he \"ran out and sat behind the drums and [they] jammed.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} Tyler [[scat singing|scatted]] \"nonsensical words initially to feel where the lyrics should go before adding them later.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} When the group was halfway through recording ''Toys in the Attic'' in early 1975 at Record Plant in New York City, they found themselves stuck for material. They had written three or four songs for the album, having \"to write the rest in the studio.\" They decided to give the song Perry had come up with in Hawaii a try, but it didn't have lyrics or a title yet.{{sfn|Myers|2016}} In 1997, Perry recalled that the idea for the funky, [[James Brown]]-influenced \"Walk This Way\" was inspired by the film ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', which the band had gone to see around the time they were working on the track:\n\n{{quote|We were working on that song and we took a break to go see the movie in [[Times Square]]... and we came to the part where [[Marty Feldman]] as Igor limps down the steps of the train platform and says to [[Gene Wilder]], \"Walk this way,\" which Gene does with the same hideous limp. We fell over ourselves because it was so funny in a recognizably [[Three Stooges]] mode.{{sfn|Myers|2016}}}}\n\nAt the hotel that night, Tyler wrote lyrics for the song, but left them in the cab on the way to the studio next morning. He says: \"I must have been stoned. All the blood drained out of my face, but no one believed me. They thought I never got around to writing them.\" Upset, he took a cassette tape with the instrumental track we had recorded and a portable tape player with headphones and \"disappeared into the stairwell.\" He \"grabbed a few No. 2 pencils\" but forgot to take paper. He wrote the lyrics on the wall at \"the Record Plant's top floor and then down a few stairs of the back stairway.\" After \"two or three hours\" he \"ran downstairs for a legal pad and ran back up and copied them down.\"{{sfn|Myers|2016}} The lyrics, which tell the story of a high-school boy losing his virginity, are sung quite fast by Tyler, with heavy emphasis being placed on the rhyming lyrics.\n\nIt was bassist Tom Hamilton who came up with the main lick on \"Sweet Emotion\". In 1997 during a band interview with Alan Di Perna of ''[[Guitar World]]'' the members discussed the evolution of the song, which owes a debt to the [[Jeff Beck]] composition \"Rice Pudding\" from the album ''[[Beck-Ola]]''.<ref name=\"diperna\"/> Hamilton recalled:\n\n{{quote|I wrote that line on bass, and I realized I should think of some guitar parts for it if I was ever going to get a chance to present it to the band. I didn't think I ever would{{nbsp}}... Steven had the idea of taking that intro riff, which became the chorus bass line under the \"sweet emotion\" part, and transposing it into the key of E, and making it a really heavy [[Led Zeppelin]]esque thing.<ref name=\"diperna\"/>}}\n\nMany Aerosmith fans believe that Tyler wrote all of the lyrics to \"Sweet Emotion\" about the tension and hatred between the band members and Joe Perry's wife. Tyler himself has said that only some of the lyrics were inspired by Perry's wife. It was stated in Aerosmith's tell-all autobiography ''[[Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith|Walk This Way]]'' and in an episode of ''[[Behind the Music]]'' that growing feuds between the band members' wives (including an incident involving \"spilt milk\" where Elyssa Perry threw milk over Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry) may have helped lead to the band's original lineup dissolving in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"VH1\"/>\n\nHamilton and Tyler also collaborated on \"Uncle Salty\", with Tyler recalling in his 2001 autobiography, \"Here I was thinking about an orphanage when I wrote those lyrics. I'd try to make the melody weep from the sadness felt when a child is abandoned.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}} Of the title track, Tyler added, \"Joe was jamming a riff and I started yelling, 'Toys, toys, toys{{nbsp}}...' Organic, immediate, infectious{{nbsp}}... I just started singing and it fit like chocolate and peanut butter. Joe plays his ass off on that song.\"{{sfn|Tyler|Dalton|2011|p=116}}\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious recording on the album is \"You See Me Crying\", a complex piano ballad that was heavily orchestrated. Jack Douglas brought in a [[symphony orchestra]] for the song, which was conducted by [[Mike Mainieri]]. The song itself was written by Tyler and outside collaborator Don Solomon. Some of the band members became frustrated with the song, which took a long time to complete, due to the many complex drum and guitar parts. The band's label, [[Columbia Records]], was nonetheless very impressed with the song and the recording process. [[Bruce Lundvall]], then-president of Columbia Records walked in on the recording sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' when the band was working on the song and remarked: \"You guys got an incredible thing going here. I just came from a [[Herbie Hancock]] session and this is much more fun.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}} While Aerosmith were planning the \"Back in the Saddle\" concert tour and recording the ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'' album during 1984, a radio DJ played the song. Tyler, who was suffering memory loss at the time from years of drug use, liked \"You See Me Crying\" so much, he suggested his group record a cover version, only to be told by his bandmate Perry, \"It's ''us'', fuckhead.\"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011|p=119}}\n\nThe album also features a cover of [[Bullmoose Jackson]]'s \"Big Ten-Inch Record,\" originally an old R&B song recorded in 1952 and first heard by the band on a tape from [[Dr. Demento]]'s radio show on [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]]. Rather than produce a rock reimagining, Aerosmith's cover largely stays true to the original song, down to its jazz-style instrumentation. In the liner notes to ''[[Pandora's Box (album)|Pandora's Box]]'', Tyler insists that he sings \"'''cept'' on my big ten inch...\" not ''suck'' on my big ten inch,\" but laments that no one on earth believes him.<ref name=\"Pandora\"/>\n\nIn the 1997, Tyler shared his memories about writing and recording several of the LP's tracks with author [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]]:\n\n*\"No More No More\": \"On a song like 'No More No More', the lyrics came from my verbal diarrhea, a mishmash that I made up and eventually changed the lyrics to something cool{{nbsp}}... about life on the road: boredom, disillusion, [[Holiday Inn]]s, stalemate, jailbait. My diary.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=230}}\n*\"You See Me Crying\": \"This was when we had a string orchestra in to work on 'You See Me Crying', which I wrote with Don Solomon, a big production conducted by Mike Maineri.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=231}}\n*\"Sweet Emotion\": \"Frank Connally sold us to Leber-Krebs for what{{snd}}I don't know{{nbsp}}... On 'Sweet Emotion', we used these backward handclaps and four of us in the studio chanting, 'Fuck you, Frank.' If you play it backward, you can hear this.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=233}}\n*\"Uncle Salty\": \"Salty worked in a home for lost children and had his way with this little girl. That's what it's about. I'm the little girl, the orphaned boy. I put myself in that place. I'm Uncle Salty too.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n*\"Adam's Apple\": I don't remember anything except I arranged it and must have fought for credit. And I originally wanted to call the album ''Love at First Bite'' after the line in the song.\"{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1975, the band started working at [[Record Plant Studios|The Record Plant]] in New York City for the album that became ''Toys in the Attic''. The sessions for ''Toys in the Attic'' were produced by Douglas without Colcord{{snd}}the album was [[audio engineering|engineered]] by Jay Messina with assistant engineers Rod O'Brien, Corky Stasiak and Dave Thoener. The songs for ''Toys in the Attic'' were recorded with a Spectrasonics mixing board and a [[multitrack recording|16-track]] tape recorder.<ref name=\"notes1\" />\n\nPerry has stated that he wanted to call the LP ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'', which would be used for their next studio album.{{sfn|Davis|Aerosmith|1997|p=232}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AM1\" />\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n|rev3 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n|rev3score = (B+)<ref name=\"Christgau\" />\n|rev4 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"RS\" />\n}}\nContemporary reviews were originally mixed. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Gordon Fletcher compared negatively ''Toys in the Attic'' to ''Get Your Wings'' which, in his opinion, was \"testimony to the band\u2019s raw abilities\"; he criticised Douglas' production and wrote that, despite \"some good moments,\" the band did not avoid \"instances of directionless meandering and downright weak material.\"<ref name=\"RS 1975\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] was more positive and remarked the progress Aerosmith had done in such a short time, both musically and lyrically.<ref name=\"Christgau\" /> [[Greg Kot]] called the album a landmark of hard rock.<ref name=\"RS\" />\n\nReviews have become more positive over time. [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] remarked how Aerosmith \"finally perfected their mix of Stonesy raunch and Zeppelin-esque riffing\", thanks to \"a combination of an increased sense of songwriting skills and purpose\", creating on the album a new style which \"fully embraced sleaziness\" in Tyler's lyrics, backed by \"an appropriately greasy\" music.<ref name=\"AM1\" /> In his review for ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', Ben Mitchell found \"Aerosmith firing on all coke-clogged cylinders\" on ''Toys in the Attic'', he lauded all the songs in the album and called the arrangement of \"You See Me Crying\" \"a typical \u201970s rock extravagance.\"<ref name=\"Blender\" />\n\nWhen ''Toys in the Attic'' was released in April 1975,{{sfn|Huxley|2005|loc=eBook}} it eventually peaked at No. 11 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, 63 positions higher than ''Get Your Wings''.<ref name=\"AM2\" /> The single release of \"Sweet Emotion\" became a minor hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] reaching No. 36 in 1975 and \"Walk This Way\" reached No. 10 on the Hot 100 in 1977.<ref name=\"AM3\" />\n\nThe album would gain renewed attention in 1986, 11 years after its release, when [[hip-hop]] group [[Run DMC]] covered \"Walk This Way,\" which helped revive Aerosmith's then-flagging career as well as propel rap music to the mainstream.\n\nAerosmith make reference to the album and its lyrics in the song \"[[Legendary Child]]\" recorded in 2011.

It first opened for business on April 15, 1951, as \"The New London-Waterford Speed Bowl\", the track has been in continuous operation every season since it initially opened. It has continuously promoted [[Modified stock car racing]] as its featured division since its first year of operation.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>  It also holds family-oriented events such as the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday Series, Friday Show & Go drag racing and several Sunday Spectacular events throughout the year.  [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]] businessman Bruce Bemer, won the track property via foreclosure auction bid in October 2014 after several seasons of financial struggles under former owner Terry Eames.  Former track champion Shawn Monahan was named the track's new General Manager in February 2015. It formerly operated under [[NASCAR]]'s [[Whelen All-American Series]] banner on Saturday nights. On April 6, 2017, [[NASCAR]] announced they ended their relationship with the New London-Waterford Speedbowl following the arrest of track owner Bruce Bemer for charges relating to sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKeever|first1=Jim|last2=Roberts|first2=Laura|title=NASCAR ends relationship with New London-Waterford Speedbowl following owner\u2019s arrest|url=http://fox61.com/2017/04/06/nascar-ends-relationship-with-new-london-waterford-speedbowl/|website=FOX61|accessdate=April 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\n\n===Original ownership group===\nThe New London-Waterford Speedbowl opened on April 15, 1951, as a 1/3 mile crushed blue stone oval race track. Its ownership group, The New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc., was composed of local businessmen: brothers Fred and Frank Benvenuti, Anthony Albino, Conrad Nassetta, William Hoffner and J. Lawrence Peters. John Whitehouse was the track's first Race Director, a position he held through most of the original ownership group's tenure into the early 1970s.  Whitehouse lived in Florida during the winter and would then moved up north and stay in a house on the Speedbowl property during the racing season.  The Speedbowl featured Modified stock car racing, called Sportsmen Stock cars at the time. The first event winner was Bob Swift. After 3 weeks of operation, the dust created during green flag segments of racing became a nuisance to spectators.  The track closed for about a month and re-opened as an asphalt oval, which it remains today.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe one and only fatality as a result of injuries from an incident during a race occurred on August 1, 1954, when Jack Griffin's car flipped end-over-end approximately 10 times down the straightaway.  The 41-year-old was transported to the local hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after 1am the following morning.  His style of racecar, known as a \"cut-down\", was banned from the Speedbowl shortly thereafter for being too unsafe for competition.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1954-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1954 Year in Review]</ref>  In the coming years, the cut-downs were eventually banned throughout the northeast.\n\nThrough the 1961 season, the track held events twice a week, on Saturdays and Wednesdays, featuring the same divisions, meaning each division ran twice a week earning points towards the championship. Since the 1962, the Speedbowl's primary weekly divisions have raced once a week on Saturdays <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1962-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1962 Year in Review]</ref>(although separate divisions and events have since been created over the years and compete exclusively on other days of the week)\n\nThe operating Board of Directors had some turnover through the years.  By 1960, Anthony Albino (now President) and Frank Benvenuti (Vice-President) were the only original owners still part of New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc.  About a year later, local businessmen Jack Brouwer and Lou Esposito bought into the track as minority owners.  By the early 1970s, the track ownership group consisted of Brouwer, Esposito and 2nd generation members Don Benvenuti and Bob Albino (who was the majority owner).  Internal conflict would lead to the group selling the track after the 1974 season, after a 24-year run operating as The New-London Waterford Speedbowl Inc.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1974-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1974 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe first Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was NEAR Hall of Famer Dave Humphrey,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref> who also won the same title at the [[Seekonk Speedway]] that year, and would later win multiple titles in the [[Northeastern Midget Association|Northeastern Midget Association (NEMA)]] later in his career.<ref>[http://www.midgetmadness.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=11216  Midget Madness]</ref> Other big stars during the track's early days were 2-time Champion Bill Slater, 5-time Champion Don Collins, 4-time Champion Charlie Webster, Moe Gherzi, Melvin \"Red\" Foote, Newt Palm and Ted Stack.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Harvey Tattersall Jr. buys Speedbowl===\nPrior to the 1975 season, Harvey Tattersall Jr., long-time president of the United Stock Car Racing Association and one-time operator of the [[Riverside Park Speedway]] (among other tracks) bought the track from the previous ownership group. Tattersall had been one of the premiere racing promoters in the Northeast for two decades.  His ownership tenure saw him as promoter and Race Director in the first few years, then he leased the track out for most of the later years.\n\nTattersall revamped the structure of the supporting Late Model division when he took over in 1975, which was now called the Grand Americans.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1975-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1975 Year in Review]</ref> During his reign, Tattersall would lease the track to Dick Williams on two occasions. First in 1978,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1978-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1978 Year in Review]</ref> only for Tattersall take promoter duties back the following year, and then again in the early 1980s when Williams was actually operating four tracks at once, until focusing solely on the Waterford Speedbowl by the 1983 season <ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830124&id=vAMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5553,4412243  Speedbowl Plans Purring on all 8-cylinders]</ref> Both Tattersall and Williams served as both the promoter and Race Director during their respective operational control of the track.\n\nIn 1983, legendary modified driver Ed Flemke became the Chief Steward at the Speedbowl, working with Dick Williams.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1983-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1983 Year in Review]</ref>  It was the last position in auto racing that Flemke held.  He died during the following off-season.  His position at the Speedbowl was not replaced.\n\nOne of the more star-studded events during this time was the Yankee All-Star League events that ran at the track from 1975-1978. Winners of these events at Waterford included future [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] stars [[Geoff Bodine]], [[Ron Bouchard]] and [[Ken Bouchard]], NASCAR National Modified Champions Carl \"Bugsy\" Stevens and [[Fred DeSarro]] and legendary Long Island, NY Modified driver [[Charlie Jarzombek]]. NASCAR Hall of Famer [[Richie Evans]] competed in these events and a few others at the Speedbowl during his career before his death in 1985. The Waterford Speedbowl, however, is one of the few tracks that Evans raced at without ever recording a victory.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/special-features/major-events/yankee-all-star-league/  speedbowlhistory.com-Yankee All-Star League]</ref> The NASCAR Stroh's Late Model tour, run by Tom Curley, made two appearances at the track in 1982 & 1983.  Dave Dion won both events.\n\nStars on the track during this time were 4-time Modified Champion Dick Dunn, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> and Late Models racers Don Fowler, Bob Gada and Ron Cote <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> among others.\n\n===Arute's 7A Productions===\nBy the end of the 1984 season, the track was enduring a tough time. The 1984 season was the only season which didn't have an end of the year banquet to celebrate its champions. But prior to the 1985 season, Tattersall leased the Speedbowl to the Arute family, who owned and operated the [[Stafford Motor Speedway]] in [[Stafford Springs, Connecticut|Stafford Springs]]. Two significant changes came during their reign as track operators: The headlining division was changed from the Modified division, to the upstart SK Modified division (at the time, the SK's were designed as a low-budget alternative to modified racing) and they also brought the NASCAR sanction to the track for the first time. The first SK Modified Champion at Waterford was future [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion Rick Fuller, driving the Ted Marsh #55 car in 198<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1985-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1985 Year in Review]</ref> The Arutes leased the track for 3 seasons, before leaving to once again focus solely on their family owned track in Stafford.\n\nAnother star who blossomed during the mid-1980s was Late Model driver Phil Rondeau of [[Baltic, Connecticut]]. He won a record 6 Late Model Championships in an 8-year span (1985, 1987\u201389, 1991\u201392) and recorded over 100 victories during his career that lasted into the early 2000s at the track. Rondeau was considered one of the top short track Late Model drivers in the Northeast during his time at Waterford. Other stars on the track in the 1980s included C.J. Frye and Brian McCarthy in the Late Model division <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> and Rick Donnelly, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt and Dick Ceravolo in the Modifieds. Potter won 6 Championship between the Modified and SK Modified divisions in the 1970s & 1980's. Hewitt was a 5-time Modified Champion.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Korteweg's K Corporation===\nIn 1988, the Korteweg family took over track operations. Headed by father George and his sons Dan and Wayne, the Kortewegs invested a lot into track renovations, including the only repaving of the track's racing surface, new steel [[Armco barrier]] around the track, new catch fence and renovated restrooms and concession stands. A 3rd division was created in 1988 to support the SK Modified and Late Model divisions, called the Strictly Stocks - an entry level division of 8-cylinder stock cars. This division proved to be wildly popular.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1988-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1988 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s brought some hurdles for the Korteweg family.  Local residents complained in numbers about the noise the facility generated during its events.  The track made it mandatory for all race cars to have mufflers in 1991.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-06-11/features/0000100879_1_noise-ordinance-decibel-level-track  Waterford Getting an Earful Over Noise]</ref> The town of Waterford did implement a noise ordinance in August 1993, but it excluded racing at the Speedbowl.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-08-06/features/0000006370_1_indycar-penske-racing-new-hampshire-international-speedway  Waterford is Left Out]</ref> During July 1991, the Speedbowl was endanger of closing its doors for one of its big events on July 4 weekend, when then-Connecticut Governor [[Lowell Weicker]] cut the state budget for non-essential jobs, including the DMV officials who regulated race events at all Connecticut tracks.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1991-07-04/features/0000214407_1_dmv-racing-tracks  Auto Racing Tracks Get Green Flag]</ref>  Less than 48 hours before the event, the state allowed DMV officials to the Speedbowl, however they would now be paid by the track directly.  Connecticut's DMV would no longer have any governing power over the events at the Speedbowl, which remains the case today.\n\nThroughout the 90's, more divisions were created. In 1995, the Mini Stock division (a former enduro-type division that ran on Sundays) was revamped as the 4-cylinder alternative to the Strictly Stock class.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1995-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1995 Year in Review]</ref> [[Legends car racing]], truck divisions and several other enduro-type divisions were also run on Sundays and then Thursdays throughout the decade.\n\nStars on the track during the 90's included Jerry Pearl, Dave Gada, Todd Ceravolo and future NASCAR [[Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion [[Ted Christopher]] in the SK Modified division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Phil Rondeau, Jay Stuart, Tom Fox and future [[K&N Pro Series East]] Champion [[Matt Kobyluck]] in the Late Model division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Glen Boss, Ed Reed Jr., Ken Cassidy and Chris \"Moose\" Douton in the Strictly Stock division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>  Jeff Miller, Dan Darnstaedt and Bruce Thomas in the Mini Stock division.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref>\n\n===Terry Eames buys Speedbowl===\nIn 2000, Terry Eames, who was the Speedbowl's promoter since the Korteweg's left the track in the mid-90s, became owner/operator and secured the return of the NASCAR sanction which had been removed in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2000-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 2000 Year in Review]</ref> In 2001, the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series debuted featuring the Legends Cars as the headlining division along with enduro-type cars called Super X (8-cylinder) and X-cars (4-cylinder) for a weekly summer series that is largely family oriented and still popular to this day.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2001-year-in-review/ speedbowlhistory.com 2001 Year in Review]</ref> It was around this time that the track was remeasured per NASCAR guidelines and officially declared a 0.375 (3/8) mile oval after a half-century of being recognized as a 0.333 (1/3) mile track.\n\nThe dominate driver in the SK Modifieds during this time was Dennis Gada, who won a record 5 straight Championships from 1999-2003 including the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Series Northeast Regional title in 2003.<ref>[http://www.racingwest.com/news/articles/8032-mcfarland-nascar-dodge-weekly-series-champions.html  NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Champions Celebrate]</ref> Gada's 62 career SK wins at the track is also a record. During the early part of the decade the [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] and [[NASCAR Busch North Series|NASCAR Busch North/East Series]] visited the track annually.\n\nHowever, by the mid-2000s the track was falling on hard times. In 2006, Washington Mutual Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against Eames. A year later, in late July 2007, a foreclosure auction was avoided when Connecticut businessmen Rocky Arbitell and Peter Borelli bought the note and refinanced with Eames directly. Washington Mutual Bank was now removed from the picture.<ref>[http://www.foreclosurelistings.com/content/foreclosures/foreclosed-homes/brakes-on-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure.htm Brakes on Waterford Speedbowl Foreclosure]</ref> Eames continued as owner, but leased operational control of the track to Jerry Robinson of [[Mystic, Connecticut]], for the 2007\u201308 seasons.  Around this time, Harvey Industries bought 8 of the 39 acres from Eames and built a distribution center in what was the north end of the parking lot.\n\nStars during the first decade of the 2000s included: Dennis Gada, Jeff Pearl, Ron Yuhas Jr. and Rob Janovic Jr. in the SK Modifieds;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Allen Coates, Corey Hutchings, Bruce Thomas Jr. and Tim Jordan in the Late Models <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Ed Gertsch Jr., Dwayne Dorr, Walt Hovey Jr. and Al Stone III in the Street Stocks;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>   Danny Field, Phil Evans and Ken Cassidy Jr. in the Mini Stocks.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref> Regional Modified/SK Modified drivers who started out in the Speedbowl's Legends Car division during this time include James Civali, Chris Pasteryak, Mark Bakaj and Jeffrey Paul.\n\n===New board of directors era===\nIn 2009, Terry Eames took back operational control of the track when Robinson's lease was not renewed.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/11/as-the-speedbowl-management-tu.html As the Speedbowl Management Turns]</ref> Now the promoter once again, Eames formed a new Board of Directors which included former competitor and 2-time Speedbowl Champion Tom Fox as Race Director, former Mini Stock competitor Mark Caise and local supporter Brian Darling. The original group also featured former Street Stock Champion Shawn Monahan as a joint operator of the track <ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/12/center-stage-monday-night-for.html  Center Stage for Speedbowl]</ref> and track historian Tom \"Sid\" DiMaggio in a multimedia capacity. However, by February 2009, Shawn Monahan resigned from his post sighting differences in the operational agreement with Eames and returned to racing shortly thereafter.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2009/01/saying-goodbye-shawn-monahan-q.html  Shawn Monahan Quickly Gone..]</ref> DiMaggio resigned 3 days later, although he continues as the track's active historian and part of the track's social media presence via his production company's video work.<ref>http://www.sidsview.com</ref>  Fox would resign as Race Director after the 2010 season and Scott Tapley was named as his replacement at the 2010 awards banquet ceremony in January 2011.  Shortly after the 2012 season ended, Tapley then resigned to take the Race Director position with the Valenti Modified Racing Series.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/11/scott-tapley-leaving-waterford-speedbowl-to-become-new-valenti-modified-racing-series-race-director/</ref>  Track owner & promoter Terry Eames took over the Race Director duties for the 2013 season, the first promoter to do so since Dick Williams in 1984.  Former X-Car Champion Patrick Williams took over Race Director duties in 2014.  In addition to the turnover with officials, the foreclosure issues were dragged out in the courts, with each season since 2006 ending with a cloud of doubt towards the facility's long-term future.\n\nThe Speedbowl's current divisions are SK Modifieds, Late Models, SK Lights, Street Stocks and Mini Stocks. Legend Cars also compete sporadically throughout the Saturday season. The Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series continues to be a successful mid-week series during the summer that features Legends Cars and Bandoleros (for drivers as young as 6-years old), Super-X cars and X-cars and various \"wacky\" races throughout their season.\n\nCurrent touring divisions that visit the track each year include the [[International Supermodified Association|ISMA Super Modifieds]], the Valenti Modified Racing Series, the [[Northeastern Midget Association|NEMA Midgets]], the Northeast Trucks Series (NETS) and the Pro4 Modifieds.\n\nKeith Rocco, who also competes at the Stafford Motor Speedway and Thompson International Speedway, clinched the [[NASCAR Whelen All-American Series]] National Championship at the Speedbowl on August 14, 2010.<ref>[http://www.speedbowl.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1281836848&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&  Rocco wins NASCAR National title]</ref> He became the first driver to win a NASCAR National Championship while an active weekly competitor at the Waterford Speedbowl. In 2012, the Speedbowl was the hometrack to three National Champions: Ken Cassidy Jr., who won his 4th Mini Stock Championship with a record 12-win season, also won the NASCAR Division III (Asphalt) National Championship.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/10/ken-cassidy-closes-out-dazzling-season-with-historic-mini-stock-win-at-waterford/</ref>  Wednesday Legends Champion Dave Garbo Jr. was the INEX Legends Car Semi-Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  Matt Pappa, of NY, who won 11 times at the Speedbowl in 2012, won the INEX Legends Car Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  In 2013, Keith Rocco became the first driver to win 2 track championships in 2 different divisions when he won both the SK Modified & Late Models titles.  In 2014, he did it again tying Dennis Gada for most Track Championships (7) in track history.\n\n===New owner Bruce Bemer===\nOn October 18, 2014, a foreclosure auction was held on the Speedbowl property. It was held on the same date as the annual 'Smacktoberfest' event which closes the racing season. There were approximately 100 people in attendance, with four registered bidders.  The winning bid of $1.75 million came from Glastonbury, Connecticut, businessman Bruce Bemer, whose group immediately announced they intended to keep it a racetrack.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/10/green-flag-waterford-speedbowl-expected-to-remain-race-track-following-foreclosure-auction/</ref>  However, the total debt that brought about the foreclosure auction was over $2 million, meaning not all the creditors owed money would be paid.  One creditor, Ed DeMuzzio, filed motions (including a motion to reconsider and an appeal) in hopes to recoup some of his money.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/12/creditor-files-motion-for-reconsideration-of-approval-of-foreclosure-auction-sale-of-waterford-speedbowl/</ref> After months of negotiations between all parties involved, in early February 2015, a resolution was reached, the appeal was withdrawn and the sale was finally approved by the courts.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/start-your-engines-settlement-reached-in-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure-case/</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Shawn Monahan was named as the new GM of the Speedbowl \u2013 six years after his first opportunity in a similar role with Terry Eames.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/breaking-shawn-monahan-named-gm-of-waterford-speedbowl-scott-tapley-named-racing-director/</ref>  Scott Tapley was also announced as the new Race Director.  One of their earliest announcements was a change back to the track's original name, \"The New London-Waterford Speedbowl\".\n\nIn 2017 Bruce Bemer was arrested for participating a sex ring and human trafficking involving troubled young men and men with mental disabilities.<ref>http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-bruce-bemer-appearance-20180131-story.html</ref>.

INEX pulled its sanction for the [[US Legend Cars]] and Bandolero divisions as well.  The track wasn't going to open but in 2017 but a lease deal was worked out to open the track with George Whitney managing the day-to-day of the track. <ref>http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/20170606/speedbowl-agreement-reached-to-lease-reopen-track-for-2017-season</ref>.

Mike Serluca leased the track for the remainder of the 2018 season.\n\nThe track's main grandstand, dating to 1951, was required to be replaced by the town of Waterford and were dismantled after the 2018 season.   New stands are on site but were not erected in time, and the speedway did not open for competition in 2019.  Mike Serluca remains in place as the track's General Manager, and the track anticipates reopening when construction is complete.\n\n[[File:BrianOuimetteHerocardVPback.jpg|thumb|Brian Ouimette at the Waterford Speedbowl.]]\n\n==In media==\n*New York DJ, producer and radio host [[Funkmaster Flex]] wanted to explore his passion for car racing and developed a unique way to get it done with a new [[Spike TV]] show race event called The Funkmaster Flex Super Series Invitational. The race featured 60 hungry late model stock car drivers from across the country turning laps at the Waterford Speedbowl. Flex went behind the scene to see what it takes to become a winner in racing while bringing out celebrities like [[Orange County Choppers]], who paced the field before the start of the race on their choppers, [[Lil' Kim]] who wove the initial green flag as the honorary starter and [[LL Cool J]], who gave a short performance to the crowd after the event..

Coates won $10,000 and a vintage 1969 Camaro for his victory.  Pitkat took home $6,000 for second and Rondeau $4,000 for third.  The event was billed as having $100,000 in total purse and awards.  The crowd was estimated at around 8,000 people, making it one of the most attended events in the history of the facility.<ref>http://articles.courant.com/2004-08-06/features/0408060755_1_lil-great-race-orange-county-choppers</ref>  Although there were early discussions for this to be a yearly event, Funkmaster Flex never returned to the Speedbowl to continue the series.\n*In the summer of 2005, [[NESN]] debuted a series called \"Inside Line\" that was a reality based show focusing on local racing in the Northeast.<ref>http://www.persistencemedia.com/news/release-inside-line.php</ref> Ted Christopher, one of the premier Modified drivers and former SK Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was one of the people profiled in an early episode of the short-lived series.  Much of the raceday footage used was shot at the Speedbowl on June 25, 2005, when Christopher competed in both the weekly SK Modified 35 lap event and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour 150 event. His twin brother Mike, engine builder Mike Pettit, and fellow competitors Doug Coby, Chris Pasteryak and the late Jay Miller were some of the people who had appearances in the episode as well.\n*The Speedbowl was highlighted on the [[Discovery Channel]] network's show [[Destroyed in Seconds]].<ref>http://www.livedash.com/transcript/destroyed_in_seconds/6222/DSCP/Thursday_January_21_2010/172502/</ref>  Originally airing on February 16, 2009, a segment of the show was dedicated to a wreck during a Late Model event held a few years earlier on Saturday July 8, 2006.  Jay Lozyniak's #28 car barrell-rolled down the front straightaway during a multi-car wreck in turn 4.  Most of the footage shown was recorded by Jay's mother in the stands while it happened.  Jay, and all other drivers involved that night, were not seriously injured.  The race was red-checkered after only 18 of the 30 laps were completed.  Only five cars were able to continue after the incident.  Glenn Colvin, who was the highest positioned car not involved in the wreck, was declared the winner.<ref>http://www.sids-vault.com/stats.php?a=1&b=6&c=7&d=2</ref>\n*The 2011 film 3 Weeks to Daytona, written & directed by [[Fairfield, CT]] native Bret Stern,<ref>http://www.fairfieldcitizenonline.com/news/article/Racer-s-dreams-fuel-inspiration-for-Fairfielder-s-1323625.php</ref>  was shot in several locations throughout the state, including the Waterford Speedbowl. In an interview with the website [[indieWire]], Stern stated \"I was inspired to make the film after watching cars race at the Speedbowl in Waterford, Connecticut. I'd go Saturday night to see races.

It first opened for business on April 15, 1951, as \"The New London-Waterford Speed Bowl\", the track has been in continuous operation every season since it initially opened. It has continuously promoted [[Modified stock car racing]] as its featured division since its first year of operation.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>  It also holds family-oriented events such as the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday Series, Friday Show & Go drag racing and several Sunday Spectacular events throughout the year.  [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]] businessman Bruce Bemer, won the track property via foreclosure auction bid in October 2014 after several seasons of financial struggles under former owner Terry Eames.  Former track champion Shawn Monahan was named the track's new General Manager in February 2015. It formerly operated under [[NASCAR]]'s [[Whelen All-American Series]] banner on Saturday nights. On April 6, 2017, [[NASCAR]] announced they ended their relationship with the New London-Waterford Speedbowl following the arrest of track owner Bruce Bemer for charges relating to sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McKeever|first1=Jim|last2=Roberts|first2=Laura|title=NASCAR ends relationship with New London-Waterford Speedbowl following owner\u2019s arrest|url=http://fox61.com/2017/04/06/nascar-ends-relationship-with-new-london-waterford-speedbowl/|website=FOX61|accessdate=April 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History ==\n\n===Original ownership group===\nThe New London-Waterford Speedbowl opened on April 15, 1951, as a 1/3 mile crushed blue stone oval race track. Its ownership group, The New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc., was composed of local businessmen: brothers Fred and Frank Benvenuti, Anthony Albino, Conrad Nassetta, William Hoffner and J. Lawrence Peters. John Whitehouse was the track's first Race Director, a position he held through most of the original ownership group's tenure into the early 1970s.  Whitehouse lived in Florida during the winter and would then moved up north and stay in a house on the Speedbowl property during the racing season.  The Speedbowl featured Modified stock car racing, called Sportsmen Stock cars at the time. The first event winner was Bob Swift. After 3 weeks of operation, the dust created during green flag segments of racing became a nuisance to spectators.  The track closed for about a month and re-opened as an asphalt oval, which it remains today.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe one and only fatality as a result of injuries from an incident during a race occurred on August 1, 1954, when Jack Griffin's car flipped end-over-end approximately 10 times down the straightaway.  The 41-year-old was transported to the local hospital but was pronounced dead shortly after 1am the following morning.  His style of racecar, known as a \"cut-down\", was banned from the Speedbowl shortly thereafter for being too unsafe for competition.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1954-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1954 Year in Review]</ref>  In the coming years, the cut-downs were eventually banned throughout the northeast.\n\nThrough the 1961 season, the track held events twice a week, on Saturdays and Wednesdays, featuring the same divisions, meaning each division ran twice a week earning points towards the championship. Since the 1962, the Speedbowl's primary weekly divisions have raced once a week on Saturdays <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1962-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1962 Year in Review]</ref>(although separate divisions and events have since been created over the years and compete exclusively on other days of the week)\n\nThe operating Board of Directors had some turnover through the years.  By 1960, Anthony Albino (now President) and Frank Benvenuti (Vice-President) were the only original owners still part of New London-Waterford Speedbowl, Inc.  About a year later, local businessmen Jack Brouwer and Lou Esposito bought into the track as minority owners.  By the early 1970s, the track ownership group consisted of Brouwer, Esposito and 2nd generation members Don Benvenuti and Bob Albino (who was the majority owner).  Internal conflict would lead to the group selling the track after the 1974 season, after a 24-year run operating as The New-London Waterford Speedbowl Inc.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1974-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1974 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe first Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was NEAR Hall of Famer Dave Humphrey,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1951-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1951 Year in Review]</ref> who also won the same title at the [[Seekonk Speedway]] that year, and would later win multiple titles in the [[Northeastern Midget Association|Northeastern Midget Association (NEMA)]] later in his career.<ref>[http://www.midgetmadness.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=11216  Midget Madness]</ref> Other big stars during the track's early days were 2-time Champion Bill Slater, 5-time Champion Don Collins, 4-time Champion Charlie Webster, Moe Gherzi, Melvin \"Red\" Foote, Newt Palm and Ted Stack.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Harvey Tattersall Jr. buys Speedbowl===\nPrior to the 1975 season, Harvey Tattersall Jr., long-time president of the United Stock Car Racing Association and one-time operator of the [[Riverside Park Speedway]] (among other tracks) bought the track from the previous ownership group. Tattersall had been one of the premiere racing promoters in the Northeast for two decades.  His ownership tenure saw him as promoter and Race Director in the first few years, then he leased the track out for most of the later years.\n\nTattersall revamped the structure of the supporting Late Model division when he took over in 1975, which was now called the Grand Americans.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1975-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1975 Year in Review]</ref> During his reign, Tattersall would lease the track to Dick Williams on two occasions. First in 1978,<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1978-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1978 Year in Review]</ref> only for Tattersall take promoter duties back the following year, and then again in the early 1980s when Williams was actually operating four tracks at once, until focusing solely on the Waterford Speedbowl by the 1983 season <ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830124&id=vAMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5553,4412243  Speedbowl Plans Purring on all 8-cylinders]</ref> Both Tattersall and Williams served as both the promoter and Race Director during their respective operational control of the track.\n\nIn 1983, legendary modified driver Ed Flemke became the Chief Steward at the Speedbowl, working with Dick Williams.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1983-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1983 Year in Review]</ref>  It was the last position in auto racing that Flemke held.  He died during the following off-season.  His position at the Speedbowl was not replaced.\n\nOne of the more star-studded events during this time was the Yankee All-Star League events that ran at the track from 1975-1978. Winners of these events at Waterford included future [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] stars [[Geoff Bodine]], [[Ron Bouchard]] and [[Ken Bouchard]], NASCAR National Modified Champions Carl \"Bugsy\" Stevens and [[Fred DeSarro]] and legendary Long Island, NY Modified driver [[Charlie Jarzombek]]. NASCAR Hall of Famer [[Richie Evans]] competed in these events and a few others at the Speedbowl during his career before his death in 1985. The Waterford Speedbowl, however, is one of the few tracks that Evans raced at without ever recording a victory.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/special-features/major-events/yankee-all-star-league/  speedbowlhistory.com-Yankee All-Star League]</ref> The NASCAR Stroh's Late Model tour, run by Tom Curley, made two appearances at the track in 1982 & 1983.  Dave Dion won both events.\n\nStars on the track during this time were 4-time Modified Champion Dick Dunn, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> and Late Models racers Don Fowler, Bob Gada and Ron Cote <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> among others.\n\n===Arute's 7A Productions===\nBy the end of the 1984 season, the track was enduring a tough time. The 1984 season was the only season which didn't have an end of the year banquet to celebrate its champions. But prior to the 1985 season, Tattersall leased the Speedbowl to the Arute family, who owned and operated the [[Stafford Motor Speedway]] in [[Stafford Springs, Connecticut|Stafford Springs]]. Two significant changes came during their reign as track operators: The headlining division was changed from the Modified division, to the upstart SK Modified division (at the time, the SK's were designed as a low-budget alternative to modified racing) and they also brought the NASCAR sanction to the track for the first time. The first SK Modified Champion at Waterford was future [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion Rick Fuller, driving the Ted Marsh #55 car in 198<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1985-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1985 Year in Review]</ref> The Arutes leased the track for 3 seasons, before leaving to once again focus solely on their family owned track in Stafford.\n\nAnother star who blossomed during the mid-1980s was Late Model driver Phil Rondeau of [[Baltic, Connecticut]]. He won a record 6 Late Model Championships in an 8-year span (1985, 1987\u201389, 1991\u201392) and recorded over 100 victories during his career that lasted into the early 2000s at the track. Rondeau was considered one of the top short track Late Model drivers in the Northeast during his time at Waterford. Other stars on the track in the 1980s included C.J. Frye and Brian McCarthy in the Late Model division <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> and Rick Donnelly, Bob Potter, George \"Moose\" Hewitt and Dick Ceravolo in the Modifieds. Potter won 6 Championship between the Modified and SK Modified divisions in the 1970s & 1980's. Hewitt was a 5-time Modified Champion.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref>\n\n===Korteweg's K Corporation===\nIn 1988, the Korteweg family took over track operations. Headed by father George and his sons Dan and Wayne, the Kortewegs invested a lot into track renovations, including the only repaving of the track's racing surface, new steel [[Armco barrier]] around the track, new catch fence and renovated restrooms and concession stands. A 3rd division was created in 1988 to support the SK Modified and Late Model divisions, called the Strictly Stocks - an entry level division of 8-cylinder stock cars. This division proved to be wildly popular.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1988-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1988 Year in Review]</ref>\n\nThe early 1990s brought some hurdles for the Korteweg family.  Local residents complained in numbers about the noise the facility generated during its events.  The track made it mandatory for all race cars to have mufflers in 1991.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-06-11/features/0000100879_1_noise-ordinance-decibel-level-track  Waterford Getting an Earful Over Noise]</ref> The town of Waterford did implement a noise ordinance in August 1993, but it excluded racing at the Speedbowl.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1993-08-06/features/0000006370_1_indycar-penske-racing-new-hampshire-international-speedway  Waterford is Left Out]</ref> During July 1991, the Speedbowl was endanger of closing its doors for one of its big events on July 4 weekend, when then-Connecticut Governor [[Lowell Weicker]] cut the state budget for non-essential jobs, including the DMV officials who regulated race events at all Connecticut tracks.<ref>[http://articles.courant.com/1991-07-04/features/0000214407_1_dmv-racing-tracks  Auto Racing Tracks Get Green Flag]</ref>  Less than 48 hours before the event, the state allowed DMV officials to the Speedbowl, however they would now be paid by the track directly.  Connecticut's DMV would no longer have any governing power over the events at the Speedbowl, which remains the case today.\n\nThroughout the 90's, more divisions were created. In 1995, the Mini Stock division (a former enduro-type division that ran on Sundays) was revamped as the 4-cylinder alternative to the Strictly Stock class.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/1995-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 1995 Year in Review]</ref> [[Legends car racing]], truck divisions and several other enduro-type divisions were also run on Sundays and then Thursdays throughout the decade.\n\nStars on the track during the 90's included Jerry Pearl, Dave Gada, Todd Ceravolo and future NASCAR [[Whelen Modified Tour]] Champion [[Ted Christopher]] in the SK Modified division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Phil Rondeau, Jay Stuart, Tom Fox and future [[K&N Pro Series East]] Champion [[Matt Kobyluck]] in the Late Model division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Glen Boss, Ed Reed Jr., Ken Cassidy and Chris \"Moose\" Douton in the Strictly Stock division;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>  Jeff Miller, Dan Darnstaedt and Bruce Thomas in the Mini Stock division.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref>\n\n===Terry Eames buys Speedbowl===\nIn 2000, Terry Eames, who was the Speedbowl's promoter since the Korteweg's left the track in the mid-90s, became owner/operator and secured the return of the NASCAR sanction which had been removed in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2000-year-in-review/  speedbowlhistory.com 2000 Year in Review]</ref> In 2001, the Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series debuted featuring the Legends Cars as the headlining division along with enduro-type cars called Super X (8-cylinder) and X-cars (4-cylinder) for a weekly summer series that is largely family oriented and still popular to this day.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/2001-year-in-review/ speedbowlhistory.com 2001 Year in Review]</ref> It was around this time that the track was remeasured per NASCAR guidelines and officially declared a 0.375 (3/8) mile oval after a half-century of being recognized as a 0.333 (1/3) mile track.\n\nThe dominate driver in the SK Modifieds during this time was Dennis Gada, who won a record 5 straight Championships from 1999-2003 including the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Series Northeast Regional title in 2003.<ref>[http://www.racingwest.com/news/articles/8032-mcfarland-nascar-dodge-weekly-series-champions.html  NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Champions Celebrate]</ref> Gada's 62 career SK wins at the track is also a record. During the early part of the decade the [[NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour]] and [[NASCAR Busch North Series|NASCAR Busch North/East Series]] visited the track annually.\n\nHowever, by the mid-2000s the track was falling on hard times. In 2006, Washington Mutual Bank initiated foreclosure proceedings against Eames. A year later, in late July 2007, a foreclosure auction was avoided when Connecticut businessmen Rocky Arbitell and Peter Borelli bought the note and refinanced with Eames directly. Washington Mutual Bank was now removed from the picture.<ref>[http://www.foreclosurelistings.com/content/foreclosures/foreclosed-homes/brakes-on-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure.htm Brakes on Waterford Speedbowl Foreclosure]</ref> Eames continued as owner, but leased operational control of the track to Jerry Robinson of [[Mystic, Connecticut]], for the 2007\u201308 seasons.  Around this time, Harvey Industries bought 8 of the 39 acres from Eames and built a distribution center in what was the north end of the parking lot.\n\nStars during the first decade of the 2000s included: Dennis Gada, Jeff Pearl, Ron Yuhas Jr. and Rob Janovic Jr. in the SK Modifieds;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/modified-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Modified Champions]</ref> Allen Coates, Corey Hutchings, Bruce Thomas Jr. and Tim Jordan in the Late Models <ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/late-model-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Late Model Champions]</ref> Ed Gertsch Jr., Dwayne Dorr, Walt Hovey Jr. and Al Stone III in the Street Stocks;<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/street-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Street Stock Champions]</ref>   Danny Field, Phil Evans and Ken Cassidy Jr. in the Mini Stocks.<ref>[http://speedbowlhistory.com/track-champions/mini-stock-champions/  speedbowlhistory.com-Mini Stock Champions]</ref> Regional Modified/SK Modified drivers who started out in the Speedbowl's Legends Car division during this time include James Civali, Chris Pasteryak, Mark Bakaj and Jeffrey Paul.\n\n===New board of directors era===\nIn 2009, Terry Eames took back operational control of the track when Robinson's lease was not renewed.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/11/as-the-speedbowl-management-tu.html As the Speedbowl Management Turns]</ref> Now the promoter once again, Eames formed a new Board of Directors which included former competitor and 2-time Speedbowl Champion Tom Fox as Race Director, former Mini Stock competitor Mark Caise and local supporter Brian Darling. The original group also featured former Street Stock Champion Shawn Monahan as a joint operator of the track <ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2008/12/center-stage-monday-night-for.html  Center Stage for Speedbowl]</ref> and track historian Tom \"Sid\" DiMaggio in a multimedia capacity. However, by February 2009, Shawn Monahan resigned from his post sighting differences in the operational agreement with Eames and returned to racing shortly thereafter.<ref>[http://blogs.courant.com/autoracing/2009/01/saying-goodbye-shawn-monahan-q.html  Shawn Monahan Quickly Gone..]</ref> DiMaggio resigned 3 days later, although he continues as the track's active historian and part of the track's social media presence via his production company's video work.<ref>http://www.sidsview.com</ref>  Fox would resign as Race Director after the 2010 season and Scott Tapley was named as his replacement at the 2010 awards banquet ceremony in January 2011.  Shortly after the 2012 season ended, Tapley then resigned to take the Race Director position with the Valenti Modified Racing Series.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/11/scott-tapley-leaving-waterford-speedbowl-to-become-new-valenti-modified-racing-series-race-director/</ref>  Track owner & promoter Terry Eames took over the Race Director duties for the 2013 season, the first promoter to do so since Dick Williams in 1984.  Former X-Car Champion Patrick Williams took over Race Director duties in 2014.  In addition to the turnover with officials, the foreclosure issues were dragged out in the courts, with each season since 2006 ending with a cloud of doubt towards the facility's long-term future.\n\nThe Speedbowl's current divisions are SK Modifieds, Late Models, SK Lights, Street Stocks and Mini Stocks. Legend Cars also compete sporadically throughout the Saturday season. The Wild N' Wacky Wednesday series continues to be a successful mid-week series during the summer that features Legends Cars and Bandoleros (for drivers as young as 6-years old), Super-X cars and X-cars and various \"wacky\" races throughout their season.\n\nCurrent touring divisions that visit the track each year include the [[International Supermodified Association|ISMA Super Modifieds]], the Valenti Modified Racing Series, the [[Northeastern Midget Association|NEMA Midgets]], the Northeast Trucks Series (NETS) and the Pro4 Modifieds.\n\nKeith Rocco, who also competes at the Stafford Motor Speedway and Thompson International Speedway, clinched the [[NASCAR Whelen All-American Series]] National Championship at the Speedbowl on August 14, 2010.<ref>[http://www.speedbowl.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1281836848&archive=&start_from=&ucat=1&  Rocco wins NASCAR National title]</ref> He became the first driver to win a NASCAR National Championship while an active weekly competitor at the Waterford Speedbowl. In 2012, the Speedbowl was the hometrack to three National Champions: Ken Cassidy Jr., who won his 4th Mini Stock Championship with a record 12-win season, also won the NASCAR Division III (Asphalt) National Championship.<ref>http://www.racedayct.com/2012/10/ken-cassidy-closes-out-dazzling-season-with-historic-mini-stock-win-at-waterford/</ref>  Wednesday Legends Champion Dave Garbo Jr. was the INEX Legends Car Semi-Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  Matt Pappa, of NY, who won 11 times at the Speedbowl in 2012, won the INEX Legends Car Pro (Asphalt) National Championship.  In 2013, Keith Rocco became the first driver to win 2 track championships in 2 different divisions when he won both the SK Modified & Late Models titles.  In 2014, he did it again tying Dennis Gada for most Track Championships (7) in track history.\n\n===New owner Bruce Bemer===\nOn October 18, 2014, a foreclosure auction was held on the Speedbowl property. It was held on the same date as the annual 'Smacktoberfest' event which closes the racing season. There were approximately 100 people in attendance, with four registered bidders.  The winning bid of $1.75 million came from Glastonbury, Connecticut, businessman Bruce Bemer, whose group immediately announced they intended to keep it a racetrack.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/10/green-flag-waterford-speedbowl-expected-to-remain-race-track-following-foreclosure-auction/</ref>  However, the total debt that brought about the foreclosure auction was over $2 million, meaning not all the creditors owed money would be paid.  One creditor, Ed DeMuzzio, filed motions (including a motion to reconsider and an appeal) in hopes to recoup some of his money.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2014/12/creditor-files-motion-for-reconsideration-of-approval-of-foreclosure-auction-sale-of-waterford-speedbowl/</ref> After months of negotiations between all parties involved, in early February 2015, a resolution was reached, the appeal was withdrawn and the sale was finally approved by the courts.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/start-your-engines-settlement-reached-in-waterford-speedbowl-foreclosure-case/</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Shawn Monahan was named as the new GM of the Speedbowl \u2013 six years after his first opportunity in a similar role with Terry Eames.<ref>http://racedayct.com/2015/02/breaking-shawn-monahan-named-gm-of-waterford-speedbowl-scott-tapley-named-racing-director/</ref>  Scott Tapley was also announced as the new Race Director.  One of their earliest announcements was a change back to the track's original name, \"The New London-Waterford Speedbowl\".\n\nIn 2017 Bruce Bemer was arrested for participating a sex ring and human trafficking involving troubled young men and men with mental disabilities.<ref>http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-news-bruce-bemer-appearance-20180131-story.html</ref>. NASCAR pulled its sanction for the track's weekly Saturday divisions shortly afterward <ref>https://www.wtnh.com/news/connecticut/new-london/nascar-terminates-sanctions-with-new-london-waterford-speedbowl/1068395854</ref>. INEX pulled its sanction for the [[US Legend Cars]] and Bandolero divisions as well.  The track wasn't going to open but in 2017 but a lease deal was worked out to open the track with George Whitney managing the day-to-day of the track. <ref>http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/20170606/speedbowl-agreement-reached-to-lease-reopen-track-for-2017-season</ref>.  Whitney operated the track until September of 2018, when he terminated his lease with Bemer with 4 weeks left in the season <ref>http://racedayct.com/2018/09/racing-to-continue-in-2018-at-speedbowl-george-whitney-out-as-operator/</ref>.  Mike Serluca leased the track for the remainder of the 2018 season.\n\nThe track's main grandstand, dating to 1951, was required to be replaced by the town of Waterford and were dismantled after the 2018 season.   New stands are on site but were not erected in time, and the speedway did not open for competition in 2019.  Mike Serluca remains in place as the track's General Manager, and the track anticipates reopening when construction is complete.\n\n[[File:BrianOuimetteHerocardVPback.jpg|thumb|Brian Ouimette at the Waterford Speedbowl.]]\n\n==In media==\n*New York DJ, producer and radio host [[Funkmaster Flex]] wanted to explore his passion for car racing and developed a unique way to get it done with a new [[Spike TV]] show race event called The Funkmaster Flex Super Series Invitational. The race featured 60 hungry late model stock car drivers from across the country turning laps at the Waterford Speedbowl. Flex went behind the scene to see what it takes to become a winner in racing while bringing out celebrities like [[Orange County Choppers]], who paced the field before the start of the race on their choppers, [[Lil' Kim]] who wove the initial green flag as the honorary starter and [[LL Cool J]], who gave a short performance to the crowd after the event.. You can view the YouTube link of the show's opening sequence here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzhrhu2sNlc Monica Taylor Enterprise - Rare Footage of Super Series]  The event was held on Thursday August 5, 2004.  Among those who were invited to qualify for the event included current [[NASCAR]] [[Whelen Modified Tour]] competitors Ted Christopher, Doug Coby and Woody Pitkat.<ref>http://www.techracing.com/NewsPages/2004/tc7-1.htm</ref>  During the late stages of the race, 6-time Speedbowl Late Model Champion Phil Rondeau was called for spinning race leader Ted Christopher with less than 20 laps to go.  3-time Speedbowl LM Champ Allen Coates inherited the lead and held off Woody Pitkat over the final laps to take the win.  Coates won $10,000 and a vintage 1969 Camaro for his victory.  Pitkat took home $6,000 for second and Rondeau $4,000 for third.  The event was billed as having $100,000 in total purse and awards.  The crowd was estimated at around 8,000 people, making it one of the most attended events in the history of the facility.<ref>http://articles.courant.com/2004-08-06/features/0408060755_1_lil-great-race-orange-county-choppers</ref>  Although there were early discussions for this to be a yearly event, Funkmaster Flex never returned to the Speedbowl to continue the series.\n*In the summer of 2005, [[NESN]] debuted a series called \"Inside Line\" that was a reality based show focusing on local racing in the Northeast.<ref>http://www.persistencemedia.com/news/release-inside-line.php</ref> Ted Christopher, one of the premier Modified drivers and former SK Modified Champion at the Speedbowl was one of the people profiled in an early episode of the short-lived series.  Much of the raceday footage used was shot at the Speedbowl on June 25, 2005, when Christopher competed in both the weekly SK Modified 35 lap event and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour 150 event. His twin brother Mike, engine builder Mike Pettit, and fellow competitors Doug Coby, Chris Pasteryak and the late Jay Miller were some of the people who had appearances in the episode as well.\n*The Speedbowl was highlighted on the [[Discovery Channel]] network's show [[Destroyed in Seconds]].<ref>http://www.livedash.com/transcript/destroyed_in_seconds/6222/DSCP/Thursday_January_21_2010/172502/</ref>  Originally airing on February 16, 2009, a segment of the show was dedicated to a wreck during a Late Model event held a few years earlier on Saturday July 8, 2006.  Jay Lozyniak's #28 car barrell-rolled down the front straightaway during a multi-car wreck in turn 4.  Most of the footage shown was recorded by Jay's mother in the stands while it happened.  Jay, and all other drivers involved that night, were not seriously injured.  The race was red-checkered after only 18 of the 30 laps were completed.  Only five cars were able to continue after the incident.  Glenn Colvin, who was the highest positioned car not involved in the wreck, was declared the winner.<ref>http://www.sids-vault.com/stats.php?a=1&b=6&c=7&d=2</ref>\n*The 2011 film 3 Weeks to Daytona, written & directed by [[Fairfield, CT]] native Bret Stern,<ref>http://www.fairfieldcitizenonline.com/news/article/Racer-s-dreams-fuel-inspiration-for-Fairfielder-s-1323625.php</ref>  was shot in several locations throughout the state, including the Waterford Speedbowl. In an interview with the website [[indieWire]], Stern stated \"I was inspired to make the film after watching cars race at the Speedbowl in Waterford, Connecticut. I'd go Saturday night to see races. Sitting in the stands, watching the guys driving the cars all night, possibly wrecking them, and then scrambling together to get them ready to race the next time.\" <ref>http://www.indiewire.com/article/four_productions_iw_is_rooting_for_3_weeks_to_daytona_adam_west_doc_dissent</ref> The film starred [[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]] as a local short track racer getting a shot to compete in the Daytona 500.
