As a senior, he joined the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and graduated ''cum laude''. While at Amherst, Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor [[Charles Edward Garman]], a [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] mystic, with a [[Neo-Hegelianism|neo-Hegelian]] philosophy.\n\nCoolidge explained Garman's ethics forty years later:\n<blockquote>[T]here is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...{{sfn|White|1938|pp=43\u201344}}</blockquote>\n\nAt his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] to become a lawyer. To avoid the cost of [[law school]], Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond & Field, and [[reading law]] with them. [[John C Hammond|John C.

In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the [[Massachusetts Bar Association|Massachusetts bar]], becoming a [[country lawyer]].{{sfn|Shlaes|2013|pp=66\u201368}} With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=74\u201381|McCoy|1967|2pp=22\u201326}}\n\n===Marriage and family===\n[[File:Grace Coolidge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grace Coolidge]]]]\nIn 1903, Coolidge met [[Grace Coolidge|Grace Anna Goodhue]], a [[University of Vermont]] graduate and teacher at Northampton's [[Clarke School for the Deaf]].

Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing the McNary-Haugen measure as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was defeated.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=327}}\n\nAfter McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge supported a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=327}} In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=388|Ferrell|1998|2p=93}} In his veto message, he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=331}} Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=388|Ferrell|1998|2p=93}} \"Farmers never have made much money,\" said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son. \"I do not believe we can do much about it.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=86}}\n\n===Flood control===\nCoolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=315|Barry|1997|2pp=286\u201387|Greenberg|2006|3pp=132\u201335}} Although he did eventually name Secretary Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that Coolidge overall showed a lack of interest in federal flood control.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=315|Barry|1997|2pp=286\u201387|Greenberg|2006|3pp=132\u201335}} Coolidge did not believe that personally visiting the region after the floods would accomplish anything, and that it would be seen as mere political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require; he believed property owners should bear much of the cost.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=330\u201331}} On the other hand, Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation.{{sfn|Barry|1997|pp=372\u201374}} When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=135}}\n\n===Civil rights===\n[[File:1924 Indian Citizenship Act.jpg|thumb|right|[[Osage Nation|Osage]] men with Coolidge after he signed the bill granting Native Americans U.S. citizenship]]\n\nAccording to one biographer, Coolidge was \"devoid of racial prejudice,\" but rarely took the lead on civil rights.  Coolidge disliked the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and no Klansman is known to have received an appointment from him. In the 1924 presidential election his opponents (Robert La Follette and John Davis), and his running mate Charles Dawes, often attacked the Klan but Coolidge avoided the subject.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|p=209}}\n\nCoolidge spoke in favor of the civil rights of [[African-American]]s, saying in his first [[State of the Union address]] that their rights were \"just as sacred as those of any other citizen\" under the U.S. Constitution and that it was a \"public and a private duty to protect those rights.\"{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=250|McCoy|1967|2pp=328\u201329}}<ref name=\"1923SOTU\">[[s:Calvin Coolidge's First State of the Union Address]]</ref>\n\nCoolidge repeatedly called for laws to make  [[Lynching in the United States|lynching a federal crime]] (it was already a state crime, though not always enforced). Congress refused to pass any such legislation. On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the [[Indian Citizenship Act]], which granted U.S. citizenship to all American Indians living on reservations. (Those off reservations had long been citizens.) {{sfn|Deloria|1992|p=91}} On June 6, 1924, Coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black, non-segregated [[Howard University]], in which he thanked and commended African-Americans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to US society over the years, as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in the World War, all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home.{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nIn a speech in October 1924, Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U.S. society, saying that they have \"contributed much to making our country what it is.\" He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was peculiar for the United States that it was a \"harmonious\" benefit for the country. Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country and urged immigrants to reject \"race hatreds\" and \"prejudices\".{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pp=159\u201356}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Ccoolidge.jpeg|thumb|Official portrait of Calvin Coolidge]]\nCoolidge was neither well versed in nor very interested in world affairs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://millercenter.org/president/coolidge/foreign-affairs|title=Calvin Coolidge: Foreign Affairs {{!}} Miller Center|date=October 4, 2016|work=Miller Center|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> His focus was directed mainly at American business, especially pertaining to trade, and \"Maintaining the Status Quo.\" Although not an isolationist, he was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=342}} While Coolidge believed strongly in a [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] foreign policy, he did believe that [[American exceptionalism|America was exceptional]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=master201019|title=Coolidge against the world: Peace, prosperity, and foreign policy in the 1920s|work=James Madison University|author=Joel Webster|accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCoolidge considered the 1920 Republican victory as a rejection of the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] position that the United States should join the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=184\u201385}} While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate U.S. membership.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=184\u201385}} He spoke in favor of the United States joining the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=360}} In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with [[reservation (law)|reservations]]).{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=363}} The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=114\u201316}} The Senate failed to act and so the United States did not join the World Court.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=114\u201316}}\n\nCoolidge authorized the [[Dawes Plan]], a financial plan by [[Charles Dawes]], to provide Germany partial relief from [[World War I reparations|its reparations obligations]] from [[World War I]].

As a senior, he joined the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and graduated ''cum laude''. While at Amherst, Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor [[Charles Edward Garman]], a [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] mystic, with a [[Neo-Hegelianism|neo-Hegelian]] philosophy.\n\nCoolidge explained Garman's ethics forty years later:\n<blockquote>[T]here is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...{{sfn|White|1938|pp=43\u201344}}</blockquote>\n\nAt his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] to become a lawyer. To avoid the cost of [[law school]], Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond & Field, and [[reading law]] with them. [[John C Hammond|John C.

He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=74\u201381|McCoy|1967|2pp=22\u201326}}\n\n===Marriage and family===\n[[File:Grace Coolidge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grace Coolidge]]]]\nIn 1903, Coolidge met [[Grace Coolidge|Grace Anna Goodhue]], a [[University of Vermont]] graduate and teacher at Northampton's [[Clarke School for the Deaf]].

He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. [[Harry A. Slattery]] reviewed the facts with him, [[Harlan F.

In 1921, when the tax rate on people making over $100,000 a year was 73 percent, the federal government collected a little over $700 million in income taxes, of which 30 percent was paid by those making over $100,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Federal Taxation in the 1920s: A Re-examination|last=Rader|first=Benjamin|publisher=Historian|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=432\u2013433}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to farm subsidies===\n[[File:Coolidge-Dawes.jpg|thumb|upright|Coolidge with his vice president, [[Charles G.

Congress refused to pass any such legislation. On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the [[Indian Citizenship Act]], which granted U.S. citizenship to all American Indians living on reservations. (Those off reservations had long been citizens.) {{sfn|Deloria|1992|p=91}} On June 6, 1924, Coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black, non-segregated [[Howard University]], in which he thanked and commended African-Americans for their rapid advances in education and their contributions to US society over the years, as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in the World War, all while being faced with discrimination and prejudices at home.{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pp=31\u201336}}\n\nIn a speech in October 1924, Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U.S. society, saying that they have \"contributed much to making our country what it is.\" He stated that although the diversity of peoples was a detrimental source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was peculiar for the United States that it was a \"harmonious\" benefit for the country. Coolidge further stated the United States should assist and help immigrants who come to the country and urged immigrants to reject \"race hatreds\" and \"prejudices\".{{sfn|Coolidge|1926|pp=159\u201356}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Ccoolidge.jpeg|thumb|Official portrait of Calvin Coolidge]]\nCoolidge was neither well versed in nor very interested in world affairs.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://millercenter.org/president/coolidge/foreign-affairs|title=Calvin Coolidge: Foreign Affairs {{!}} Miller Center|date=October 4, 2016|work=Miller Center|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> His focus was directed mainly at American business, especially pertaining to trade, and \"Maintaining the Status Quo.\" Although not an isolationist, he was reluctant to enter into foreign alliances.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=342}} While Coolidge believed strongly in a [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] foreign policy, he did believe that [[American exceptionalism|America was exceptional]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=master201019|title=Coolidge against the world: Peace, prosperity, and foreign policy in the 1920s|work=James Madison University|author=Joel Webster|accessdate=February 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCoolidge considered the 1920 Republican victory as a rejection of the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] position that the United States should join the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=184\u201385}} While not completely opposed to the idea, Coolidge believed the League, as then constituted, did not serve American interests, and he did not advocate U.S. membership.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|pp=184\u201385}} He spoke in favor of the United States joining the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=360}} In 1926, the Senate eventually approved joining the Court (with [[reservation (law)|reservations]]).{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=363}} The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but it suggested some modifications of its own.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=114\u201316}} The Senate failed to act and so the United States did not join the World Court.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=114\u201316}}\n\nCoolidge authorized the [[Dawes Plan]], a financial plan by [[Charles Dawes]], to provide Germany partial relief from [[World War I reparations|its reparations obligations]] from [[World War I]].

Legard competed as an [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] in both Summer and Winter disciplines. He was, respectively, a [[modern pentathlon|modern pentathlete]] and a [[Nordic combined]] skier. He also took part in the demonstration of the [[winter pentathlon]] as an Olympic sport. In addition, he took part in the inaugural meeting of the [[Badminton Horse Trials]]. He was a regular officer in the British Army and during the [[Second World War]] he served in the [[Commandos]], where he was the initial Commanding Officer of No.4 Commando.\n\n==Early life==\nLegard was born in 1906 in [[Saltash]] in [[Cornwall]] but spent most of his childhood in [[Sweden]], where he developed his un-English expertise in skiing and other Nordic sports. He came from a junior branch of the long-established family of Yorkshire [[Legard baronets|gentry]]. The family had been loyal servants of the Crown since the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and his father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all officers, either of the British Army - and Britain's [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] - or, since the family lived close to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], the Royal Navy. Legard's father was a [[Royal Navy|naval]] officer.\n\nHe returned to [[England]] to enter the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. On passing out, he joined the elite cavalry regiment which, after a couple of variants of name-style, became known as the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]]. In 1938 the regiment was [[mechanised]] to become an [[armoured warfare|armoured]] regiment.\n\n==Athletic career==\nLegard became the British [[ski-jump]] champion in [[St. Moritz]] in January 1929. Legard became one of the first three British men to achieve a 50 m. jump, together with Guy Nixon and Colin Wyatt.

His event was the [[Nordic combined]], which married a 15 kilometre cross-country ski-race with 2 attempts at the ski-jump. 46 competitors completed the events, including Legard who came 44th. To date, Legard is the only Briton ever to have competed in this event at the Olympics. Legard's Olympic career was interrupted by the war years, which eliminated the Olympiads of 1940 and 1944.

When the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939, Legard's regiment had only just pensioned-off its horses in favour of [[Light Tank Mk VI|Mark VI]] light tanks. The regiment was sent to [[France]] with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]], but in 1940 these light tanks could not match their Panzerwaffe counterparts and the regiment was soon involved in the confused withdrawal that led to [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]].\n\nBack in Britain, the armoured units awaited be re-equipped with more modern and powerful weapons.

His answer was a force of [[Commandos]], volunteers to cross the Channel and harass the enemy garrisons the length of the coastline of occupied Europe. Legard became a member of this force and the Commandos soon developed an [[esprit de corps]] and a methodology and expertise in amphibious warfare. A formal training programme was developed and established at [[Achnacarry Castle|Achnacarry]]. At 34 years of age, he was much older than most of the Commandos, but as an experienced officer, his value lay more as a unit commander than as a leader of the individual assault teams.

Legard competed as an [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] in both Summer and Winter disciplines. He was, respectively, a [[modern pentathlon|modern pentathlete]] and a [[Nordic combined]] skier. He also took part in the demonstration of the [[winter pentathlon]] as an Olympic sport. In addition, he took part in the inaugural meeting of the [[Badminton Horse Trials]]. He was a regular officer in the British Army and during the [[Second World War]] he served in the [[Commandos]], where he was the initial Commanding Officer of No.4 Commando.\n\n==Early life==\nLegard was born in 1906 in [[Saltash]] in [[Cornwall]] but spent most of his childhood in [[Sweden]], where he developed his un-English expertise in skiing and other Nordic sports. He came from a junior branch of the long-established family of Yorkshire [[Legard baronets|gentry]]. The family had been loyal servants of the Crown since the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and his father, grandfather and great-grandfather were all officers, either of the British Army - and Britain's [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] - or, since the family lived close to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], the Royal Navy. Legard's father was a [[Royal Navy|naval]] officer.\n\nHe returned to [[England]] to enter the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. On passing out, he joined the elite cavalry regiment which, after a couple of variants of name-style, became known as the [[5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards]]. In 1938 the regiment was [[mechanised]] to become an [[armoured warfare|armoured]] regiment.\n\n==Athletic career==\nLegard became the British [[ski-jump]] champion in [[St. Moritz]] in January 1929. Legard became one of the first three British men to achieve a 50 m. jump, together with Guy Nixon and Colin Wyatt.

The introduction of foundation trusts represented a change in the [[history of the National Health Service]] and the way in which hospital services are managed and provided. At the time of introduction they were described \"as a sort of halfway house between the public and private sectors\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/nov/13/health.theissuesexplained | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Patrick | last1=Butler | first2=Simon | last2=Parker | title=Q&A: foundation trusts | date=14 November 2002}}</ref> This form of NHS trust is an important part of the [[United Kingdom]] government's programme to create a \"patient-led\" NHS with an [[Quasi-market|internal market]]. The stated purpose is to devolve decision-making from a centralised NHS to local communities in an effort to be more responsive to their needs and wishes.  But after [[Gordon Brown]] prevented plans by [[Alan Milburn]] to make them financially autonomous<ref name=\"Who Runs Britain\"/> they have been much more in the public sector and less autonomous than was originally expected.\n\n==Mutuality==\n\nEach Foundation Trust has a Council of Governors. This is made up of elected Governors and appointed Governors<!-- Needs reference (as with much of this section) -->. Elected Governors are chosen by a secret, postal ballot, of the membership. The elections are usually held in separate constituencies. Typically there is a staff constituency, a patient constituency, and a \"public member\" constituency consisting of members who are neither patients nor staff but live in a defined geographical area. In addition there are appointed Governors, appointed by bodies with whom the trust works in partnership. So, for example, appointments may be made by local Councils, local medical Schools, and local Voluntary organisations. Governors are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\">[http://www.bfwhospitals.nhs.uk/members/ Members Area \u2013 NHS]</ref> The size of the Council of Governors and its exact composition is determined by the constitution of the particular Trust. Each Trust adopts its own constitution subject to certain restrictions in legislation. (For example, a majority of the Council of Governors must be elected Governors and Governors must be unpaid volunteers. They are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\"/> Some trusts are more committed to co-operative principles and have even written the [[Rochdale Principles]] into their constitution and aspire to work closely and in partnership with other mutual as well as local organisations.<ref>South London & Maudsley NHS Trust.

They are authorised and regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]], the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. They include acute trusts, mental health, community and ambulance trusts. A full list of NHS foundation trusts can be found on Monitor's website.<ref name=\"monitor-register\">Monitor: Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts [http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/register.php Public Register of NHS Foundation Trusts]. Accessed 19 May 2008</ref>\nWith the authorisation of North East Ambulance Service in November 2011, the North East became the first region with all trusts having gained foundation trust status.\n\nThe trade body for foundation trusts is [http://www.nhsproviders.org NHS Providers], formerly known as the Foundation Trust Network, which has 95% of all acute, ambulance, community and mental health foundation trusts and trusts in its membership. The chief executive of NHS Providers is Chris Hopson.\n\n== Equivalent Foundation Trusts (eFT) ==\nFormerly referred to as ''Foundation Trust equivalent'' (FTe), this designation applies only to trusts providing high secure psychiatric services. There are three: [[Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust]], [[West London Mental Health NHS Trust]] and [[Mersey Care NHS Trust]]. Nottinghamshire Healthcare gained Foundation Trust standard on 2 November 2010. The other two trusts are in the assessment process.\n\nThese trusts abide by the same Department of Health definition for a Foundation Trust but the Secretary of State (SoS) for Health maintains a direct line of communication and accountability with them because the SoS has the responsibility to provide healthcare to patients who have been detained under the [[Mental Health Act]], and have been judged to pose a grave and immediate danger to the public.\n\nUnlike full Foundation Trusts, Governors have no statutory role. The Board of Directors have no statutory duty towards the governors. The governors cannot, without the Board of Directors' permission, have any control over the direction of the FT. The governors cannot appoint or remove trust auditors. The chair and directors are not appointed by their board of governors. Equivalent Foundation Trust organisations are still regulated by Monitor, and can retain surplus cash and can sell property and retain the cash from the sale.\n\n==Comparison with other NHS trusts==\n<!-- Have Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland introduced equivalents of Foundation Trusts -->\n<!-- How do they differ from Nuffield, BUPA and other private and not-for-profit hospitals?  Similarities? -->\n<!-- How do they differ from other English NHS hospitals? Similarities? -->\n\nFoundation trusts had a cap on the proportion of their income that can come from non-NHS treatments.  It did not only apply to income derived from individual patients, it covered income from all non-NHS sources. This could include joint ventures to develop medical technologies, employers paying for counselling services or income from treating UK military personnel overseas.\n\nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 abolished the private patient income cap but FTs have to do the majority of their work for the NHS. This restriction was kept to reassure those concerned about future developments that FTs would continue to have NHS work as their central concern. Previously each FT had its own cap, set at the level of its private activity when the first FTs were established in 2003/4. About three-quarters of all FTs had a cap of 1.5% or less. Until 2010 all mental health trusts were completely barred from undertaking non NHS work, but after lobbying from the Foundation Trust Network it was raised to 1.5%. These caps disappeared on 1 October 2012.  Collective earnings from private patients increased 14%, from \u00a3346.1 million in 2012\u201313 to \u00a3395.9 million for 2014\u201315. Private earning is concentrated on specialist hospitals in London who see many patients from other countries.  Most Trusts have negligible private income.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS private pay income up 14% in two years|url=http://www.healthinvestor.co.uk/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=4259|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Health Investor|date=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nFoundation Trusts also have different reporting requirements. They produce their accounts under the Foundation Trust Financial Report Manual, which is collated and authorised by Monitor, in liaison with HM Treasury. They also have to produce annual Quality Accounts.\n\n==Achieving Foundation Trust status==\n\nIn order to achieve Foundation Trust status, NHS Trusts have to pass a variety of tests, which have changed over time.  In 2003 only trusts with three stars from the [[Commission for Health Improvement]] were eligible for foundation status. In that year Aintree Hospitals, Essex Rivers Healthcare, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and Walsall Hospitals were all downgraded to two stars and so did not make the first wave of Foundation Trusts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Foundation hopefuls lose out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3068203.stm|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=16 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reservations==\n\nThe public's perception of Foundation Trust status implying a high standard of clinical care was changed by the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]] scandal ([[Stafford Hospital scandal|Stafford Hospital Scandal]]) and the Francis enquiry published in 2013. At the outset some critics claimed that Foundation Trusts go against the spirit of the principles laid out by [[Aneurin Bevan]] (who founded the NHS). Others feared that it would lead to a two-tier system. Others doubted whether the Foundation Trust members would succeed in having any effective influence over hospital management. A study undertaken in 2005 by the [[King's Fund]] of [[Homerton University Hospital|Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]] found some governors disappointed and disillusioned.\n\nAnother report found that it was too easy to invite members to sit on sub-committees, where they quickly became bogged down in the minutiae of operational planning, whilst the main decisions were taken at meetings that they only heard about after they took place.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last =Brettingham  | first = Madeleine| title =Local control over foundation trusts is \"rhetoric\"  | journal =British Medical Journal  | year =2005  | url =http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7505/1408-d  | doi =10.1136/bmj.330.7505.1408-d  | pmc = 558406 | volume =330  | pages =1408 | issue=7505}}</ref> This study was funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].\n\nIn June 2014 Bill Moyes, former Monitor executive chair, urged the NHS to reconsider \"whether the model of foundation trusts is sensible\", arguing \"If one-third of the hospital system is permanently not demonstrating good viability and good governance, is that telling you something about actually how the system should run as opposed to how we thought it should run?\u201d<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Moyes questions whether FT model remains 'sensible'|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/foundation-trusts/bill-moyes-questions-whether-ft-model-remains-sensible/5071945.article#.U8PwnvldUk4|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSome have argued that the success associated with foundation trusts has been due to {{clarify span|other factors|date=January 2017}}.<ref>Goddard, Maria; Verzulli, Rossella; Jacobs, Rowena (July 2011) [http://www.york.ac.uk/media/che/documents/papers/researchpapers/RP64_Foundation_Trusts.pdf Do Hospitals Respond to Greater Autonomy?

A foundation trust finance facility, managed by an advisory committee to the Department of Health, dealing with loans to foundation trusts was established to cover capital developments, but during 2014 applications were made by trusts which had trouble paying utility bills or replacing medical equipment.  Guidance issued in October 2014 said that conditions could be set which could include: reductions in the use of temporary staff, \"use of collaborative procurement routes\" or \"the adoption of a shared services solution\".<ref>{{cite news|title=DH sets new bailout conditions for foundation trusts|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/dh-sets-new-bailout-conditions-for-foundation-trusts/5075976.article#.VGpsPfmsUk4|accessdate=17 November 2014|date=21 October 2014}}</ref> By the end of 2013\u201314 Foundation Trusts collectively had built up cash reserves of \u00a34.3 billion and it was suggested in the NHS [[Five Year Forward View]], that the government would \"support\" foundation trusts to spend this money \"to help local service transformation\".

The introduction of foundation trusts represented a change in the [[history of the National Health Service]] and the way in which hospital services are managed and provided. At the time of introduction they were described \"as a sort of halfway house between the public and private sectors\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2002/nov/13/health.theissuesexplained | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Patrick | last1=Butler | first2=Simon | last2=Parker | title=Q&A: foundation trusts | date=14 November 2002}}</ref> This form of NHS trust is an important part of the [[United Kingdom]] government's programme to create a \"patient-led\" NHS with an [[Quasi-market|internal market]]. The stated purpose is to devolve decision-making from a centralised NHS to local communities in an effort to be more responsive to their needs and wishes.  But after [[Gordon Brown]] prevented plans by [[Alan Milburn]] to make them financially autonomous<ref name=\"Who Runs Britain\"/> they have been much more in the public sector and less autonomous than was originally expected.\n\n==Mutuality==\n\nEach Foundation Trust has a Council of Governors. This is made up of elected Governors and appointed Governors<!-- Needs reference (as with much of this section) -->. Elected Governors are chosen by a secret, postal ballot, of the membership. The elections are usually held in separate constituencies. Typically there is a staff constituency, a patient constituency, and a \"public member\" constituency consisting of members who are neither patients nor staff but live in a defined geographical area. In addition there are appointed Governors, appointed by bodies with whom the trust works in partnership. So, for example, appointments may be made by local Councils, local medical Schools, and local Voluntary organisations. Governors are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\">[http://www.bfwhospitals.nhs.uk/members/ Members Area \u2013 NHS]</ref> The size of the Council of Governors and its exact composition is determined by the constitution of the particular Trust. Each Trust adopts its own constitution subject to certain restrictions in legislation. (For example, a majority of the Council of Governors must be elected Governors and Governors must be unpaid volunteers. They are intended to act as a link between the community and the Board of Directors.<ref name=\"Members Area - NHS\"/> Some trusts are more committed to co-operative principles and have even written the [[Rochdale Principles]] into their constitution and aspire to work closely and in partnership with other mutual as well as local organisations.<ref>South London & Maudsley NHS Trust.

They are authorised and regulated by [[Monitor (NHS)|Monitor]], the independent regulator of NHS foundation trusts. They include acute trusts, mental health, community and ambulance trusts. A full list of NHS foundation trusts can be found on Monitor's website.<ref name=\"monitor-register\">Monitor: Independent Regulator of NHS Foundation Trusts [http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/register.php Public Register of NHS Foundation Trusts]. Accessed 19 May 2008</ref>\nWith the authorisation of North East Ambulance Service in November 2011, the North East became the first region with all trusts having gained foundation trust status.\n\nThe trade body for foundation trusts is [http://www.nhsproviders.org NHS Providers], formerly known as the Foundation Trust Network, which has 95% of all acute, ambulance, community and mental health foundation trusts and trusts in its membership. The chief executive of NHS Providers is Chris Hopson.\n\n== Equivalent Foundation Trusts (eFT) ==\nFormerly referred to as ''Foundation Trust equivalent'' (FTe), this designation applies only to trusts providing high secure psychiatric services. There are three: [[Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust]], [[West London Mental Health NHS Trust]] and [[Mersey Care NHS Trust]]. Nottinghamshire Healthcare gained Foundation Trust standard on 2 November 2010. The other two trusts are in the assessment process.\n\nThese trusts abide by the same Department of Health definition for a Foundation Trust but the Secretary of State (SoS) for Health maintains a direct line of communication and accountability with them because the SoS has the responsibility to provide healthcare to patients who have been detained under the [[Mental Health Act]], and have been judged to pose a grave and immediate danger to the public.\n\nUnlike full Foundation Trusts, Governors have no statutory role. The Board of Directors have no statutory duty towards the governors. The governors cannot, without the Board of Directors' permission, have any control over the direction of the FT. The governors cannot appoint or remove trust auditors. The chair and directors are not appointed by their board of governors. Equivalent Foundation Trust organisations are still regulated by Monitor, and can retain surplus cash and can sell property and retain the cash from the sale.\n\n==Comparison with other NHS trusts==\n<!-- Have Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland introduced equivalents of Foundation Trusts -->\n<!-- How do they differ from Nuffield, BUPA and other private and not-for-profit hospitals?  Similarities? -->\n<!-- How do they differ from other English NHS hospitals? Similarities? -->\n\nFoundation trusts had a cap on the proportion of their income that can come from non-NHS treatments.  It did not only apply to income derived from individual patients, it covered income from all non-NHS sources. This could include joint ventures to develop medical technologies, employers paying for counselling services or income from treating UK military personnel overseas.\n\nThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 abolished the private patient income cap but FTs have to do the majority of their work for the NHS. This restriction was kept to reassure those concerned about future developments that FTs would continue to have NHS work as their central concern. Previously each FT had its own cap, set at the level of its private activity when the first FTs were established in 2003/4. About three-quarters of all FTs had a cap of 1.5% or less. Until 2010 all mental health trusts were completely barred from undertaking non NHS work, but after lobbying from the Foundation Trust Network it was raised to 1.5%. These caps disappeared on 1 October 2012.  Collective earnings from private patients increased 14%, from \u00a3346.1 million in 2012\u201313 to \u00a3395.9 million for 2014\u201315. Private earning is concentrated on specialist hospitals in London who see many patients from other countries.  Most Trusts have negligible private income.<ref>{{cite news|title=NHS private pay income up 14% in two years|url=http://www.healthinvestor.co.uk/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=4259|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Health Investor|date=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nFoundation Trusts also have different reporting requirements. They produce their accounts under the Foundation Trust Financial Report Manual, which is collated and authorised by Monitor, in liaison with HM Treasury. They also have to produce annual Quality Accounts.\n\n==Achieving Foundation Trust Status==\n\nIn order to achieve Foundation Trust Status NHS Trusts have to pass a variety of tests, which have changed over time.  In 2003 only trusts with three stars from the [[Commission for Health Improvement]] were eligible for foundation status. In that year Aintree Hospitals, Essex Rivers Healthcare, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals and Walsall Hospitals were all downgraded to two stars and so did not make the first wave of Foundation Trusts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Foundation hopefuls lose out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3068203.stm|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=16 July 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Reservations==\n\nThe public's perception of Foundation Trust status implying a high standard of clinical care was changed by the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]] scandal ([[Stafford Hospital scandal|Stafford Hospital Scandal]]) and the Francis enquiry published in 2013. At the outset some critics claimed that Foundation Trusts go against the spirit of the principles laid out by [[Aneurin Bevan]] (who founded the NHS). Others feared that it would lead to a two-tier system. Others doubted whether the Foundation Trust members would succeed in having any effective influence over hospital management. A study undertaken in 2005 by the [[King's Fund]] of [[Homerton University Hospital|Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]] found some governors disappointed and disillusioned.\n\nAnother report found that it was too easy to invite members to sit on sub-committees, where they quickly became bogged down in the minutiae of operational planning, whilst the main decisions were taken at meetings that they only heard about after they took place.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last =Brettingham  | first = Madeleine| title =Local control over foundation trusts is \"rhetoric\"  | journal =British Medical Journal  | year =2005  | url =http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7505/1408-d  | doi =10.1136/bmj.330.7505.1408-d  | pmc = 558406 | volume =330  | pages =1408 | issue=7505}}</ref> This study was funded by the [[Nuffield Foundation]].\n\nIn June 2014 Bill Moyes, former Monitor executive chair, urged the NHS to reconsider \"whether the model of foundation trusts is sensible\", arguing \"If one-third of the hospital system is permanently not demonstrating good viability and good governance, is that telling you something about actually how the system should run as opposed to how we thought it should run?\u201d<ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Moyes questions whether FT model remains 'sensible'|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/foundation-trusts/bill-moyes-questions-whether-ft-model-remains-sensible/5071945.article#.U8PwnvldUk4|accessdate=14 July 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=16 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSome have argued that the success associated with foundation trusts has been due to {{clarify span|other factors|date=January 2017}}.<ref>Goddard, Maria; Verzulli, Rossella; Jacobs, Rowena (July 2011) [http://www.york.ac.uk/media/che/documents/papers/researchpapers/RP64_Foundation_Trusts.pdf Do Hospitals Respond to Greater Autonomy?

A foundation trust finance facility, managed by an advisory committee to the Department of Health, dealing with loans to foundation trusts was established to cover capital developments, but during 2014 applications were made by trusts which had trouble paying utility bills or replacing medical equipment.

Garmatz U.S. Courthouse''' is a [[courthouse]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]].\n\n==Building history==\nDuring the 1960s, the federal courts in Baltimore occupied the old U.S. Courthouse and Post Office, now known as Courthouse East, on Calvert Street. The courts rapidly outgrew their facilities, however, and required a larger building to accommodate the growing caseload. In 1970, the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] selected a {{convert|2.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land bounded by West Pratt, West Lombard, and South Hanover streets and Hopkins Place for a new federal courthouse. Congress allocated funding for the proposed building the same year. The courthouse was designed by [[RTKL Associates]] and contains elements of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture, first popularized in 1930s Europe and later adopted for federal buildings in the United States. The International Style does not reference regional architectural trends, so similar buildings can be found throughout the United States.\n\nIn 1972, the building was named to honor [[Edward A. Garmatz]] (1903\u20131986). Garmatz, who was born and died in Baltimore, was a U.S. Representative for Maryland from 1947 to 1973, serving as the chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries for much of his political career. Garmatz was elected during a special vote after [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], resigned his Congressional seat to become mayor of Baltimore.\n\nCompleted in 1976 at a cost of $23 million, the new Edward A. Garmatz Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse had 532,020 gross square feet. The federal courts occupied the building later the same year. On May 1, 1978, a dedication ceremony was held in the plaza adjoining the building. In 2004, in Courtroom 5-D of the building, [[Ed Norris]], former superintendent of the Maryland State Police, pleaded guilty to charges that he made illegal personal expenditures from the Baltimore Police Department's discretionary fund while serving as the department's commissioner.\n\nThe building's tenants include the U.S. District Court, [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], and the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]].\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe construction of this building was part of an early phase of redevelopment for the area west of the [[Inner Harbor]]. Designed by RTKL Associates, a Baltimore-based, multidisciplinary firm of architects, engineers, and planners, the building exhibits characteristics of the International Style of architecture including a simple cubic mass, lack of ornamentation, and horizontal bands of windows. [1,2,3] The designers embraced contemporary trends, materials, and technology to develop an efficient and economical building that eschewed elaborate designs of earlier federal architecture. The nine-story box-like building has an L-shaped footprint with a flat roof. The building is a poured-concrete shell with a strong exterior horizontal emphasis created by alternating concrete strips and bands of fixed windows. The windows are separated by narrow aluminum [[mullion]]s.\n\nInterior spaces evoke the clean, [[Modern architecture|Modern]] exterior of the courthouse. Pale grey [[terrazzo]] floors and white walls are accented with dark grey painted surfaces and aluminum and silvertone metallic details such as handrails and vent grilles. Green marble panels cover elevator lobby walls, and granite tiles in pale and dark tones cover the floor. Gleaming steel elevator doors and surrounds reinforce the Modern interior design features and finishes. [[Courtroom]]s, some of which have been altered to make them appear more [[Classical architecture|Classical]], have dark wood [[wainscoting]] and [[jury box]]es. [[Coffer]]ed ceilings contain both recessed lighting and hemispherical pendant lights. [[Clerestory]] windows with decorative geometric metalwork admit exterior light into some of the courtrooms. A covered patio with brick flooring, planted containers, chairs, and tables provides a transitional space between indoor and outdoor areas.\n\nThe U.S. General Services Administration sought to add local context to the site during renovations completed in 2000. Most notably, O'Doherty Group Landscape Architecture redesigned the formerly stark brick plaza to include engaging design features that provide a human scale. Drawing inspiration from Baltimore's past, the landscape architects chose to celebrate the city's mill history, installing a water feature that invokes [[weir]]s (dams) and [[mill race]]s, culminating in a semi-circular fountain base. Designers introduced terraced grassy lawn panels and indigenous plantings. Tiered stone retaining walls of varying lengths are constructed of reclaimed Belgian block from the city's streets and respond to the natural site topography. Unique pyramidal [[bollard]]s add visual interest to the site while providing security for the building.\n\n''Baltimore Federal'', a large-scale sculpture by noted artist [[George Sugarman]], was originally installed just outside the building's entrance in 1978. The brightly colored organic forms, executed in painted aluminum, create areas for seating and shelter. The sculpture was initially controversial.  [4,5,6,] When the plaza was renovated in 2000, the work was conserved and relocated to its present site at the corner of South Hanover and West Lombard streets. Baltimore-born sculptor [[Reuben Kramer]]'s rugged bronze depiction of [[Thurgood Marshall]], accomplished lawyer, civil rights advocate, and the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, was unveiled in 1980. It is located on the corner of West Pratt Street and Hopkins Place.\n\n==Significant events==\n*1972: Building named to honor [[Edward A.

Garmatz U.S. Courthouse''' is a [[courthouse]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland]].\n\n==Building history==\nDuring the 1960s, the federal courts in Baltimore occupied the old U.S. Courthouse and Post Office, now known as Courthouse East, on Calvert Street. The courts rapidly outgrew their facilities, however, and required a larger building to accommodate the growing caseload. In 1970, the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] selected a {{convert|2.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land bounded by West Pratt, West Lombard, and South Hanover streets and Hopkins Place for a new federal courthouse. Congress allocated funding for the proposed building the same year. The courthouse was designed by [[RTKL Associates]] and contains elements of the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of architecture, first popularized in 1930s Europe and later adopted for federal buildings in the United States. The International Style does not reference regional architectural trends, so similar buildings can be found throughout the United States.\n\nIn 1972, the building was named to honor [[Edward A. Garmatz]] (1903\u20131986). Garmatz, who was born and died in Baltimore, was a U.S. Representative for Maryland from 1947 to 1973, serving as the chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries for much of his political career. Garmatz was elected during a special vote after [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], resigned his Congressional seat to become mayor of Baltimore.\n\nCompleted in 1976 at a cost of $23 million, the new Edward A. Garmatz Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse had 532,020 gross square feet. The federal courts occupied the building later the same year. On May 1, 1978, a dedication ceremony was held in the plaza adjoining the building. In 2004, in Courtroom 5-D of the building, [[Ed Norris]], former superintendent of the Maryland State Police, pleaded guilty to charges that he made illegal personal expenditures from the Baltimore Police Department's discretionary fund while serving as the department's commissioner.\n\nThe building's tenants include the U.S. District Court, [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], and the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]].\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe construction of this building was part of an early phase of redevelopment for the area west of the [[Inner Harbor]]. Designed by RTKL Associates, a Baltimore-based, multidisciplinary firm of architects, engineers, and planners, the building exhibits characteristics of the International Style of architecture including a simple cubic mass, lack of ornamentation, and horizontal bands of windows. [1,2,3] The designers embraced contemporary trends, materials, and technology to develop an efficient and economical building that eschewed elaborate designs of earlier federal architecture. The nine-story box-like building has an L-shaped footprint with a flat roof. The building is a poured-concrete shell with a strong exterior horizontal emphasis created by alternating concrete strips and bands of fixed windows. The windows are separated by narrow aluminum [[mullion]]s.\n\nInterior spaces evoke the clean, [[Modern architecture|Modern]] exterior of the courthouse. Pale grey [[terrazzo]] floors and white walls are accented with dark grey painted surfaces and aluminum and silvertone metallic details such as handrails and vent grilles. Green marble panels cover elevator lobby walls, and granite tiles in pale and dark tones cover the floor. Gleaming steel elevator doors and surrounds reinforce the Modern interior design features and finishes. [[Courtroom]]s, some of which have been altered to make them appear more [[Classical architecture|Classical]], have dark wood [[wainscoting]] and [[jury box]]es. [[Coffer]]ed ceilings contain both recessed lighting and hemispherical pendant lights. [[Clerestory]] windows with decorative geometric metalwork admit exterior light into some of the courtrooms. A covered patio with brick flooring, planted containers, chairs, and tables provides a transitional space between indoor and outdoor areas.\n\nThe U.S. General Services Administration sought to add local context to the site during renovations completed in 2000. Most notably, O'Doherty Group Landscape Architecture redesigned the formerly stark brick plaza to include engaging design features that provide a human scale. Drawing inspiration from Baltimore's past, the landscape architects chose to celebrate the city's mill history, installing a water feature that invokes [[weir]]s (dams) and [[mill race]]s, culminating in a semi-circular fountain base. Designers introduced terraced grassy lawn panels and indigenous plantings. Tiered stone retaining walls of varying lengths are constructed of reclaimed Belgian block from the city's streets and respond to the natural site topography. Unique pyramidal [[bollard]]s add visual interest to the site while providing security for the building.\n\n''Baltimore Federal'', a large-scale sculpture by noted artist [[George Sugarman]], was originally installed just outside the building's entrance in 1978. The brightly colored organic forms, executed in painted aluminum, create areas for seating and shelter. The sculpture was initially controversial.  [4,5,6,] When the plaza was renovated in 2000, the work was conserved and relocated to its present site at the corner of South Hanover and West Lombard streets. Baltimore-born sculptor [[Reuben Kramer]]'s rugged bronze depiction of [[Thurgood Marshall]], accomplished lawyer, civil rights advocate, and the first African-American Supreme Court Justice, was unveiled in 1980. It is located on the corner of West Pratt Street and Hopkins Place.\n\n==Significant events==\n*1972: Building named to honor [[Edward A.

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, will be released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast will premiere on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{main|List of Money Heist episodes}}\n{{:List of Money Heist episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017) ===\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman named \"Tokyo\", as a man named the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police and proposes her a heist of drastic proportions. After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police. With another police assault on the bank incoming, and believing Lisbon to have been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares [[DEFCON 2]] on the police. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap and that \"the war had begun.\"\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<!-- Main and recurring are split and ordered as they appear in the series' credits. -->\n* [[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]] as Silene Oliveira (Tokyo): the narrator; she was a runaway robber until scouted by the Professor to participate in his plan.\n* [[Itziar Itu\u00f1o]] as Raquel Murillo (Lisbon): an inspector of the [[National Police Corps]] who is put in charge of the case until she joins the group in part 3.\n* [[\u00c1lvaro Morte]] as Sergio Marquina (The Professor / Salvador \"Salva\" Mart\u00edn): the mastermind of the heist who assembled the group, and Berlin's brother.\n* [[Paco Tous]] as Agust\u00edn Ramos (Moscow) (part 1\u20132; featured part 3): a former miner turned criminal and Denver's father.\n* [[Pedro Alonso]] as Andr\u00e9s de Fonollosa (Berlin): a terminally ill jewel thief and the Professor's second-in-command and brother.\n* [[Alba Flores]] as \u00c1gata Jim\u00e9nez (Nairobi): an expert in forgery in charge of printing the money for the group.\n* [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]] as An\u00edbal Cort\u00e9s (Rio): a young hacker and Tokyo's boyfriend.\n* [[Jaime Lorente]] as Daniel/Ricardo{{efn|The official website lists Denver's name as Daniel,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.antena3.com/series/casa-de-papel/noticias/conoce-los-verdaderos-nombres-de-la-banda-de-atracadores-de-la-casa-de-papel_201711255a1940100cf2f56e3ec268dd.html |title=Conoce los verdaderos nombres de la banda de atracadores de 'La casa de papel' |language=es |publisher=antena3.com |last=\u00c1lvarez |first=Jennifer |date=25 November 2017 |access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> but in the show he has called himself Ricardo.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Part 2, episode 8 |series=Money Heist |network=Netflix <!--|season= |series-no= |number=--> |time=36:50 |quote= |language=}}</ref>}} Ramos (Denver): Moscow's son who joins him in the heist.\n* [[Esther Acebo]] as M\u00f3nica Gaztambide (Stockholm): one of the hostages who is Arturo Rom\u00e1n's secretary and mistress, carrying his child out of wedlock.

Created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]], the series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. [[Netflix]] acquired the global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, will be released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast will premiere on Netflix the same day, titled ''Money Heist: The Phenomenon''.\n\nThe first two parts revolve around a long-prepared, multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]], in which a group of robbers take hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion. It involves eight robbers, code-named after cities and led by the Professor ([[\u00c1lvaro Morte]]) from an external location. The story is primarily focused on one of the robbers, Tokyo ([[\u00darsula Corber\u00f3]]), as they battle with hostages on the inside and the police on the outside. In the third part, the surviving robbers are forced out of hiding, and with the help of new members, they plan and perform an assault on the [[Bank of Spain]].\n\nThe series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions of part 3 were also filmed in [[Panama]], [[Thailand]] and [[Florence]], Italy. The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations and an unreliable narrator for complexity. The series subverts the heist genre by being told from the perspective of a woman (Tokyo) and having a strong [[Spaniard|Spanish]] identity, where emotional dynamics offset the perfect strategic crime.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"[[Bella ciao]]\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,<ref name=newstatesman_180824 /> with a particular resonance coming from viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{{main|List of Money Heist episodes}}\n{{:List of Money Heist episodes}}\n\n=== Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017) ===\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman named \"Tokyo\", as a man named the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police and proposes her a heist of drastic proportions. After a brief outline of the planned heist, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the [[Royal Mint of Spain]] in [[Madrid]]. The eight robbers are code-named after cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits with a mask of the Spanish painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], the group of robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with \u20ac2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation in an abandoned hunting estate in the [[Province of Toledo|Toledo]] countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and the assault shall be without bloodshed.\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to the pre-defined rules, and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo commentates the events through [[voice-over]]s. While Denver pursues a love affair with the hostage M\u00f3nica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the [[National Police Corps]] negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva\". The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered, until Raquel realises his true identity, but is emotionally unable and unwilling to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape successfully from the Mint with \u20ac984 million printed, but at the cost of the lives of Oslo, Moscow and Berlin. One year after the heist, Raquel decodes postcards left by the Professor for a location in [[Palawan]] in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n=== Season 2: Part 3 (2019) ===\n\nPart 3 begins two to three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when [[Europol]] captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the [[Bank of Spain]] to force Europol to hand over Rio. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including M\u00f3nica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together and enlist three new members: Bogot\u00e1, Palermo and Marseille. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets, while the Professor and Lisbon travel in an [[RV]] and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. A breach in the bank is thwarted, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi gets gravely injured by a police-inflicted [[sniper]] shot in the chest, and Lisbon is caught by the police.
