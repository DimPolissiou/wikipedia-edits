They can show a polished looking surface scarred with glacial striations. Often these striations carved into the bedrock extend for long distances.

The bedrock that we can observe these marks in today must be a hard rock able to be able to preserve these features, which could have formed up to 30,000 years ago. Consequently, rocks that are softer don't preserve the polished appearance or the striation features nearly as well. However, other features can be presented on hard rocks like striations, but are formed differently. A formation known as a slickenside also shows smooth, polished looking surfaces with scars in uniform lines.
