As on all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips ([[embouchure]]) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models ''also'' use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]] and [[superbone]] have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.\n\nThe word \"trombone\" derives from Italian ''tromba'' (trumpet) and ''-one'' (a suffix meaning \"large\"), so the name means \"large trumpet\". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the [[Baritone horn|baritone]], in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the [[cornet]], the [[euphonium]], and the [[French horn]]. The most frequently encountered trombones are the [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]] and [[Types of trombones#Bass trombone|bass trombone]]. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B{{music|flat}}, an octave below the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and an octave above the pedal B{{music|flat}} tuba. The once common E{{music|flat}} [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]] became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B{{music|flat}} [[transposing instrument]], written in treble clef.\n\nA person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. <!--If you are here to change \"trombonist\" to something else, know that it is not at all original, and not all that funny. Don't be that guy.-->\n\n== Construction ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; caption: stuff; margin-right: 0; float: right\"\n|+ <big>Basic trombone anatomy</big>\n| [[File:Trombone-2.svg|120 px]]\n||\n# tuning slide\n# counterweight\n# mouthpiece\n# slide lock ring\n# bell\n# knob/bumper\n# water key/spit valve\n# main slide\n# second slide brace/stay\n# first slide brace/stay\n# bell lock nut\n|}\n\nThe trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube bent into an elongated \"S\" shape. Rather than being completely cylindrical from end to end, the tube is a complex series of tapers with the smallest at the mouthpiece receiver and the largest just before the bell flare. The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the instrument. As with other [[brass instrument]]s, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a [[standing wave]] in the instrument.\n\nThe detachable cup-shaped [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] is similar to that of the [[baritone horn]] and closely related to that of the [[trumpet]]. It has the [[Venturi effect|venturi]]:<ref name=\"Friedman\">{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Jay |title=The German Trombone, by Jay Friedman |url=https://www.jayfriedman.net/articles/the_german_trombone |website=www.jayfriedman.net |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance greatly affecting the tone of the instrument and is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section.  The slide section consists of a [[leadpipe]], the inner and outer slide tubes, and the bracing, or \"stays\". Modern stays are soldered, while [[sackbut]]s (medieval precursors to trombones) were made with loose, unsoldered stays.<ref name=\"Campbell2004\">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Murray |last2=Greated|first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers|first3=Arnold|title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music|url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816504-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona/page/201 201]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fischer1984\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Henry George |title=The Renaissance Sackbut and Its Use Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMVxu1y9O0C&pg=PA15|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=1984|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-412-8|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 'slide', the most distinctive feature of the trombone (cf. [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]), allows the player to extend the length of the air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves known as stockings were developed during the [[Renaissance]]. These \"stockings\" were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a threaded collar to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.\n\nThe adjustment of intonation is most often accomplished with a short tuning slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker Fran\u00e7ois Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs and later in the century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation \"on the fly\" by subtly altering slide [[Position (music)|positions]] when necessary. For example, second position \"A\" is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position \"E\". Many [[types of trombones|types of trombone]] also include one or more [[rotary valves]] used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.\n\nLike the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of unchanging diameter. Tenor trombones typically have a bore of {{convert|0.450|in|mm}} (small bore) to {{convert|0.547|in|mm}} (large or ''orchestral'' bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the gooseneck to the bell, which is typically between {{convert|7|and|8+1/2|in|cm}}. A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.\n\n== History ==\n=== Etymology ===\n\"Trombone\" comes from the Italian word ''tromba'' (trumpet) plus the suffix ''-one'' (big), meaning \"big trumpet\".\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was \"[[sackbut]]\". The word first appears in court records in 1495 as \"''shakbusshe''\" at about the time King Henry VII married a Portuguese princess who brought musicians with her. \"''Shakbusshe''\" is similar to \"''sacabuche''\", attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent \"''saqueboute''\" appears in 1466.<ref name=\"Michault\">{{cite web |last1=Michault |first1=Pierre |title=Le doctrinal du temps pr\u00e9sent , compil\u00e9 par maistre Pierre Michault, secr\u00e9taire du tr\u00e8s puissant duc de Bourgoingne |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k70431s/f17.item |website=gallica.bnf.fr |accessdate=4 December 2018 |page=16 |language=FR}}</ref>\n\nThe German \"''Posaune''\" long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of the Trombone |last=Guion |first=David M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780810874459 |location=Lanham, Maryland|page=22}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nBoth towns and courts sponsored bands of [[shawm]]s and trombone. The most famous and influential served the Duke of Burgundy. The trombone's principal role was the [[Countertenor|contratenor]] part in a dance band.<ref>Herbert (2006), p.&nbsp;59.</ref> The sackbut was used extensively across Europe, from its appearance in the 15th century to a decline in most places by the mid-late 17th century. It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. With trumpeters, trombonists in German city-states were employed as civil officials. As officials, these trombonists were often relegated to standing watch [[tower music|in the city towers]] but would also herald the arrival of important people to the city. This is similar to the role of a military bugler and was used as a sign of wealth and strength in 16th century German cities.\n\nHowever, these trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the [[alta capella]] wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles. These performed in religious settings, such as [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Helen |title=Defining the City 'Trumpeter': German Civic Identity and the Employment of Brass Instruments, c. 1500 |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nComposers who wrote for trombone during this period include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and his uncle [[Andrea Gabrieli]]. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.\n\nWhen the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known as the \"trombone\",<ref name=\"Guion\">{{cite book |last1=Guion |first1=David |title=The Trombone: Its History and Music, 1697\u20131811 |date=1988 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |isbn=2-88124-211-1 |page=3 |quote=Many modern musicians prefer to use the word 'sackbut' when referring to the Baroque trombone.

Italian [[:it:trombone|''trombone'']] and German [[:de:Posaune|''Posaune'']]. The 17th-century trombone was built in slightly smaller dimensions than modern trombones and had a bell that was more conical and less flared.\n\nDuring the later Baroque period, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] used trombones on a few occasions. Bach used it in some of his [[cantata]]s, having written for four trombones (with the rare [[soprano trombone]] playing the [[cantus firmus]], which would normally be played on cornett).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Who says the c.f. was normally played by a cornet?}} Handel used it in the ''Death March'' from ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', ''[[Samson (oratorio)|Samson]]'', and ''[[Israel in Egypt (oratorio)|Israel in Egypt]]''. All were examples of an [[oratorio]] style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional \"Stadtpfeiffer\" or [[alta cappella]] musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Therefore, trombone parts were rather seldom given \"solo\" roles that were not interchangeable with other instruments.\n\n=== Classical period ===\n[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]] ''(1767), but he also used it in operas such as ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]] ''(1779) and ''[[Echo et Narcisse]]''.\n\nThe construction of the trombone changed relatively little between the Baroque and Classical period. The most obvious change was in the bell, slightly more flared.\n\nThe first use of the trombone as an independent instrument in a symphony was in the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1807) by Swedish composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kallai |first1=Avishai |title=Biography of Joachim Nikolas Eggert |url=http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |website=Musicalics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108151031/http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |archivedate=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the composer usually credited with the trombone's introduction into the symphony orchestra was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5 in C minor]] (1808). Beethoven also used trombones in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 in F major (\"Pastoral\")]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 (\"Choral\")]].\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n==== 19th-century orchestras ====\nTrombones were often included in compositions, operas, and symphonies by composers such as [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy|Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Berwald]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner]] among others.\n\nAlthough the trombone trio had been paired with one or two cornets during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, the disappearance of the cornet as a partner and replacement by oboe and clarinet left unchanged the trombone's purpose: to support the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings) where harmonic moving lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. But the introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon an additional tenor trombone replaced alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the [[Second World War]]. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid 19th century.\n\nTrombonists were employed less by cathedrals and court orchestras and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E{{music|flat}} bass trombone remained in military use until around the [[First World War]]. But orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, the most versatile trombone that could play in the ranges of any of the three trombone parts that typically appeared in orchestral scores.{{vague|date=December 2018}}\n\nValve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; although it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the valve trombone remained popular almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and [[Bohemia]]. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] scored for a valve trombone section.\n\n{{listen|type=music|title=Trombone solo|description=from [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Mahler's 3rd Symphony]], 1st movement (composed 1893\u20131896)\n|filename=Gustav Mahler - Trombone Solo from 3rd Symphony, 1st movement.ogg}}\n\nWith the [[ophicleide]] or later, the tuba subjoined to the trombone trio during the 19th century, parts scored for the bass trombone rarely descended as low as parts scored before the addition of either of these new low brass instruments.{{vague|date=December 2018}} Only in the early 20th century did it regain a degree of independence. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner's addition of a contrabass trombone in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and Gustav Mahler's and Richard Strauss' augmentation by adding a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.\n\n==== 19th-century wind bands ====\nTrombones have been a part of the large wind band since its inception as an ensemble during the French Revolution of 1791. During the 19th century wind band traditions were established, including  circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones where the bell section pointed behind the player's left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire, with few original compositions, that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz's 1840 [[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]], which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. The most notable was [[Arthur Pryor]], who played with the [[John Philip Sousa]] band and formed his own.\n\n==== 19th-century pedagogy ====\nIn the Romantic era, [[Leipzig]] became a center of trombone pedagogy. The trombone began to be taught at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Musikhochschule]] founded by [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. The [[Paris Conservatory]] and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, [[Karl Traugott Queisser]], was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers wrote works for Quiesser, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the ''[[Trombone Concertino (David)|Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra]]'', Ernst Sachse and [[Friedrich August Belcke]], whose solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser helped reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany. He championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler's tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.\n\n==== 19th-century construction ====\nSattler had a great influence on trombone design. He introduced a significant widening of the bore (the most important since the Renaissance), the innovations of ''Schlangenverzierungen'' (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare\u2014features still found on German-made trombones that were widely copied during the 19th century.\n\nThe trombone was further improved in the 19th century with the addition of \"stockings\" at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of [[F attachment tenor trombone|a valve]] that, intentionally, only was to be set on or off but later was to become the regular F-valve. Additionally, the valve trombone came around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{listen|type=music|title=\"Miss Trombone\"\n|description=1908 ragtime by [[Henry Fillmore]]; played by The Indestructible Military Band\n|filename=Fillmore, Henry - Miss Trombone (1911).ogg}}\n\n==== 20th-century orchestras ====\nIn the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] the trombone maintained its important place in the orchestra in works by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Leos Janacek]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Ottorino Respighi]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], and [[William Walton]].\n\nWith the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of large bore tenors and B{{music|flat}} basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.\n\n==== 20th-century wind bands ====\nDuring the first half of the century, touring and community concert bands lost their popularity in the United States and were greatly reduced in number. However, with the development of music education in the public school system, high school, and university concert bands and marching bands and became ubiquitous in the US. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==== Use in jazz ====\n{{further|List of jazz trombonists}}\nIn the 1900s the trombone assisted the bass or tuba player's job of outlining chords for the other instruments by playing a bass line for the higher-pitched instruments to improvise over. It was not until the swing era of the mid-1920s that the trombone began to be used as a solo instrument. Examples of early trombone soloists are [[Jack Teagarden]] and [[J.J. Johnson]].<ref name=\"Bernotas\">{{cite web |last1=Bernotas |first1=Bob |title=Trombone |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/trombone-by-bob-bernotas.php#.VERSjPBX-uY |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=4 December 2018 |date=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilken\">{{cite web |last1=Wilken |first1=David |title=The Historical Evolution of the Jazz Trombone: Part One |url=http://trombone.org/articles/library/evojazz1.asp |website=trombone.org |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century construction ====\nChanges in construction have occurred during the 20th century, such as the use of different materials; increases in mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions; and in types of mutes and valves. Despite the universal switch to a larger horn, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the popularity of the F-Attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century, orchestral trombonists used instruments that lacked a trigger because there was no need for one. But as 20th century composers such as Mahler became popular, tenor trombone parts began to extend down into lower ranges that required a trigger. Although some trombonists prefer \"straight\" trombone models without triggers, most have added them for convenience and versatility.\n\n=== Contemporary use ===\nThe trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, or trios, or trombone trios, quartets, or choirs. The size of a trombone choir can vary from five or six to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&B, [[ska]], and New Orleans brass bands.\n\n== Types ==\n{{Main|Types of trombone}}\n[[File:Detall de bucc\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The bell of a [[buccin]] (MDMB 369, 1800\u20131860) in the musical instrument collection of the [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\n\n[[File:Superbone.svg|thumb|250px|Superbone]]\n\nThe most frequently encountered type of trombone today is the tenor, followed by the bass, though as with many other Renaissance instruments the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide that is used to change the pitch. [[Valve trombone]]s use three valves (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a half-step, and the third valve by one and a half steps.\n\nA [[superbone]] uses a full set of valves ''and'' a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves operated by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the ''F attachment'', which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B{{music|flat}} to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A [[buccin]] is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Basic slide positions ===\n[[File:Wirth trombone slide position chart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Slide position chart (new system); most trombones are tenor trombones, like the valveless one in the middle.]]\n\nThe modern system has seven chromatic [[Position (music)#Trombone position|slide positions]] on a tenor trombone in B{{music|b}}.

Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to \"bend\" the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | New system\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old system\n| \u2013 || 1 || \u2013 || 2 || \u2013 || 3 || 4\n|}\n\n=== Partials and intonation ===\n[[File:Trombone first position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone first position harmonic series, \"where additional overtones may be used to stretch the upper range a bit higher.\"<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n[[File:Trombone seventh position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone seventh position harmonic series.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nAs with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]] in the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B{{music|flat}} trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> (one octave higher than the pedal B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>), F<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fifth]] higher than the previous partial), B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fourth]] higher), D<sub>4</sub> (a [[major third]] higher), and F<sub>4</sub> (a [[minor third]] higher).\n\nF<sub>4</sub> marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] scale. A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh.  On the slide trombone, such deviations from [[intonation (music)|intonation]] are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have [[just intonation]] (see [[harmonic seventh]] as well for A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>).\n\nThe next higher partials\u2014B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a [[major second]] higher), C<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher), D<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher)\u2014do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> (a [[minor second]] higher) is almost exactly a [[quarter tone]] higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and F<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed [[Embouchure|facial musculature]] and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] can go even higher to G<sub>5</sub>, A{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>, B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and beyond.\n\n[[File:Trombone F slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone with F attachment slide position second harmonics.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nThe higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above).  A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F<sub>4</sub> (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B{{music|flat}} trombone. The note E<sub>1</sub> (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} B{{music|flat}} tenor trombone, requiring a full {{convert|2.24|m|order=flip}} of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> (the fundamental in first position) and E<sub>2</sub> (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce \"[[Falset (music)|falset]]\" notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.\n\n=== Pedal tones ===\n[[File:Trombone slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone slide position \"pedal tones\".<ref name=\"Orchestration\">{{cite book |last1=Kennan |first1=Kent |last2=Grantham |first2=Donald |title=The Technique of Orchestration |date=2002 |isbn=0-13-040771-2 |pages=148\u2013149}}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[pedal tone]] on B{{music|flat}} is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music while notes below that are called for only rarely as they \"become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality\" with A{{music|flat}} or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B{{music|flat}} on the bass trombone.\n\n=== Glissando === <!--[[False glissando]], etc., redirect directly here.-->\nThe trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true [[glissando]], by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />{{rp|151}}\n\n'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.<ref name=\"Herbert 40\">{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Trevor |title=The Trombone |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10095-7 |page=40}}</ref>\n\n=== Trills ===\n[[Trill (music)|Trills]], though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>5</sub>) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor's [[range (music)|range]].<ref>Herbert (2006), p. 43.</ref> Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nUnlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a [[transposing instrument]]. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a \"[[Crook (music)|crook]]\") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (''e.g.'' Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).<ref name=\"Palm\">{{cite web |last1=Palm |first1=Paul W. |title=Baroque Solo and Homogeneous Ensemble Trombone Repertoire: A Lecture Recital Supporting and Demonstrating Performance at a Pitch Standard Derived from Primary Sources and Extant Instruments |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/listing.aspx?id=4343 |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\nTrombone parts are typically notated in [[bass clef]], though sometimes also written in [[tenor clef]] or [[alto clef]]. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German [[Robert Schumann]] was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.\n\nAn accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B{{music|flat}} as well.\n\n=== Mutes ===\n[[File:Trombone Plunger.jpg|thumb|175px|A plunger in use]]\nA variety of [[Whispa mute|mutes]] can be used with the trombone to alter its [[timbre]]. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect. Mutes used in this way include the \"hat\" (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or [[plunger|toilet plunger]]), a sound featured as the voices of adults in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoons.\n\n== Variations in construction ==\n\n=== Bells ===\nTrombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between {{convert|7|and(-)|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, the most common being sizes from {{convert|7+1/2|to(-)|8+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The smallest sizes are found in small jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common in orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be as large as {{convert|10+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more, though usually either {{convert|9+1/2|or|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bell may be constructed out of two separate brass sheets or out of one single piece of metal and hammered on a mandrel until the part is shaped correctly. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.\n\n=== Valve attachments ===\nMany trombones have valve attachments to aid in increasing the range of the instrument while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. In addition, valve attachments make [[Trill (music)|trills]] much easier. Valve attachments appear on alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass trombones. It is rare on the alto, but when the instrument does have it, the valve attachment changes the key of the instrument from E{{Music|flat}} to B{{Music|flat}}, allowing the alto trombone to play in the tenor trombone range. Tenor trombones commonly have valve attachments, the most common being the [[F attachment|F-attachment]], which changes the pitch of the instrument from B{{Music|flat}} to F, increasing the range of the instrument downward and allowing alternate slide positions for notes in 6th or 7th position.\n\nBass trombones also very commonly have F-attachments, which serve exactly the same function as on the tenor trombone. Some single valve bass trombones have E-attachments instead of F-attachments, or sometimes there is extra tubing on the F-attachment to allow it to be used as an E-attachment if desired. However, many bass trombones have a second valve attachment instead, which increases their range downward even more. The most common second valve attachment is the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment, which changes the instrument's key to D when used in combination with the F-attachment (or D{{Music|flat}} if used with the less common E-attachment). There are other configurations other than the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment however.\n\nThe two valves on a bass trombone can either be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used in combination with the first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other.<ref>[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/faq/faq_text/valves.html Douglas Yeo FAQ: Bass Trombone Valve Systems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Contrabass trombones also can have valve attachments. Contrabass trombones in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D{{Music|flat}} respectively. Contrabass trombones in B{{Music|flat}} on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G{{Music|flat}}.\n\nThe most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the [[rotary valve]]. Some trombones have [[piston valves]] used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the [[Thayer valve]] or axial-flow valve, the [[Hagmann valve]], the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow due to the 90\u00b0 bend in most conventional rotary valve designs. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valve attachments\n|File:Thayer valve.jpg|The Thayer valve is an advanced, conically shaped rotary valve that has become very popular in recent trombone design due to the open air flow it allows. The Thayer valve bends the air flowing through the trombone as little as 25 degrees.\n|File:HagmannValve.jpg|The Hagmann valve is a rotary valve variation that has become popular in recent years. It was invented following the Thayer valve as a response to maintenance issues of the Thayer valve.\n|File:TriggerTrombone.jpg|The standard rotary valve, like the one seen on this tenor trombone, is the most common valve type seen on slide trombones today.\n}}\n\n==== Valves ====\nSome trombones have valves instead of a slide (see [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]). These are usually [[rotary valve]]s, or [[piston valve]]s.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valves\n|File:Valvetrombonephoto.jpg|A valve trombone\n|File:Trombone a six pistons-IMG 0853-black.jpg|A military 6-valve trombone, by Adolphe Sax. Paris, 1866\n}}\n\n==== Tubing ====\nMore often than not, tenor trombones with an [[Types of trombones#F attachment|F attachment]], or trigger, have a larger bore through the attachment than through the 'straight' section (the portion of the trombone through which the air flows when the attachment is not engaged). Typically, for orchestral instruments, the slide bore is {{convert|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} and the attachment tubing bore is {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}}. A wide variety of valve attachments and combinations are available. Valve attachment tubing usually incorporates a small tuning slide so that the attachment tubing can be tuned separately from the rest of the instrument. Most B{{music|flat}}/F tenor and bass trombones include a tuning slide long enough to lower the pitch to E with the valve tubing engaged, enabling the production of B<sub>2</sub>.\n[[File:Yamaha Trombone comparison of open and traditional wrap.jpg|thumb|Open wrap (left) and traditional wrap (right) F attachments]]\nWhereas older instruments fitted with valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (''closed wrap '' or ''traditional wrap''), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (''open wrap''), resulting in a freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks out from behind the bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.\n\n=== Tuning ===\nSome trombones are tuned through a mechanism in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning slide in the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion from the start of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning slide in the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.\n\n=== Slides ===\nCommon and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are {{convert|0.500|,|0.508|,|0.525|and|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a ''dual-bore'' configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are {{convert|0.481|\u2013|0.491|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.500|\u2013|0.508|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.508|\u2013|0.525|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.525|\u2013|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.547|\u2013|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|\u2013|0.578|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones.\n\n=== Mouthpiece ===\n[[File:Schilke 51C4 Trombone Mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|right|A tenor trombone mouthpiece]]\nThe mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player's ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the [[timbre]] of that tone, its [[Loudness|volume]], the instrument's [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] tendencies, the player's subjective level of comfort, and the instrument's playability in a given pitch range.\n\nMouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a [[jazz]] trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.\n\n=== Plastic ===\n[[File:The Trombone Show (color).JPG|thumb|upright|Quartet with plastic trombones]]\nInstruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass.<ref name=\"pBone\">{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Mike|title=pBone plastic trombone|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-instrument-reviews/71-brass/12744-pbone-plastic-trombone|website=Jazzwise Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|date = 2 May 2013|title = Korg UK takes on distribution of Tromba|accessdate = 12 July 2013|website = Musical Instrument Professional|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114137/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|archive-date = 5 May 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\n\n==== Germany and Austria ====\nGerman trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German ''Konzertposaune'' can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least {{convert|12|to(-)|24|in|cm|-1}}. The whole instrument is often made of gold brass, and its sound is usually darker compared with British, French or American designs. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed {{convert|10|in|cm}} in diameter.\n\nValve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B{{Music|flat}} trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German \"Quart-ventil\", built onto a B{{Music|flat}} tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B{{Music|flat}} or F for extended passages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.\n\nAs with other German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long [[water key]]s and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.\n\nSince around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling \"American trombones\" as well. Most trombones played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper.\n\n==== France ====\nFrench trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid\u201320th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around {{convert|0.450|in|mm|abbr=on}}, small bells of not more than {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the [[cornet]] or [[French horn|horn]]. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B{{music|flat}}, altos in D{{music|flat}}, sopranos in F, piccolos in high B{{music|flat}}, basses in G and E{{music|flat}}, contrabasses in B{{music|flat}}.\n\n== Didactics ==\nSeveral makers have begun to market compact B{{music|flat}}/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B{{music|flat}} is ''open'' when the trigger is ''not'' depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (\"Preacher model\") was marketed by [[C.G. Conn]] in the 1920s, also under the [[Wurlitzer]] label. Currently, B{{music|flat}}/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers G\u00fcnter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the [[Yamaha Corporation]].<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090428193549/https://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor</ref>\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nTrombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, [[Boston Musical Instrument Company]], [[E. A. Couturier]], [[King Musical Instruments|H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments]], [[James Warren York|J. W. York]], and [[C.G. Conn]].

As on all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips ([[embouchure]]) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models ''also'' use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]] and [[superbone]] have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.\n\nThe word \"trombone\" derives from Italian ''tromba'' (trumpet) and ''-one'' (a suffix meaning \"large\"), so the name means \"large trumpet\". The trombone has a predominantly cylindrical bore like its valved counterpart, the [[Baritone horn|baritone]], in contrast to its conical valved counterparts: the [[cornet]], the [[euphonium]], and the [[French horn]]. The most frequently encountered trombones are the [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]] and [[Types of trombones#Bass trombone|bass trombone]]. The most common variant, the tenor, is a non-transposing instrument pitched in B{{music|flat}}, an octave below the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and an octave above the pedal B{{music|flat}} tuba. The once common E{{music|flat}} [[Types of trombones#Alto trombone|alto trombone]] became less widely used as improvements in technique extended the upper range of the tenor, but it is now resurging due to its lighter sonority which is appreciated in many classical and early romantic works. Trombone music is usually written in concert pitch in either bass or tenor clef, although exceptions do occur, notably in British brass-band music where the tenor trombone is presented as a B{{music|flat}} [[transposing instrument]], written in treble clef.\n\nA person who plays the trombone is called a trombonist or trombone player. <!--If you are here to change \"trombonist\" to something else, know that it is not at all original, and not all that funny. Don't be that guy.-->\n\n== Construction ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; caption: stuff; margin-right: 0; float: right\"\n|+ <big>Basic trombone anatomy</big>\n| [[File:Trombone-2.svg|120 px]]\n||\n# tuning slide\n# counterweight\n# mouthpiece\n# slide lock ring\n# bell\n# knob/bumper\n# water key/spit valve\n# main slide\n# second slide brace/stay\n# first slide brace/stay\n# bell lock nut\n|}\n\nThe trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube bent into an elongated \"S\" shape. Rather than being completely cylindrical from end to end, the tube is a complex series of tapers with the smallest at the mouthpiece receiver and the largest just before the bell flare. The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the instrument. As with other [[brass instrument]]s, sound is produced by blowing air through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a [[standing wave]] in the instrument.\n\nThe detachable cup-shaped [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] is similar to that of the [[baritone horn]] and closely related to that of the [[trumpet]]. It has the [[Venturi effect|venturi]]:<ref name=\"Friedman\">{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Jay |title=The German Trombone, by Jay Friedman |url=https://www.jayfriedman.net/articles/the_german_trombone |website=www.jayfriedman.net |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref> a small constriction of the air column that adds resistance greatly affecting the tone of the instrument and is inserted into the mouthpiece receiver in the slide section.  The slide section consists of a [[leadpipe]], the inner and outer slide tubes, and the bracing, or \"stays\". Modern stays are soldered, while [[sackbut]]s (medieval precursors to trombones) were made with loose, unsoldered stays.<ref name=\"Campbell2004\">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Murray |last2=Greated|first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers|first3=Arnold|title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music|url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816504-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona/page/201 201]\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Fischer1984\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Henry George |title=The Renaissance Sackbut and Its Use Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMVxu1y9O0C&pg=PA15|accessdate=4 December 2018|year=1984|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-412-8|pages=15\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe 'slide', the most distinctive feature of the trombone (cf. [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]), allows the player to extend the length of the air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves known as stockings were developed during the [[Renaissance]]. These \"stockings\" were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a threaded collar to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.\n\nThe adjustment of intonation is most often accomplished with a short tuning slide between the neckpipe and the bell incorporating the bell bow (U-bend); this device was designed by the French maker Fran\u00e7ois Riedlocker during the early 19th century and applied to French and British designs and later in the century to German and American models, though German trombones were built without tuning slides well into the 20th century. However, trombonists, unlike other instrumentalists, are not subject to the intonation issues resulting from valved or keyed instruments, since they can adjust intonation \"on the fly\" by subtly altering slide [[Position (music)|positions]] when necessary. For example, second position \"A\" is not in exactly the same place on the slide as second position \"E\". Many [[types of trombones|types of trombone]] also include one or more [[rotary valves]] used to increase the length of the instrument (and therefore lower its pitch) by directing the air flow through additional tubing. This allows the instrument to reach notes that are otherwise not possible without the valve as well as play other notes in alternate positions.\n\nLike the trumpet, the trombone is considered a cylindrical bore instrument since it has extensive sections of tubing, principally in the slide section, that are of unchanging diameter. Tenor trombones typically have a bore of {{convert|0.450|in|mm}} (small bore) to {{convert|0.547|in|mm}} (large or ''orchestral'' bore) after the leadpipe and through the slide. The bore expands through the gooseneck to the bell, which is typically between {{convert|7|and|8+1/2|in|cm}}. A number of common variations on trombone construction are noted below.\n\n== History ==\n=== Etymology ===\n\"Trombone\" comes from the Italian word ''tromba'' (trumpet) plus the suffix ''-one'' (big), meaning \"big trumpet\".\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the equivalent English term was \"[[sackbut]]\". The word first appears in court records in 1495 as \"''shakbusshe''\" at about the time King Henry VII married a Portuguese princess who brought musicians with her. \"''Shakbusshe''\" is similar to \"''sacabuche''\", attested in Spain as early as 1478. The French equivalent \"''saqueboute''\" appears in 1466.<ref name=\"Michault\">{{cite web |last1=Michault |first1=Pierre |title=Le doctrinal du temps pr\u00e9sent , compil\u00e9 par maistre Pierre Michault, secr\u00e9taire du tr\u00e8s puissant duc de Bourgoingne |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k70431s/f17.item |website=gallica.bnf.fr |accessdate=4 December 2018 |page=16 |language=FR}}</ref>\n\nThe German \"''Posaune''\" long predates the invention of the slide and could refer to a natural trumpet as late as the early fifteenth century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A History of the Trombone |last=Guion |first=David M. |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780810874459 |location=Lanham, Maryland|page=22}}</ref>\n\n=== Origin ===\nBoth towns and courts sponsored bands of [[shawm]]s and trombone. The most famous and influential served the Duke of Burgundy. The trombone's principal role was the [[Countertenor|contratenor]] part in a dance band.<ref>Herbert (2006), p.&nbsp;59.</ref> The sackbut was used extensively across Europe, from its appearance in the 15th century to a decline in most places by the mid-late 17th century. It was used in outdoor events, in concert, and in liturgical settings. With trumpeters, trombonists in German city-states were employed as civil officials. As officials, these trombonists were often relegated to standing watch [[tower music|in the city towers]] but would also herald the arrival of important people to the city. This is similar to the role of a military bugler and was used as a sign of wealth and strength in 16th century German cities.\n\nHowever, these trombonists were often viewed separately from the more skilled trombonists who played in groups such as the [[alta capella]] wind ensembles and the first orchestral ensembles. These performed in religious settings, such as [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Helen |title=Defining the City 'Trumpeter': German Civic Identity and the Employment of Brass Instruments, c. 1500 |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nComposers who wrote for trombone during this period include [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] and his uncle [[Andrea Gabrieli]]. The trombone doubled voice parts in sacred works, but there are also solo pieces written for trombone in the early 17th century.\n\nWhen the sackbut returned to common use in England in the 18th century, Italian music was so influential that the instrument became known as the \"trombone\",<ref name=\"Guion\">{{cite book |last1=Guion |first1=David |title=The Trombone: Its History and Music, 1697\u20131811 |date=1988 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |isbn=2-88124-211-1 |page=3 |quote=Many modern musicians prefer to use the word 'sackbut' when referring to the Baroque trombone.

Italian [[:it:trombone|''trombone'']] and German [[:de:Posaune|''Posaune'']]. The 17th-century trombone was built in slightly smaller dimensions than modern trombones and had a bell that was more conical and less flared.\n\nDuring the later Baroque period, [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] used trombones on a few occasions. Bach used it in some of his [[cantata]]s, having written for four trombones (with the rare [[soprano trombone]] playing the [[cantus firmus]], which would normally be played on cornett).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Who says the c.f. was normally played by a cornet?}} Handel used it in the ''Death March'' from ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'', ''[[Samson (oratorio)|Samson]]'', and ''[[Israel in Egypt (oratorio)|Israel in Egypt]]''. All were examples of an [[oratorio]] style popular during the early 18th century. Score notations are rare because only a few professional \"Stadtpfeiffer\" or [[alta cappella]] musicians were available. Handel, for instance, had to import trombones to England from a Royal court in Hanover, Germany, to perform one of his larger compositions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Therefore, trombone parts were rather seldom given \"solo\" roles that were not interchangeable with other instruments.\n\n=== Classical period ===\n[[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] was the first major composer to use the trombone in an opera overture, ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]] ''(1767), but he also used it in operas such as ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''[[Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride]] ''(1779) and ''[[Echo et Narcisse]]''.\n\nThe construction of the trombone changed relatively little between the Baroque and Classical period. The most obvious change was in the bell, slightly more flared.\n\nThe first use of the trombone as an independent instrument in a symphony was in the Symphony in E{{music|flat}} (1807) by Swedish composer [[Joachim Nicolas Eggert]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kallai |first1=Avishai |title=Biography of Joachim Nikolas Eggert |url=http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |website=Musicalics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108151031/http://musicalics.com/fr/compositeur/Joachim-Nikolas-Eggert |archivedate=8 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the composer usually credited with the trombone's introduction into the symphony orchestra was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5 in C minor]] (1808). Beethoven also used trombones in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 6 in F major (\"Pastoral\")]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9 (\"Choral\")]].\n\n=== Romantic period ===\n\n==== 19th-century orchestras ====\nTrombones were often included in compositions, operas, and symphonies by composers such as [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy|Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Berwald]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], and [[Richard Wagner]] among others.\n\nAlthough the trombone trio had been paired with one or two cornets during the Renaissance and early Baroque periods, the disappearance of the cornet as a partner and replacement by oboe and clarinet left unchanged the trombone's purpose: to support the alto, tenor, and bass voices of the chorus (usually in ecclesiastical settings) where harmonic moving lines were more difficult to pick out than the melodic soprano line. But the introduction of trombones into the orchestra allied them more closely with trumpets, and soon an additional tenor trombone replaced alto. The Germans and Austrians kept alto trombone somewhat longer than the French, who preferred a section of three tenor trombones until after the [[Second World War]]. In other countries, the trio of two tenor trombones and one bass became standard by about the mid 19th century.\n\nTrombonists were employed less by cathedrals and court orchestras and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E{{music|flat}} bass trombone remained in military use until around the [[First World War]]. But orchestral musicians adopted the tenor trombone, the most versatile trombone that could play in the ranges of any of the three trombone parts that typically appeared in orchestral scores.{{vague|date=December 2018}}\n\nValve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; although it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the valve trombone remained popular almost to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and [[Bohemia]]. Composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, [[Giacomo Puccini]], [[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]], and [[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] scored for a valve trombone section.\n\n{{listen|type=music|title=Trombone solo|description=from [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Mahler's 3rd Symphony]], 1st movement (composed 1893\u20131896)\n|filename=Gustav Mahler - Trombone Solo from 3rd Symphony, 1st movement.ogg}}\n\nWith the [[ophicleide]] or later, the tuba subjoined to the trombone trio during the 19th century, parts scored for the bass trombone rarely descended as low as parts scored before the addition of either of these new low brass instruments.{{vague|date=December 2018}} Only in the early 20th century did it regain a degree of independence. Experiments with the trombone section included Richard Wagner's addition of a contrabass trombone in ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and Gustav Mahler's and Richard Strauss' augmentation by adding a second bass trombone to the usual trio of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone. The majority of orchestral works are still scored for the usual mid- to late-19th-century low brass section of two tenor trombones, one bass trombone, and one tuba.\n\n==== 19th-century wind bands ====\nTrombones have been a part of the large wind band since its inception as an ensemble during the French Revolution of 1791. During the 19th century wind band traditions were established, including  circus bands, military bands, brass bands (primarily in the UK), and town bands (primarily in the US). Some of these, especially military bands in Europe, used rear-facing trombones where the bell section pointed behind the player's left shoulder. These bands played a limited repertoire, with few original compositions, that consisted mainly of orchestral transcriptions, arrangements of popular and patriotic tunes, and feature pieces for soloists (usually cornetists, singers, and violinists). A notable work for wind band is Berlioz's 1840 [[Grande symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale]], which uses a trombone solo for the entire second movement.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, trombone virtuosi began appearing as soloists in American wind bands. The most notable was [[Arthur Pryor]], who played with the [[John Philip Sousa]] band and formed his own.\n\n==== 19th-century pedagogy ====\nIn the Romantic era, [[Leipzig]] became a center of trombone pedagogy. The trombone began to be taught at the [[University of Music and Theatre Leipzig|Musikhochschule]] founded by [[Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy]]. The [[Paris Conservatory]] and its yearly exhibition also contributed to trombone education. At the Leipzig academy, Mendelssohn's bass trombonist, [[Karl Traugott Queisser]], was the first in a long line of distinguished professors of trombone. Several composers wrote works for Quiesser, including [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]] (Mendelssohn's concertmaster) who wrote in 1837 the ''[[Trombone Concertino (David)|Concertino for Trombone and Orchestra]]'', Ernst Sachse and [[Friedrich August Belcke]], whose solo works remain popular in Germany. Queisser helped reestablish the reputation of the trombone in Germany. He championed and popularized Christian Friedrich Sattler's tenorbass trombone during the 1840s, leading to its widespread use in orchestras throughout Germany and Austria.\n\n==== 19th-century construction ====\nSattler had a great influence on trombone design. He introduced a significant widening of the bore (the most important since the Renaissance), the innovations of ''Schlangenverzierungen'' (snake decorations), the bell garland, and the wide bell flare\u2014features still found on German-made trombones that were widely copied during the 19th century.\n\nThe trombone was further improved in the 19th century with the addition of \"stockings\" at the end of the inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of [[F attachment tenor trombone|a valve]] that, intentionally, only was to be set on or off but later was to become the regular F-valve. Additionally, the valve trombone came around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n{{listen|type=music|title=\"Miss Trombone\"\n|description=1908 ragtime by [[Henry Fillmore]]; played by The Indestructible Military Band\n|filename=Fillmore, Henry - Miss Trombone (1911).ogg}}\n\n==== 20th-century orchestras ====\nIn the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] the trombone maintained its important place in the orchestra in works by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Edward Elgar]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Leos Janacek]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud]], [[Carl Nielsen]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Ottorino Respighi]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], and [[William Walton]].\n\nWith the rise of recorded music and music schools, orchestral trombone sections around the world began to have a more consistent idea of a standard trombone sound. British orchestras abandoned the use of small bore tenors and G basses in favor of an American/German approach of large bore tenors and B{{music|flat}} basses in the 1940s. French orchestras did the same in the 1960s.\n\n==== 20th-century wind bands ====\nDuring the first half of the century, touring and community concert bands lost their popularity in the United States and were greatly reduced in number. However, with the development of music education in the public school system, high school, and university concert bands and marching bands and became ubiquitous in the US. A typical concert band trombone section consists of two tenor trombones and one bass trombone, but using multiple players per part is common practice, especially in public-school settings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==== Use in jazz ====\n{{further|List of jazz trombonists}}\nIn the 1900s the trombone assisted the bass or tuba player's job of outlining chords for the other instruments by playing a bass line for the higher-pitched instruments to improvise over. It was not until the swing era of the mid-1920s that the trombone began to be used as a solo instrument. Examples of early trombone soloists are [[Jack Teagarden]] and [[J.J. Johnson]].<ref name=\"Bernotas\">{{cite web |last1=Bernotas |first1=Bob |title=Trombone |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/trombone-by-bob-bernotas.php#.VERSjPBX-uY |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=4 December 2018 |date=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilken\">{{cite web |last1=Wilken |first1=David |title=The Historical Evolution of the Jazz Trombone: Part One |url=http://trombone.org/articles/library/evojazz1.asp |website=trombone.org |accessdate=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th-century construction ====\nChanges in construction have occurred during the 20th century, such as the use of different materials; increases in mouthpiece, bore, and bell dimensions; and in types of mutes and valves. Despite the universal switch to a larger horn, many European trombone makers prefer a slightly smaller bore than their American counterparts.\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the popularity of the F-Attachment trigger. Through the mid-20th century, orchestral trombonists used instruments that lacked a trigger because there was no need for one. But as 20th century composers such as Mahler became popular, tenor trombone parts began to extend down into lower ranges that required a trigger. Although some trombonists prefer \"straight\" trombone models without triggers, most have added them for convenience and versatility.\n\n=== Contemporary use ===\nThe trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass quintets, quartets, or trios, or trombone trios, quartets, or choirs. The size of a trombone choir can vary from five or six to twenty or more members. Trombones are also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&B, [[ska]], and New Orleans brass bands.\n\n== Types ==\n{{Main|Types of trombone}}\n[[File:Detall de bucc\u00e9n.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The bell of a [[buccin]] (MDMB 369, 1800\u20131860) in the musical instrument collection of the [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\n\n[[File:Superbone.svg|thumb|250px|Superbone]]\n\nThe most frequently encountered type of trombone today is the tenor, followed by the bass, though as with many other Renaissance instruments the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide that is used to change the pitch. [[Valve trombone]]s use three valves (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a half-step, and the third valve by one and a half steps.\n\nA [[superbone]] uses a full set of valves ''and'' a slide. These differ from trombones with triggers. Some slide trombones have one or (less frequently) two rotary valves operated by a left-hand thumb trigger. The single rotary valve is part of the ''F attachment'', which adds a length of tubing to lower the instrument's fundamental pitch from B{{music|flat}} to F. Some bass trombones have a second trigger with a different length of tubing. The second trigger facilitates playing the otherwise problematic low B. A [[buccin]] is a trombone with a round, zoomorphic bell section. They were common in 19th-century military bands.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Basic slide positions ===\n[[File:Wirth trombone slide position chart.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Slide position chart (new system); most trombones are tenor trombones, like the valveless one in the middle.]]\n\nThe modern system has seven chromatic [[Position (music)#Trombone position|slide positions]] on a tenor trombone in B{{music|b}}. It was first described by Andre Braun circa 1795.<ref name=\"Weiner\">{{cite journal |last1=Weiner |first1=H. |title=Andr\u00e9 Braun's Gamme et M\u00e9thode pour les Trombonnes: The Earliest Modern Trombone Method Rediscovered |journal=Historic Brass Society Journal |date=1993 |pages=288\u2013308}}</ref>\n\nIn 1811 Joseph Fr\u00f6hlich wrote on the differences between the modern system and an old system where four diatonic slide positions were used and the trombone was usually keyed to A.<ref name=\"Guion 93\">Guion (1988), p. 93.</ref> To compare between the two styles the chart below may be helpful (take note for example, in the old system contemporary 1st-position was considered \"drawn past\" then current 1st).<ref name=\"Guion 93\" /> In the modern system, each successive position outward (approximately {{convert|3+1/4|in|cm|0|disp=sqbr}}) will produce a note which is one [[semitone]] lower when played in the same [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]]. Tightening and loosening the lips will allow the player to \"bend\" the note up or down by a semitone without changing position, so a slightly out-of-position slide may be compensated for by ear.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | New system\n| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Old system\n| \u2013 || 1 || \u2013 || 2 || \u2013 || 3 || 4\n|}\n\n=== Partials and intonation ===\n[[File:Trombone first position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone first position harmonic series, \"where additional overtones may be used to stretch the upper range a bit higher.\"<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n[[File:Trombone seventh position harmonic series.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone seventh position harmonic series.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nAs with all brass instruments, progressive tightening of the lips and increased air pressure allow the player to move to different [[harmonic series (music)#partial|partial]] in the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. In the first position (also called closed position) on a B{{music|flat}} trombone, the notes in the harmonic series begin with B{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> (one octave higher than the pedal B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>), F<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fifth]] higher than the previous partial), B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> (a [[perfect fourth]] higher), D<sub>4</sub> (a [[major third]] higher), and F<sub>4</sub> (a [[minor third]] higher).\n\nF<sub>4</sub> marks the sixth partial, or the fifth overtone. Notes on the next partial, for example A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a minor third higher) in first position, tend to be out of tune in regards to the twelve-tone [[equal temperament]] scale. A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> in particular, which is at the seventh partial (sixth overtone) is nearly always 31 cents, or about one third of a semitone, flat of the minor seventh.  On the slide trombone, such deviations from [[intonation (music)|intonation]] are corrected for by slightly adjusting the slide or by using an alternate position.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Although much of Western music has adopted the even-tempered scale, it has been the practice in Germany and Austria to play these notes in position, where they will have [[just intonation]] (see [[harmonic seventh]] as well for A{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub>).\n\nThe next higher partials\u2014B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> (a [[major second]] higher), C<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher), D<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher)\u2014do not require much adjustment for even-tempered intonation, but E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> (a [[minor second]] higher) is almost exactly a [[quarter tone]] higher than it would be in twelve-tone equal temperament. E{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and F<sub>5</sub> (a major second higher) at the next partial are very high notes; a very skilled player with a highly developed [[Embouchure|facial musculature]] and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] can go even higher to G<sub>5</sub>, A{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>, B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub> and beyond.\n\n[[File:Trombone F slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone with F attachment slide position second harmonics.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />]]\n\nThe higher in the harmonic series any two successive notes are, the closer they tend to be (as evidenced by the progressively smaller intervals noted above).  A byproduct of this is the relatively few motions needed to move between notes in the higher ranges of the trombone. In the lower range, significant movement of the slide is required between positions, which becomes more exaggerated on lower pitched trombones, but for higher notes the player need only use the first four positions of the slide since the partials are closer together, allowing higher notes in alternate positions. As an example, F<sub>4</sub> (at the bottom of the treble clef) may be played in first, fourth or sixth position on a B{{music|flat}} trombone. The note E<sub>1</sub> (or the lowest E on a standard 88-key piano keyboard) is the lowest attainable note on a {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} B{{music|flat}} tenor trombone, requiring a full {{convert|2.24|m|order=flip}} of tubing. On trombones without an F attachment, there is a gap between B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> (the fundamental in first position) and E<sub>2</sub> (the first harmonic in seventh position). Skilled players can produce \"[[Falset (music)|falset]]\" notes between these, but the sound is relatively weak and not usually used in performance. The addition of an F attachment allows for intermediate notes to be played with more clarity.\n\n=== Pedal tones ===\n[[File:Trombone slide position pedal tones.png|thumb|right|250px|Trombone slide position \"pedal tones\".<ref name=\"Orchestration\">{{cite book |last1=Kennan |first1=Kent |last2=Grantham |first2=Donald |title=The Technique of Orchestration |date=2002 |isbn=0-13-040771-2 |pages=148\u2013149}}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[pedal tone]] on B{{music|flat}} is frequently seen in commercial scoring but much less often in symphonic music while notes below that are called for only rarely as they \"become increasingly difficult to produce and insecure in quality\" with A{{music|flat}} or G being the bottom limit for most tenor trombonists.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" /> Some contemporary orchestral writing, movie or video game scoring, trombone ensemble and solo works will call for notes as low as a pedal C, B, or even double pedal B{{music|flat}} on the bass trombone.\n\n=== Glissando === <!--[[False glissando]], etc., redirect directly here.-->\nThe trombone is one of the few wind instruments that can produce a true [[glissando]], by moving the slide without interrupting the airflow or sound production. Every pitch in a glissando must have the same harmonic number, and a tritone is the largest interval that can be performed as a glissando.<ref name=\"Orchestration\" />{{rp|151}}\n\n'Harmonic', 'inverted', 'broken' or 'false' glissandos are those that cross one or more harmonic series, requiring a simulated or faked glissando effect.<ref name=\"Herbert 40\">{{cite book |last1=Herbert |first1=Trevor |title=The Trombone |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0-300-10095-7 |page=40}}</ref>\n\n=== Trills ===\n[[Trill (music)|Trills]], though generally simple with valves, are difficult on the slide trombone. Trills tend to be easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B{{music|b}}<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> is virtually impossible as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B{{music|b}}<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>5</sub>) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave and a half of the tenor's [[range (music)|range]].<ref>Herbert (2006), p. 43.</ref> Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nUnlike most other brass instruments in an orchestral setting, the trombone is not usually considered a [[transposing instrument]]. Prior to the invention of valve systems, most brass instruments were limited to playing one overtone series at a time; altering the pitch of the instrument required manually replacing a section of tubing (called a \"[[Crook (music)|crook]]\") or picking up an instrument of different length. Their parts were transposed according to which crook or length-of-instrument they used at any given time, so that a particular note on the staff always corresponded to a particular partial on the instrument. Trombones, on the other hand, have used slides since their inception. As such, they have always been fully chromatic, so no such tradition took hold, and trombone parts have always been notated at concert pitch (with one exception, discussed below). Also, it was quite common for trombones to double choir parts; reading in concert pitch meant there was no need for dedicated trombone parts. Note that while the fundamental sounding pitch (slide fully retracted) has remained quite consistent, the conceptual pitch of trombones has changed since their origin (''e.g.'' Baroque A tenor = modern B-flat tenor).<ref name=\"Palm\">{{cite web |last1=Palm |first1=Paul W. |title=Baroque Solo and Homogeneous Ensemble Trombone Repertoire: A Lecture Recital Supporting and Demonstrating Performance at a Pitch Standard Derived from Primary Sources and Extant Instruments |url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/listing.aspx?id=4343 |accessdate=1 October 2019 |language=EN}}</ref>\n\nTrombone parts are typically notated in [[bass clef]], though sometimes also written in [[tenor clef]] or [[alto clef]]. The use of alto clef is usually confined to orchestral first trombone parts, with the second trombone part written in tenor clef and the third (bass) part in bass clef. As the alto trombone declined in popularity during the 19th century, this practice was gradually abandoned and first trombone parts came to be notated in the tenor or bass clef. Some Russian and Eastern European composers wrote first and second tenor trombone parts on one alto clef staff (the German [[Robert Schumann]] was the first to do this). Examples of this practice are evident in scores by Igor Stravinsky, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich. Trombone parts in band music are nearly exclusively notated in bass clef. The rare exceptions are in contemporary works intended for high-level wind bands.\n\nAn accomplished performer today is expected to be proficient in reading parts notated in bass clef, tenor clef, alto clef, and (more rarely) treble clef in C, with the British brass-band performer expected to handle treble clef in B{{music|flat}} as well.\n\n=== Mutes ===\n[[File:Trombone Plunger.jpg|thumb|175px|A plunger in use]]\nA variety of [[Whispa mute|mutes]] can be used with the trombone to alter its [[timbre]]. Many are held in place with the use of cork grips, including the straight, cup, harmon and pixie mutes. Some fit over the bell, like the bucket mute. In addition to this, mutes can be held in front of the bell and moved to cover more or less area for a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah-wah]] effect. Mutes used in this way include the \"hat\" (a metal mute shaped like a bowler hat) and plunger (which looks like, and often is, the rubber suction cup from a sink or [[plunger|toilet plunger]]), a sound featured as the voices of adults in the ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoons.\n\n== Variations in construction ==\n\n=== Bells ===\nTrombone bells (and sometimes slides) may be constructed of different brass mixtures. The most common material is yellow brass (70% copper, 30% zinc), but other materials include rose brass (85% copper, 15% zinc) and red brass (90% copper, 10% zinc). Some manufacturers offer interchangeable bells. Tenor trombone bells are usually between {{convert|7|and(-)|9|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, the most common being sizes from {{convert|7+1/2|to(-)|8+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}}. The smallest sizes are found in small jazz trombones and older narrow-bore instruments, while the larger sizes are common in orchestral models. Bass trombone bells can be as large as {{convert|10+1/2|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more, though usually either {{convert|9+1/2|or|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. The bell may be constructed out of two separate brass sheets or out of one single piece of metal and hammered on a mandrel until the part is shaped correctly. The edge of the bell may be finished with or without a piece of bell wire to secure it, which also affects the tone quality; most bells are built with bell wire. Occasionally, trombone bells are made from solid sterling silver.\n\n=== Valve attachments ===\nMany trombones have valve attachments to aid in increasing the range of the instrument while also allowing alternate slide positions for difficult music passages. In addition, valve attachments make [[Trill (music)|trills]] much easier. Valve attachments appear on alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass trombones. It is rare on the alto, but when the instrument does have it, the valve attachment changes the key of the instrument from E{{Music|flat}} to B{{Music|flat}}, allowing the alto trombone to play in the tenor trombone range. Tenor trombones commonly have valve attachments, the most common being the [[F attachment|F-attachment]], which changes the pitch of the instrument from B{{Music|flat}} to F, increasing the range of the instrument downward and allowing alternate slide positions for notes in 6th or 7th position.\n\nBass trombones also very commonly have F-attachments, which serve exactly the same function as on the tenor trombone. Some single valve bass trombones have E-attachments instead of F-attachments, or sometimes there is extra tubing on the F-attachment to allow it to be used as an E-attachment if desired. However, many bass trombones have a second valve attachment instead, which increases their range downward even more. The most common second valve attachment is the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment, which changes the instrument's key to D when used in combination with the F-attachment (or D{{Music|flat}} if used with the less common E-attachment). There are other configurations other than the G{{Music|flat}}-attachment however.\n\nThe two valves on a bass trombone can either be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent valve bass trombones were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used in combination with the first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other.<ref>[http://www.yeodoug.com/resources/faq/faq_text/valves.html Douglas Yeo FAQ: Bass Trombone Valve Systems<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Contrabass trombones also can have valve attachments. Contrabass trombones in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D{{Music|flat}} respectively. Contrabass trombones in B{{Music|flat}} on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G{{Music|flat}}.\n\nThe most common type of valve seen for valve attachments is the [[rotary valve]]. Some trombones have [[piston valves]] used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the [[Thayer valve]] or axial-flow valve, the [[Hagmann valve]], the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow due to the 90\u00b0 bend in most conventional rotary valve designs. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valve attachments\n|File:Thayer valve.jpg|The Thayer valve is an advanced, conically shaped rotary valve that has become very popular in recent trombone design due to the open air flow it allows. The Thayer valve bends the air flowing through the trombone as little as 25 degrees.\n|File:HagmannValve.jpg|The Hagmann valve is a rotary valve variation that has become popular in recent years. It was invented following the Thayer valve as a response to maintenance issues of the Thayer valve.\n|File:TriggerTrombone.jpg|The standard rotary valve, like the one seen on this tenor trombone, is the most common valve type seen on slide trombones today.\n}}\n\n==== Valves ====\nSome trombones have valves instead of a slide (see [[Types of trombones#Valve trombone|valve trombone]]). These are usually [[rotary valve]]s, or [[piston valve]]s.\n{{Gallery\n|title=Valves\n|File:Valvetrombonephoto.jpg|A valve trombone\n|File:Trombone a six pistons-IMG 0853-black.jpg|A military 6-valve trombone, by Adolphe Sax. Paris, 1866\n}}\n\n==== Tubing ====\nMore often than not, tenor trombones with an [[Types of trombones#F attachment|F attachment]], or trigger, have a larger bore through the attachment than through the 'straight' section (the portion of the trombone through which the air flows when the attachment is not engaged). Typically, for orchestral instruments, the slide bore is {{convert|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} and the attachment tubing bore is {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}}. A wide variety of valve attachments and combinations are available. Valve attachment tubing usually incorporates a small tuning slide so that the attachment tubing can be tuned separately from the rest of the instrument. Most B{{music|flat}}/F tenor and bass trombones include a tuning slide long enough to lower the pitch to E with the valve tubing engaged, enabling the production of B<sub>2</sub>.\n[[File:Yamaha Trombone comparison of open and traditional wrap.jpg|thumb|Open wrap (left) and traditional wrap (right) F attachments]]\nWhereas older instruments fitted with valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (''closed wrap '' or ''traditional wrap''), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (''open wrap''), resulting in a freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks out from behind the bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.\n\n=== Tuning ===\nSome trombones are tuned through a mechanism in the slide section rather than via a separate tuning slide in the bell section. This method preserves a smoother expansion from the start of the bell section to the bell flare. The tuning slide in the bell section requires two portions of cylindrical tubing in an otherwise conical part of the instrument, which affects the tone quality. Tuning the trombone enables it to play with other instruments which is essential for the trombone.\n\n=== Slides ===\nCommon and popular bore sizes for trombone slides are {{convert|0.500|,|0.508|,|0.525|and|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones. The slide may also be built with a ''dual-bore'' configuration, in which the bore of the second leg of the slide is slightly larger than the bore of the first leg, producing a stepwise conical effect. The most common dual-bore combinations are {{convert|0.481|\u2013|0.491|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.500|\u2013|0.508|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.508|\u2013|0.525|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.525|\u2013|0.547|in|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|0.547|\u2013|0.562|in|mm|abbr=on}} for tenor trombones, and {{convert|0.562|\u2013|0.578|in|mm|abbr=on}} for bass trombones.\n\n=== Mouthpiece ===\n[[File:Schilke 51C4 Trombone Mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|right|A tenor trombone mouthpiece]]\nThe mouthpiece is a separate part of the trombone and can be interchanged between similarly sized trombones from different manufacturers. Available mouthpieces for trombone (as with all brass instruments) vary in material composition, length, diameter, rim shape, cup depth, throat entrance, venturi aperture, venturi profile, outside design and other factors. Variations in mouthpiece construction affect the individual player's ability to make a lip seal and produce a reliable tone, the [[timbre]] of that tone, its [[Loudness|volume]], the instrument's [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] tendencies, the player's subjective level of comfort, and the instrument's playability in a given pitch range.\n\nMouthpiece selection is a highly personal decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape in order to produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a [[jazz]] trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims, cups, and shanks allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpieces to their preference.\n\n=== Plastic ===\n[[File:The Trombone Show (color).JPG|thumb|upright|Quartet with plastic trombones]]\nInstruments made mostly from plastic, including the pBone and the Tromba plastic trombone, emerged in the 2010s as a cheaper and more robust alternative to brass.<ref name=\"pBone\">{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Mike|title=pBone plastic trombone|url=http://www.jazzwisemagazine.com/pages/jazz-instrument-reviews/71-brass/12744-pbone-plastic-trombone|website=Jazzwise Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2016|date=20 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|date = 2 May 2013|title = Korg UK takes on distribution of Tromba|accessdate = 12 July 2013|website = Musical Instrument Professional|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505114137/http://www.mi-pro.co.uk/news/read/korg-uk-takes-on-distribution-of-tromba/017677|archive-date = 5 May 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Plastic instruments could come in almost any colour but the sound plastic instruments produce is different from that of brass. While originally seen as a gimmick, these plastic models have found increasing popularity of the last decade and are now viewed as practice tools that make for more convenient travel as well as a cheaper option for beginning players not wishing to invest so much money in a trombone right away. Manufacturers now produce large-bore models with triggers as well as smaller alto models.\n\n=== Regional variations ===\n\n==== Germany and Austria ====\nGerman trombones have been built in a wide variety of bore and bell sizes. The traditional German ''Konzertposaune'' can differ substantially from American designs in many aspects. The mouthpiece is typically rather small and is placed into a slide section with a very long leadpipe of at least {{convert|12|to(-)|24|in|cm|-1}}. The whole instrument is often made of gold brass, and its sound is usually darker compared with British, French or American designs. While their bore sizes were considered large in the 19th century, German trombones have altered very little over the last 150 years and are now typically somewhat smaller than their American counterparts. Bell sizes remain very large in all sizes of German trombone and a bass trombone bell may exceed {{convert|10|in|cm}} in diameter.\n\nValve attachments in tenor and bass trombones were first seen in the mid 19th century, originally on the tenor B{{Music|flat}} trombone. Before 1850, bass trombone parts were mostly played on a slightly longer F-bass trombone (a fourth lower). The first valve was simply a fourth-valve, or in German \"Quart-ventil\", built onto a B{{Music|flat}} tenor trombone, to allow playing in low F. This valve was first built without a return spring, and was only intended to set the instrument in B{{Music|flat}} or F for extended passages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Since the mid-20th century, modern instruments use a trigger to engage the valve while playing.\n\nAs with other German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves are used to the exclusion of almost all other types of valve, even in valve trombones. Other features often found on German trombones include long [[water key]]s and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.\n\nSince around 1925, when jazz music became popular, Germany has been selling \"American trombones\" as well. Most trombones played in Germany today, especially by amateurs, are built in the American fashion, as those are much more widely available, and thus far cheaper.\n\n==== France ====\nFrench trombones were built in the very smallest bore sizes up to the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and whilst other sizes were made there, the French usually preferred the tenor trombone to any other size. French music, therefore, usually employed a section of three tenor trombones up to the mid\u201320th century. Tenor trombones produced in France during the 19th and early 20th centuries featured bore sizes of around {{convert|0.450|in|mm|abbr=on}}, small bells of not more than {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, as well as a funnel-shaped mouthpiece slightly larger than that of the [[cornet]] or [[French horn|horn]]. French tenor trombones were built in both C and B{{music|flat}}, altos in D{{music|flat}}, sopranos in F, piccolos in high B{{music|flat}}, basses in G and E{{music|flat}}, contrabasses in B{{music|flat}}.\n\n== Didactics ==\nSeveral makers have begun to market compact B{{music|flat}}/C trombones that are especially well suited for young children learning to play the trombone who cannot reach the outer slide positions of full-length instruments. The fundamental note of the unenhanced length is C, but the short valved attachment that puts the instrument in B{{music|flat}} is ''open'' when the trigger is ''not'' depressed. While such instruments have no seventh slide position, C and B natural may be comfortably accessed on the first and second positions by using the trigger. A similar design (\"Preacher model\") was marketed by [[C.G. Conn]] in the 1920s, also under the [[Wurlitzer]] label. Currently, B{{music|flat}}/C trombones are available from many manufacturers, including German makers G\u00fcnter Frost, Thein and Helmut Voigt, as well as the [[Yamaha Corporation]].<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090428193549/https://www.yamaha.com/yamahavgn/CDA/ContentDetail/ModelSeriesDetail.html?CNTID=2265&CTID=242600 Yamaha Catalog YSL-350C] with ascending Bb/C rotor</ref>\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nTrombones in slide and valve configuration have been made by a vast array of musical instrument manufacturers. For the brass bands of the late 19th and early 20th century, prominent American manufacturers included Graves and Sons, E. G. Wright and Company, [[Boston Musical Instrument Company]], [[E. A. Couturier]], [[King Musical Instruments|H. N. White Company/King Musical Instruments]], [[James Warren York|J. W. York]], and [[C.G. Conn]].

The surname Dean is derived from the same place but a different English dialect transformed it into Dane. The first recorded spelling of this surname came in the 14th century and was rendered as \u201cDanne\u201d. Alternately, Dane could also indicate a Danish person hailing from Denmark (just as Hamlet was referred to as \u201cThe Dane\u201d). The Danes are a North Germanic tribe dating back to ancient time and who began invading and settling in England around the 9th century. In fact, in the early 11th century King Canute ruled both Denmark and England as a single realm for almost 20 years. As a given name, Dane is relatively modern.

''Aladdin'' was also referenced throughout the [[Disney Infinity (series)|''Disney Infinity'' series]] via power discs and in-game toys, with Aladdin and Jasmine being added to the series as playable characters in the series' second game, ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n\n===''Disney's Aladdin'' by Virgin Games===\n{{main|Disney's Aladdin (Virgin Games video game)}}\n''Disney's Aladdin'' was developed for the [[Mega Drive]] by [[Virgin Interactive]]'s studio of Virgin Games USA and published by [[Sega]] in 1993. This was due to the fact that Sega had both obtained a license for publishing video games based on Disney's motion picture and established a collaboration deal with Disney's animation studios which was a first in the video game industry, so Sega of America tasked the Virgin Games USA development team with the programming duties because of their successful previous efforts with [[McDonald's]] ''[[Global Gladiators]]'' and [[7 Up]]'s ''[[Cool Spot]]''. The game has been noted for its use of [[traditional animation]], which was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animators under the supervision of Virgin's animation staff, including animation producer [[Andy Luckey]], technical director Paul Schmiedeke and animation director Mike Dietz, using an in-house \"Digicel\" process to compress the data onto the cartridge. The game also featured arrangements and original compositions composed by Donald S. Griffin.\n\n===''Disney's Aladdin'' by Capcom===\n{{main|Disney's Aladdin (Capcom video game)}}\n{{nihongo|''Disney's Aladdin''|\u30a2\u30e9\u30b8\u30f3|Arajin}} was developed for the Super NES and published by [[Capcom]] separately from Virgin's version, since Capcom still held Disney licensing rights for Nintendo consoles at the time of the film's release. Although the game is still a side-scrolling platformer, it is significantly different in both presentation and gameplay. Similarly following the movie's storyline, players control Aladdin as he jumps on enemies, vaults off stumps and performs various acrobatic feats to get through levels. Throughout the level, Aladdin can collect apples to throw at enemies and golden scarabs which unlock bonus stages. Throughout each level there are various diamonds (collecting all within a level also unlocking bonus stages), with players able to unlock an extra challenge if they collect 70 red diamonds. The game was later ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]] with extra stages, though all the songs based directly on the original movie were replaced with new music, possibly because of copyright reasons. It was also unofficially ported to the NES in 1995 by Hummer Team.\n\n===''Disney's Aladdin'' by SIMS===\n{{main|Disney's Aladdin (1994 video game)}}\n''Disney's Aladdin'' was developed by [[SIMS Co., Ltd.|SIMS]] and published by [[Sega]], and released in 1994 for the [[Game Gear]] worldwide and for the [[Master System]] in Europe. Sega went on to produce this game since they already had the necessary [[intellectual property]] licensing rights in order to publish the [[Virgin Interactive]] game on the Mega Drive/Genesis. The game is also significantly different in gameplay compared to its Mega Drive counterpart. There are three main types of level, chase levels in which Aladdin must outrun enemies while dodging obstacles, exploration levels in which Aladdin must carefully navigate traps and solve puzzles, similar to ''[[Prince of Persia]]'', and carpet levels in which Aladdin rides his flying carpet. It also, unlike its 16-bit counterparts, fairly closely follow the plot of the movie, even including cut scenes containing entire dialogue scenes from the movie.\n\n===''Aladdin the Series: Tower of Gold Adventure''===\n''Aladdin the Series: Tower of Gold Adventure'' is a handheld electronic game that was developed and published by Tiger Electronics in 1994 in the United States.

The game is set after the events of ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', during the [[Aladdin (TV series)|television series]], and before ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''. The legendary city of Agrabah is in trouble again: the evil sorceress [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Nasira|Nasira]] ([[Jodi Benson]]) is out to avenge the death of her brother, the nefarious sorcerer [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] ([[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]]). She begins her vengeful plot by taking over the palace with a spell and kidnapping Princess Jasmine ([[Linda Larkin]]) and the Sultan; she then commands the guard's captain Razoul ([[Jim Cummings]]) to bring Aladdin ([[Scott Weinger]]) to her. The treacherous Nasira believes that if she collects a set of ancient relics that are spread all over Agrabah she might be able to revive Jafar and take over the world, and so she uses her captives to force Aladdin into doing this job for her.\n\n===Critical reception===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n!

This was due to the fact that Sega had both obtained a license for publishing video games based on Disney's motion picture and established a collaboration deal with Disney's animation studios which was a first in the video game industry, so Sega of America tasked the Virgin Games USA development team with the programming duties because of their successful previous efforts with [[McDonald's]] ''[[Global Gladiators]]'' and [[7 Up]]'s ''[[Cool Spot]]''. The game has been noted for its use of [[traditional animation]], which was produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animators under the supervision of Virgin's animation staff, including animation producer [[Andy Luckey]], technical director Paul Schmiedeke and animation director Mike Dietz, using an in-house \"Digicel\" process to compress the data onto the cartridge. The game also featured arrangements and original compositions composed by Donald S. Griffin.\n\n===''Disney's Aladdin'' by Capcom===\n{{main|Disney's Aladdin (Capcom video game)}}\n{{nihongo|''Disney's Aladdin''|\u30a2\u30e9\u30b8\u30f3|Arajin}} was developed for the Super NES and published by [[Capcom]] separately from Virgin's version, since Capcom still held Disney licensing rights for Nintendo consoles at the time of the film's release. Although the game is still a side-scrolling platformer, it is significantly different in both presentation and gameplay. Similarly following the movie's storyline, players control Aladdin as he jumps on enemies, vaults off stumps and performs various acrobatic feats to get through levels. Throughout the level, Aladdin can collect apples to throw at enemies and golden scarabs which unlock bonus stages. Throughout each level there are various diamonds (collecting all within a level also unlocking bonus stages), with players able to unlock an extra challenge if they collect 70 red diamonds. The game was later ported to the [[Game Boy Advance]] with extra stages, though all the songs based directly on the original movie were replaced with new music, possibly because of copyright reasons. It was also unofficially ported to the NES in 1995 by Hummer Team.\n\n===''Disney's Aladdin'' by SIMS===\n{{main|Disney's Aladdin (1994 video game)}}\n''Disney's Aladdin'' was developed by [[SIMS Co., Ltd.|SIMS]] and published by [[Sega]], and released in 1994 for the [[Game Gear]] worldwide and for the [[Master System]] in Europe. Sega went on to produce this game since they already had the necessary [[intellectual property]] licensing rights in order to publish the [[Virgin Interactive]] game on the Mega Drive/Genesis. The game is also significantly different in gameplay compared to its Mega Drive counterpart. There are three main types of level, chase levels in which Aladdin must outrun enemies while dodging obstacles, exploration levels in which Aladdin must carefully navigate traps and solve puzzles, similar to ''[[Prince of Persia]]'', and carpet levels in which Aladdin rides his flying carpet. It also, unlike its 16-bit counterparts, fairly closely follow the plot of the movie, even including cut scenes containing entire dialogue scenes from the movie.\n\n===''Aladdin the Series: Tower of Gold Adventure''===\n''Aladdin the Series: Tower of Gold Adventure'' is a handheld electronic game that was developed and published by Tiger Electronics in 1994 in the United States.

The game is set after the events of ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', during the [[Aladdin (TV series)|television series]], and before ''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]''. The legendary city of Agrabah is in trouble again: the evil sorceress [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Nasira|Nasira]] ([[Jodi Benson]]) is out to avenge the death of her brother, the nefarious sorcerer [[List of Disney's Aladdin characters#Jafar|Jafar]] ([[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]]). She begins her vengeful plot by taking over the palace with a spell and kidnapping Princess Jasmine ([[Linda Larkin]]) and the Sultan; she then commands the guard's captain Razoul ([[Jim Cummings]]) to bring Aladdin ([[Scott Weinger]]) to her. The treacherous Nasira believes that if she collects a set of ancient relics that are spread all over Agrabah she might be able to revive Jafar and take over the world, and so she uses her captives to force Aladdin into doing this job for her.\n\n===Critical reception===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\" \n!

It consists of the festival itself as well as the celebration surrounding [[Emancipation Day]]. PANAFEST primarily takes place in two cities, [[Elmina]] and [[Cape Coast]], which were the largest slave-trading forts in the nation. The festival takes place over eight to nine days and begins with a ceremonial wreath laying. Events during PANAFEST include carnival day, a journey of return from those located in other nations, [[Rita Marley]]'s birthday, an academic lecture on the women and youth, a naming ceremony from people from the diaspora, and finally the \"Reverential Night\".\n\nPANAFEST is a direct manifestation of Ghanaian culture. It is also the appropriation of it and capitalization by the Rawlings administration. Indeed, Rawlings' developed international cultural festivals such as PANAFEST as a source of income for Ghana through the promotion of tourism in Ghana. It proved to be effective.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=The predicament of blackness : postcolonial Ghana and the politics of race|last=Jemima.|first=Pierre|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226923024|oclc=819853928|year = 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism in Ghana: appropriated beginnings ==\nBefore the Rawlings administration, tourism in Ghana was not an effective source of income for the Ghanaian society and was thus a missed opportunity in helping to diversify the Ghanaian economy. The Rawlings administration saw this area of opportunity and capitalized on it, ultimately&nbsp;[[Cultural appropriation|appropriating]]&nbsp;the Ghanaian culture and utilizing it as a source of revenue. Through the restoration of castles that were once used for the slave industry, establishment of public memorials honouring the \"illustrious sons\" of Ghana coupled with encouragement from the government via incentives for private investments, the Rawlings administration was effectively able to push tourism forward with the cost of capitalizing on Ghanaian culture.\n\nThe tourist industry in Ghana is known to promote sustainable tourism that includes: cultural tourism, heritage tourism, recreational tourism, adventure tourism and events tourism. Cultural tourism focuses on festivals and events, whereas heritage tourism focuses on the history of the slave routes. Recreational tourism allows tourists to explore beaches and theme parks. Adventure tourism takes a look at rain forests and game parks, and event tourism focuses on resources and conferences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-ghana-harlem-man-stuck-overseas-20200417-qa5pxcbsszgvdd6gaxe5lwomqa-story.html|title=Harlem man stuck in Ghana for weeks due to coronavirus travel restrictions says he\u2019s fine staying put|last=Greene|first=Leonard|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2020/apr/02/traveling-time-coronavirus/|title=Traveling in the time of coronavirus|website=amsterdamnews.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nMany of the heritage tourism sites highlight the legacy of the African Diaspora and the social composition of communities.

Though an uncomfortable mode of transportation due to it being usually packed with passengers, it is still a viable option and the cost is fairly low.\n\nIn Ghana, there are also \"'''hurry cars'''\";<ref name=\":0\" /> these are private cars that have set destinations and wait for passengers that are going to the set destination of the hurry car. They are typically found by transport  stations and is definitely a more comfortable method of travel as opposed to a Tro Tro. The drivers of hurry cars will usually hold signs or give some type of information letting passengers know the destination they are set to go.\n\nAnother unique method of transportation is a '''[[Share taxi|shared taxi]]''',<ref name=\":0\" /> which is the same concept as a hurry car except that fares are set by the government and is shared amongst the passengers; due to that fact, if not enough passengers board the taxi at once, the driver may insist on waiting to ensure the car is full of enough passengers headed to the pre-specified destination.\n\n<ref name=\":0\" /> Other methods of transportation in Ghana include:\n* Taxi\n* Ferry\n* Train\n* Bus\n\n==Major tourist sites==\n[[File:Ghana Tourism sites (collage).JPG|336px|right|thumb|<center>[[Tourism]] destinations in Ghana.<ref name=\"uniquetrustex.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.uniquetrustex.com/node/162/177/?ex=trade-expo-international-ghana&nid=162 |title=Trade Expo International |work=UniqueTtrustex |accessdate=3 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501221713/http://www.uniquetrustex.com/node/162/177/?ex=trade-expo-international-ghana&nid=162 |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></center>]][[Aburi Botanical Gardens]] \n\n* [[Kakum National Park]] \u2013 National Park\n* [[Mole National Park]] \u2013 National Park\n* [[Ankasa Conservation Area|Ankasa National park]] \u2013 National Park\n* [[Cape Coast Castle]] \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Site\n* [[Elmina Castle]] \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Site\n* [[Nzulezo]] \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\n===Gallery===\n{{Gallery\n|title= Tourism sites in Ghana\n|width=155 | height=200 | lines=3\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:Kakum Canopy.jpg\n|alt1=\n|[[Kakum National Park]] \u2013 National Park.\n|File:Ghanaian wildlife.JPG\n|alt2=\n|Mole National Park \u2013 National Park.\n|File:Mole National Park Tourism.jpg\n|alt3=\n|Mole National Park Tourism in Ghana.\n|File:Ghanaian Wildlife.JPG\n|alt4=\n|Tourist taking photo of [[Elephant]]s with [[iPad]] at [[Mole National Park]] in Ghana.\n|File:Barack Obama in Cape Coast Castle.jpg\n|alt5=\n|[[Cape Coast Castle]] \u2013 [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.\n|File:St. George Castle, Elmina, Ghana.JPG\n|alt6=\n|[[Elmina Castle]] \u2013 [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.\n|File:Nzulezo.jpg\n|alt7=\n|[[Nzulezo]] \u2013 [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.\n|File:Boti falls, Ghana.jpg\n|alt8=\n|Boti [[Waterfall]]s.\n|File:Wli Lower Fall-4.jpg\n|alt9=\n|[[Wli Waterfalls]].\n|File:Kintampo Waterfalls.JPG\n|alt10=\n|[[Kintampo waterfalls|Kintampo Waterfalls]].\n|File:Tagbo Falls Ghana.jpg\n|alt11=\n|[[Tagbo Falls]].\n|File:Umbrella rock, Koforidua, Ghana.jpg\n|alt12=\n|[[Umbrella Rock]].\n|File:Tropical Luxury Resort, Coast of Ghana.jpg\n|alt13=\n|[[Tropical climate|Tropical climatic]] [[Lagoon]]s and [[Vacation]] [[Holiday resort|Holiday Resort]]s in [[Dodi Island]] on the [[Volta Lake]].\n|File:Fort Amsterdam Front view.jpg\n|alt14=\n| [[Fort Amsterdam, Ghana|Fort Amsterdam]].\n|File:Gro\u00df Friedrichsburg.JPG\n|alt15=\n|[[Brandenburger Gold Coast|Fort Groot Fredericksburg]].\n|File:Overzicht bovenop bastion rechts voor met zicht op beide hoger gelegen bouwdelen - Axim - 20374980 - RCE.jpg\n|alt16=\n|[[Fort Santo Antonio]].\n|File:Fort Metal Cross.jpg\n|alt17=\n|[[Fort Metal Cross]].\n|File:Museum Ground floor from 1st floor.jpg\n|alt18=\n| [[National Museum of Ghana|National Museum]].|Aburi Botanical Gardens=}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Visa policy of Ghana]]\n* [[Ghana\u2019s material cultural heritage]]\n* [[Ministry of Tourism (Ghana)]]\n* [[Transport in Ghana]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline|Ghana}}\n* [http://www.touringghana.com/ Official Website]\n* K.

Belda. 2004. {{rp|24}}</ref>\n\n== Heritage tourism ==\nHeritage tourism in Ghana is led by a festival called the Pan-African Historical Festival or [[PANAFEST]].<ref>[https://www.panafestghana.org/index.php Panafest website.]</ref> The festival is a cultural event with the intention of increasing the notion of Pan-Africanism and African development. It consists of the festival itself as well as the celebration surrounding [[Emancipation Day]]. PANAFEST primarily takes place in two cities, [[Elmina]] and [[Cape Coast]], which were the largest slave-trading forts in the nation. The festival takes place over eight to nine days and begins with a ceremonial wreath laying. Events during PANAFEST include carnival day, a journey of return from those located in other nations, [[Rita Marley]]'s birthday, an academic lecture on the women and youth, a naming ceremony from people from the diaspora, and finally the \"Reverential Night\".\n\nPANAFEST is a direct manifestation of Ghanaian culture. It is also the appropriation of it and capitalization by the Rawlings administration. Indeed, Rawlings' developed international cultural festivals such as PANAFEST as a source of income for Ghana through the promotion of tourism in Ghana. It proved to be effective.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=The predicament of blackness : postcolonial Ghana and the politics of race|last=Jemima.|first=Pierre|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226923024|oclc=819853928|year = 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism in Ghana: appropriated beginnings ==\nBefore the Rawlings administration, tourism in Ghana was not an effective source of income for the Ghanaian society and was thus a missed opportunity in helping to diversify the Ghanaian economy. The Rawlings administration saw this area of opportunity and capitalized on it, ultimately&nbsp;[[Cultural appropriation|appropriating]]&nbsp;the Ghanaian culture and utilizing it as a source of revenue. Through the restoration of castles that were once used for the slave industry, establishment of public memorials honouring the \"illustrious sons\" of Ghana coupled with encouragement from the government via incentives for private investments, the Rawlings administration was effectively able to push tourism forward with the cost of capitalizing on Ghanaian culture.\n\nThe tourist industry in Ghana is known to promote sustainable tourism that includes: cultural tourism, heritage tourism, recreational tourism, adventure tourism and events tourism. Cultural tourism focuses on festivals and events, whereas heritage tourism focuses on the history of the slave routes. Recreational tourism allows tourists to explore beaches and theme parks. Adventure tourism takes a look at rain forests and game parks, and event tourism focuses on resources and conferences.\n\nMany of the heritage tourism sites highlight the legacy of the African Diaspora and the social composition of communities. As a result, these studies have impacted the tourists' connection to the heritage tourism sites by providing cultural depth to their travelling experience.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yankholmes, A., & McKercher, B.|year=2015|title=Understanding visitors to slavery heritage sites in Ghan.|url=|journal=Tourism Management|volume=51|pages=22\u201332|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2015.04.003}}</ref>\n\n== Currency in Ghana and exchange rates ==\nIn Ghana, the economic system is based on the Ghanaian [[Ghanaian cedi|Cedi]] (currency symbol GH\u00a2) and the [[Ghanaian cedi|pesewa]] (currency symbol Gp).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xe.com/currency/ghs-ghanaian-cedi|title=GHS - Ghanian Cedi rates, news, and tools|last=|first=|date=|website=XE|access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> Pesewas are the basic units of Ghanaian currency and cedis are the second tier in their economic system; in other words, pesewas are comparable to the United States' penny and the cedi is comparable to a United States dollar.

Some of them may be safer than others but are not always available. Here we will explain methods of transportation that are unique to Ghana and other developing countries:\n\nThe [[Tro tro|'''Tro Tro''']]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://easytrackghana.com/travel-information-ghana_local-transportation.php|title=Local Transportation Ghana|date=25 February 2017|website=Easy Track Ghana|access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> is one method of transportation that usually utilizes a minivan and are used to travel anywhere throughout Ghana. Though an uncomfortable mode of transportation due to it being usually packed with passengers, it is still a viable option and the cost is fairly low.\n\nIn Ghana, there are also \"'''hurry cars'''\";<ref name=\":0\" /> these are private cars that have set destinations and wait for passengers that are going to the set destination of the hurry car. They are typically found by transport  stations and is definitely a more comfortable method of travel as opposed to a Tro Tro. The drivers of hurry cars will usually hold signs or give some type of information letting passengers know the destination they are set to go.\n\nAnother unique method of transportation is a '''[[Share taxi|shared taxi]]''',<ref name=\":0\" /> which is the same concept as a hurry car except that fares are set by the government and is shared amongst the passengers; due to that fact, if not enough passengers board the taxi at once, the driver may insist on waiting to ensure the car is full of enough passengers headed to the pre-specified destination.\n\n<ref name=\":0\" /> Other methods of transportation in Ghana include:\n* Taxi\n* Ferry\n* Train\n* Bus\n\n==Major tourist sites==\n[[File:Ghana Tourism sites (collage).JPG|336px|right|thumb|<center>[[Tourism]] destinations in Ghana.<ref name=\"uniquetrustex.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.uniquetrustex.com/node/162/177/?ex=trade-expo-international-ghana&nid=162 |title=Trade Expo International |work=UniqueTtrustex |accessdate=3 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501221713/http://www.uniquetrustex.com/node/162/177/?ex=trade-expo-international-ghana&nid=162 |archivedate=1 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></center>]][[Aburi Botanical Gardens]] \n\n* [[Kakum National Park]] \u2013 National Park\n* [[Mole National Park]] \u2013 National Park\n* [[Ankasa Conservation Area|Ankasa National park]] \u2013 National Park\n* [[Cape Coast Castle]] \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Site\n* [[Elmina Castle]] \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Site\n* [[Nzulezo]] \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\n===Gallery===\n{{Gallery\n|title= Tourism sites in Ghana\n|width=155 | height=200 | lines=3\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:Kakum Canopy.jpg\n|alt1=\n|[[Kakum National Park]] \u2013 National Park.\n|File:Ghanaian wildlife.JPG\n|alt2=\n|Mole National Park \u2013 National Park.\n|File:Mole National Park Tourism.jpg\n|alt3=\n|Mole National Park Tourism in Ghana.\n|File:Ghanaian Wildlife.JPG\n|alt4=\n|Tourist taking photo of [[Elephant]]s with [[iPad]] at [[Mole National Park]] in Ghana.\n|File:Barack Obama in Cape Coast Castle.jpg\n|alt5=\n|[[Cape Coast Castle]] \u2013 [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.\n|File:St. George Castle, Elmina, Ghana.JPG\n|alt6=\n|[[Elmina Castle]] \u2013 [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.\n|File:Nzulezo.jpg\n|alt7=\n|[[Nzulezo]] \u2013 [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site.\n|File:Boti falls, Ghana.jpg\n|alt8=\n|Boti [[Waterfall]]s.\n|File:Wli Lower Fall-4.jpg\n|alt9=\n|[[Wli Waterfalls]].\n|File:Kintampo Waterfalls.JPG\n|alt10=\n|[[Kintampo waterfalls|Kintampo Waterfalls]].\n|File:Tagbo Falls Ghana.jpg\n|alt11=\n|[[Tagbo Falls]].\n|File:Umbrella rock, Koforidua, Ghana.jpg\n|alt12=\n|[[Umbrella Rock]].\n|File:Tropical Luxury Resort, Coast of Ghana.jpg\n|alt13=\n|[[Tropical climate|Tropical climatic]] [[Lagoon]]s and [[Vacation]] [[Holiday resort|Holiday Resort]]s in [[Dodi Island]] on the [[Volta Lake]].\n|File:Fort Amsterdam Front view.jpg\n|alt14=\n| [[Fort Amsterdam, Ghana|Fort Amsterdam]].\n|File:Gro\u00df Friedrichsburg.JPG\n|alt15=\n|[[Brandenburger Gold Coast|Fort Groot Fredericksburg]].\n|File:Overzicht bovenop bastion rechts voor met zicht op beide hoger gelegen bouwdelen - Axim - 20374980 - RCE.jpg\n|alt16=\n|[[Fort Santo Antonio]].\n|File:Fort Metal Cross.jpg\n|alt17=\n|[[Fort Metal Cross]].\n|File:Museum Ground floor from 1st floor.jpg\n|alt18=\n| [[National Museum of Ghana|National Museum]].|Aburi Botanical Gardens=}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Visa policy of Ghana]]\n* [[Ghana\u2019s material cultural heritage]]\n* [[Ministry of Tourism (Ghana)]]\n* [[Transport in Ghana]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline|Ghana}}\n* [http://www.touringghana.com/ Official Website]\n* K.

He gives her his number so she can contact him any time she needs to get away from [[Walford]], before taking her home. They stay in contact and Rob is seen showing a friend a photo of Whitney. When Whitney either rejects or is rejected by all her friends and family, she contacts Rob and he takes her to stay with him. After Whitney has been missing for several days, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) tries to phone her, leaving several messages. When she finally gets a voicemail back, it is from Rob saying if she calls again, there will be trouble.\n\nLauren tracks Whitney down to [[Dartford]], but Whitney insists she is fine with Rob, and that they are in love. Rob meets Lauren at their bedsit and invites her out with them, but Lauren leaves. Rob then leaves Whitney alone with [[#Chris|Chris]] (Richard Simons) and it is revealed that Rob is using Whitney to pay off his debts. Rob meets Lauren in a caf\u00e9 and again invites her out and calls her beautiful. He then threatens her, saying he does not want to see her again. When Rob returns to the bedsit, Whitney is there with [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), who says she is taking Whitney home. Whitney refuses to go and Rob ejects Janine from the building. Rob then tells Whitney they are going out immediately, and drags her to the car as she refuses to go. Lauren and Janine watch as Rob drives away with Whitney. Rob takes Whitney to a house where she meets [[#Chloe|Chloe]] ([[Georgia Henshaw]]), another girl being exploited. Whitney realises she is there to have sex with men, so asks Rob if she can leave. Rob says to either be nice to his friends or he will hurt her. He grabs her and locks her in a room. She is unable to open the windows so when she hears people outside the door, she smashes a window, jumps to the ground and runs away with Rob calling after her. She then stops a car and asks for help. She later returns to Walford after being arrested for shoplifting. Her half brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) learns of what happened and wants to find Rob but Whitney says he has moved.\n\nWhen Whitney starts a relationship with a man named [[#Lee|Lee]] (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. Whitney goes to meet Lee and is shocked to see Rob instead. She is taken in by his charm until she texts Lee not to come, and then sees the message on Rob's phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to [[Southend-on-Sea]] with friends. She leaves Rob a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall over the edge of the pier. A body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob's.\n\n===Development===\nIn January 2011, it was announced that Whitney would be part of the sexual exploitation storyline. She is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for Rob, who then exploits her. ''EastEnders'' worked alongside charity [[Comic Relief]] on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during [[Red Nose Day 2011]] on 18 March 2011, in a special 10-minute episode.<ref name=\"Sex exploitation plot\"/> Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: \"It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with ''EastEnders'' will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the ''EastEnders'' script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation.\"<ref name=\"Humphreys\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/01/comicrelief.shtml|title=EastEnders working with Comic Relief|last=Humphreys|first=Matt|date=9 January 2011|work=EastEnders|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added \"We have worked over many years with ''EastEnders'' in all kinds of ways.

The BBC issued a statement, saying:\n\n{{blockquote|The ''EastEnders'' audience would have been aware of the dark situation Whitney was getting into. In the preceding episodes viewers saw Whitney feeling increasingly unwanted and unloved, with her brother and her step-mother absent, her life was taking a downward spiral. [...] It was a natural progression of Whitney's story thus far and we felt it was an important story to tell, and hopefully to raise awareness of amongst our audience. In doing so, we believe it was right to show the\u2014albeit unpleasant\u2014reality of the situation faced by these girls, rather than put a gloss on it. In the episode Whitney is seen to escape and to raise the alarm\u2014we did not leave the audience on a cliffhanger. The menace and danger Whitney is in whilst clear is implied rather than graphic or sensationalised and is in keeping with the audience expectations of how ''EastEnders'' would tackle a tough story in a pre-watershed manner and indeed how Whitney's story has evolved over the last few years. We are conscious that Red Nose Day programming includes many different tones and themes, ranging from light comedy sketches to difficult and emotional appeal films, all of which played out around the time the ''EastEnders'' episode was scheduled to transmit. We hope that the majority of the audience would have heard the first extended warning and that the serious tone of the introduction, though truncated, pointed to the fact that the upcoming film was a gear change. It was further put into context by the presenters at the end of the piece, when they talked about the Comic Relief-funded charities working to help girls like Whitney.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a310633/bbc-defends-enders-comic-relief-episode.html|title=BBC defends 'Enders Comic Relief episode|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=23 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 March 2011|location=London}}</ref>}}\n\nSpeaking about how members of the public reacted to the storyline, Latham told ''[[OK!]]'', \"Considering Rob makes [[Phil Mitchell]] look like a field mouse, I've got to be quite grateful. I've not had a tin of baked beans chucked at me in Asda by some nice old lady. It's just a bit of banter off the public, which I relish.

Kat shouts at Shenice to take the clothes off, and Shenice flinches thinking Kat is going to hit her. The next day, Shenice is caught trying to steal cigarettes from the local shop, which Kat chastises a drunken Martina for. Martina calls her daughter useless before going to bed, and Shenice tells Kat and Alfie that Martina says things she does not mean when she is drunk. The next day, Martina tells Kat that she is back with her boyfriend and she will get some money so she and Shenice can move out. Kat and Alfie organise a birthday party for Shenice as Martina has forgotten and Shenice takes a disliking to [[Tiffany Butcher]] ([[Maisie Smith]]) as they are wearing the same outfit. Shenice has to leave halfway through the party as Martina finds a place to live, and they move out, leaving Kat and Alfie distraught.\n\nKat and Alfie holiday in Spain and return with Shenice. Shenice and Tiffany become friends again but Shenice grows bored as Kat cannot take her and Tiffany out anywhere because of Kat's baby [[Tommy Moon|Tommy]]. Shenice bonds with Kat's relative [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) after helping her plant some window boxes. When Shenice is due to go back to Spain, she begs to stay in Walford and Alfie agrees. Shenice is then enrolled at Walford Primary School. Martina allows Shenice to spend Christmas with Kat and Alfie. When Jean is questioned for benefit fraud, it sparks off another [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]] episode. This results in Jean believing that Shenice is an angel sent from her daughter [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]). Jean tries to take Shenice ice skating whilst dressed in pyjamas. Shenice manages to escape and runs back to The Queen Victoria to alert Kat and Alfie. Jean's mental health improves, and though Shenice is wary of her for a time, she allows Jean to become her honorary grandma.

Norman's niece, [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) is angry with him because he never bothered with his mother while she was alive. A week later, Pat calls him and asks him to contest the will against Janine who is the sole beneficiary. The next day, Norman phones up Pat, and asks her to visit him in hospital after he stepped on a rake. Pat tries to persuade Norman not to contest the will after all, and he later agrees. It is clear that Norman likes Pat, but she is oblivious to this. [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) takes a liking to Norman and asks him to dress as a [[Pearly King]] to help with her campaign to stop the community centre closing. Jean hopes that she can be his Pearly Queen, but he asks Pat to do it instead, and she reluctantly agrees.\n\nNorman asks Pat out but she rejects him, while Jean's liking of Norman intensifies. Jean agrees to go to a [[skiffle]] event with him. However, she misunderstands, as he is actually giving her both tickets and not going with her. Jean's relative [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) confronts Norman for playing games but he insists he was never planning to go with Jean. This causes an argument between Kat, Pat and Janine, and Janine tells Norman that Pat used to be a prostitute. Norman tells Janine he is ashamed to be related to her. Jean soon becomes obsessed with Norman, constantly sending him text messages. She invites him to dinner, but he says no, saying he would not want to make a habit of it. Jean then mistakenly thinks Norman wants to live with her. He is shocked at this, and asks Kat's husband [[Alfie Moon|Alfie]] ([[Shane Richie]]) for help. Alfie makes things worse though, so Norman is forced to tell Jean that they should just be friends, as he feels she is too good for him.\n\nWhen Pat discovers that her son, [[Simon Wicks]], who lives in New Zealand, is going to lose his home, she fails to get a loan because of her age. Norman offers to help and organises a loan for her. After speaking to her great grandson [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]), Pat decides she likes Norman and they kiss, she also asks him to stay. However, the next day Norman tells [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) that he regularly earns commission for organising loans for people. Patrick then warns Pat about this, and once Pat finds out that the terms of the loan mean if she misses a payment she could lose her house, she rejects Norman, tells him to leave and says she never wants to see him again.\n\nA few months later, Norman returns to Walford, saying he has raised enough money to help Pat with the loan. However, Pat has died, so he goes to the Butchers' house to pay his respects.\n\n[[Digital Spy]] reported that \"sparks fly\" when Norman runs into Pat Evans and he develops a soft spot for her.<ref name=\"Norman\"/> The character and casting were announced on 12 June 2011.<ref name=\"Norman\"/> Norman is described as \"hapless, clumsy and unlucky in life.\"<ref name=\"Norman\"/> Of his casting, Layton said \"I am thrilled to be joining such a wonderful cast and crew\u2014Norman is a great part and I'm excited to play him.

Dot sees Rose in a bar, drinking and flirting with a group of men, and leaves without speaking to her. She later follows her to an address, and Rose lies that she is well off and her husband has died. Dot leaves but returns when she realises she has left something behind. She finds that the dead man is alive and Rose has lied about everything. Dot goes to her actual home and Rose admits she did not want Dot to think bad of her. Dot tells Rose she may not have long to live and did not want to die before making amends. They start to bond, and Dot meets Rose's son [[#Andrew Cotton|Andrew]] ([[Ricky Grover]]), and there is animosity between mother and son. Before Dot is due to leave, Rose asks to spend some more time with her. Dot says as they are both lonely, Rose should live with her in [[Walford]], and Rose agrees. Andrew drives them there but reveals his last name is Cotton, and Rose is forced to admit that Andrew's father is Dot's first husband [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), who had a bigamous marriage with Rose. Dot kicks Rose out but she later returns, saying she does not want to lose her sister again.\n\nRose moves in and Dot urges her to earn money. When Dot gossips to her about [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) and her family, Rose uses this information to make Jean think she is psychic, and Jean pays her for her services. She then gets a trial working for Doctor [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) as his receptionist. She gets the job and appears to enjoy it, although her constant pining over Yusef appears to irritate him somewhat. Rose reveals to Dot that she is behind with the paperwork at the surgery while Yusef has been away. Dot helps Rose sort through her workload, but they discover that Rose has misplaced some test results for a patient who has since died. Rose fears her oversight resulted in the patient's death, but [[Reverend Stevens]] ([[Michael Keating (actor)|Michael Keating]]) tells her the patient died of a bee sting. A relieved Rose then flirts with Reverend Stevens, much to the chagrin of Dot. A few days later, Dot reveals Rose's shady past to Reverend Stevens. However, the Reverend is intrigued, and he and Rose share a drink at [[The Queen Victoria]] public house, as he wants to know more about her life. Rose brings alcohol to a church social event, which Dot is against, but Reverend Stevens thanks Dot for making it the best so far. Rose and Reverend Stevens grow closer at the event, resulting in him asking for Dot's blessing to date Rose. Rose later has sex with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) upsetting Reverend Stevens. Cora finds this funny but Dot kicks Cora out for laughing. Rose later apologises to Dot for embarrassing her and forgives Dot for the things she said, however, Dot asks Rose to move back to Southend. Dot also discovers Rose's passport which reveals Rose had remarried again and had the surname of Beauchamp. When Dot confronts her, Rose reveals that the marriage was abusive. Dot then allows Rose to move back in with her. Rose later does some card readings with Jean, [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) and [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). In December 2011 Andrew comes back to Walford in December, and promises to stay for Christmas, much to the delight of Rose and Dot.\n\nIn January 2012, [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) finds a love note in the charity shop and finds out the book the note was in belongs to Cora. However, Abi sees Rose reading the same note, leaving Abi confused. Cora then discovers the letter Rose is reading and asks why is anybody writing to her, leaving the two ladies to have an argument. When Rose receives more love letters, Dot and Cora rummage through her things to try and discover who the mystery man is. They are horrified when they learn he is serving a life sentence in prison, although Rose seems unfazed by this. Dot then attempts to put a stop to it by writing on Rose's behalf, but reveals her real name and address, not realising that Rose used a false name and a PO Box address.\n\nAndrew announces that he is to marry [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]). Rose is unhappy at Andrew's choice of bride, and tries to undermine Heather. Heather eventually stands up to Rose, saying she is bullying her, and Rose later realises that she is just jealous and does not want to lose her son. Rose then helps dot arrange the wedding. However, on Heather's hen party, Rose gets drunk and leaves early. At home, she tries on Heather's wedding dress. Andrew discovers her, gets angry and rips the dress. It is also revealed that Andrew has spent time in prison for assaulting Rose's abusive husband. Dot and Rose hastily repair Heather's wedding dress on the night before the wedding, but are distraught when they learn that Heather has been murdered. The police arrest Andrew, and Patrick finds the burnt remains of a [[hoodie]] worn by members of Andrew's stag-party. Desperate to prove Andrew's innocence, Rose, Dot and [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) break into the [[R&R (EastEnders)|R&R]] nightclub where he worked and find Andrew's hoodie, which they hand to the police. Andrew is released from custody. In May 2012 Dot leaves to spend a few months with her granddaughter Dotty. Rose then becomes lonely, and jealous of the friendship between Cora and Patrick.

Andrew then returns to Southend.\n\nAndrew returns to Walford in December and promises to stay for Christmas, much to Rose and Dot's delight. He meets Heather again, and vows to her that he will make up for his past mistakes with her. Heather initially rejects him, but then they share a kiss. He later asks to spend Christmas with her, and she agrees. Andrew starts working as a doorman at the [[R&R (EastEnders)|R&R nightclub]]. Heather is upset when he chooses to work instead of spending the night with her. Andrew leaves Heather several messages, explaining he was scared and he will wait in the caf\u00e9 until she arrives. However, he is asked to leave because he is taking up a seat and he refuses. In his anger, he pushes a table over, which Heather witnesses. She forgives him, and the couple soon admit their love for each other. They attend a dance class with [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) and Heather is impressed with Andrew's dance moves. He also picks up a poster about [[gastric band]] surgery, which Rose finds and confronts Heather about. He tells Heather he is fixing Dot's tap but Heather thinks he is having the surgery, but he reveals he was looking for an engagement ring. He proposes and Heather accepts and they have sex for the first time. Andrew soon notices that Heather spends more time with Shirley than with him, and gets angry with Heather. Heather and Andrew settle their differences and spend more time together.\n\nAt Heather's hen night, Andrew's temper emerges again when he almost hits Shirley and it is revealed that Andrew went to prison for assaulting Rose's husband. Heather stays with Andrew as he explains that Rose's husband regularly abused her. Sick of the interference in their wedding, Andrew suggests to Heather that they elope. Heather is unsure, so he gives her two train tickets and tells her to meet him at [[The Queen Victoria]] public house by 6&nbsp;pm if she wants to elope with him. Heather does not arrive, so Andrew gets drunk, leaves the pub and considers leaving Walford. He is persuaded to stay by a homeless man, [[List of EastEnders characters (2012)#Gerry2|Gerry]] (Michael Elliott), and returns to Heather's flat, only to find that Heather has been murdered. Andrew is arrested by the police, as he doesn't have an alibi for where he was when Heather died and they suspect him as he cannot prove that a tramp stole Heather's money from him. However, he is eventually released without charge. Shirley confronts Andrew and publicly accuses him of murdering Heather. However, when it is suggested that Andrew should leave Walford, he declares that he plans to stay. Dot doubts Andrew's innocence but when Andrew opens up to Dot about his feelings for Heather, Dot changes her mind. This leads to Shirley banning Andrew and Dot from Heather's funeral. However, Shirley later finds the train tickets that Andrew gave Heather the night she died and realises he is innocent. She later admits that she wanted him to be the killer as she was jealous and the pair agree to unite to find Heather's real killer. Dot and Rose eventually leave Walford, leaving Andrew with no family there. Heather's killer is eventually revealed to be [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe) after he confesses to the police. When [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) is released on bail charged with [[perverting the course of justice]] for protecting Ben, Andrew accuses Shirley of protecting them as they were living with her. When he sees Jay, he attacks him in The Queen Victoria by pushing him onto a table. The next day, Andrew realises that he will never be able to move on as long as he stays in Walford because of the memories and decides to leave.\n\n===Creation and development===\nIn November 2011, executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] told ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that Andrew would be returning to ''EastEnders'' to woo Heather.<ref>{{cite journal|date=19\u201325 November 2011|title=Secrets of the Square|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=46|page=39}}</ref> In March 2012, Grover said that Andrew will be staying with ''EastEnders'', despite Heather's departure.<ref name=Regular>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Andrew Cotton to stay on soap, confirms Ricky Grover|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a372135/eastenders-andrew-cotton-to-stay-on-soap-confirms-ricky-grover.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=20 March 2012}}</ref> Speaking to ''[[Inside Soap]]'', Grover said: \"EastEnders have asked me to stay on as a more regular character, so I'm hoping to be involved for another year or so.\"<ref name=Regular /> He added that it was a lovely compliment as Andrew was originally intended for four episodes only and that it was a shock to hear that Fergison would be leaving the show.<ref name=Regular /> Grover revealed in April 2012 that he initially turned down the role of Andrew up to five times, before being persuaded to accept the role.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\">{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title='EastEnders' Ricky Grover: 'I turned Andrew role down five times'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a375404/eastenders-ricky-grover-i-turned-andrew-role-down-five-times.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=8 April 2012}}</ref> Grover said he was scared of being branded a \"silly fat couple\" as both Andrew and Heather are overweight.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" /> He said he spoke to [[Steve McFadden]], who is a friend of his and he told Grover that he can play the role how he wants so eventually accepted it.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" /> Speaking about his introduction, Grover added that Heather and Andrew were \"hitting it off\" and it is like he and Fergison have been working together for years.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" /> Grover also added that when he is filming, he \"makes it sound authentic\".<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" />\n\nFergison commented on Heather feelings when Andrew proposes to her, saying that Heather \"couldn't be happier\".<ref name=\"Andrew Proposal\">{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' proposal thrills Heather, says Cheryl Fergison|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/images/content/characters/zoe_cotton/zoe_cotton_126.jpg|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=25 January 2012|date=17 January 2011}}</ref> Fergison told ''[[All About Soap]]'': \"He tells Heather he has to go and fix Dot's leaky tap, but she discovers he's lying.

However, Amira goes to Syed and Christian's engagement party and tells Syed he has a daughter but she does not want Christian to have anything to do with Yasmin but Syed refuses to visit without Christian. However, he later meets Amira and Yasmin in the park. Amira tries to manipulate Syed into spending more time with her and Yasmin. Amira lies, saying that Yasmin has swallowed her ring, leading to Yasmin going for an unnecessary trip to the hospital. Yusef, trying to tear the Masood family apart, tells Christian that Syed may not be Yasmin's father so he and Christian get a paternity test done, taking a hair from each of them. However, Yusef, who is the local GP, swaps Syed's hair sample for one of his own. The test results then show that Syed is not Yasmin's father, causing consternation for those involved, though Yusef's falsification is subsequently exposed. When Amira leaves Walford, she leaves Yasmin with Syed and Christian.\n\nWhen Christian enters Yasmin into a \"beautiful baby\" competition, Syed becomes angry and refers to Yasmin as his daughter, not his and Christian's, leading to an argument between them. Amira returns a few months later as she wants Yasmin to live with her and her new fianc\u00e9 in Birmingham. Syed eventually agrees but when Christian finds out, he tries to stop her. Syed tells him that it is for the best and after agreeing to stay in touch, Amira and Yasmin leave after a tearful goodbye. However, Syed and Christian soon leave Walford to move nearer to Yasmin.

He gives her his number so she can contact him any time she needs to get away from [[Walford]], before taking her home. They stay in contact and Rob is seen showing a friend a photo of Whitney. When Whitney either rejects or is rejected by all her friends and family, she contacts Rob and he takes her to stay with him. After Whitney has been missing for several days, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) tries to phone her, leaving several messages. When she finally gets a voicemail back, it is from Rob saying if she calls again, there will be trouble.\n\nLauren tracks Whitney down to [[Dartford]], but Whitney insists she is fine with Rob, and that they are in love. Rob meets Lauren at their bedsit and invites her out with them, but Lauren leaves. Rob then leaves Whitney alone with [[#Chris|Chris]] (Richard Simons) and it is revealed that Rob is using Whitney to pay off his debts. Rob meets Lauren in a caf\u00e9 and again invites her out and calls her beautiful. He then threatens her, saying he does not want to see her again. When Rob returns to the bedsit, Whitney is there with [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), who says she is taking Whitney home. Whitney refuses to go and Rob ejects Janine from the building. Rob then tells Whitney they are going out immediately, and drags her to the car as she refuses to go. Lauren and Janine watch as Rob drives away with Whitney. Rob takes Whitney to a house where she meets [[#Chloe|Chloe]] ([[Georgia Henshaw]]), another girl being exploited. Whitney realises she is there to have sex with men, so asks Rob if she can leave. Rob says to either be nice to his friends or he will hurt her. He grabs her and locks her in a room. She is unable to open the windows so when she hears people outside the door, she smashes a window, jumps to the ground and runs away with Rob calling after her. She then stops a car and asks for help. She later returns to Walford after being arrested for shoplifting. Her half brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) learns of what happened and wants to find Rob but Whitney says he has moved.\n\nWhen Whitney starts a relationship with a man named [[#Lee|Lee]] (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. Whitney goes to meet Lee and is shocked to see Rob instead. She is taken in by his charm until she texts Lee not to come, and then sees the message on Rob's phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to [[Southend-on-Sea]] with friends. She leaves Rob a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall over the edge of the pier. A body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob's.\n\n===Development===\nIn January 2011, it was announced that Whitney would be part of the sexual exploitation storyline. She is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for Rob, who then exploits her. ''EastEnders'' worked alongside charity [[Comic Relief]] on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during [[Red Nose Day 2011]] on 18 March 2011, in a special 10-minute episode.<ref name=\"Sex exploitation plot\"/> Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: \"It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with ''EastEnders'' will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the ''EastEnders'' script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation.\"<ref name=\"Humphreys\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/01/comicrelief.shtml|title=EastEnders working with Comic Relief|last=Humphreys|first=Matt|date=9 January 2011|work=EastEnders|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added \"We have worked over many years with ''EastEnders'' in all kinds of ways.

The BBC issued a statement, saying:\n\n{{blockquote|The ''EastEnders'' audience would have been aware of the dark situation Whitney was getting into. In the preceding episodes viewers saw Whitney feeling increasingly unwanted and unloved, with her brother and her step-mother absent, her life was taking a downward spiral. [...] It was a natural progression of Whitney's story thus far and we felt it was an important story to tell, and hopefully to raise awareness of amongst our audience. In doing so, we believe it was right to show the\u2014albeit unpleasant\u2014reality of the situation faced by these girls, rather than put a gloss on it. In the episode Whitney is seen to escape and to raise the alarm\u2014we did not leave the audience on a cliffhanger. The menace and danger Whitney is in whilst clear is implied rather than graphic or sensationalised and is in keeping with the audience expectations of how ''EastEnders'' would tackle a tough story in a pre-watershed manner and indeed how Whitney's story has evolved over the last few years. We are conscious that Red Nose Day programming includes many different tones and themes, ranging from light comedy sketches to difficult and emotional appeal films, all of which played out around the time the ''EastEnders'' episode was scheduled to transmit. We hope that the majority of the audience would have heard the first extended warning and that the serious tone of the introduction, though truncated, pointed to the fact that the upcoming film was a gear change. It was further put into context by the presenters at the end of the piece, when they talked about the Comic Relief-funded charities working to help girls like Whitney.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a310633/bbc-defends-enders-comic-relief-episode.html|title=BBC defends 'Enders Comic Relief episode|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=23 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 March 2011|location=London}}</ref>}}\n\nSpeaking about how members of the public reacted to the storyline, Latham told ''[[OK!]]'', \"Considering Rob makes [[Phil Mitchell]] look like a field mouse, I've got to be quite grateful. I've not had a tin of baked beans chucked at me in Asda by some nice old lady. It's just a bit of banter off the public, which I relish.

Kat shouts at Shenice to take the clothes off, and Shenice flinches thinking Kat is going to hit her.

Martina calls her daughter useless before going to bed, and Shenice tells Kat and Alfie that Martina says things she does not mean when she is drunk.

Kat and Alfie organise a birthday party for Shenice as Martina has forgotten and Shenice takes a disliking to [[Tiffany Butcher]] ([[Maisie Smith]]) as they are wearing the same outfit.

This results in Jean believing that Shenice is an angel sent from her daughter [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]). Jean tries to take Shenice ice skating whilst dressed in pyjamas. Shenice manages to escape and runs back to The Queen Victoria to alert Kat and Alfie. Jean's mental health improves, and though Shenice is wary of her for a time, she allows Jean to become her honorary grandma. Shenice goes to visit Martina in Spain, and on 7 September 2012 Kat reveals to Alfie that she is not coming back.\n\n===Development===\nHarvey is the real-life sister of [[Lacey Turner]] who played [[Stacey Slater]], and first appears on screen on 28 February 2011.<ref name=\"Martina\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a303087/yusef-provides-support-for-Denise.html |title=Yusef provides support for Denise |author=Daniel Kilkelly |date=February 2011 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=10 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wOpo5tnu?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a303087/yusef-provides-support-for-denise.html |archivedate=10 February 2011 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Producers were unaware that Harvey and Turner were related until after the casting was made.

Norman's niece, [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) is angry with him because he never bothered with his mother while she was alive. A week later, Pat calls him and asks him to contest the will against Janine who is the sole beneficiary. The next day, Norman phones up Pat, and asks her to visit him in hospital after he stepped on a rake. Pat tries to persuade Norman not to contest the will after all, and he later agrees. It is clear that Norman likes Pat, but she is oblivious to this. [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) takes a liking to Norman and asks him to dress as a [[Pearly King]] to help with her campaign to stop the community centre closing. Jean hopes that she can be his Pearly Queen, but he asks Pat to do it instead, and she reluctantly agrees.\n\nNorman asks Pat out but she rejects him, while Jean's liking of Norman intensifies. Jean agrees to go to a [[skiffle]] event with him. However, she misunderstands, as he is actually giving her both tickets and not going with her. Jean's relative [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) confronts Norman for playing games but he insists he was never planning to go with Jean. This causes an argument between Kat, Pat and Janine, and Janine tells Norman that Pat used to be a prostitute. Norman tells Janine he is ashamed to be related to her. Jean soon becomes obsessed with Norman, constantly sending him text messages. She invites him to dinner, but he says no, saying he would not want to make a habit of it. Jean then mistakenly thinks Norman wants to live with her. He is shocked at this, and asks Kat's husband [[Alfie Moon|Alfie]] ([[Shane Richie]]) for help. Alfie makes things worse though, so Norman is forced to tell Jean that they should just be friends, as he feels she is too good for him.\n\nWhen Pat discovers that her son, [[Simon Wicks]], who lives in New Zealand, is going to lose his home, she fails to get a loan because of her age. Norman offers to help and organises a loan for her. After speaking to her great grandson [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]), Pat decides she likes Norman and they kiss, she also asks him to stay. However, the next day Norman tells [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) that he regularly earns commission for organising loans for people. Patrick then warns Pat about this, and once Pat finds out that the terms of the loan mean if she misses a payment she could lose her house, she rejects Norman, tells him to leave and says she never wants to see him again.\n\nA few months later, Norman returns to Walford, saying he has raised enough money to help Pat with the loan.

It was my first job out of drama school, as I only finished a few weeks before. I had to jump straight into it, but everyone was so nice. The cast and crew really are just like one big family.

On 18 May 2012, Daniel Kilkelly of [[Digital Spy]] confirmed Perkins was leaving ''EastEnders''. Rose's last episode was on 19 July 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a382389/eastenders-departure-for-rose-cotton-confirmed.html|title='EastEnders' departure for Rose Cotton confirmed|date=18 May 2012|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref><ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/information/a130011/soaplands-joiners-movers-and-leavers.html</ref>\n\nShe is first seen when Dot goes to visit her in [[Southend-on-Sea]] where she lives, as she has decided to make amends before she dies. Dot sees Rose in a bar, drinking and flirting with a group of men, and leaves without speaking to her. She later follows her to an address, and Rose lies that she is well off and her husband has died. Dot leaves but returns when she realises she has left something behind. She finds that the dead man is alive and Rose has lied about everything. Dot goes to her actual home and Rose admits she did not want Dot to think bad of her. Dot tells Rose she may not have long to live and did not want to die before making amends. They start to bond, and Dot meets Rose's son [[#Andrew Cotton|Andrew]] ([[Ricky Grover]]), and there is animosity between mother and son. Before Dot is due to leave, Rose asks to spend some more time with her. Dot says as they are both lonely, Rose should live with her in [[Walford]], and Rose agrees. Andrew drives them there but reveals his last name is Cotton, and Rose is forced to admit that Andrew's father is Dot's first husband [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), who had a bigamous marriage with Rose. Dot kicks Rose out but she later returns, saying she does not want to lose her sister again.\n\nRose moves in and Dot urges her to earn money. When Dot gossips to her about [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) and her family, Rose uses this information to make Jean think she is psychic, and Jean pays her for her services. She then gets a trial working for Doctor [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) as his receptionist. She gets the job and appears to enjoy it, although her constant pining over Yusef appears to irritate him somewhat. Rose reveals to Dot that she is behind with the paperwork at the surgery while Yusef has been away. Dot helps Rose sort through her workload, but they discover that Rose has misplaced some test results for a patient who has since died. Rose fears her oversight resulted in the patient's death, but [[Reverend Stevens]] ([[Michael Keating (actor)|Michael Keating]]) tells her the patient died of a bee sting. A relieved Rose then flirts with Reverend Stevens, much to the chagrin of Dot. A few days later, Dot reveals Rose's shady past to Reverend Stevens. However, the Reverend is intrigued, and he and Rose share a drink at [[The Queen Victoria]] public house, as he wants to know more about her life. Rose brings alcohol to a church social event, which Dot is against, but Reverend Stevens thanks Dot for making it the best so far. Rose and Reverend Stevens grow closer at the event, resulting in him asking for Dot's blessing to date Rose. Rose later has sex with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) upsetting Reverend Stevens. Cora finds this funny but Dot kicks Cora out for laughing. Rose later apologises to Dot for embarrassing her and forgives Dot for the things she said, however, Dot asks Rose to move back to Southend. Dot also discovers Rose's passport which reveals Rose had remarried again and had the surname of Beauchamp. When Dot confronts her, Rose reveals that the marriage was abusive. Dot then allows Rose to move back in with her. Rose later does some card readings with Jean, [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) and [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). In December 2011 Andrew comes back to Walford in December, and promises to stay for Christmas, much to the delight of Rose and Dot.\n\nIn January 2012, [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) finds a love note in the charity shop and finds out the book the note was in belongs to Cora. However, Abi sees Rose reading the same note, leaving Abi confused. Cora then discovers the letter Rose is reading and asks why is anybody writing to her, leaving the two ladies to have an argument. When Rose receives more love letters, Dot and Cora rummage through her things to try and discover who the mystery man is. They are horrified when they learn he is serving a life sentence in prison, although Rose seems unfazed by this. Dot then attempts to put a stop to it by writing on Rose's behalf, but reveals her real name and address, not realising that Rose used a false name and a PO Box address.\n\nAndrew announces that he is to marry [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]). Rose is unhappy at Andrew's choice of bride, and tries to undermine Heather. Heather eventually stands up to Rose, saying she is bullying her, and Rose later realises that she is just jealous and does not want to lose her son. Rose then helps dot arrange the wedding. However, on Heather's hen party, Rose gets drunk and leaves early. At home, she tries on Heather's wedding dress. Andrew discovers her, gets angry and rips the dress. It is also revealed that Andrew has spent time in prison for assaulting Rose's abusive husband. Dot and Rose hastily repair Heather's wedding dress on the night before the wedding, but are distraught when they learn that Heather has been murdered. The police arrest Andrew, and Patrick finds the burnt remains of a [[hoodie]] worn by members of Andrew's stag-party. Desperate to prove Andrew's innocence, Rose, Dot and [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) break into the [[R&R (EastEnders)|R&R]] nightclub where he worked and find Andrew's hoodie, which they hand to the police. Andrew is released from custody. In May 2012 Dot leaves to spend a few months with her granddaughter Dotty. Rose then becomes lonely, and jealous of the friendship between Cora and Patrick. Andrew calls Dot, who invites Rose to stay with her, and Rose leaves Walford.\n\n===Development===\nThe casting of Perkins in the role was announced on 27 May 2011 and the character first appeared on screen on 22 August 2011.<ref name=\"22aug\">{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 22/08/2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013spj2 |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Tim Mercier; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Matthew Barry |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=22 August 2011}}</ref> She is described as \"flighty, fun and not one to age gracefully\".<ref name=\"Rose\" /> Rose and Dot have been estranged for most of their lives, since Rose had an affair with Dot's first husband, [[Charlie Cotton]].

Shirley walks out but when she returns, it is too late for them to go in but Andrew, who is working on the door, lets them in anyway. Heather tells Andrew that she and Shirley are lesbians as the event is for couples, but he thinks Heather is lying, and she admits it. When Andrew talks to Shirley, she says Heather is not interested and Heather thinks Andrew is more interested in Shirley. Eventually, Shirley tells Heather that Andrew likes her, but did not tell her in case it was purely for a bet. This upsets Heather, who tells Andrew the bet is off. Heather soon realises she was wrong and meets Andrew in the restaurant of the hotel where she is staying. Heather's friend [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) arrives with her half sister [[#Rose Cotton|Rose Cotton]] ([[Polly Perkins (singer)|Polly Perkins]]) and it is revealed that Andrew is Rose's son and they do not get on. Andrew and Rose trade insults at the table and he and Heather decide to leave. Heather tells Andrew he should not speak to his mother that way and decides to leave. Andrew finds out Rose has decided to live with Dot and will be left on his own. He drives them to [[Walford]] and finds Heather, and she says she will find him next time she is in Southend. He tells her his name as Andrew Cotton, revealing to Dot that his father is her first husband [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]), and that he had a third bigamous marriage. Andrew then returns to Southend.\n\nAndrew returns to Walford in December and promises to stay for Christmas, much to Rose and Dot's delight. He meets Heather again, and vows to her that he will make up for his past mistakes with her. Heather initially rejects him, but then they share a kiss. He later asks to spend Christmas with her, and she agrees. Andrew starts working as a doorman at the [[R&R (EastEnders)|R&R nightclub]]. Heather is upset when he chooses to work instead of spending the night with her. Andrew leaves Heather several messages, explaining he was scared and he will wait in the caf\u00e9 until she arrives. However, he is asked to leave because he is taking up a seat and he refuses. In his anger, he pushes a table over, which Heather witnesses. She forgives him, and the couple soon admit their love for each other. They attend a dance class with [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]) and Heather is impressed with Andrew's dance moves. He also picks up a poster about [[gastric band]] surgery, which Rose finds and confronts Heather about. He tells Heather he is fixing Dot's tap but Heather thinks he is having the surgery, but he reveals he was looking for an engagement ring. He proposes and Heather accepts and they have sex for the first time. Andrew soon notices that Heather spends more time with Shirley than with him, and gets angry with Heather. Heather and Andrew settle their differences and spend more time together.\n\nAt Heather's hen night, Andrew's temper emerges again when he almost hits Shirley and it is revealed that Andrew went to prison for assaulting Rose's husband. Heather stays with Andrew as he explains that Rose's husband regularly abused her. Sick of the interference in their wedding, Andrew suggests to Heather that they elope. Heather is unsure, so he gives her two train tickets and tells her to meet him at [[The Queen Victoria]] public house by 6&nbsp;pm if she wants to elope with him. Heather does not arrive, so Andrew gets drunk, leaves the pub and considers leaving Walford. He is persuaded to stay by a homeless man, [[List of EastEnders characters (2012)#Gerry2|Gerry]] (Michael Elliott), and returns to Heather's flat, only to find that Heather has been murdered. Andrew is arrested by the police, as he doesn't have an alibi for where he was when Heather died and they suspect him as he cannot prove that a tramp stole Heather's money from him. However, he is eventually released without charge. Shirley confronts Andrew and publicly accuses him of murdering Heather. However, when it is suggested that Andrew should leave Walford, he declares that he plans to stay. Dot doubts Andrew's innocence but when Andrew opens up to Dot about his feelings for Heather, Dot changes her mind. This leads to Shirley banning Andrew and Dot from Heather's funeral. However, Shirley later finds the train tickets that Andrew gave Heather the night she died and realises he is innocent. She later admits that she wanted him to be the killer as she was jealous and the pair agree to unite to find Heather's real killer. Dot and Rose eventually leave Walford, leaving Andrew with no family there. Heather's killer is eventually revealed to be [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe) after he confesses to the police. When [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) is released on bail charged with [[perverting the course of justice]] for protecting Ben, Andrew accuses Shirley of protecting them as they were living with her. When he sees Jay, he attacks him in The Queen Victoria by pushing him onto a table. The next day, Andrew realises that he will never be able to move on as long as he stays in Walford because of the memories and decides to leave.\n\n===Creation and development===\nIn November 2011, executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] told ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that Andrew would be returning to ''EastEnders'' to woo Heather.<ref>{{cite journal|date=19\u201325 November 2011|title=Secrets of the Square|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|issue=46|page=39}}</ref> In March 2012, Grover said that Andrew will be staying with ''EastEnders'', despite Heather's departure.<ref name=Regular>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Andrew Cotton to stay on soap, confirms Ricky Grover|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a372135/eastenders-andrew-cotton-to-stay-on-soap-confirms-ricky-grover.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=20 March 2012}}</ref> Speaking to ''[[Inside Soap]]'', Grover said: \"EastEnders have asked me to stay on as a more regular character, so I'm hoping to be involved for another year or so.\"<ref name=Regular /> He added that it was a lovely compliment as Andrew was originally intended for four episodes only and that it was a shock to hear that Fergison would be leaving the show.<ref name=Regular /> Grover revealed in April 2012 that he initially turned down the role of Andrew up to five times, before being persuaded to accept the role.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\">{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title='EastEnders' Ricky Grover: 'I turned Andrew role down five times'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a375404/eastenders-ricky-grover-i-turned-andrew-role-down-five-times.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=8 April 2012|date=8 April 2012}}</ref> Grover said he was scared of being branded a \"silly fat couple\" as both Andrew and Heather are overweight.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" /> He said he spoke to [[Steve McFadden]], who is a friend of his and he told Grover that he can play the role how he wants so eventually accepted it.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" /> Speaking about his introduction, Grover added that Heather and Andrew were \"hitting it off\" and it is like he and Fergison have been working together for years.<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" /> Grover also added that when he is filming, he \"makes it sound authentic\".<ref name=\"Rejected Role\" />\n\nFergison commented on Heather feelings when Andrew proposes to her, saying that Heather \"couldn't be happier\".<ref name=\"Andrew Proposal\">{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' proposal thrills Heather, says Cheryl Fergison|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/images/content/characters/zoe_cotton/zoe_cotton_126.jpg|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=25 January 2012|date=17 January 2011}}</ref> Fergison told ''[[All About Soap]]'': \"He tells Heather he has to go and fix Dot's leaky tap, but she discovers he's lying.

However, Amira reveals that she wants Syed to meet his daughter. Yusef tries to persuade her she is doing the wrong thing and that Syed will want custody of Yasmin. However, Amira goes to Syed and Christian's engagement party and tells Syed he has a daughter but she does not want Christian to have anything to do with Yasmin but Syed refuses to visit without Christian. However, he later meets Amira and Yasmin in the park. Amira tries to manipulate Syed into spending more time with her and Yasmin. Amira lies, saying that Yasmin has swallowed her ring, leading to Yasmin going for an unnecessary trip to the hospital. Yusef, trying to tear the Masood family apart, tells Christian that Syed may not be Yasmin's father so he and Christian get a paternity test done, taking a hair from each of them. However, Yusef, who is the local GP, swaps Syed's hair sample for one of his own. The test results then show that Syed is not Yasmin's father, causing consternation for those involved, though Yusef's falsification is subsequently exposed. When Amira leaves Walford, she leaves Yasmin with Syed and Christian.\n\nWhen Christian enters Yasmin into a \"beautiful baby\" competition, Syed becomes angry and refers to Yasmin as his daughter, not his and Christian's, leading to an argument between them. Amira returns a few months later as she wants Yasmin to live with her and her new fianc\u00e9 in Birmingham. Syed eventually agrees but when Christian finds out, he tries to stop her. Syed tells him that it is for the best and after agreeing to stay in touch, Amira and Yasmin leave after a tearful goodbye. However, Syed and Christian soon leave Walford to move nearer to Yasmin. In May 2014, Yasmin appears when [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) visits Christian at his home in Birmingham, following the death of his daughter [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]).

And then she was like, 'Oh, trust me, it's great.' So Sue gave it to me just because she had it ... I used to, like, give out copies of the movie.
