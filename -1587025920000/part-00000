Nostrand recalled working alongside his fellow assistants, background artist George Siefringer and \"Martin Epp, who [[inker|inked]], [[letterer|lettered]] and helped George on backgrounds. I started out inking and then got into doing backgrounds... and then [[penciler|penciling]].\"<ref name=nostrand18 /> Nostrand worked for Powell on features that included \"Red Hawk\" in [[Magazine Enterprises]]' ''[[Howard Culver|Straight Arrow]]'' and \"Bobby Benson's B-Bar-B Riders\", based on the [[children's television]] series, in the same publisher's comic book of that title, but it was the horror comics that Harvey would begin publishing in the early 1950s that would feature some of Nostrand and Powell's finest comic art. For [[Fawcett Comics]], he did work in ''[[Hot Rod]] Comics'', an adaptation of the 1951 [[John Huston]] film ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (1951 film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]'' and \"a couple of Westerns\", including the movie spin-off feature \"[[Lash LaRue]]\".<ref name=nostrand18 /> Writer and artist credits were not routinely given in comics during this time; historians cite as Nostand's first confirmed full inking work the seven-page Powell-penciled horror story \"Servants of the Tomb\" in Harvey's ''Witches Tales'' #6 (Nov. 1961).<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/howard%20nostrand/sort/chrono/ Howard Nostrand] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>\n\nNostrand left Powell in March 1952 and found work with Harvey Comics editor [[Sid Jacobson]]. \"I think the first job I did for Harvey was a story called 'Man Germ', written by a fellow named Nat Barnett... about a trip through the interior of a person's body. Turns out this fellow as a germ, though, and the body expires. Cute.\"<ref name=nostrand19>Nostrand, p. 19</ref> Nostrand also worked on Harvey's short-lived [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] comics, as well as on such horror titles as ''Black Cat Mystery'', ''Chamber of Chills'', ''Tomb of Terror'' and ''Witches Tales''.<ref name=gcd/>\n\nSince EC comics were leading the way in the horror comics genre of the day, most publishers were advising their artists to adopt a similar style and in some cases outright art swipes from [[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales From the Crypt]] and other comics published under the Entertaining Comics banner. Nostrand did a flawless imitation of [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and in one case completely redrew a sequence by [[Wally Wood]] from EC's [[Two-Fisted Tales]] but changed the positioning and layout of every panel. Wood and other EC artists praised Nostrand's work and saw that he was talented enough not to do outright swipes, but only work influenced by other artists.\n\nWith the mid-1950s slump in comic books that followed the Senate hearings on [[juvenile delinquency]] and the creation of the [[Comics Code]]. Nostrand turned to commercial art. In a 1974 autobiographical magazine article, he recalled: \n{{quote|text=I was pretty well washed-up in comics. I did manage to scrounge a couple of jobs once in a while, but the handwriting was on the wall... I decided instead of becoming a famous cartoonist, I would become a famous illustrator.

Nostrand recalled working alongside his fellow assistants, background artist George Siefringer and \"Martin Epp, who [[inker|inked]], [[letterer|lettered]] and helped George on backgrounds. I started out inking and then got into doing backgrounds... and then [[penciler|penciling]].\"<ref name=nostrand18 /> Nostrand worked for Powell on features that included \"Red Hawk\" in [[Magazine Enterprises]]' ''[[Howard Culver|Straight Arrow]]'' and \"Bobby Benson's B-Bar-B Riders\", based on the [[children's television]] series, in the same publisher's comic book of that title, but it was the horror comics that Harvey would begin publishing in the early 1950s that would feature some of Nostrand and Powell's finest comic art. For [[Fawcett Comics]], he did work in ''[[Hot Rod]] Comics'', an adaptation of the 1951 [[John Huston]] film ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]'' and \"a couple of Westerns\", including the movie spin-off feature \"[[Lash LaRue]]\".<ref name=nostrand18 /> Writer and artist credits were not routinely given in comics during this time; historians cite as Nostand's first confirmed full inking work the seven-page Powell-penciled horror story \"Servants of the Tomb\" in Harvey's ''Witches Tales'' #6 (Nov. 1961).<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/howard%20nostrand/sort/chrono/ Howard Nostrand] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>\n\nNostrand left Powell in March 1952 and found work with Harvey Comics editor [[Sid Jacobson]]. \"I think the first job I did for Harvey was a story called 'Man Germ', written by a fellow named Nat Barnett... about a trip through the interior of a person's body. Turns out this fellow as a germ, though, and the body expires. Cute.\"<ref name=nostrand19>Nostrand, p. 19</ref> Nostrand also worked on Harvey's short-lived [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] comics, as well as on such horror titles as ''Black Cat Mystery'', ''Chamber of Chills'', ''Tomb of Terror'' and ''Witches Tales''.<ref name=gcd/>\n\nSince EC comics were leading the way in the horror comics genre of the day, most publishers were advising their artists to adopt a similar style and in some cases outright art swipes from [[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales From the Crypt]] and other comics published under the Entertaining Comics banner. Nostrand did a flawless imitation of [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and in one case completely redrew a sequence by [[Wally Wood]] from EC's [[Two-Fisted Tales]] but changed the positioning and layout of every panel. Wood and other EC artists praised Nostrand's work and saw that he was talented enough not to do outright swipes, but only work influenced by other artists.\n\nWith the mid-1950s slump in comic books that followed the Senate hearings on [[juvenile delinquency]] and the creation of the [[Comics Code]]. Nostrand turned to commercial art. In a 1974 autobiographical magazine article, he recalled: \n{{quote|text=I was pretty well washed-up in comics. I did manage to scrounge a couple of jobs once in a while, but the handwriting was on the wall... I decided instead of becoming a famous cartoonist, I would become a famous illustrator. I started doing samples. This was a very bleak period in my life. After doing comics for five or six years, I found it difficult to adapt myself to working in new media.

He attended [[Brown University]] and subsequently went to work as an [[economist]] for the [[United States Department of State]]. In 1941 he joined the [[Red Cross]] and served in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during [[World War II]]. There he met director [[John Huston]] who recommended that he try [[Hollywood]] after the war. Instead, Dierkes went to work for the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] which coincidentally sent him to Hollywood to function as [[technical advisor]] for the film ''[[To the Ends of the Earth (1948 film)|To the Ends of the Earth]]'' (1948) and Orson Welles cast him as Ross in his version of ''[[Macbeth]]'' in the same year. Welles used Dierkes again in his ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). He married Cynthia Dierkes and they had two daughter and two sons.\n\nBecause of his appearance and very tall frame (6&nbsp;ft 6 in), Dierkes enjoyed a long career as a character actor, often portraying either villains or soldiers. One noteworthy performance cast Dierkes as the compassionate and caring scientist Dr. Chapman in the 1951 film ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' which remains a mainstay science fiction classic during the 1950s. His performance provided sanity and calm amid the tension and chills of the action thriller. Although playing against type, his low tone and measured monotone dialogue was a good counter to the rapid and chaotic overlapping dialogue throughout the movie, giving brief pauses between each actor's lines as the tension in each scene increased.  In 1951 played a soldier next to Audie Murphy in the classic film, ''Red'' ''Badge'' ''of'' ''Courage''. In the 1953 film ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', Dierkes portrays the callous Morgan Ryker with great effect, director George Stevens making good use of Dierkes' craggy features. Alongside his 'brother' Rufus (Emile Meyer) and Jack Wilson (Jack Palance) he makes up a trio of villainous characters who are despatched by the title character, Shane, in the final bar room shootout. One of his more memorable scenes is in the 1960 film, ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]''. Dierkes portrays a Tennessean named Jocko, who is torn between leaving before the attack to care for his blind wife, or staying to support the Texans' cause. Understanding that if Jocko stays to fight she will likely be widowed, Jocko's wife coaxes him to stay and defend the fort, despite her disability.\n\nHis other film credits included ''[[The Naked Jungle]]'' (1954), ''[[The Raid (1954 film)|The Raid]]'' (1954), ''[[Jubal (film)|Jubal]]'' (1956), ''[[The Daughter of Dr. Jekyll]]'' (1957), ''[[Blood Arrow]]'' (1958), ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'' (1958), ''[[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|The Buccaneer]]'' (1958), ''[[The Hanging Tree]]'' (1959), ''[[The Oregon Trail (1959 film)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1959), ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961), ''[[The Premature Burial (film)|The Premature Burial]]'' (1962), ''[[X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes]]'' (1963), ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'' (1963), ''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971) and ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'' (1972).\n\nDierkes died on January 8, 1975 from [[emphesyma]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{{Div col}}\n*''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'' (1948) - Ross\n*''[[Three Husbands]]'' (1950) - Night Court Judge (uncredited)\n*''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951) - Dr. Chapman (uncredited)\n*''[[The Red Badge of Courage (1951 film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]'' (1951) - Jim Conklin - the Tall Soldier\n*''[[Silver City (1951 film)|Silver City]]'' (1951) - Arnie\n*''[[The Sellout (film)|The Sellout]]'' (1952) - Big Jake (uncredited)\n*''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (1952 film)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'' (1952) - Bosun (uncredited)\n*''[[Plymouth Adventure]]'' (1952) - Greene (uncredited)\n*''[[A Perilous Journey]]'' (1953) - First Mate\n*''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953) - Morgan Ryker\n*''[[The Vanquished]]'' (1953) - General Morris\n*''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1953) - Batley\n*''[[The Moonlighter]]'' (1953) - Sheriff Daws\n*''[[Gun Fury]]'' (1953) - Sheepherder (uncredited)\n*''[[The Naked Jungle]]'' (1954) - Gruber\n*''[[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]]'' (1954) - Sir Tristram (uncredited)\n*''[[The Desperado]]'' (1954) - Police Sergeant\n*''[[Silver Lode (film)|Silver Lode]]'' (1954) - Blacksmith (uncredited)\n*''[[The Raid (1954 film)|The Raid]]'' (1954) - Cpl.

Part of the parking lot to the west across Laramie Avenue has been converted into a public park.\n\n==Past winners==\n\n=== ARCA Lincoln Welders Truck Series history ===\n{{main|Lincoln Welders 50}}\n*2001 [[Robbin Slaughter]]\n\n===CART Champ Car history===\n{{Main|Peak Antifreeze Indy 300}}\n\n===NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series history===\n{{main|Sears Craftsman 175}}\n*2000 [[Joe Ruttman]]\n*2001 [[Scott Riggs]]\n\n===Mid-American Stock Car Series===\n*1999 [[Mike Monroe (racing driver)|Mike Monroe]]\n*2000 [[Nate Clatfelter]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nascar.com/2009/news/opinion/07/09/retro.racing.maumann.chicago.motor.speedway/index.html Retro Racing article about Chicago Motor Speedway on NASCAR.com]\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks?id=201 NASCAR CTS track history at racing-reference.info]\n*[http://racing.ballparks.com/Chicago/index.htm Track statistics]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081103073700/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-sportsmans-31oct31,0,1842050.story Cicero racetrack will be razed to make way for mall]\n*[http://www.chicagoreader.com/TheBlog/archives/2009/01/08/so-long-sportsmans-good-riddance So Long Sportsmans - Good Riddance]\n\n\n{{Champ Car tracks}}\n{{NASCAR Truck Series racetracks}}\n{{ASA National Tour racetracks}}\n{{Atlantic Championship circuits}}\n{{Indy Lights racetracks}}\n{{Barber Pro Series tracks}}\n{{NASCAR Elite Division Midwest racetracks}}\n{{coord|41|49|50|N|87|44|55|W|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Champ Car circuits]]\n[[Category:NASCAR tracks]]\n[[Category:Cicero, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Defunct horse racing venues in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Defunct motorsport venues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Cook County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:1999 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:2003 disestablishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1999]]\n", "name_user": "Luks25", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Motor_Speedway"}

Mumbai and Pune will be closely monitored during this lockdown and rules will be strictly followed here.<ref>{{cite news| title=The lockdown has been extended to April 30 in Maharashtra| url=https://www.bhaskar.com/local/maharashtra/mumbai/news/coronavirus-maharashtra-cases-live-updates-covid-19-death-rise-signs-progress-in-mumbai-pune-ahmadnagar-nagpur-aurangabad-latur-yavatmal-nashik-jalgaon-latest-today-news-127149726.html| work=Dainik Bhaskar| access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Nationwide Lockdown Extension===\n\nOn 14 April 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the nation, announced that the nationwide Lockdown which was supposed to end on 14 April 2020 has now been extended to 3 May 2020.\n\n==Testing==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right; float:right; font-size:90%; width:auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Total samples tested\n| 36,771\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Positive\n| 1,761\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |Negative \n| 34,094\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | As of 11 April\n|}\nUntil mid-March, the state had three testing facilities, which also tested samples from some other states for confirmation, viz.
