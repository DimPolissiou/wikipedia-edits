{"title_page": "Hindu mythological wars", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n'''Ancient Hindu wars''' are the [[battle]]s described in the [[Hindu texts]] of ancient [[India]]. These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form. They and many Hindu heroes use ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' \u2013 celestial weapons with fearsome supernatural power \u2013 to aid them in battle.\n\n[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|375px|The Battle of Kurukshetra, fought between the [[Kaurava]]s and the [[Pandava]]s, recorded in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.]]\n\n==In Vedic literature==\n\n===Indra and Vritra===\nThe central battle in the ''Vedas'' is between [[Indra]] and [[Vritra]], and the defeat of the demon Vritra leads to the liberation of rivers, cattle and ''[[Ushas]]'' ([[dawn]]/light). While this battle does reinforce the timeless good v/s evil theme, close examination of various hymns and verses in the [[Rigveda]] suggest this might have been an allegorical account of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system.<ref>[http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/vrtra-myth-the-bharadvaja-version/ A record of the end of the last ice age in the Himalayan glacial system?]</ref>\n\nAnother important battle is the historic [[Battle of the Ten Kings]], alluded to in the [[Rigveda]], in which the [[Tritsu]] clan, led by [[Sudas]], defeat the [[Puru (Vedic tribe)|Puru]] confederation of ten [[Indo Aryan]] clans.<ref name=\"schmidt1980\">Schmidt, H.P.

Both races are technically equal, possessors of great religious and martial powers, but the Devas are committed to the worship of the [[Supreme Being]] and the practice of [[virtue]]. The Asuras have atheistic and devious tendencies that grow over time.

The king whose authority is contested must prove himself in battle or accept the imperial supremacy of the challenging king. When the horse returns safely after the period of time, the main sacrifice is performed, and the king, if successful in obtaining dominance over other kings, is crowned ''Emperor of the World''. The ''Ashwamedha'' allows the opportunity to maintain peace if the kings do not choose to contest the sacrificial horse. In the [[Mahabharata|Mahabharat]] era, [[Arjuna]] alone had conquered the whole world for the sake of ''Ashwamedha Yagya'' of his brother.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m14/m14085.htm|title=Digivijaya of Arjuna}}</ref>\n*''[[Rajasuya]]'': Considered the ultimate sacrifice, the king performing the sacrifice must openly challenge every king in the world to accept his supremacy or defeat him in battle. If and when the king returns successfully, having beaten all other known rulers, the performance of the sacrifice will send him to the abode of [[Indra]]. It was performed by king [[Yudhishthira]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' epic.

Rama was extremely powerful warrior and had knowledge of usage of many celestial astras. Rama single-handedly slayed the 14,000 demon hordes of [[Khara (Ramayana)|Khara]] (in one hour, according to the ''Ramayana''), the demons [[Maricha]] and [[Subahu]], Ravana's chief commander [[Prahasta]] and is responsible for the ultimate killing of [[Ravana]] himself.\n*[[Lakshmana]] : He was also very powerful like his brother. He was incarnation of Sheshnag. He controlled his sleep for 14 continuous years and slayed extremely powerful demons including [[Atikaya]] and [[Indrajit]].\n*[[Hanuman]] : He was son of Kesari and Anjana. He was one of the [[Rudras]] of Shiva. He was first trained by Sun god Surya and later Shiva himself mentored him. Later he became [[Vanara]] minister of [[Sugriva]]. He is the greatest devotee of [[Rama]], famous for his unerring service, absolute loyalty and great feats of courage. Hanuman is responsible for killing many demons, as well as burning the city of Lanka. His strength is given by his father [[Vayu]], and by virtue of the boons bestowed on him by various Gods, no astra & weapon could harm him. He can transform into any size & shape as he desired. He was also well expert in using celestial astras. He also possessed Mohini astra, Raudra astra etc. \n*[[Ravana]]: blessed by his fearsome 10,000 year [[tapasya]] to be the most powerful being on earth, invulnerable to every God, demon and living being, save man. Although an expert on the [[Vedas]], a great king, and a great devotee of [[Shiva]], he is the Emperor of evil due to his patronage of demons, murder of kings and humiliation of the Gods headed by Indra.\n*[[Indrajit]] : He was first-born son of mighty [[Ravana]]. Originally his name was Meghanada. He was master of illusion war techniques. He became the possessor of several supreme celestial weapons. Through penance, he obtained a boon from Brahma : he could be killed by a common man who could control his sleep for 12 years continuously. He defeated [[Indra]] and arrested him. Then Brahma appeared and asked him to free Indra. Meghanada did as Brahma directed and was then granted boon : he would never be killed in any battle, until his Yagna (fire-worship) of his native goddess Nikumbala was disturbed and destroyed. On the completion of the Yagna, a supreme celestial chariot would appear, boarding which, Indrajit would become unkilled in any battle. But Brahma also cautioned him that whosoever would destroy this yagna, would also kill him. He was killed by [[Lakshmana]].\n*[[Kumbhakarna]]: the gigantic brother of Ravana is a fearsome monster-demon who sleeps for six months at a stretch, rising for only one day and then returning to his slumber.

In the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]], he is called Paramatman or Parameshwara (the highest form of God), and is periodically reborn as an [[Avatar]] upon earth in order to destroy evil and bring deliverance to the pious.

The most martial Avatars include [[Matsya]], [[Kurma]], [[Varaha]], [[Narasimha]], [[Mohini]], [[Vamana]], [[Parshurama|Parshuram]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Kalki]]. He is also considered to be the first God, 'Adideva'. He is beyond birth, death, time. He is beyond all. In battle, the avatars of Vishnu are aided by a variety of ''[[Astra (weapon)|astra]]'' or celestial weapons. His two human avatars, Parashuram and Rama, were fearsome warriors and possessed many celestial weapons that accompany the past times of Vishnu. Krishna also used a few of these weapons in Mahabharata. These include:\n\n*''[[Kaumodaki]]'': The divine [[Gada (mace)|mace]] weapon of Vishnu; invincible and without parallel; Krishna slayed demon Dantavakra with it.\n*''Kodandam'': The bow of [[Rama]], 7th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Nandaka]]'': The sword of Vishnu\n*''[[Narayanastra]]'': Narayanastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Vaishnavastra. The personal missile weapon of Vishnu in his [[Narayana]] (Naraina) form, this ''astra'' lets loose a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower increases with resistance. The only solution is total submission before the missile; only then will it cease. The Narayanastra was first used by Rama in the ''Ramayana''. Then, thousands of years later, this astra was again used by [[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]] in the [[Kurukshetra War]] against the [[Pandava]] army.\n*''[[Parashu]]'': The axe of [[Parashurama]], 6th avatar of [[Vishnu]], given by [[Shiva]].\n*''[[Sharanga (Hindu mythology)|Sharanga]]'': The celestial bow of Vishnu. \n*''Sharkha'': The bow of [[Krishna]], 8th avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n*''[[Sudarshana Chakra]]'': The magical ''Chakra'', a spinning disc with sharp outer spears.

The Sudarshan flies at the command of Krishna, spinning away to tear off the heads of his opponents, or to perform any function desired by Vishnu. It was most famously used by [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n*''[[Vaishnavastra]]'': Vaishnavastra is the most powerful astra in the universe along with the Narayanastra. The personal missile weapon of [[Krishna]], once fired it cannot be thwarted by any means, save by the will of [[Vishnu]] himself.

These battles depicted great [[hero]]es, [[demon]]s, celestial weapons and [[supernatural]] beings. Major wars were fought with the aim of upholding the ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness that brought [[prosperity]] to [[human]]ity) over ''[[Adharma]]'' (wickedness that causes humanity to suffer). The purpose of the wars is often described as the removal of demonic beings or lords and rulers who pursued war with ambition (wicked wishes) and domination (for worldly pleasures). Hindu teachings prescribe war as the final option, to be employed only after all peaceful methods are exhausted. But, when this time comes, war is taught to be a matter of great personal and social importance, where every man who belongs to the warrior caste must do his duty, exemplifying courage, [[honor]], and fearsome prowess against all odds and even at the cost of his life.\n\nThe major Hindu gods, including [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]], often engage in war, either in the form of [[Avatars]] or in their true form.

A variety of racing, exhibition, and entertainment events are held at the raceway, ranging from [[superkart]]s to sports car racing to music festivals.

After the course was reconfigured, two artificial ponds were added.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:LagunaSecaMay08.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Laguna Seca Raceway from between Turns 1 and 2]]\n[[File:Mario Andretti 1991 Laguna Seca.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mario Andretti]] at Laguna Seca, 1991]]\n[[File:LagunaSecaOriginal.svg|thumb|right|The original layout]]\nThe earliest development of the local area occurred in 1867 with the founding of the nearby [[Laguna Seca Ranch]], which has operated continuously for 140 years with [[grazing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] uses.<ref>''Environmental Site Assessment: Laguna Seca Ranch'', Earth Metrics Inc., on file with the County of Monterey (1989)</ref>\n\nThe track was built in 1957 at a cost of $1.5 million raised from local businesses and individuals on part of the US Army's [[Fort Ord]] (a maneuver area and field artillery target range) after the nearby [[Pebble Beach Road Races]] were abandoned for being too dangerous. In 1974 the property was deeded over to the [[Monterey County]] Parks Department and continues to be part of the park system.\n\nThe first race, held on November 9, 1957, was won by [[Pete Lovely]] driving a [[Ferrari]]. In the intervening years, the track has hosted USRRC, [[Can-Am]], [[Trans-Am]], [[Formula 5000]], [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GT]], [[Champ Car|CART]], [[Indy Car]], [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Grand American]], [[Monterey Historic Automobile Races]], [[Speed World Challenge]], AMA ([[American Motorcyclist Association]]), WSBK [[Superbike World Championship]] and [[MotoGP]] motorcycle races (but 125/Moto3 and 250/Moto2 are not admitted).\n\nThe day-to-day operations of the track, along with the management and promotion of major racing events, are now handled by A&D Narigi Consulting, LLC. John V. Narigi is the General Manager and President. Until January 1, 2020, it was managed by the Sports Car Racing Association of the Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP), which is a non-profit organization. With oversight by a board of local residents, SCRAMP operates with a professional staff on-site with the goal of generating income through the operations of the racetrack which is then redistributed to local charities.\n\nThe track itself has undergone significant changes over the past two decades to meet evolving safety [[homologation]] requirements of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM), [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) and other sanctioning bodies. Changes include the addition of the entire infield area in 1988 (present day turns 3, 4, and 5, eliminating the straight that started at present day turn 2 and ended at present day turn 5) extending the track from its original {{convert|1.9|mi|km|adj=on}} length to meet the minimum-track-length criteria of the FIM for MotoGP events, plus the more recent relocation of [[pedestrian]] bridges and [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]], and the expansion of [[gravel]] pits outside turns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 for additional runoff. The original media center was demolished in 2006 to make way for additional run-off room in Turn 1. Also in 2006, the 'hump' at the top of the Rahal Straight was flattened to accommodate the MotoGP riders, though some claim that this increases the wind effects that can perturb a race motorcycle. Remnants of the old configuration can still be seen from the parking lot between turns two and five. They are found underneath a road leading to the parking area for entrant trailers and RVs.\n[[Image:CORKSCREW.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The \"Corkscrew\" at Turn 8, with gradient up to 16%]]\n[[Image:Horag Corkscrew.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A view of the \"Corkscrew\" from the bottom]]\n{{anchor|Corkscrew}}\nThe famous Turn 8 and 8A combination, popularly referred to as 'the Corkscrew', is considered one of the motorsport world's most challenging turns,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} due to the 18-metre drop in elevation as well as its blind crest and apex on the uphill approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode&q=Mazda+Raceway+Laguna+Seca&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=34.861942,86.308594&ie=UTF8&ll=36.584244,-121.748887&spn=0,359.997366&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=36.584343,-121.748854&panoid=udrYf4y2Ja8H454cVpYO2w&cbp=12,1.5996056991563416,,0,5|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Andretti Hairpin}}\nTurn 2, with its difficult and technical double-apex, has been renamed the 'Andretti Hairpin', in honor of former Formula 1 World Champion [[Mario Andretti]], while Turn 9 has been renamed 'Rainey Curve' in honor of 500cc [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] World Champion [[Wayne Rainey]], a resident of nearby [[Salinas, California]]. Also the straight that runs between Turn 6 and Turn 7 has been renamed the 'Rahal Straight' after four-time consecutive Champ Car race winner [[Bobby Rahal]].\n\nA [[Champ Car]] World Series weekend had been a prominent event from 1983 through 2004, when its spot on the calendar was shifted to the [[San Jose Grand Prix]]. On the last lap of the 1996 CART race, [[Alex Zanardi]] passed [[Bryan Herta]] on the inside of the Corkscrew to take the victory. Uruguayan driver [[Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez]] died during the practice session of the 1999 CART race after crashing at the same corner. Because of the incident, runoff was installed at the end of the Rahal Straight.\n\nChamp Car announced on September 11, 2007 that they would be returning the Northern California race to Laguna Seca from San Jose over the May 16\u201318 weekend in 2008.<ref>[http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=12226 Champ Car > News Tuesday, September 11, 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916032348/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=12226 |date=September 16, 2007 }}</ref>  But the subsequent merger of Champ Car and [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] resulted in the race being canceled.  On Jul 17, 2018 [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] announced a return of IndyCars to Laguna Seca, with the event to be held the weekend of Sept. 20-22, 2019.\n\nThe track is also the site of the annual [[Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion]], formerly known as the Monterey Historic Automobile Races. The event features an extraordinarily eclectic mixture of race cars on the course. Each year features a different marque.  Considered one of the two greatest historic racing events (along with the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed|Goodwood Festival]] in England), attendance often rivals, or surpasses the professional racing events listed above.\n\nThere are many permanent dry and hook-up [[camping]] facilities located at the raceway, which are available year-round as part of the Laguna Seca Recreation Area, the county park in which the racetrack is set.\n\nThe track's primary corporate sponsor is [[WeatherTech]] which began April 2018. As part of the sponsorship, the track is now officially referred to as WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. Previously, the sponsorship belonged to [[Mazda]] for 17 years with the track being known as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.\n\nA study by [[California State University, Monterey Bay]] and commissioned by SCRAMP states that the raceway generates $62.1 million to the [[Monterey County]] economy and $5.2 million in state and local taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=CSUMB Economic Study: Mazda Raceway Contributed $62M To Monterey County In 2015|url=http://www.mazdaraceway.com/homepage-middle-pod/csumb-economic-study-mazda-raceway-contributed-62m-monterey-county-2015|publisher=Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Racing ==\nMajor events each year include the US round of the [[World Superbike Championship]] (held in conjunction with a round of the [[MotoAmerica]] championship), [[Monterey Sports Car Championships]] ([[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]), and the Monterey Historics for classic racecars.\n\n===Formula One===\nIn 1989, the year following the last [[Detroit Grand Prix|Formula One race in Detroit]], choices for a new location for the [[United States Grand Prix]] came down to Laguna Seca and [[Phoenix street circuit|Phoenix]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Formula One at Laguna?

During the trials, Clarkson determined that the game omitted a few details of the track, and the game's physics allowed him to brake later when coming into turns than he could in real life.  As a consequence, reality prevailed and he managed a best time of only 1:57 on the real course.<ref>Top Gear, Season 7, Episode 6 2005.12.27</ref>  However, both he and the track instructor agreed that it is possible to complete the course in 1:41 in a Honda NSX if the driver were sufficiently experienced, talented, and most importantly fearless.\n\nIt was also used in 1975 for the film ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' as a qualifying track.\n\n===Other non-automotive events===\nLaguna Seca and the part of the old [[Fort Ord]] that is now [[Bureau of Land Management]] land annually host the [[Sea Otter Classic]] \"Celebration of Cycling\".

'''Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca''') is a paved [[Racing track#Motorsport|road racing track]] in [[central California]] used for both [[auto racing]] and [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racing]], built in 1957 near both [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] and [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]], United States.\n\nThe racetrack is {{convert|2.238|mi|km}} long, with a {{convert|180|ft|m}} elevation change.<ref>[http://www.modified.com/roadtests/modp-1110-mazda-raceway-laguna-seca/index.html Modified.com - Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca - Track Review]</ref><ref>[http://image.modified.com/f/34973662/modp-1110-03+mazda-raceway-laguna-seca+track-map.jpg Detailed course map by Whitson Engineers]</ref> Its eleven turns are highlighted by the circuit's signature turn, the downhill-plunging \"Corkscrew\" at Turns 8 and 8A. A variety of racing, exhibition, and entertainment events are held at the raceway, ranging from [[superkart]]s to sports car racing to music festivals. Laguna Seca is classified as an [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[List of motor racing circuits by FIA Grade#Grade Two|Grade Two]] circuit.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.fia.com/file/70006/download?token=hDk9-FSg|title=List of FIA licensed circuits|date=December 14, 2018|publisher=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile|access-date=September 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe name Laguna Seca is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"dry lagoon\":  the area where the track now lies was once a lake, and the course was built around the dry lake bed. After the course was reconfigured, two artificial ponds were added.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:LagunaSecaMay08.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Laguna Seca Raceway from between Turns 1 and 2]]\n[[File:Mario Andretti 1991 Laguna Seca.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mario Andretti]] at Laguna Seca, 1991]]\n[[File:LagunaSecaOriginal.svg|thumb|right|The original layout]]\nThe earliest development of the local area occurred in 1867 with the founding of the nearby [[Laguna Seca Ranch]], which has operated continuously for 140 years with [[grazing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] uses.<ref>''Environmental Site Assessment: Laguna Seca Ranch'', Earth Metrics Inc., on file with the County of Monterey (1989)</ref>\n\nThe track was built in 1957 at a cost of $1.5 million raised from local businesses and individuals on part of the US Army's [[Fort Ord]] (a maneuver area and field artillery target range) after the nearby [[Pebble Beach Road Races]] were abandoned for being too dangerous. In 1974 the property was deeded over to the [[Monterey County]] Parks Department and continues to be part of the park system.\n\nThe first race, held on November 9, 1957, was won by [[Pete Lovely]] driving a [[Ferrari]]. In the intervening years, the track has hosted USRRC, [[Can-Am]], [[Trans-Am]], [[Formula 5000]], [[IMSA GT Championship|IMSA GT]], [[Champ Car|CART]], [[Indy Car]], [[American Le Mans Series]], [[Grand American]], [[Monterey Historic Automobile Races]], [[Speed World Challenge]], AMA ([[American Motorcyclist Association]]), WSBK [[Superbike World Championship]] and [[MotoGP]] motorcycle races (but 125/Moto3 and 250/Moto2 are not admitted).\n\nThe day-to-day operations of the track, along with the management and promotion of major racing events, are now handled by A&D Narigi Consulting, LLC. John V. Narigi is the General Manager and President. Until January 1, 2020, it was managed by the Sports Car Racing Association of the Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP), which is a non-profit organization. With oversight by a board of local residents, SCRAMP operates with a professional staff on-site with the goal of generating income through the operations of the racetrack which is then redistributed to local charities.\n\nThe track itself has undergone significant changes over the past two decades to meet evolving safety [[homologation]] requirements of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Motocyclisme]] (FIM), [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) and other sanctioning bodies. Changes include the addition of the entire infield area in 1988 (present day turns 3, 4, and 5, eliminating the straight that started at present day turn 2 and ended at present day turn 5) extending the track from its original {{convert|1.9|mi|km|adj=on}} length to meet the minimum-track-length criteria of the FIM for MotoGP events, plus the more recent relocation of [[pedestrian]] bridges and [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]], and the expansion of [[gravel]] pits outside turns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 for additional runoff. The original media center was demolished in 2006 to make way for additional run-off room in Turn 1. Also in 2006, the 'hump' at the top of the Rahal Straight was flattened to accommodate the MotoGP riders, though some claim that this increases the wind effects that can perturb a race motorcycle. Remnants of the old configuration can still be seen from the parking lot between turns two and five. They are found underneath a road leading to the parking area for entrant trailers and RVs.\n[[Image:CORKSCREW.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The \"Corkscrew\" at Turn 8, with gradient up to 16%]]\n[[Image:Horag Corkscrew.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A view of the \"Corkscrew\" from the bottom]]\n{{anchor|Corkscrew}}\nThe famous Turn 8 and 8A combination, popularly referred to as 'the Corkscrew', is considered one of the motorsport world's most challenging turns,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} due to the 18-metre drop in elevation as well as its blind crest and apex on the uphill approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode&q=Mazda+Raceway+Laguna+Seca&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=34.861942,86.308594&ie=UTF8&ll=36.584244,-121.748887&spn=0,359.997366&t=h&z=19&layer=c&cbll=36.584343,-121.748854&panoid=udrYf4y2Ja8H454cVpYO2w&cbp=12,1.5996056991563416,,0,5|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Andretti Hairpin}}\nTurn 2, with its difficult and technical double-apex, has been renamed the 'Andretti Hairpin', in honor of former Formula 1 World Champion [[Mario Andretti]], while Turn 9 has been renamed 'Rainey Curve' in honor of 500cc [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] World Champion [[Wayne Rainey]], a resident of nearby [[Salinas, California]]. Also the straight that runs between Turn 6 and Turn 7 has been renamed the 'Rahal Straight' after four-time consecutive Champ Car race winner [[Bobby Rahal]].\n\nA [[Champ Car]] World Series weekend had been a prominent event from 1983 through 2004, when its spot on the calendar was shifted to the [[San Jose Grand Prix]]. On the last lap of the 1996 CART race, [[Alex Zanardi]] passed [[Bryan Herta]] on the inside of the Corkscrew to take the victory. Uruguayan driver [[Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez]] died during the practice session of the 1999 CART race after crashing at the same corner. Because of the incident, runoff was installed at the end of the Rahal Straight.\n\nChamp Car announced on September 11, 2007 that they would be returning the Northern California race to Laguna Seca from San Jose over the May 16\u201318 weekend in 2008.<ref>[http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=12226 Champ Car > News Tuesday, September 11, 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916032348/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=12226 |date=September 16, 2007 }}</ref>  But the subsequent merger of Champ Car and [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] resulted in the race being canceled.  On Jul 17, 2018 [[Indy Racing League|IndyCar]] announced a return of IndyCars to Laguna Seca, with the event to be held the weekend of Sept. 20-22, 2019.\n\nThe track is also the site of the annual [[Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion]], formerly known as the Monterey Historic Automobile Races. The event features an extraordinarily eclectic mixture of race cars on the course. Each year features a different marque.  Considered one of the two greatest historic racing events (along with the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed|Goodwood Festival]] in England), attendance often rivals, or surpasses the professional racing events listed above.\n\nThere are many permanent dry and hook-up [[camping]] facilities located at the raceway, which are available year-round as part of the Laguna Seca Recreation Area, the county park in which the racetrack is set.\n\nThe track's primary corporate sponsor is [[WeatherTech]] which began April 2018. As part of the sponsorship, the track is now officially referred to as WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. Previously, the sponsorship belonged to [[Mazda]] for 17 years with the track being known as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.\n\nA study by [[California State University, Monterey Bay]] and commissioned by SCRAMP states that the raceway generates $62.1 million to the [[Monterey County]] economy and $5.2 million in state and local taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=CSUMB Economic Study: Mazda Raceway Contributed $62M To Monterey County In 2015|url=http://www.mazdaraceway.com/homepage-middle-pod/csumb-economic-study-mazda-raceway-contributed-62m-monterey-county-2015|publisher=Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Racing ==\nMajor events each year include the US round of the [[World Superbike Championship]] (held in conjunction with a round of the [[MotoAmerica]] championship), [[Monterey Sports Car Championships]] ([[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]]), and the Monterey Historics for classic racecars.\n\n===Formula One===\nIn 1989, the year following the last [[Detroit Grand Prix|Formula One race in Detroit]], choices for a new location for the [[United States Grand Prix]] came down to Laguna Seca and [[Phoenix street circuit|Phoenix]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Formula One at Laguna?

Approximately twice a year the [[Sports Car Club of America]] holds regional club races for the San Francisco Region.  Various clubs rent the track throughout the year for informal high performance driving schools that allow the public to drive their own cars at speed. The raceway has also played host to prototype testing of the [[Nissan GT-R]] in 2007.<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=119632 2009 Nissan Skyline GT-R conquers the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609025115/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/GeneralFuture/articleId=119632 |date=2008-06-09 }} By Ed Hellwig '''Edmunds Inside Line''' 2/16/2007.</ref>\n\nThe track is featured in [[video game]]s such as the [[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]] series (including the bike version [[Tourist Trophy (video game)|Tourist Trophy]]), [[Forza Motorsport]], and the [[MotoGP '07|MotoGP]] series.  In a bid to compare real life versus video games, [[Jeremy Clarkson]] of the British automotive show ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' attempted to beat his [[Gran Turismo 4|Gran Turismo]] time of 1:41.148 in a [[Honda NSX]] by racing the real track in the same car in 2005.  During the trials, Clarkson determined that the game omitted a few details of the track, and the game's physics allowed him to brake later when coming into turns than he could in real life.  As a consequence, reality prevailed and he managed a best time of only 1:57 on the real course.<ref>Top Gear, Season 7, Episode 6 2005.12.27</ref>  However, both he and the track instructor agreed that it is possible to complete the course in 1:41 in a Honda NSX if the driver were sufficiently experienced, talented, and most importantly fearless.\n\nIt was also used in 1975 for the film ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' as a qualifying track.\n\n===Other non-automotive events===\nLaguna Seca and the part of the old [[Fort Ord]] that is now [[Bureau of Land Management]] land annually host the [[Sea Otter Classic]] \"Celebration of Cycling\".

The admission fee is $10 per bicycle rider.\n\nLaguna Seca served as the finish line for Stage 4 of the [[2016 Tour of California|2016 Amgen Tour of California]] and\nStage 3 of the [[2018 Tour of California|2018 Amgen Tour of California]] bicycle races.\n\nThe raceway has been occasionally as a venue for concerts and other non-sporting events.

Her mother, [[Charlotte Hennessey]], was of [[Irish Catholic]] descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, [[Lottie Pickford|Charlotte, called \"Lottie\"]] (born 1893), and [[Jack Pickford|John Charles, called \"Jack\"]] (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband's relatives, Pickford's mother baptized her children as Methodists, the religion of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a [[purser]] with Niagara Steamship.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nWhen Gladys was four years old, her household was under infectious quarantine as a public health measure.

Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer [[Chauncey Olcott]] on Broadway in ''[[Edmund Burke]]''.<ref>''Pictorial History of the American Theatre 1860\u20131985'' by Daniel C. Blum, c. 1985</ref> Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (play)|The Warrens of Virginia]]''. The play was written by [[William C. deMille]], whose brother, [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil]], appeared in the cast. [[David Belasco]], the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.<ref name=\"filmbug\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Filmbug.|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342424|publisher=Filmbug|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref> After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\n\nOn April 19, 1909, the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] director [[D. W. Griffith]] screen-tested her at the company's New York studio for a role in the [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] film ''[[Pippa Passes (1909 film)|Pippa Passes]]''. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford's single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week.<ref>Mary Pickford, ''Sunshine and Shadow'', Doubleday & Co., 1955, p. 10.</ref>\n\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, [[Ing\u00e9nue|ingenues]], [[Charwoman|charwomen]], spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph:<blockquote>I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, and there would be a demand for my work.</blockquote> She appeared in 51 films in 1909 \u2013 almost one a week. While at Biograph, she suggested to [[Florence La Badie]] to \"try pictures\", invited her to the studio and later introduced her to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie's career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://11east14thstreet.com/2013/08/02/florence-la-badie-becoming/|title=FLORENCE LA BADIE, BECOMING|last=Zonarich|first=Gene|date=2013-08-03|website=11 East 14th Street|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the [[East Coast of the United States|East]]. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (''Sweet and Twenty'', ''They Would Elope,'' and ''To Save Her Soul'', to name a few) with films made in California.\n\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith's company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors, in turn, capitalized on her popularity by advertising on [[sandwich board]]s that a film featuring \"The Girl with the Golden Curls\", \"Blondilocks\", or \"The [[Biograph Girl]]\" was inside.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Golden Silents.|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/marypickford.html|publisher=Golden Silents.com|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at [[Carl Laemmle]]'s [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Moving Pictures Company]] (IMP). IMP was absorbed into [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as ''Friends'', ''The Mender of Nets'', ''Just Like a Woman'', and ''[[The Female of the Species (1912 film)|The Female of the Species]]''. That year, Pickford also introduced [[Dorothy Gish|Dorothy]] and [[Lillian Gish]]\u2013 whom she had befriended as new neighbors from Ohio<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Affron |title=Lillian Gish: her legend, her life |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X44SqEVU2r4C&pg=PA19 |publisher=University of California Press |date=March 12, 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23434-5 |pages=19\u201320}}</ref> \u2013to Griffith,<ref name=\"Whitfield\">Whitfield, Eileen: ''Pickford: the Woman Who Made Hollywood'' (1997), pp. 8, 25, 28, 115, 125, 126, 131, 300, 376.

Pickford made her last Biograph picture, ''[[The New York Hat]]'', in late 1912.\n\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of ''[[A Good Little Devil]]'' (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, [[Adolph Zukor]] had formed [[Famous Players Film Company|Famous Players in Famous Plays]]. It was later known as [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and then [[Paramount Pictures]], one of the first American feature film companies.\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford with camera2.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor's roster of stars. Zukor believed film's potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of ''A Good Little Devil''. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called \"one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\n\nPickford's work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as ''[[In the Bishop's Carriage]]'' (1913), ''[[Caprice (1913 film)|Caprice]]'' (1913), and especially ''[[Hearts Adrift]]'' (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. ''Hearts Adrift'' was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews.<ref name=\"Kevin Brownlow\">{{cite book|last1=Brownlow|first1=Kevin|title=Mary Pickford Rediscovered|date=May 1, 1999|publisher=Harry N.

Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, \"the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== Stardom ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford-Ziegfeld.jpg|right|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1920]]\n\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career.

Pickford's fans were devoted to these \"little girl\" roles, but they were not typical of her career.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Due to her lack of a normal childhood, she enjoyed making these pictures. Given how small she was at under five feet, and her naturalistic acting abilities, she was very successful in these roles. [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], when he first met her in person as a boy, assumed she was a new playmate for him, and asked her to come and play trains with him, which she obligingly did.<ref>Clip of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. describing this incident. ''Mary Pickford: Muse of the Movies'', 2008. Documentary.</ref>\n\nIn August 1918, Pickford's contract expired and, when refusing Zukor's terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to [[First National Pictures]], which agreed to her terms.<ref>''The New York Times'', October 29, 1925<!-- page?? --></ref> In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]], formed the independent film production company [[United Artists]]. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford's film ''[[Pollyanna (1920 film)|Pollyanna]]'' grossed around $1,100,000.<ref name=\"OP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/timeline/timeline2.html|title=Timeline: Mary Pickford|work=American Experience|publisher=PBS|date=July 23, 2004|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}</ref> The following year, Pickford's film ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' was also a success, and in 1923, ''[[Rosita (film)|Rosita]]'' grossed over $1,000,000 as well.<ref name=\"OP\" /> During this period, she also made [[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|''Little Annie Rooney'']] (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, ''[[Sparrows (1926 film)|Sparrows]]'' (1926), which blended the [[Dickensian]] with newly minted [[German expressionism|German expressionist]] style, and ''[[My Best Girl (1927 film)|My Best Girl]]'' (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband [[Buddy Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]].\n\n[[File:MaryPickford4.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Movie poster#Lobby cards|lobby card]] for ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1921)]]\n\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that \"adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the [[Venus de Milo]]\".<ref name=\"OP\" />\n\nShe played a reckless socialite in ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]'' (1929), a role for which her famous [[Ringlet (haircut)|ringlets]] were cut into a 1920s' [[bob cut|bob]]. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother's death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/e_fans.html People & Events: Mary Pickford, ''Fan Culture''], PBS.org; accessed December 4, 2015.</ref> Pickford's hair had become a symbol of female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other papers.

Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as [[Sound film|talkies]] became more popular among audiences.<ref name=\"mdecline\" />\n\nHer next film, ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)|The Taming of The Shrew]]'', made with husband [[Douglas Fairbanks]], was not well received at the box office.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_fairbanks.html \"Douglas Fairbanks profile\"], pbs.org; accessed May 19, 2014.</ref> Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies. On March 29, 1928, ''The Dodge Brothers Hour'' was broadcast from Pickford's bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[John Barrymore]], [[D.W. Griffith]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], among others.

In 1933, she underwent a [[Technicolor]] screen test for an animated/live action film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', but [[Walt Disney]] discarded the project when [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor [[Film still|still]]<!-- or is this [[still frame]]? --> of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including ''[[Sleep, My Love]]'' (1948; with [[Claudette Colbert]]) and ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1949), with the [[Marx Brothers]]).<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== The film industry ===\n[[File:MaryPickfordHoover.gif|right|thumb|Mary Pickford giving President [[Herbert Hoover]] a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931]]\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, she proved to be a strong businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities |last=McDonald |first=Paul |publisher=Wallflower |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-903364-02-4 |location=London |page=33}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]] she promoted the sale of [[Liberty Bond]]s, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches, beginning in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Theda Bara]], and [[Marie Dressler]]. Five days later she spoke on [[Wall Street]] to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of [[Americana]], kissing the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars' worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy's official \"Little Sister\"; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n[[File:Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921]]\n\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the [[Motion Picture & Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]], an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with [[Joseph Schenck]] voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the \"Payroll Pledge Program\", a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House and Hospital]], in [[Woodland Hills, California]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, \"she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project\". She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor's Famous Players in Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio's choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford's films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford's motion-picture production company.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford signing the entrance to the Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow, 1943]]\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding [[United Artists]] (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA's creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded.<ref name=\"mdecline\" /> After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.<ref name=\"ushistory\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford biography|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3890.html|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Mary Pickford portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Pickford, 1921]]\nPickford was a hoe. She married [[Owen Moore]], an Irish-born silent pimp, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by unknown pimp in the early 1910s and had a [[miscarriage]] or an [[abortion]]. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> The couple's marriage was strained by Moore's alcoholism, insecurity about having a gay dad as a drag queen, and bouts of [[domestic violence]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The couple lived together on-and-off for several years.<ref>Peggy Dymond Leavey, ''Mary Pickford: Canada's Silent Siren, America's Sweetheart''.

They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple's triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\n\n''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as \"Hollywood royalty\". Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the [[White House]] often asked if they could also visit [[Pickfair]], the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills.<ref name=\"filmbug\" />\n\nDinners at Pickfair became celebrity events.

The public nature of Pickford's second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America's unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks' restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks' romance with [[Sylvia Ashley|Sylvia, Lady Ashley]] became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks' son by his first wife, [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader [[Charles 'Buddy' Rogers|Buddy Rogers]]. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). A PBS ''[[American Experience]]'' documentary described Pickford's relationship with her children as tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love. In 2003, Ronnie recalled that \"Things didn't work out that much, you know. But I'll never forget her. I think that she was a good woman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_rogers.html|title=Buddy Rogers, Mary Pickford and Their Children|accessdate=August 26, 2007|publisher=American Experience}}</ref>\n\n=== Later years and death ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford 1934.JPG|thumb|right|Mary Pickford in ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934), her only film appearance in Technicolor]]\nAfter retiring from the screen, Pickford became an alcoholic, as her father had been. Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her adopted children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from [[Lillian Gish]], her stepson [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station [[WSJS-TV]]. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied: \"I'm 21, going on 20.\"<ref>\"Mary Pickford \"Going On 20\" (Or Is It 66?)\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', April 11, 1959, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. [[Charles Buddy Rogers|Buddy Rogers]] often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=\"ushistory\" /> In addition to her Oscar as best actress for ''Coquette'' (1929), Mary Pickford received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks \u2013 offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor.<ref>{{cite AV media | title = The 48th Annual Academy Awards | date = March 29, 1976 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vXhqrbSeOE}}</ref>\n\nPickford believed that she had ceased to be a [[British subject]] when she married an American citizen upon her marriage to Fairbanks in 1920.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=April 30, 1949|title=Mary Pickford Files TV Bid |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |page=14|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Thus, she never acquired Canadian citizenship when it was first created in 1947. However, Pickford held and traveled under a British/Canadian passport which she renewed regularly at the British/Canadian consulates in Los Angeles, and she did not take out papers for American citizenship. She also owned a house in Toronto, Canada. Toward the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Canadian Department of Citizenship to officially acquire Canadian citizenship because she wished to \"die as a Canadian\". Canadian authorities were not sure that she had ever lost her Canadian citizenship, given her passport status, but her request was approved and she officially became a Canadian citizen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John Robert|title=Fascinating Canada: A Book of Questions and Answers|year=2011|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55488-923-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20 20]|url=https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkANAAAAIBAJ&pg=2767,848052&dq=mary+pickford+citizenship&hl=en|title=City, fans honor Mary Pickford|date=May 18, 1983|work=The Leader-Post|pages=D\u20138|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford Tomb.JPG|thumb|The tomb of actress Mary Pickford in the Garden of Memory, Forest Lawn Glendale]]\nOn May 29, 1979, Pickford died at a [[Santa Monica, California]], hospital of complications from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] she had suffered the week before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124175355/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 24, 2013|title=Mary Pickford Is Dead at 86|date=May 30, 1979|work=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> She was interred in the Garden of Memory of the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] cemetery in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], California.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n\n* Pickford was awarded a star in the category of motion pictures on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6280 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/mary-pickford|title=Mary Pickford \u2013 Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Her handprints and footprints are displayed at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood, California.\n* The [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]] at 1313 Vine Street in Hollywood, constructed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, opened in 1948 as a radio and television studio facility.\n* The [[Mary Pickford Theater]] at the [[James Madison Memorial Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]] is named in her honor.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n* The Mary Pickford Auditorium at [[Claremont McKenna College]] is named in her honor.\n* In 1948, Mary Pickford built a 7 bedrooms, 8 bathroom, and 6,050 square foot estate on 2.12 acres at the [[B Bar H Ranch, California]] where she lived and then later sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.estately.com/listings/info/19120-bubbling-wells-road--14|title=19120 Bubbling Wells Road|publisher=}}</ref>\n* A first-run movie theatre in [[Cathedral City, California]] is called The Mary Pickford Theatre, which was established on May 25, 2001.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Iannucci|first1=Lisa|title=On Location: A Film and TV Lover's Travel Guide|date=March 1, 2018|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-1-4930-3085-9|page=28|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_QNBDwAAQBAJ}}</ref> The theater is a grand one with several screens and is built in the shape of a Spanish Cathedral, complete with bell tower and three-story lobby.

Her mother, [[Charlotte Hennessey]], was of [[Irish Catholic]] descent and worked for a time as a seamstress. She had two younger siblings, [[Lottie Pickford|Charlotte, called \"Lottie\"]] (born 1893), and [[Jack Pickford|John Charles, called \"Jack\"]] (born 1896), who also became actors. To please her husband's relatives, Pickford's mother baptized her children as Methodists, the religion of their father. John Charles Smith was an alcoholic; he abandoned the family and died on February 11, 1898, from a fatal blood clot caused by a workplace accident when he was a [[purser]] with Niagara Steamship.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nWhen Gladys was four years old, her household was under infectious quarantine as a public health measure.

Gladys, her mother and two younger siblings toured the United States by rail, performing in third-rate companies and plays. After six impoverished years, Pickford allowed one more summer to land a leading role on Broadway, planning to quit acting if she failed. In 1906 Gladys, Lottie and Jack Smith supported singer [[Chauncey Olcott]] on Broadway in ''[[Edmund Burke]]''.<ref>''Pictorial History of the American Theatre 1860\u20131985'' by Daniel C. Blum, c. 1985</ref> Gladys finally landed a supporting role in a 1907 Broadway play, ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (play)|The Warrens of Virginia]]''. The play was written by [[William C. deMille]], whose brother, [[Cecil B. DeMille|Cecil]], appeared in the cast. [[David Belasco]], the producer of the play, insisted that Gladys Smith assume the stage name Mary Pickford.<ref name=\"filmbug\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Filmbug.|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342424|publisher=Filmbug|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref> After completing the Broadway run and touring the play, however, Pickford was again out of work.\n\nOn April 19, 1909, the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Company]] director [[D. W. Griffith]] screen-tested her at the company's New York studio for a role in the [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] film ''[[Pippa Passes (1909 film)|Pippa Passes]]''. The role went to someone else but Griffith was immediately taken with Pickford. She quickly grasped that movie acting was simpler than the stylized stage acting of the day. Most Biograph actors earned $5 a day but, after Pickford's single day in the studio, Griffith agreed to pay her $10 a day against a guarantee of $40 a week.<ref>Mary Pickford, ''Sunshine and Shadow'', Doubleday & Co., 1955, p. 10.</ref>\n\nPickford, like all actors at Biograph, played both bit parts and leading roles, including mothers, [[Ing\u00e9nue|ingenues]], [[Charwoman|charwomen]], spitfires, slaves, Native Americans, spurned women, and a prostitute. As Pickford said of her success at Biograph:<blockquote>I played scrubwomen and secretaries and women of all nationalities ... I decided that if I could get into as many pictures as possible, I'd become known, and there would be a demand for my work.</blockquote> She appeared in 51 films in 1909 \u2013 almost one a week. While at Biograph, she suggested to [[Florence La Badie]] to \"try pictures\", invited her to the studio and later introduced her to D. W. Griffith, who launched La Badie's career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://11east14thstreet.com/2013/08/02/florence-la-badie-becoming/|title=FLORENCE LA BADIE, BECOMING|last=Zonarich|first=Gene|date=2013-08-03|website=11 East 14th Street|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1910, Pickford traveled with a Biograph crew to Los Angeles. Many other film companies wintered on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], escaping the weak light and short days that hampered winter shooting in the [[East Coast of the United States|East]]. Pickford added to her 1909 Biographs (''Sweet and Twenty'', ''They Would Elope,'' and ''To Save Her Soul'', to name a few) with films made in California.\n\nActors were not listed in the credits in Griffith's company. Audiences noticed and identified Pickford within weeks of her first film appearance. Exhibitors, in turn, capitalized on her popularity by advertising on [[sandwich board]]s that a film featuring \"The Girl with the Golden Curls\", \"Blondilocks\", or \"The [[Biograph Girl]]\" was inside.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford at Golden Silents.|url=http://www.goldensilents.com/stars/marypickford.html|publisher=Golden Silents.com|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>\n\nPickford left Biograph in December 1910. The following year, she starred in films at [[Carl Laemmle]]'s [[Independent Moving Pictures|Independent Moving Pictures Company]] (IMP). IMP was absorbed into [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford returned to work with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as ''Friends'', ''The Mender of Nets'', ''Just Like a Woman'', and ''[[The Female of the Species (1912 film)|The Female of the Species]]''. That year, Pickford also introduced [[Dorothy Gish|Dorothy]] and [[Lillian Gish]]\u2013 whom she had befriended as new neighbors from Ohio<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Affron |title=Lillian Gish: her legend, her life |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X44SqEVU2r4C&pg=PA19 |publisher=University of California Press |date=March 12, 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23434-5 |pages=19\u201320}}</ref> \u2013to Griffith,<ref name=\"Whitfield\">Whitfield, Eileen: ''Pickford: the Woman Who Made Hollywood'' (1997), pp. 8, 25, 28, 115, 125, 126, 131, 300, 376.

Pickford made her last Biograph picture, ''[[The New York Hat]]'', in late 1912.\n\nShe returned to Broadway in the David Belasco production of ''[[A Good Little Devil]]'' (1912). This was a major turning point in her career. Pickford, who had always hoped to conquer the Broadway stage, discovered how deeply she missed film acting. In 1913, she decided to work exclusively in film. The previous year, [[Adolph Zukor]] had formed [[Famous Players Film Company|Famous Players in Famous Plays]]. It was later known as [[Famous Players-Lasky]] and then [[Paramount Pictures]], one of the first American feature film companies.\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford with camera2.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1916]]\nPickford left the stage to join Zukor's roster of stars. Zukor believed film's potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of ''A Good Little Devil''. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called \"one of the worst [features] I ever made ... it was deadly\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.\n\nPickford's work in material written for the camera by that time had attracted a strong following. Comedy-dramas, such as ''[[In the Bishop's Carriage]]'' (1913), ''[[Caprice (1913 film)|Caprice]]'' (1913), and especially ''[[Hearts Adrift]]'' (1914), made her irresistible to moviegoers. ''Hearts Adrift'' was so popular that Pickford asked for the first of her many publicized pay raises based on the profits and reviews.<ref name=\"Kevin Brownlow\">{{cite book|last1=Brownlow|first1=Kevin|title=Mary Pickford Rediscovered|date=May 1, 1999|publisher=Harry N.

Each enjoyed a level of fame far exceeding that of other actors. Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, Pickford was believed to be the most famous woman in the world, or, as a silent-film journalist described her, \"the best known woman who has ever lived, the woman who was known to more people and loved by more people than any other woman that has been in all history\".<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== Stardom ===\n[[File:Mary Pickford-Ziegfeld.jpg|right|thumb|Mary Pickford, 1920]]\n\nPickford starred in 52 features throughout her career.

Pickford's fans were devoted to these \"little girl\" roles, but they were not typical of her career.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> Due to her lack of a normal childhood, she enjoyed making these pictures. Given how small she was at under five feet, and her naturalistic acting abilities, she was very successful in these roles. [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], when he first met her in person as a boy, assumed she was a new playmate for him, and asked her to come and play trains with him, which she obligingly did.<ref>Clip of Douglas Fairbanks Jr. describing this incident. ''Mary Pickford: Muse of the Movies'', 2008. Documentary.</ref>\n\nIn August 1918, Pickford's contract expired and, when refusing Zukor's terms for a renewal, she was offered $250,000 to leave the motion picture business. She declined, and went to [[First National Pictures]], which agreed to her terms.<ref>''The New York Times'', October 29, 1925<!-- page?? --></ref> In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Douglas Fairbanks]], formed the independent film production company [[United Artists]]. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute them as she chose. In 1920, Pickford's film ''[[Pollyanna (1920 film)|Pollyanna]]'' grossed around $1,100,000.<ref name=\"OP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/timeline/timeline2.html|title=Timeline: Mary Pickford|work=American Experience|publisher=PBS|date=July 23, 2004|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}</ref> The following year, Pickford's film ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' was also a success, and in 1923, ''[[Rosita (film)|Rosita]]'' grossed over $1,000,000 as well.<ref name=\"OP\" /> During this period, she also made [[Little Annie Rooney (1925 film)|''Little Annie Rooney'']] (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, ''[[Sparrows (1926 film)|Sparrows]]'' (1926), which blended the [[Dickensian]] with newly minted [[German expressionism|German expressionist]] style, and ''[[My Best Girl (1927 film)|My Best Girl]]'' (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband [[Buddy Rogers (actor)|Buddy Rogers]].\n\n[[File:MaryPickford4.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Movie poster#Lobby cards|lobby card]] for ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy (1921 film)|Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (1921)]]\n\nThe arrival of sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated the value of adding sound to movies, claiming that \"adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the [[Venus de Milo]]\".<ref name=\"OP\" />\n\nShe played a reckless socialite in ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]'' (1929), a role for which her famous [[Ringlet (haircut)|ringlets]] were cut into a 1920s' [[bob cut|bob]]. Pickford had already cut her hair in the wake of her mother's death in 1928. Fans were shocked at the transformation.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/e_fans.html People & Events: Mary Pickford, ''Fan Culture''], PBS.org; accessed December 4, 2015.</ref> Pickford's hair had become a symbol of female virtue, and when she cut it, the act made front-page news in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other papers.

Like most movie stars of the silent era, Pickford found her career fading as [[Sound film|talkies]] became more popular among audiences.<ref name=\"mdecline\" />\n\nHer next film, ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1929 film)|The Taming of The Shrew]]'', made with husband [[Douglas Fairbanks]], was not well received at the box office.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pickford/peopleevents/p_fairbanks.html \"Douglas Fairbanks profile\"], pbs.org; accessed May 19, 2014.</ref> Established Hollywood actors were panicked by the impending arrival of the talkies. On March 29, 1928, ''The Dodge Brothers Hour'' was broadcast from Pickford's bungalow, featuring Fairbanks, Chaplin, [[Norma Talmadge]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[John Barrymore]], [[D.W. Griffith]], and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], among others.

In 1933, she underwent a [[Technicolor]] screen test for an animated/live action film version of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', but [[Walt Disney]] discarded the project when [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] released its own version of the book. Only one Technicolor [[Film still|still]]<!-- or is this [[still frame]]? --> of her screen test still exists. She retired from acting in 1933; her last acting film was released in 1934. She continued to produce for others, however, including ''[[Sleep, My Love]]'' (1948; with [[Claudette Colbert]]) and ''[[Love Happy]]'' (1949), with the [[Marx Brothers]]).<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n=== The film industry ===\n[[File:MaryPickfordHoover.gif|right|thumb|Mary Pickford giving President [[Herbert Hoover]] a ticket for a film industry benefit for the unemployed, 1931]]\nPickford used her stature in the movie industry to promote a variety of causes. Although her image depicted fragility and innocence, she proved to be a strong businesswoman who took control of her career in a cutthroat industry.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities |last=McDonald |first=Paul |publisher=Wallflower |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-903364-02-4 |location=London |page=33}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]] she promoted the sale of [[Liberty Bond]]s, making an intensive series of fund-raising speeches, beginning in Washington, D.C., where she sold bonds alongside [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Theda Bara]], and [[Marie Dressler]]. Five days later she spoke on [[Wall Street]] to an estimated 50,000 people. Though Canadian-born, she was a powerful symbol of [[Americana]], kissing the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] for cameras and auctioning one of her world-famous curls for $15,000. In a single speech in Chicago she sold an estimated five million dollars' worth of bonds. She was christened the U.S. Navy's official \"Little Sister\"; the Army named two cannons after her and made her an honorary colonel.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\n[[File:Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of Mary Pickford, 1921]]\n\nAt the end of World War I, Pickford conceived of the [[Motion Picture & Television Fund|Motion Picture Relief Fund]], an organization to help financially needy actors. Leftover funds from her work selling Liberty Bonds were put toward its creation, and in 1921, the Motion Picture Relief Fund (MPRF) was officially incorporated, with [[Joseph Schenck]] voted its first president and Pickford its vice president. In 1932, Pickford spearheaded the \"Payroll Pledge Program\", a payroll-deduction plan for studio workers who gave one half of one percent of their earnings to the MPRF. As a result, in 1940, the Fund was able to purchase land and build the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country House and Hospital]], in [[Woodland Hills, California]].<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nAn astute businesswoman, Pickford became her own producer within three years of her start in features. According to her Foundation, \"she oversaw every aspect of the making of her films, from hiring talent and crew to overseeing the script, the shooting, the editing, to the final release and promotion of each project\". She demanded (and received) these powers in 1916, when she was under contract to Zukor's Famous Players in Famous Plays (later Paramount). Zukor acquiesced to her refusal to participate in block-booking, the widespread practice of forcing an exhibitor to show a bad film of the studio's choosing to also be able to show a Pickford film. In 1916, Pickford's films were distributed, singly, through a special distribution unit called Artcraft. The Mary Pickford Corporation was briefly Pickford's motion-picture production company.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford signing the entrance to the Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow.jpg|left|thumb|Mary Pickford War Funds bungalow, 1943]]\nIn 1919, she increased her power by co-founding [[United Artists]] (UA) with Charlie Chaplin, D. W. Griffith, and her soon-to-be husband, Douglas Fairbanks. Before UA's creation, Hollywood studios were vertically integrated, not only producing films but forming chains of theaters. Distributors (also part of the studios) arranged for company productions to be shown in the company's movie venues. Filmmakers relied on the studios for bookings; in return they put up with what many considered creative interference.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nUnited Artists broke from this tradition. It was solely a distribution company, offering independent film producers access to its own screens as well as the rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman who has ever worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded.<ref name=\"mdecline\" /> After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.<ref name=\"ushistory\">{{cite web|title=Mary Pickford biography|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3890.html|accessdate=January 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Mary Pickford portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Pickford, 1921]]\nPickford was married three times. She married [[Owen Moore]], an Irish-born silent film actor, on January 7, 1911. It is rumored she became pregnant by Moore in the early 1910s and had a [[miscarriage]] or an [[abortion]]. Some accounts suggest this resulted in her later inability to have children.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" /> The couple's marriage was strained by Moore's alcoholism, insecurity about living in the shadow of Pickford's fame, and bouts of [[domestic violence]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The couple lived together on-and-off for several years.<ref>Peggy Dymond Leavey, ''Mary Pickford: Canada's Silent Siren, America's Sweetheart''.

They went to Europe for their honeymoon; fans in London and in Paris caused riots trying to get to the famous couple. The couple's triumphant return to Hollywood was witnessed by vast crowds who turned out to hail them at railway stations across the United States.\n\n''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and a series of other swashbucklers gave the popular Fairbanks a more romantic, heroic image. Pickford continued to epitomize the virtuous but fiery girl next door. Even at private parties, people instinctively stood up when Pickford entered a room; she and her husband were often referred to as \"Hollywood royalty\". Their international reputations were broad. Foreign heads of state and dignitaries who visited the [[White House]] often asked if they could also visit [[Pickfair]], the couple's mansion in Beverly Hills.<ref name=\"filmbug\" />\n\nDinners at Pickfair became celebrity events.

The public nature of Pickford's second marriage strained it to the breaking point. Both she and Fairbanks had little time off from producing and acting in their films. They were also constantly on display as America's unofficial ambassadors to the world, leading parades, cutting ribbons, and making speeches. When their film careers both began to flounder at the end of the silent era, Fairbanks' restless nature prompted him to overseas travel (something which Pickford did not enjoy). When Fairbanks' romance with [[Sylvia Ashley|Sylvia, Lady Ashley]] became public in the early 1930s, he and Pickford separated. They divorced January 10, 1936. Fairbanks' son by his first wife, [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]], claimed his father and Pickford long regretted their inability to reconcile.<ref name=\"Whitfield\" />\n\nOn June 24, 1937, Pickford married her third and last husband, actor and band leader [[Charles 'Buddy' Rogers|Buddy Rogers]]. They adopted two children: Roxanne (born 1944, adopted 1944) and Ronald Charles (born 1937, adopted 1943, a.k.a. Ronnie Pickford Rogers). A PBS ''[[American Experience]]'' documentary described Pickford's relationship with her children as tense. She criticized their physical imperfections, including Ronnie's small stature and Roxanne's crooked teeth. Both children later said their mother was too self-absorbed to provide real maternal love.

Her mother Charlotte died of breast cancer in March 1928. Her siblings, Lottie and Jack, both died of alcohol-related causes. These deaths, her divorce from Fairbanks, and the end of silent films left Pickford deeply depressed. Her relationship with her adopted children, Roxanne and Ronald, was turbulent at best. Pickford withdrew and gradually became a recluse, remaining almost entirely at Pickfair and allowing visits only from [[Lillian Gish]], her stepson [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], and few other people. She appeared in court in 1959, in a matter pertaining to her co-ownership of North Carolina TV station [[WSJS-TV]]. The court date coincided with the date of her 67th birthday; under oath, when asked to give her age, Pickford replied: \"I'm 21, going on 20.\"<ref>\"Mary Pickford \"Going On 20\" (Or Is It 66?)\", ''The Ottawa Citizen'', April 11, 1959, p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Pickford often received visitors only by telephone, speaking to them from her bedroom. [[Charles Buddy Rogers|Buddy Rogers]] often gave guests tours of Pickfair, including views of a genuine western bar Pickford had bought for Douglas Fairbanks, and a portrait of Pickford in the drawing room. A print of this image now hangs in the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=\"ushistory\" /> In addition to her Oscar as best actress for ''Coquette'' (1929), Mary Pickford received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1976 for lifetime achievement. The Academy sent a TV crew to her house to record her short statement of thanks \u2013 offering the public a very rare glimpse into Pickfair Manor.<ref>{{cite AV media | title = The 48th Annual Academy Awards | date = March 29, 1976 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vXhqrbSeOE}}</ref>\n\nPickford believed that she had ceased to be a [[British subject]] when she married an American citizen upon her marriage to Fairbanks in 1920.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=April 30, 1949|title=Mary Pickford Files TV Bid |magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |page=14|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Thus, she never acquired Canadian citizenship when it was first created in 1947. However, Pickford held and traveled under a British/Canadian passport which she renewed regularly at the British/Canadian consulates in Los Angeles, and she did not take out papers for American citizenship. She also owned a house in Toronto, Canada. Toward the end of her life, Pickford made arrangements with the Canadian Department of Citizenship to officially acquire Canadian citizenship because she wished to \"die as a Canadian\". Canadian authorities were not sure that she had ever lost her Canadian citizenship, given her passport status, but her request was approved and she officially became a Canadian citizen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Colombo|first=John Robert|title=Fascinating Canada: A Book of Questions and Answers|year=2011|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-55488-923-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20 20]|url=https://archive.org/details/fascinatingcanad0000colo/page/20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJlVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LkANAAAAIBAJ&pg=2767,848052&dq=mary+pickford+citizenship&hl=en|title=City, fans honor Mary Pickford|date=May 18, 1983|work=The Leader-Post|pages=D\u20138|accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mary Pickford Tomb.JPG|thumb|The tomb of actress Mary Pickford in the Garden of Memory, Forest Lawn Glendale]]\nOn May 29, 1979, Pickford died at a [[Santa Monica, California]], hospital of complications from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] she had suffered the week before.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130124175355/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&dat=19790530&id=GkgjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Kc0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,4772311|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 24, 2013|title=Mary Pickford Is Dead at 86|date=May 30, 1979|work=The Palm Beach Post|accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> She was interred in the Garden of Memory of the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] cemetery in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], California.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n\n* Pickford was awarded a star in the category of motion pictures on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6280 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/mary-pickford|title=Mary Pickford \u2013 Hollywood Walk of Fame|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Her handprints and footprints are displayed at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood, California.\n* The [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]] at 1313 Vine Street in Hollywood, constructed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, opened in 1948 as a radio and television studio facility.\n* The [[Mary Pickford Theater]] at the [[James Madison Memorial Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]] is named in her honor.<ref name=\"ushistory\" />\n* The Mary Pickford Auditorium at [[Claremont McKenna College]] is named in her honor.\n* In 1948, Mary Pickford built a 7 bedrooms, 8 bathroom, and 6,050 square foot estate on 2.12 acres at the [[B Bar H Ranch, California]] where she lived and then later sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.estately.com/listings/info/19120-bubbling-wells-road--14|title=19120 Bubbling Wells Road|publisher=}}</ref>\n* A first-run movie theatre in [[Cathedral City, California]] is called The Mary Pickford Theatre, which was established on May 25, 2001.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Iannucci|first1=Lisa|title=On Location: A Film and TV Lover's Travel Guide|date=March 1, 2018|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-1-4930-3085-9|page=28|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=_QNBDwAAQBAJ}}</ref> The theater is a grand one with several screens and is built in the shape of a Spanish Cathedral, complete with bell tower and three-story lobby.

The next day, at a news conference at Atlanta's [[Centennial Olympic Park]], WNBA president [[Donna Orender]] made the announcement that Atlanta would officially be granted a WNBA expansion franchise.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/wnba/2007-10-17-atlanta-franchise_N.htm | title=Atlanta lands WNBA's 14th team.|work=USA Today | accessdate=2008-06-24 | date=2007-10-18}}</ref>\n\nOn November 27, 2007, Atlanta named [[Marynell Meadors]], a coach with extensive experience at the college level, the first [[head coach]] and [[general manager]] in franchise history.  This was Meadors' second role as a coach/general manager in the WNBA following a stint with the [[Charlotte Sting]].  Afterwards, Meadors had served as a scouting director for the [[Miami Sol]] and had been an assistant coach under [[Richie Adubato]] and [[Tree Rollins]] for the [[Washington Mystics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/atlanta/meadors_hiring_071127.html |title=Atlanta Franchise Names Marynell Meadors Head Coach and General Manager. |work=WNBA |accessdate=2008-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013164227/http://www.wnba.com/atlanta/meadors_hiring_071127.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> Former NBA player [[Dennis Rodman]] volunteered his name as head coach for the Dream.

Atlanta traded [[Roneeka Hodges]] and their number four pick in the [[2008 WNBA Draft]] to the [[Seattle Storm]] for [[Izi Castro Marques]] and Seattle's eighth pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft. Also, the Dream traded the 18th pick and [[LaToya Thomas]] to the [[Detroit Shock]] for [[Ivory Latta]].\n\nFrom May 17, 2008, with a season opening loss against the [[Connecticut Sun]] to July 3, 2008, with a home loss against the [[Houston Comets]], the Dream lost 17 consecutive games, setting the WNBA all-time record for both consecutive losses and losses from opening day.  The 2006 [[Chicago Sky]] had previously lost 13 consecutive games, and the 2002 [[Detroit Shock]] had opened their season 0\u201313. On July 5, the Dream earned their first win in Atlanta 91\u201384 against the [[Chicago Sky]], ending the losing streak. They later finished with a 4\u201330 record.\n\nNot wanting a repeat of 2008, head coach and general manager [[Marynell Meadors]] acquired players such as [[Sancho Lyttle]], [[Nikki Teasley]], [[Chamique Holdsclaw]], [[Angel McCoughtry]], and [[Michelle Snow]] in the 2008\u20132009 offseason. In 2009, Atlanta reached the playoffs at 18\u201316, exceeding their previous record by 14 wins, but lost in the first round to the 2008 champion [[Detroit Shock]] in a sweep. After the season, their coach, Marynell Meadors, was awarded the [[WNBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year Award]].\n\nThe Dream's owner, Ron Terwilliger, announced in August that he wanted to give up his position as the primary owner of the Atlanta franchise.  On October 29, 2009, Kathy Betty took control of the team under the business entity Dream Too, LLC.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-businesswoman-kathy-betty-177579.html | title=Atlanta businesswoman Kathy Betty to buy WNBA team | first=Kristi E. | last=Swartz | newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=2009-10-29 | accessdate=2009-10-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091101065201/http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-businesswoman-kathy-betty-177579.html| archivedate= November 1, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010 season saw further improvement, finishing in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. The Dream then made it through the first two rounds of the playoffs and secured a trip to the WNBA Finals with a win over the [[New York Liberty]], as they swept New York in two games in the Eastern Conference Finals. They eventually faced the best team in the league, the 28\u20136 [[Seattle Storm]]. Seattle took the first two games at [[KeyArena|home]] with two close wins. Seattle completed the sweep and won the series in Atlanta.<ref>[http://www.wnba.com/games/20100916/SEAATL/gameinfo.html Seattle @ Atlanta Game 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918230403/http://www.wnba.com/games/20100916/SEAATL/gameinfo.html |date=September 18, 2010 }}</ref> Even though they were swept, the Dream did not lose any game by a margin of more than three points.\n\nAddressing arguably Atlanta's biggest concern, the team traded for All-Star point guard [[Lindsey Harding]] prior to the 2011 season. Despite the addition, the Dream struggled to open the season, starting with a 2\u20137 record due to an injury that sidelined [[Angel McCoughtry]] and overseas commitments by [[Sancho Lyttle]]. The team then went on a run of 14 wins and 5 losses after the All-Star break. They carried that momentum into the playoffs, sweeping the [[Connecticut Sun]] and defeating the [[Indiana Fever]] to return to the WNBA Finals.  However, they lost to the 27\u20137 [[Minnesota Lynx]] in three games.\n\nDuring the 2011 season, Betty sold Dream Too LLC to local investors Mary Brock and [[Kelly Loeffler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://atlanta.sbnation.com/atlanta-hawks/2011/9/4/2404035/the-atlanta-dream-transfer-ownership-from-kathy-betty-to-mary-brock |title=The Atlanta Dream Transfer Ownership From Kathy Betty To Mary Brock and Kelly Loeffler |website=SB Nation |date=September 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Dream started the 2012 season with a 12\u201312 record and fired head coach and general manager Meadors during a dispute with league-leading scorer [[Angel McCoughtry]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/8308988/wnba-sad-time-atlanta-dream | title=Sad time for Meadors, Dream | accessdate=2012-08-28 | date=2012-08-27 | publisher=ESPN | last=Voepel | first=Mechelle }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/8300116/wnba-angel-mccoughtry-indefinitely-atlanta-dream| title=McCoughtry's absence is puzzling | publisher=ESPN | last=Voepel | first=Mechelle | accessdate=2012-08-27 | date=2012-08-24}}</ref> Meadors was replaced by [[Fred Williams (basketball, born 1957)|Fred Williams]], finished with a 19\u201315 record, and lost in the first round.\n\nThe following 2013 season, the team again made it to the WNBA Finals, and again were swept by the Lynx.

(WNBA). The team was founded for the [[2008 WNBA season]]. The team is owned by Dream Too LLC, which is composed of two Atlanta businesswomen: Mary Brock and [[Kelly Loeffler]]. Although the Dream share the Atlanta market with the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Atlanta Hawks|Hawks]], the Dream is not affiliated with their NBA counterpart. The Dream play at the [[Gateway Center Arena]] in [[College Park, Georgia]].\n\nThe Dream has qualified for the [[WNBA Playoffs]] in nine of its 12 years in Atlanta and has reached the [[WNBA Finals]] three times.

In [[2010 WNBA Finals|2010]], the Dream went to the [[WNBA Finals]] but fell short to [[Seattle Storm|Seattle]]. They lost to the [[Minnesota Lynx]] in the [[2011 WNBA Finals|2011]] and [[2013 WNBA Finals]].\n\n==Franchise history==\nEven before the success of the United States women's basketball team in the 1996 Olympic Games, the [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)|American Basketball League]] had interest in placing a women's professional basketball team in Atlanta as early as 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://womensbasketballonline.com/history/timeline1990s.html |title=Women's Basketball Timeline: 1990s |accessdate=2008-06-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725055100/http://womensbasketballonline.com/history/timeline1990s.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> Eight of the twelve Olympians played on ABL teams when the league began play in October 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.interbasket.net/players/usa/abl.htm | title=American Basketball League profile by Interbasket | accessdate=2008-06-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080706142605/http://www.interbasket.net/players/usa/abl.htm| archivedate= July 6, 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> The [[Atlanta Glory]] played at [[Forbes Arena]] and lasted two seasons before folding before the start of the 1998\u201399 season, which would be the ABL's final.\n\nAtlanta had been mentioned as a possible future city for WNBA expansion, but efforts did not come together until the beginning of 2007 when an organizing committee with Atlanta businessmen and politicians began the effort to attract an expansion team.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/wnba/2007-02-19-atlanta_x.htm?csp=34 | title=Atlanta group launching effort to attract WNBA team | work=USA Today | accessdate=2008-06-24 | date=2007-02-19}}</ref>  The inability of the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] to draw crowds was a concern of the WNBA, and the committee kicked off an effort in February 2007 to gain volunteers and petition signatures.

Atlanta traded [[Roneeka Hodges]] and their number four pick in the [[2008 WNBA Draft]] to the [[Seattle Storm]] for [[Izi Castro Marques]] and Seattle's eighth pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft. Also, the Dream traded the 18th pick and [[LaToya Thomas]] to the [[Detroit Shock]] for [[Ivory Latta]].\n\nFrom May 17, 2008, with a season opening loss against the [[Connecticut Sun]] to July 3, 2008, with a home loss against the [[Houston Comets]], the Dream lost 17 consecutive games, setting the WNBA all-time record for both consecutive losses and losses from opening day.  The 2006 [[Chicago Sky]] had previously lost 13 consecutive games, and the 2002 [[Detroit Shock]] had opened their season 0\u201313. On July 5, the Dream earned their first win in Atlanta 91\u201384 against the [[Chicago Sky]], ending the losing streak. They later finished with a 4\u201330 record.\n\nNot wanting a repeat of 2008, head coach and general manager [[Marynell Meadors]] acquired players such as [[Sancho Lyttle]], [[Nikki Teasley]], [[Chamique Holdsclaw]], [[Angel McCoughtry]], and [[Michelle Snow]] in the 2008\u20132009 offseason. In 2009, Atlanta reached the playoffs at 18\u201316, exceeding their previous record by 14 wins, but lost in the first round to the 2008 champion [[Detroit Shock]] in a sweep. After the season, their coach, Marynell Meadors, was awarded the [[WNBA Coach of the Year Award|Coach of the Year Award]].\n\nThe Dream's owner, Ron Terwilliger, announced in August that he wanted to give up his position as the primary owner of the Atlanta franchise.  On October 29, 2009, Kathy Betty took control of the team under the business entity Dream Too, LLC.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-businesswoman-kathy-betty-177579.html | title=Atlanta businesswoman Kathy Betty to buy WNBA team | first=Kristi E. | last=Swartz | newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution | date=2009-10-29 | accessdate=2009-10-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091101065201/http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-businesswoman-kathy-betty-177579.html| archivedate= November 1, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe 2010 season saw further improvement, finishing in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. The Dream then made it through the first two rounds of the playoffs and secured a trip to the WNBA Finals with a win over the [[New York Liberty]], as they swept New York in two games in the Eastern Conference Finals. They eventually faced the best team in the league, the 28\u20136 [[Seattle Storm]]. Seattle took the first two games at [[KeyArena|home]] with two close wins.

Despite the addition, the Dream struggled to open the season, starting with a 2\u20137 record due to an injury that sidelined [[Angel McCoughtry]] and overseas commitments by [[Sancho Lyttle]]. The team then went on a run of 14 wins and 5 losses after the All-Star break. They carried that momentum into the playoffs, sweeping the [[Connecticut Sun]] and defeating the [[Indiana Fever]] to return to the WNBA Finals.  However, they lost to the 27\u20137 [[Minnesota Lynx]] in three games.\n\nDuring the 2011 season, Betty sold Dream Too LLC to local investors Mary Brock and [[Kelly Loeffler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://atlanta.sbnation.com/atlanta-hawks/2011/9/4/2404035/the-atlanta-dream-transfer-ownership-from-kathy-betty-to-mary-brock |title=The Atlanta Dream Transfer Ownership From Kathy Betty To Mary Brock and Kelly Loeffler |website=SB Nation |date=September 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Dream started the 2012 season with a 12\u201312 record and fired head coach and general manager Meadors during a dispute with league-leading scorer [[Angel McCoughtry]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/8308988/wnba-sad-time-atlanta-dream | title=Sad time for Meadors, Dream | accessdate=2012-08-28 | date=2012-08-27 | publisher=ESPN | last=Voepel | first=Mechelle }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/8300116/wnba-angel-mccoughtry-indefinitely-atlanta-dream| title=McCoughtry's absence is puzzling | publisher=ESPN | last=Voepel | first=Mechelle | accessdate=2012-08-27 | date=2012-08-24}}</ref> Meadors was replaced by [[Fred Williams (basketball, born 1957)|Fred Williams]], finished with a 19\u201315 record, and lost in the first round.\n\nThe following 2013 season, the team again made it to the WNBA Finals, and again were swept by the Lynx.

'''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In a particularly brutal act, Koonay, the sister of Tachnechdorus, was strung up by the wrists while her unborn baby was impaled.  As expected, Tachnechdorus took revenge, and was supported by the Shawnee, who expressed discontent that they had still not been paid for their lands.{{r|Calloway|p=208}}.

Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there.  St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\"{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}  Western native leaders, meanwhile, met at Kekionga to determine a response to the Treaty of Fort Harmar. \n\nGeneral Harmar's forces of about 1,453 militia and regulars departed [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]] on 7 October 1790.

'''Northwest Indian War''' (1785\u20131795), also known as the '''Ohio War''', '''Little Turtle's War''', and by other names, was a war between the [[United States]] and a confederation of numerous [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, with support from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], for control of the [[Northwest Territory]]. It followed centuries of conflict over this territory, first among Native American tribes, and then with the added shifting alliances among the tribes and the European powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Great Britain]], and their colonials. The [[United States Army]] considers it their first of the [[American Indian Wars|United States Indian Wars]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.army.mil/html/reference/army_flag/iw.html |title=Indian Wars Campaigns |website=U.S. Army Center of Military History |accessdate=27 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], Great Britain ceded to the U.S. \"control\" of what were known as the Ohio Country and the Illinois Country, which were occupied by numerous Native American peoples. Despite the treaty, the British kept forts there and continued policies that supported the Native Americans. With the encroachment of European settlers west of the Appalachians after the War, a Huron-led confederacy formed in 1785 to resist usurpation of Indian lands, declaring that lands north and west of the Ohio River were Indian territory.  President [[George Washington]] directed the [[United States Army]] to enforce U.S. sovereignty over the territory. The U.S. Army, consisting mostly of untrained recruits and volunteer militiamen, suffered a series of major defeats, including the [[Harmar Campaign]] (1790) and [[St. Clair's Defeat]] (1791). About 1,000 soldiers and militiamen were killed and the United States forces suffered many more casualties than their opponents. These defeats are among the worst ever suffered in the [[History of the United States Army|history of the US Army]].\n\nAfter St. Clair's disaster, Washington ordered [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] to organize and train a proper fighting force. Wayne took command of the new [[Legion of the United States]] late in 1792. After a methodical campaign up the Great Miami and Maumee river valleys in western Ohio Country, he led his men to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] near the southwestern shore of [[Lake Erie]] (close to modern [[Toledo, Ohio]]) in 1794. Afterward he went on to establish [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] at the Miami capital of [[Kekionga]], the symbol of U.S. sovereignty in the heart of Indian Country. The defeated tribes were forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day [[Ohio]], in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. The [[Jay Treaty]] in the same year arranged for cessions of British Great Lakes outposts on the great U.S. territory.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Sixty Years' War}}\nControl of the area south of the [[Great Lakes]] and north of the [[Ohio River]] was contested for centuries.

In a particularly brutal act, Koonay, the sister of Tachnechdorus, was strung up by the wrists while her unborn baby was impaled.  As expected, Tachnechdorus took revenge, and was supported by the Shawnee, who expressed discontent that they had still not been paid for their lands.{{r|Calloway|p=208}}.

During the mid- and late-1780s, American settlers south of the Ohio River in Kentucky and travelers on and north of the Ohio River suffered approximately 1,500 casualties.

Washington, as early as 1784, had told Henry Knox that a strong U.S. post should be established at Kekionga. Knox, however, was concerned that a U.S. fort at Kekionga would provoke the Indians and denied St. Clair's request to build a fort there.  St. Clair, in 1790, had told both Washington and Knox that \"we will never have peace with the Western Nations until we have a garrison there.\"{{r|Poinsatte|p=21-3}}  Western native leaders, meanwhile, met at Kekionga to determine a response to the Treaty of Fort Harmar. \n\nGeneral Harmar's forces of about 1,453 militia and regulars departed [[Fort Washington (Ohio)|Fort Washington]] on 7 October 1790.
