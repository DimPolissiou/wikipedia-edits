It was first published in Hasegawa's local paper, the {{nihongo|''Fukunichi Shinbun''|\u30d5\u30af\u30cb\u30c1\u65b0\u805e}}, on April 22, 1946. When the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' wished to have Hasegawa draw the four-panel comic for their paper, she moved to [[Tokyo]] in 1949 with the explanation that the main characters had moved from [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] to Tokyo as well. The manga dealt with contemporary situations in Tokyo until Hasegawa retired and ended the series on February 21, 1974.\n\n''Sazae-san'' won the 8th [[Bungeishunj\u016b Manga Award]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ztv.ne.jp/keiko/comic_lab/prize/bungei_shunju_mangasho.html | script-title=ja:\u6587\u85dd\u6625\u79cb\u6f2b\u753b\u8cde | publisher=Comic Lab | accessdate=June 9, 2013 | language=Japanese | archivedate=October 20, 2009 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kebZ8Aik?url=http://www.ztv.ne.jp/keiko/comic_lab/prize/bungei_shunju_mangasho.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> An [[anime]] television adaptation by TCJ (later renamed [[Eiken (studio)|Eiken]]) began airing in Japan in October 1969 and holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the longest-running animated television series.<ref name=\"worldrecord\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-09-05/guinness-certifies-sazae-san-as-longest-running-animated-show |title=Guinness Certifies Sazae-san as Longest Running Animated Show - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref> It has also been adapted into a radio show, theatrical plays and songs.<ref>https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hasegawa_machiko.htm</ref>\n \n==Plots==\nIn the beginning, Sazae was more interested in being with her horse than dressing up in kimono and makeup to attract her future husband. Hasegawa was forward-thinking in that, in her words, the Isono/Fuguta clan would embody the image of the modern Japanese family after [[World War II]].\n\nSazae was a very \"liberated\" woman, and many of the early plotlines revolved around Sazae bossing around her husband, to the consternation of her neighbors, who believed that a man should be the head of his household. Later, Sazae became a feminist and was involved in many comical situations regarding her affiliation with her local [[women's lib]] group.\n\nDespite the topical nature of the series, the core of the stories revolved around the large family dynamic, and were presented in a lighthearted, easy fashion. In fact, the final comic, in 1974, revolved around Sazae's happiness that an egg she cracked for her husband's breakfast produced a double [[yolk]], with Katsuo remarking about the happiness the \"little things\" in life can bring.\n\nAs of now, the popular ''Sazae-san'' anime is frequently taken as nostalgia for traditional Japanese society, since it alludes to a simpler time before modern technology, despite the fact that it was leftist to the point of controversy when it originally ran in Japanese newspapers.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Sazae-san rocks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical ''Sazae-san'' strip]]\n\n=== Isono and Fuguta family ===\n*{{nihongo|'''Sazae Fuguta'''|\u30d5\u30b0\u7530 \u30b5\u30b6\u30a8|''Fuguta Sazae''}} (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' {{nihongo|Isono|\u78ef\u91ce|}})\n:The main character.

In April 1993, this publishing company went out of business and the comic books went out of print. The same year, ''Asahi Shimbun'' purchased the right to publish the forty-five paperback volumes. Twelve bilingual (Japanese-English) manga volumes were published by [[Kodansha]] between 1997 and 1999 as ''The Wonderful World of Sazae-San''.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/gp/B00GEYO30E/</ref> The volumes were re-released in 2004,<ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4770025440/</ref> and in 2015 another three bilingual manga volumes were released as ''The Best of Sazae-san''.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4062500841/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4062500817/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4062500825</ref>\n\n== Sazae-san on television ==\n\n===Anime series===\nIn October 1969, [[Fuji Television]] started an anime comedy series, which is still on the air today and currently in production, making it [[List of anime series by episode count|one of the longest-running scripted TV series in history]] and the longest running animated show.

Since November 1991, after the closing credits and the next episode previews, each show has ended with a [[Rock-paper-scissors|janken]] match between Sazae and the viewers at home, in which Sazae holds up a sign representing one of the appropriate hand gestures.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081231130553/http://www.geocities.co.jp/Hollywood-Theater/2500/english_sazaedata.html Sazae's Past Jankens (via archive.org; updated through 2008)]</ref> From 1969 until October 1991, Sazae ended each episode by tossing a bean or rice cake in the air and catching it in her mouth.

Despite the series being a hit, Hasegawa stated that she never wanted any merchandise to be made for it, including home video rights, making availability of past episodes, especially those prior to the introduction of the VCR, very rare. Following her death, her request to prohibit older episodes from being released in home media was honored.<ref>[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-longest-running-tv-cartoon-ever/ Cartoon Research: \"The Longest Running TV Cartoon, Ever\", April 9, 2013.]</ref> Despite this however, Fuji TV made an agreement with Amazon Prime Video on December 2018 to release the 1969 and early-to-mid 1970s episodes available on their streaming service.

It was first published in Hasegawa's local paper, the {{nihongo|''Fukunichi Shinbun''|\u30d5\u30af\u30cb\u30c1\u65b0\u805e}}, on April 22, 1946. When the ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' wished to have Hasegawa draw the four-panel comic for their paper, she moved to [[Tokyo]] in 1949 with the explanation that the main characters had moved from [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] to Tokyo as well. The manga dealt with contemporary situations in Tokyo until Hasegawa retired and ended the series on February 21, 1974.\n\n''Sazae-san'' won the 8th [[Bungeishunj\u016b Manga Award]] in 1962.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ztv.ne.jp/keiko/comic_lab/prize/bungei_shunju_mangasho.html | script-title=ja:\u6587\u85dd\u6625\u79cb\u6f2b\u753b\u8cde | publisher=Comic Lab | accessdate=June 9, 2013 | language=Japanese | archivedate=October 20, 2009 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kebZ8Aik?url=http://www.ztv.ne.jp/keiko/comic_lab/prize/bungei_shunju_mangasho.html | url-status=dead }}</ref> An [[anime]] television adaptation by TCJ (later renamed [[Eiken (studio)|Eiken]]) began airing in Japan in October 1969 and holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for the longest-running animated television series.<ref name=\"worldrecord\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-09-05/guinness-certifies-sazae-san-as-longest-running-animated-show |title=Guinness Certifies Sazae-san as Longest Running Animated Show - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref> It has also been adapted into a radio show, theatrical plays and songs.<ref>https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hasegawa_machiko.htm</ref>\n \n==Plots==\nIn the beginning, Sazae was more interested in being with her horse than dressing up in kimono and makeup to attract her future husband. Hasegawa was forward-thinking in that, in her words, the Isono/Fuguta clan would embody the image of the modern Japanese family after [[World War II]].\n\nSazae was a very \"liberated\" woman, and many of the early plotlines revolved around Sazae bossing around her husband, to the consternation of her neighbors, who believed that a man should be the head of his household. Later, Sazae became a feminist and was involved in many comical situations regarding her affiliation with her local [[women's lib]] group.\n\nDespite the topical nature of the series, the core of the stories revolved around the large family dynamic, and were presented in a lighthearted, easy fashion. In fact, the final comic, in 1974, revolved around Sazae's happiness that an egg she cracked for her husband's breakfast produced a double [[yolk]], with Katsuo remarking about the happiness the \"little things\" in life can bring.\n\nAs of now, the popular ''Sazae-san'' anime is frequently taken as nostalgia for traditional Japanese society, since it alludes to a simpler time before modern technology, despite the fact that it was leftist to the point of controversy when it originally ran in Japanese newspapers.\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Sazae-san rocks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical ''Sazae-san'' strip]]\n\n=== Isono and Fuguta family ===\n*{{nihongo|'''Sazae Fuguta'''|\u30d5\u30b0\u7530 \u30b5\u30b6\u30a8|''Fuguta Sazae''}} (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' {{nihongo|Isono|\u78ef\u91ce|}})\n:The main character.

In April 1993, this publishing company went out of business and the comic books went out of print. The same year, ''Asahi Shimbun'' purchased the right to publish the forty-five paperback volumes. Twelve bilingual (Japanese-English) manga volumes were published by [[Kodansha]] between 1997 and 1999 as ''The Wonderful World of Sazae-San''.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/gp/B00GEYO30E/</ref> The volumes were re-released in 2004,<ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4770025440/</ref> and in 2015 another three bilingual manga volumes were released as ''The Best of Sazae-san''.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4062500841/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4062500817/</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4062500825</ref>\n\n== Sazae-san on television ==\n\n===Anime series===\nIn October 1969, [[Fuji Television]] started an anime comedy series, which is still on the air today and currently in production, making it [[List of anime series by episode count|one of the longest-running scripted TV series in history]] and the longest running animated show. It has been broadcast every Sunday from 6:30 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. and contains three vignettes. The anime series has some characters, like Katsuo's classmates, who have not appeared in Hasegawa's original works.\n\nThe end credits for each episode include brief animations of the original comic strips, with dialogue appearing in word balloons. Since November 1991, after the closing credits and the next episode previews, each show has ended with a [[Rock-paper-scissors|janken]] match between Sazae and the viewers at home, in which Sazae holds up a sign representing one of the appropriate hand gestures.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081231130553/http://www.geocities.co.jp/Hollywood-Theater/2500/english_sazaedata.html Sazae's Past Jankens (via archive.org; updated through 2008)]</ref> From 1969 until October 1991, Sazae ended each episode by tossing a bean or rice cake in the air and catching it in her mouth. Fuji Television switched to the janken match after doctors at Tohoku University Hospital and the National Center for Child Health and Development raised concerns that children may try to imitate Sazae and potentially choke on food.\n\nOn November 16, 2008, the series' 2000th 30-minute broadcast was aired in celebration of the 40th anniversary of the anime series; this special episode also featured Sazae-san wearing five costumes based on submissions from viewers.\n\nThe anime series was originally sponsored solely by [[Toshiba]]\u2014including placement of its products within the show\u2014but later expanded to other sponsors.\n\n''Sazae-san'' was the last animated television series to use traditional [[cel animation]], although as of April 2009, the opening credits were digital;<ref>[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-08-29/sazae-san-is-last-tv-anime-using-cels-not-computers Sazae-san is Last TV Anime Using Cels, Not Computers\u2014Anime News Network<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the series finally switched to fully digital animation in 2015. Despite the series being a hit, Hasegawa stated that she never wanted any merchandise to be made for it, including home video rights, making availability of past episodes, especially those prior to the introduction of the VCR, very rare. Following her death, her request to prohibit older episodes from being released in home media was honored.<ref>[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/the-longest-running-tv-cartoon-ever/ Cartoon Research: \"The Longest Running TV Cartoon, Ever\", April 9, 2013.]</ref> Despite this however, Fuji TV made an agreement with Amazon Prime Video on December 2018 to release the 1969 and early-to-mid 1970s episodes available on their streaming service.

Photographed in Via delle Casine.]] \nThe river originates on [[Mount Falterona]] in the [[Casentino]] area of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].\n\nWith a length of {{convert|241|km}}, it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: [[Sieve (river)|Sieve]] at {{convert|60|km|mi}} long, [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio]] at {{convert|49|km}}, and the [[Era (river)|Era]], [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]], [[Pesa (river)|Pesa]], and [[Pescia (River)|Pescia]]. The drainage basin amounts to more than {{convert|8200|sqkm}} and drains the waters of the following subbasins:\n\n*The [[Casentino]], in the [[province of Arezzo]], formed by the upper course of the river until its confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.\n*The [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], a plain drained in the 18th century, which until then had been a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.\n*The upper [[Valdarno]], a long valley bordered on the east by the [[Pratomagno]] massif and on the west by the hills around [[Siena]].\n*The Sieve's basin, which flows into the Arno immediately before Florence.\n*The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence, [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Prato]], and [[Pistoia]].\n*The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa, and Era and in which, after [[Pontedera]], the Arno flows into the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The river has a very variable discharge, ranging from about {{convert|6|m3/s|cuft/s}} to more than {{convert|2000|m3/s|cuft/s}}. The mouth of the river was once near [[Pisa]] but is now several kilometres westwards.\n\nIt crosses [[Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Ponte Santa Trinita|Santa Trinita bridge]] (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, most recently in [[1966 flood of the Arno|1966]], with {{convert|4500|m3/s|cuft/s}} after rainfall of {{convert|437.2|mm}} in Badia Agnano and {{convert|190|mm}} in Florence, in only 24 hours.\n\nBefore Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte. This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the [[Lago di Bientina]], which was once the largest lake in [[Tuscany]] before its reclamation. \n\nThe flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days.

Photographed in Via delle Casine.]] \nThe river originates on [[Mount Falterona]] in the [[Casentino]] area of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near [[Arezzo]] passing through [[Florence]], [[Empoli]] and [[Pisa]], flowing into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] at [[Marina di Pisa]].\n\nWith a length of {{convert|241|km}}, it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: [[Sieve (river)|Sieve]] at {{convert|60|km|mi}} long, [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio]] at {{convert|49|km}}, and the [[Era (river)|Era]], [[Elsa (river)|Elsa]], [[Pesa (river)|Pesa]], and [[Pescia (River)|Pescia]]. The drainage basin amounts to more than {{convert|8200|sqkm}} and drains the waters of the following subbasins:\n\n*The [[Casentino]], in the [[province of Arezzo]], formed by the upper course of the river until its confluence with the Maestro della Chiana channel.\n*The [[Valdichiana|Val di Chiana]], a plain drained in the 18th century, which until then had been a marshy area tributary of the Tiber.\n*The upper [[Valdarno]], a long valley bordered on the east by the [[Pratomagno]] massif and on the west by the hills around [[Siena]].\n*The Sieve's basin, which flows into the Arno immediately before Florence.\n*The middle Valdarno, with the plain including Florence, [[Sesto Fiorentino]], [[Prato]], and [[Pistoia]].\n*The lower Valdarno, with the valley of important tributaries such as the Pesa, Elsa, and Era and in which, after [[Pontedera]], the Arno flows into the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The river has a very variable discharge, ranging from about {{convert|6|m3/s|cuft/s}} to more than {{convert|2000|m3/s|cuft/s}}. The mouth of the river was once near [[Pisa]] but is now several kilometres westwards.\n\nIt crosses [[Florence]], where it passes below the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Ponte Santa Trinita|Santa Trinita bridge]] (built by [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] but inspired by [[Michelangelo]]). The river [[flood]]ed this city regularly in historical times, most recently in [[1966 flood of the Arno|1966]], with {{convert|4500|m3/s|cuft/s}} after rainfall of {{convert|437.2|mm}} in Badia Agnano and {{convert|190|mm}} in Florence, in only 24 hours.\n\nBefore Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte. This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the [[Lago di Bientina]], which was once the largest lake in [[Tuscany]] before its reclamation. \n\nThe flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between {{convert|0.56|and|3540|m3/s|cuft/s}}.

Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist of [[Stranger Things (season 1)|season 1]], and one of the main protagonists of [[Stranger Things (season 2)|season 2]] and [[Stranger Things (season 3)|season 3]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Season 1===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 1)}}\nSteve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s jock character, antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been dating [[Nancy Wheeler]] but after he harasses [[List of Stranger Things characters#Jonathan Byers|Jonathan Byers]] by breaking his camera, Nancy seems to become close to Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but Jonathan beats him in a fight and Steve sees the error of his ways. Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he becomes involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues his relationship with Nancy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 2)}}\nSteve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. Steve also finds himself at odds with [[List of Stranger Things characters#Billy Hargrove|Billy Hargrove]], a new student at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes involved with [[Mike Wheeler (Stranger Things)|Mike Wheeler]] and his friends after [[Dustin Henderson|Dustin]] asks him to help find his \"pet\" D'Artagnan, unaware it is a Demogorgon. Steve and Dustin bond over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve takes Mike, Lucas, and Billy's stepsister [[List of Stranger Things characters#Max Mayfield|Max]] under his wing. Steve protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across Hawkins, giving time for [[Eleven (Stranger Things)|Eleven]] and [[Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)|Jim Hopper]] to close the gate to the Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised from his body.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}\nNow graduated from high school, Steve works at the Scoops Ahoy! ice cream parlor at Starcourt Mall with Robin Buckley ([[Maya Hawke]]), a former classmate who teases him frequently. Dustin, having returned from science camp and set up a [[ham radio]] tower to talk with his new girlfriend Suzie in Utah, gets Steve's help to translate a Russian radio message he overheard. Robin helps with the translation, indicating a site at the mall, and Lucas' sister Erica (Priah Ferguson) is recruited to sneak into the site in exchange for free ice cream. Steve, Robin, Dustin, and Erica find a secret Russian base under the mall that is attempting to open a portal to the Upside Down. Though Steve and Robin are captured and drugged, Dustin and Erica help save them and return to the surface to warn the others. Whilst coming down off the drugs, Steve admits he is attracted to Robin and learns that Robin is a lesbian, yet accepts her sexuality. In the following battle with the Mind Flayer, Steve helps to stop the possessed Billy from ramming the car that the others are using to escort Eleven away, and joins the rest in distracting the Mind Flayer with fireworks as the gate in the Russian base is shut down. With the mall's destruction from the battle, Steve and Robin lose their jobs at Scoops Ahoy! and get work at the local [[Family Video]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe character appears in ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'' as a DLC character along with [[Nancy Wheeler]] as a fellow survivor being hunted by the Demogorgon throughout the Hawkins Lab.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter |title= ''Stranger Things'' is coming to ''Dead by Daylight'' in a new update |date=2019-08-19 |website=Polygon |language=en |access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character development of Steve Harrington in the [[Stranger Things 2|second season of the show]] has been met with acclaim and has led to Steve becoming a fan-favorite character and critical darling on the show, and Joe Keery received critical acclaim for his performance. The transition from stereotypical bully and lothario to a caring and protective character was lauded by critics and audiences.

While starting out as a typical jock character, Steve has grown into a more paternal and caring character as the show has progressed, a development that has received widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike and has led to Steve becoming one of the show\u2019s most beloved and enduring characters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/07/stranger-things-3-steve-harrington-actor-joe-keery-interview|title= An Ode to Steve Harrington, the soft hero Stranger Things fans deserve|date=2019-07-04|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> Initially a part of the recurring cast, Joe Keery was promoted to the main cast in the second season. Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist of [[Stranger Things (season 1)|season 1]], and one of the main protagonists of [[Stranger Things (season 2)|season 2]] and [[Stranger Things (season 3)|season 3]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Season 1===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 1)}}\nSteve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s jock character, antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been dating [[Nancy Wheeler]] but after he harasses [[List of Stranger Things characters#Jonathan Byers|Jonathan Byers]] by breaking his camera, Nancy seems to become close to Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but Jonathan beats him in a fight and Steve sees the error of his ways. Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he becomes involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues his relationship with Nancy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 2)}}\nSteve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. Steve also finds himself at odds with [[List of Stranger Things characters#Billy Hargrove|Billy Hargrove]], a new student at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes involved with [[Mike Wheeler (Stranger Things)|Mike Wheeler]] and his friends after [[Dustin Henderson|Dustin]] asks him to help find his \"pet\" D'Artagnan, unaware it is a Demogorgon. Steve and Dustin bond over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve takes Mike, Lucas, and Billy's stepsister [[List of Stranger Things characters#Max Mayfield|Max]] under his wing. Steve protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across Hawkins, giving time for [[Eleven (Stranger Things)|Eleven]] and [[Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)|Jim Hopper]] to close the gate to the Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised from his body.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}\nNow graduated from high school, Steve works at the Scoops Ahoy! ice cream parlor at Starcourt Mall with Robin Buckley ([[Maya Hawke]]), a former classmate who teases him frequently. Dustin, having returned from science camp and set up a [[ham radio]] tower to talk with his new girlfriend Suzie in Utah, gets Steve's help to translate a Russian radio message he overheard. Robin helps with the translation, indicating a site at the mall, and Lucas' sister Erica (Priah Ferguson) is recruited to sneak into the site in exchange for free ice cream. Steve, Robin, Dustin, and Erica find a secret Russian base under the mall that is attempting to open a portal to the Upside Down. Though Steve and Robin are captured and drugged, Dustin and Erica help save them and return to the surface to warn the others. Whilst coming down off the drugs, Steve admits he is attracted to Robin and learns that Robin is a lesbian, yet accepts her sexuality. In the following battle with the Mind Flayer, Steve helps to stop the possessed Billy from ramming the car that the others are using to escort Eleven away, and joins the rest in distracting the Mind Flayer with fireworks as the gate in the Russian base is shut down. With the mall's destruction from the battle, Steve and Robin lose their jobs at Scoops Ahoy! and get work at the local [[Family Video]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe character appears in ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'' as a DLC character along with [[Nancy Wheeler]] as a fellow survivor being hunted by the Demogorgon throughout the Hawkins Lab.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter |title= ''Stranger Things'' is coming to ''Dead by Daylight'' in a new update |date=2019-08-19 |website=Polygon |language=en |access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character development of Steve Harrington in the [[Stranger Things 2|second season of the show]] has been met with acclaim and has led to Steve becoming a fan-favorite character and critical darling on the show, and Joe Keery received critical acclaim for his performance.

Frank is best known for his studies of Spanish and [[Latin American literature]] and culture and his work is regarded as an intellectual bridge between the two continents.\n\nA radical political activist during the years of the [[Great Depression]], Frank delivered a keynote speech to the first congress of the [[League of American Writers]] and was the first chair of that organization. Frank broke with the [[Communist Party, USA]] in 1937 over its treatment of exiled Soviet leader [[Leon Trotsky]], whom Frank met in Mexico in January of that year.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\n\nWaldo Frank was born in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]] on August 25, 1889, during his family's summer vacation. He was the youngest of four children to Julius J. Frank, a prosperous Wall Street attorney employed by the Hamburg-Amerika Line,<ref name=Casciato>Art Casciato, \"Waldo Frank (1889-1967), in Bernard K. Johnpoll and Harvey Klehr (eds.), ''Biographical Dictionary of the American Left.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1986; pp. 143-144.</ref> and his wife, the former Helene Rosenberg, who hailed from the American South and was the daughter of a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] blockade runner during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=Ogorzaly14>Michael A. Ogorzaly, ''Waldo Frank, Prophet of Hispanic Regeneration,'' pg. 14.</ref>\n\nThe young Frank grew up on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[New York City]], where he attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]].<ref name=Casciato /> He was expelled from school for refusing to take a Shakespeare course, saying that he knew more than the teacher and subsequently spent a year attending a college preparatory boarding school in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]].<ref name=Casciato /> Upon his return to the United States, Frank enrolled at [[Yale University]], first earning a [[bachelor's degree]] before completing his [[Masters degree]] in 1911.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nFollowing graduation, Frank worked briefly as a reporter for the ''[[New York Times]]'' before leaving in 1913 for [[Paris]], where he went to read and write.<ref name=Casciato /> With [[World War I]] in the wings, Frank returned to New York City in 1914.<ref name=Casciato />\n\n===Literary career===\n\nFrank's first published novel, ''The Unwelcome Man'' (1917), was a [[psychoanalytic]] look into a man contemplating suicide.  The novel also drew upon the ideas of New England [[transcendentalist]] [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and the poet [[Walt Whitman]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 1916, Frank became associate editor of ''[[The Seven Arts]]'', a journal that ran for just twelve issues but became an important artistic and political influence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Its contributors were determined pacifists, a position that caused a decline in subscriptions and supporting funds. Contributors included [[Randolph Bourne]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], and [[James Oppenheim]], the founder and general editor of the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn January 1917, Frank married [[Margaret Naumburg]], a postgraduate pupil of [[John Dewey]]. She developed techniques which later became known as [[art therapy]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 1921 Frank met and became intense friends with the young writer, [[Jean Toomer]]. He served as editor for Toomer's first novel, ''Cane'' (1923), a modernist work combining poems and associated stories, inspired by his working in the rural South as a school principal at a black school. Toomer became an important figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]]; of mixed-race and majority-white, complex ethnicity, he resisted being classified as a black writer and said he was \"an American\". They had a falling out and their friendship ended after 1923, due in part to an affair between Toomer and Naumburg.<ref>Kathleen Pfeiffer (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1hDLAbREMYEC&pg=PA2 ''Brother Mine: The Correspondence of Jean Toomer and Waldo Frank.''] Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2010; pg. 2.</ref>\n\nFrank became a regular contributor to the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' in 1925 under the pseudonym \"Search-Light\".\n\n===Political activity===\n\nFrank was an [[anti-militarism|anti-militarist]] and declared himself a [[conscientious objector]] in registering for [[conscription|the draft]] in 1917.<ref name=Casciato /> He became increasingly political during the 1920s, joining the liberal magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'' as a contributing editor in November 1925.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nIn 1929 together with fellow writers [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and others Frank worked to raise money for striking workers in Southern textile mills.<ref name=Casciato /> He toured the [[Soviet Union]] in the summer and early fall of 1931 and returned to write a book on his experiences, ''Dawn of Russia,'' published in 1932.<ref name=Casciato /> Frank also went to [[Harlan County, Kentucky]] in 1932 in support of striking coal miners on behalf of the Independent Miners Relief Committee, where he was attacked by [[vigilantes]] and forcibly removed from the strike area.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nBy the middle 1930s, Frank had moved close to the [[Communist Party, USA]] (CPUSA), culminating in his being tapped as speaker at the opening session of the founding convention of Communist-organized [[League of American Writers]] in April 1935.<ref name=Casciato /> Frank was subsequently elected as the chairman of that organization.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nDuring the [[1936 United States presidential election|United States Presidential election of 1936]], Frank was active in the ranks of [[Professional Groups for Browder and Ford]], working in support of the CPUSA ticket.<ref name=Casciato /> Frank's efforts on behalf of the Communist Party brought him some minor legal trouble when he was arrested together with CPUSA General Secretary [[Earl Browder]] when the two were campaigning in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] on September 30, 1936.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nIn January 1937, Frank went to Mexico to attend the congress of the [[League of Revolutionary Artists and Writers]].<ref name=Casciato /> There he interviewed [[Leon Trotsky]],<ref name=Casciato /> held by the [[Joseph Stalin]]-led world Communist movement to be the leader of an international conspiracy to sabotage and overthrow the government of the USSR and the Russian Revolution itself. Upon his return to the United States, Frank suggested in a letter to ''The New Republic'' that an international tribunal be established to investigate the merit or lack thereof regarding the charges made by the Soviet against Trotsky.<ref name=Casciato /> This brought a harsh reply from Earl Browder, leading to a break between Frank and the Communist Party and his denunciation by Browder at the Second Converess of the League of American Writers in June 1937.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nFrank largely removed himself from political activity during the 1950s until in the fall of 1959 he visited revolutionary Cuba and was impressed enough to temporarily accept the position of chairman of the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]].<ref name=Casciato /> He published his final book, ''Cuba: Prophetic Island,'' a sympathetic account of the [[Cuban revolution]], in 1961.<ref name=Casciato />\n\n===Hispanic cultural studies===\n\nWaldo Frank was regarded as a living cultural bridge between North America and Latin America.\n\nAlready believing in Hispanic spiritual values, Frank traveled to Spain in 1921. He published his cultural study, ''Virgin Spain'' (1926). He had envisioned that there needed to be an organic synthesis of the two Americas: North and South, Anglo and Hispanic. He thought that Spain had achieved a \"spiritual synthesis of its warring religions\" and could be \"an example of wholeness\" for the New World.<ref name=Ogorzaly13>Ogorzaly, ''Waldo Frank, Prophet of Hispanic Regeneration,'' pg. 13.</ref> Having also spent time in Spain, writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] mocked Frank's ideas in his novel, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' (1932).<ref>Miriam B. Mandel (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FYG3nXSivwoC&pg=PA260 ''A Companion to Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon.'']  Camden House, 2004; pg. 260.</ref>\n\nFrank's novel, ''Rediscovery of America'' (1929), also expressed some of his utopian ideas. After this and other novels were less commercially successful than he thought they deserved, Frank turned his attention to politics. His thesis about the spiritual strengths of Latin America won him wide acclaim when he toured there in 1929. His lecture tour was organized by the University of Mexico,<ref name=Ogorzaly13 /> as well as [[Argentinian people|Argentinian]] editor Samuel Glusberg and [[Peruvian people|Peruvian]] cultural theorist [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui]]. The latter had serialized parts of ''Rediscovery of America'' (without Frank's authorization) in the journal ''[[Amauta]]''.\n\nIt was in South America that Frank's literary influence was greatest. Due to his successful reception there, the [[United States State Department]] asked him to tour in 1942, to try to discourage alliances with the [[Nazi]] government in Germany during [[World War II]]. In 1942 while in Argentina, Frank denounced the pro-Nazi drift of the Argentine government, and it declared him a ''[[persona non-grata]]''.<ref>Frank A. Ninkovich, ''The Diplomacy of Ideas: U.S. Foreign Policy and Cultural Relations, 1938\u20131950.'' Cambridge University Press, 1981; pg. 44.</ref> During his stay in Buenos Aires, Frank was attacked in his apartment by six armed men in response to \"some opinions he expressed in regards to Argentine neutrality\" in the war. He was pistol whipped and repeatedly kicked in the head. He suffered a \"concussion of marked severity.\" The attack was believed to be the work of pro-Nazi sympathizers who posed as detectives checking to see if Frank's \"papers were in order.\" <ref>Cortesi, Arnold, The New York ''Times'' https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/08/03/issue.html</ref> \n\nBased on his travels in the region and continuing studies, Frank published ''South American Journey'' in 1943 and ''Birth of a World: Simon Bolivar in Terms of His Peoples'' in 1951.<ref>[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/frank.htm \"Waldo Frank Papers,\"] Special Collections, University of Delaware, www.lib.udel.edu/</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nWaldo Frank died  January 9, 1967 in [[White Plains, New York]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Expand list|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Books ===\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask= |title=The unwelcome man : a novel |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1917 |<!--lccn=17002340-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=Our America |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1919 |<!--lccn=19016552-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=The dark mother : a novel |url=https://archive.org/details/darkmotheranove01compgoog |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1920 |<!--lccn=20019046-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=City block |url=https://archive.org/details/cityblock00frangoog |location=Darien, Conn. |publisher=Waldo Frank |year=1922 |<!--lccn=22020427-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=Rahab |url=https://archive.org/details/rahab00fran |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1922 |<!--lccn=22004977-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=Holiday |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1923 |<!--lccn=23012748-->}}\n*''Chalk Face'' (1924)\n*''Virgin Spain: Scenes from the Spiritual Drama of a Great People'' (1926)\n*''The Rediscovery of America''.

The novel also drew upon the ideas of New England [[transcendentalist]] [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and the poet [[Walt Whitman]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 1916, Frank became associate editor of ''[[The Seven Arts]]'', a journal that ran for just twelve issues but became an important artistic and political influence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Its contributors were determined pacifists, a position that caused a decline in subscriptions and supporting funds. Contributors included [[Randolph Bourne]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], and [[James Oppenheim]], the founder and general editor of the magazine.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn January 1917, Frank married [[Margaret Naumburg]], a postgraduate pupil of [[John Dewey]]. She developed techniques which later became known as [[art therapy]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 1921 Frank met and became intense friends with the young writer, [[Jean Toomer]]. He served as editor for Toomer's first novel, ''Cane'' (1923), a modernist work combining poems and associated stories, inspired by his working in the rural South as a school principal at a black school. Toomer became an important figure in the [[Harlem Renaissance]]; of mixed-race and majority-white, complex ethnicity, he resisted being classified as a black writer and said he was \"an American\". They had a falling out and their friendship ended after 1923, due in part to an affair between Toomer and Naumburg.<ref>Kathleen Pfeiffer (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1hDLAbREMYEC&pg=PA2 ''Brother Mine: The Correspondence of Jean Toomer and Waldo Frank.''] Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2010; pg. 2.</ref>\n\nFrank became a regular contributor to the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' in 1925 under the pseudonym \"Search-Light\".\n\n===Political activity===\n\nFrank was an [[anti-militarism|anti-militarist]] and declared himself a [[conscientious objector]] in registering for [[conscription|the draft]] in 1917.<ref name=Casciato /> He became increasingly political during the 1920s, joining the liberal magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'' as a contributing editor in November 1925.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nIn 1929 together with fellow writers [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and others Frank worked to raise money for striking workers in Southern textile mills.<ref name=Casciato /> He toured the [[Soviet Union]] in the summer and early fall of 1931 and returned to write a book on his experiences, ''Dawn of Russia,'' published in 1932.<ref name=Casciato /> Frank also went to [[Harlan County, Kentucky]] in 1932 in support of striking coal miners on behalf of the Independent Miners Relief Committee, where he was attacked by [[vigilantes]] and forcibly removed from the strike area.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nBy the middle 1930s, Frank had moved close to the [[Communist Party, USA]] (CPUSA), culminating in his being tapped as speaker at the opening session of the founding convention of Communist-organized [[League of American Writers]] in April 1935.<ref name=Casciato /> Frank was subsequently elected as the chairman of that organization.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nDuring the [[1936 United States presidential election|United States Presidential election of 1936]], Frank was active in the ranks of [[Professional Groups for Browder and Ford]], working in support of the CPUSA ticket.<ref name=Casciato /> Frank's efforts on behalf of the Communist Party brought him some minor legal trouble when he was arrested together with CPUSA General Secretary [[Earl Browder]] when the two were campaigning in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]] on September 30, 1936.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nIn January 1937, Frank went to Mexico to attend the congress of the [[League of Revolutionary Artists and Writers]].<ref name=Casciato /> There he interviewed [[Leon Trotsky]],<ref name=Casciato /> held by the [[Joseph Stalin]]-led world Communist movement to be the leader of an international conspiracy to sabotage and overthrow the government of the USSR and the Russian Revolution itself. Upon his return to the United States, Frank suggested in a letter to ''The New Republic'' that an international tribunal be established to investigate the merit or lack thereof regarding the charges made by the Soviet against Trotsky.<ref name=Casciato /> This brought a harsh reply from Earl Browder, leading to a break between Frank and the Communist Party and his denunciation by Browder at the Second Converess of the League of American Writers in June 1937.<ref name=Casciato />\n\nFrank largely removed himself from political activity during the 1950s until in the fall of 1959 he visited revolutionary Cuba and was impressed enough to temporarily accept the position of chairman of the [[Fair Play for Cuba Committee]].<ref name=Casciato /> He published his final book, ''Cuba: Prophetic Island,'' a sympathetic account of the [[Cuban revolution]], in 1961.<ref name=Casciato />\n\n===Hispanic cultural studies===\n\nWaldo Frank was regarded as a living cultural bridge between North America and Latin America.\n\nAlready believing in Hispanic spiritual values, Frank traveled to Spain in 1921. He published his cultural study, ''Virgin Spain'' (1926). He had envisioned that there needed to be an organic synthesis of the two Americas: North and South, Anglo and Hispanic. He thought that Spain had achieved a \"spiritual synthesis of its warring religions\" and could be \"an example of wholeness\" for the New World.<ref name=Ogorzaly13>Ogorzaly, ''Waldo Frank, Prophet of Hispanic Regeneration,'' pg. 13.</ref> Having also spent time in Spain, writer [[Ernest Hemingway]] mocked Frank's ideas in his novel, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' (1932).<ref>Miriam B. Mandel (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=FYG3nXSivwoC&pg=PA260 ''A Companion to Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon.'']  Camden House, 2004; pg. 260.</ref>\n\nFrank's novel, ''Rediscovery of America'' (1929), also expressed some of his utopian ideas. After this and other novels were less commercially successful than he thought they deserved, Frank turned his attention to politics. His thesis about the spiritual strengths of Latin America won him wide acclaim when he toured there in 1929. His lecture tour was organized by the University of Mexico,<ref name=Ogorzaly13 /> as well as [[Argentinian people|Argentinian]] editor Samuel Glusberg and [[Peruvian people|Peruvian]] cultural theorist [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui]]. The latter had serialized parts of ''Rediscovery of America'' (without Frank's authorization) in the journal ''[[Amauta]]''.\n\nIt was in South America that Frank's literary influence was greatest. Due to his successful reception there, the [[United States State Department]] asked him to tour in 1942, to try to discourage alliances with the [[Nazi]] government in Germany during [[World War II]]. In 1942 while in Argentina, Frank denounced the pro-Nazi drift of the Argentine government, and it declared him a ''[[persona non-grata]]''.<ref>Frank A. Ninkovich, ''The Diplomacy of Ideas: U.S. Foreign Policy and Cultural Relations, 1938\u20131950.'' Cambridge University Press, 1981; pg. 44.</ref> During his stay in Buenos Aires, Frank was attacked in his apartment by six armed men in response to \"some opinions he expressed in regards to Argentine neutrality\" in the war. He was pistol whipped and repeatedly kicked in the head. He suffered a \"concussion of marked severity.\" The attack was believed to be the work of pro-Nazi sympathizers who posed as detectives checking to see if Frank's \"papers were in order.\" <ref>Cortesi, Arnold, The New York ''Times'' https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1942/08/03/issue.html</ref> \n\nBased on his travels in the region and continuing studies, Frank published ''South American Journey'' in 1943 and ''Birth of a World: Simon Bolivar in Terms of His Peoples'' in 1951.<ref>[http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/frank.htm \"Waldo Frank Papers,\"] Special Collections, University of Delaware, www.lib.udel.edu/</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nWaldo Frank died  January 9, 1967 in [[White Plains, New York]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Expand list|date=March 2017}}\n\n=== Books ===\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask= |title=The unwelcome man : a novel |location=Boston |publisher=Little, Brown |year=1917 |<!--lccn=17002340-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=Our America |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1919 |<!--lccn=19016552-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=The dark mother : a novel |url=https://archive.org/details/darkmotheranove01compgoog |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1920 |<!--lccn=20019046-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=City block |url=https://archive.org/details/cityblock00frangoog |location=Darien, Conn. |publisher=Waldo Frank |year=1922 |<!--lccn=22020427-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=Rahab |url=https://archive.org/details/rahab00fran |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1922 |<!--lccn=22004977-->}}\n*{{cite book |author=Frank, Waldo |authormask=1 |title=Holiday |location=New York |publisher=Boni & Liveright |year=1923 |<!--lccn=23012748-->}}\n*''Chalk Face'' (1924)\n*''Virgin Spain: Scenes from the Spiritual Drama of a Great People'' (1926)\n*''The Rediscovery of America''.

The story was originally written by [[David Seltzer]], who chose not to continue the series after the first [[novelization#film|novel]]. The second novel was then written by Joseph Howard; the third novel was done by Gordon McGill. After the third film was produced, a fourth and fifth were made-for-television in an attempt to revive the series, but they were received poorly.\n\nThe series centers on [[Damien Thorn]], a child born of [[Satan]] and given to Robert and Katherine Thorn, before being passed along the Thorn families as a child. It is revealed among the families that Damien is in fact meant to be the [[Antichrist]], and as an adult is attempting to gain control of the Thorn business and reach for the presidency.\n\nThree documentaries regarding the series have been made: ''666: The Omen - Revealed'' (2000), ''The Omen: Legacy'' (2001), and ''The Curse of The Omen'' (2005).\n\n==Films==\n''[[The Omen]]'' is the original film in the series, directed by [[Richard Donner]] and written by [[David Seltzer]]. The story introduces Robert Thorn, the American Ambassador in Italy who adopts the newborn [[Damien Thorn|Damien]] to replace the newborn that he was told was stillborn. When Damien reaches the age of five as Robert is transferred to Britain, strange events unfold, starting with the boy's nanny committing suicide during his birthday party. Soon afterward Robert encounters Father Brennan, a Catholic priest who was present at Damien's birth, who attempts to warn him that the child would eventually kill him and his wife; Brennan soon dies, impaled by a falling church spire. Only after Robert's wife Katherine ends up hospitalized with a miscarriage does he come to believe Brennan; Robert and a photographer named Jennings then travel to Rome, where they learn that Damien is the [[Antichrist]], and that the death of Robert's child was arranged so the Antichrist child could be raised by a politician. In the meantime, Katherine Thorn is murdered by Mrs. Baylock, Damien's second nanny, who in reality is a member of the Satanists who arranged Damien's upbringing, and will kill in order to suppress any threat to him. Arriving in [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] to find Bugenhagen, an exorcist and archaeologist, Robert is presented with the only means to kill Damien: the Seven Daggers of Megiddo. Though he initially refuses, it takes both the death of Jennings and discovering the [[Number of the Beast|Mark of the Beast]] on Damien's head to convince Robert to go through with it. But despite killing Mrs. Baylock after a struggle, Robert is killed by the authorities before he can kill Damien. Damien is then left in the care of his uncle, Richard Thorn.\n\nThe second film, ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' starts with Bugenhagen attempting to send Richard a package, but he and his friend Morris end up being buried alive in Megiddo.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Donner, Richard (Director) |year=1976 |title=The Omen |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=70171384}}</ref> The audience is then introduced to Richard's son Mark and his second wife Ann. Now a teenager, Damien attends [[military school]] alongside Mark while his subconscious, acting in the form of a raven, kills Richard's aunt Marion, Jennings's friend Joan Hart, and Thorn Industries manager Bill Atherton. Atherton's death is beneficial for senior manager Paul Buher, another member of the Satanist group Baylock was part of. Another member, Sgt. Neff, guides Damien to learn his true nature by advising him to read the [[Book of Revelation]]. Though fearful of it at first, unconsciously killing Dr. David Pasarian and a medical physician who tested his blood, Damien comes to accept his fate as he begins to consciously kill anyone who stands in his way, including his cousin Mark and Dr. Charles Warren. Though Richard accepted the truth upon receiving the Daggers of Megiddo from Bugenhagen's package, he is murdered by Ann before Damien kills her despite being one of his disciples.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Taylor, Don and Hodges, Mike (Directors) |year=1978 |title=Damien: Omen II |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=45111331}}</ref>\n\nThe third film, ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]'', follows the adult Damien, now head of his uncle's company and arranging his position as American Ambassador in Britain to prevent the [[Second Coming]]\u2014which would gradually weaken his powers\u2014by having his followers slaughter every male British child born on March 24. Though he managed to kill six of the seven monks who each brandish a Dagger of Megiddo, their leader Father DeCarlo lives. Damien unknowingly causes his own downfall by his association with a journalist named Kate Reynolds who kills him at his moment of weakness. But as Damien's death did not occur in the manner that Bugenhagen learned, the Antichrist only suffered a temporary demise.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Baker, Graham (Director) |year=1981 |title=Omen III: The Final Conflict |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=45273673}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth and final film of the original series, ''[[Omen IV: The Awakening]]'', it is revealed that Damien's followers arranged for his biological daughter Delia to be adopted by two attorneys, Gene and Karen York. While nothing seems wrong at first, compared to her father, Delia is fully aware of her powers as she terrorizes her mother Karen. Karen finds herself pregnant and hires a detective to find out about Delia's lineage. A string of bizarre accidental deaths follows, before Karen gives birth to her son Alexander while falling into a paranoia as she tries to reveal her daughter's true identity. Though she learned that Delia is the daughter of Damien Thorn while holding her family doctor Hastings at gunpoint, upon learning he is a Satanist, Karen learns that the reborn Antichrist is actually Alexander: Delia's twin brother whose embryo was implanted into Karen. Though Karen was adamant to kill Alexander, she ended up committing suicide, leaving Alexander and Delia still alive to continue their birth father's work.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Montesi, Jorge and Othenin-Girard, Dominique (Directors) |year=1991 |title=Omen IV: The Awakening |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=76878002}}</ref>\n\nThe 2006 remake of the first film, also titled ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'', was directed and produced by [[John Moore (film director)|John Moore]].

The story was originally written by [[David Seltzer]], who chose not to continue the series after the first [[novelization#film|novel]]. The second novel was then written by Joseph Howard; the third novel was done by Gordon McGill. After the third film was produced, a fourth and fifth were made-for-television in an attempt to revive the series, but they were received poorly.\n\nThe series centers on [[Damien Thorn]], a child born of [[Satan]] and given to Robert and Katherine Thorn, before being passed along the Thorn families as a child. It is revealed among the families that Damien is in fact meant to be the [[Antichrist]], and as an adult is attempting to gain control of the Thorn business and reach for the presidency.\n\nThree documentaries regarding the series have been made: ''666: The Omen - Revealed'' (2000), ''The Omen: Legacy'' (2001), and ''The Curse of The Omen'' (2005).\n\n==Films==\n''[[The Omen]]'' is the original film in the series, directed by [[Richard Donner]] and written by [[David Seltzer]]. The story introduces Robert Thorn, the American Ambassador in Italy who adopts the newborn [[Damien Thorn|Damien]] to replace the newborn that he was told was stillborn. When Damien reaches the age of five as Robert is transferred to Britain, strange events unfold, starting with the boy's nanny committing suicide during his birthday party. Soon afterward Robert encounters Father Brennan, a Catholic priest who was present at Damien's birth, who attempts to warn him that the child would eventually kill him and his wife; Brennan soon dies, impaled by a falling church spire. Only after Robert's wife Katherine ends up hospitalized with a miscarriage does he come to believe Brennan; Robert and a photographer named Jennings then travel to Rome, where they learn that Damien is the [[Antichrist]], and that the death of Robert's child was arranged so the Antichrist child could be raised by a politician. In the meantime, Katherine Thorn is murdered by Mrs. Baylock, Damien's second nanny, who in reality is a member of the Satanists who arranged Damien's upbringing, and will kill in order to suppress any threat to him. Arriving in [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] to find Bugenhagen, an exorcist and archaeologist, Robert is presented with the only means to kill Damien: the Seven Daggers of Megiddo. Though he initially refuses, it takes both the death of Jennings and discovering the [[Number of the Beast|Mark of the Beast]] on Damien's head to convince Robert to go through with it. But despite killing Mrs. Baylock after a struggle, Robert is killed by the authorities before he can kill Damien. Damien is then left in the care of his uncle, Richard Thorn.\n\nThe second film, ''[[Damien: Omen II]]'' starts with Bugenhagen attempting to send Richard a package, but he and his friend Morris end up being buried alive in Megiddo.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Donner, Richard (Director) |year=1976 |title=The Omen |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=70171384}}</ref> The audience is then introduced to Richard's son Mark and his second wife Ann. Now a teenager, Damien attends [[military school]] alongside Mark while his subconscious, acting in the form of a raven, kills Richard's aunt Marion, Jennings's friend Joan Hart, and Thorn Industries manager Bill Atherton. Atherton's death is beneficial for senior manager Paul Buher, another member of the Satanist group Baylock was part of. Another member, Sgt. Neff, guides Damien to learn his true nature by advising him to read the [[Book of Revelation]]. Though fearful of it at first, unconsciously killing Dr. David Pasarian and a medical physician who tested his blood, Damien comes to accept his fate as he begins to consciously kill anyone who stands in his way, including his cousin Mark and Dr. Charles Warren. Though Richard accepted the truth upon receiving the Daggers of Megiddo from Bugenhagen's package, he is murdered by Ann before Damien kills her despite being one of his disciples.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Taylor, Don and Hodges, Mike (Directors) |year=1978 |title=Damien: Omen II |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=45111331}}</ref>\n\nThe third film, ''[[Omen III: The Final Conflict]]'', follows the adult Damien, now head of his uncle's company and arranging his position as American Ambassador in Britain to prevent the [[Second Coming]]\u2014which would gradually weaken his powers\u2014by having his followers slaughter every male British child born on March 24. Though he managed to kill six of the seven monks who each brandish a Dagger of Megiddo, their leader Father DeCarlo lives. Damien unknowingly causes his own downfall by his association with a journalist named Kate Reynolds who kills him at his moment of weakness. But as Damien's death did not occur in the manner that Bugenhagen learned, the Antichrist only suffered a temporary demise.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Baker, Graham (Director) |year=1981 |title=Omen III: The Final Conflict |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=45273673}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth and final film of the original series, ''[[Omen IV: The Awakening]]'', it is revealed that Damien's followers arranged for his biological daughter Delia to be adopted by two attorneys, Gene and Karen York. While nothing seems wrong at first, compared to her father, Delia is fully aware of her powers as she terrorizes her mother Karen. Karen finds herself pregnant and hires a detective to find out about Delia's lineage. A string of bizarre accidental deaths follows, before Karen gives birth to her son Alexander while falling into a paranoia as she tries to reveal her daughter's true identity. Though she learned that Delia is the daughter of Damien Thorn while holding her family doctor Hastings at gunpoint, upon learning he is a Satanist, Karen learns that the reborn Antichrist is actually Alexander: Delia's twin brother whose embryo was implanted into Karen. Though Karen was adamant to kill Alexander, she ended up committing suicide, leaving Alexander and Delia still alive to continue their birth father's work.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Montesi, Jorge and Othenin-Girard, Dominique (Directors) |year=1991 |title=Omen IV: The Awakening |medium=DVD |publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=Beverly Hills, CA |oclc=76878002}}</ref>\n\nThe 2006 remake of the first film, also titled ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'', was directed and produced by [[John Moore (film director)|John Moore]]. Starring [[Liev Schreiber]] and [[Julia Stiles]], the film was met with mixed reviews but with general box office success.

In 1949 he was awarded a fellowship to study in Europe, where he was to spend the rest of his life. He lived in France and Germany, and travelled widely throughout the Continent. Cohen and his first wife, Virginia Adler, lived in Sam Francis' old studio on the Boulevard Arago in Paris, where he studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n== Artistic career ==\nCohen's work was representational and figurative, owing most to Dufy, Bonnard, Chagall, Kokoschka, Rouault and Soutine. His favourite subjects were ports and river banks, vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits. .\n\nIn the 1950s he had one-man exhibitions in Germany and Paris. French critics described him as an 'intimist', 'ranking among our best painters',<ref>Masques et Visages, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation</ref> and hailing his paintings as 'good, direct and natural'.<ref>Le Peintre, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> In 1958 he had his first one-man exhibition at the Ben Uri in London, where two years later he decided to settle. His exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery in 1960 was the first of several sell-out shows in Britain.\n\nHe had already met with considerable success in Germany and France. But with the large, ambitious, shimmering canvases of his ''Aspects of the Thames'' exhibition in 1961 Cohen really began to win critical acclaim in Britain too. \n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.jpg|frame|Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation]]\n\nThe young Anita Brookner wrote in the ''Burlington Magazine'' that he was 'a fresh and accessible artist of considerable accomplishment, whose abstract impressionist compositions were enlivened by an acute charm of colour'.<ref>Anita Brookner, Burlington Magazine, 1961</ref> ''The Tatler'' admired 'the rich sense of colour that makes his work immediately striking and lastingly memorable' and again noted the combination of abstract design and representation which remained important throughout his career: 'Look . . . at almost any few square inches of a Cohen canvas and you have a little gem of abstract painting'.<ref>Robert Wraight, Tatler, 1961</ref> Edward Lucie-Smith, in ''Arts Review'', found the paintings 'strikingly well constructed', adding: 'the architecture is nearly always firm and logical. . . . I admire these pictures most as virtuoso demonstrations of technical skill. They have immense panache and glitter, and yet they are self-consistent'.<ref>Edward Lucie-Smith, Arts Review, 1961</ref> The ''New Daily'' appreciated the 'visionary quality' of their effects of light.<ref>C. R. Cammell, New Daily, 1961.</ref>\n\nCohen followed this with an even more successful exhibition at the Brook Street Gallery in 1963, on the theme of the ''commedia dell'arte.'' The ''Daily Telegraph'' described the technical achievement of his images as 'formidable', and declared him 'one of the best draughtsmen at work today', adding that 'Only Picasso in one or two early works has in our time touched such depths through the characters of the ''Commedia dell'Arte'.''<ref>Terence Mullaly, Daily Telegraph, October 1963.</ref> Conroy Maddox, wrote in ''Arts Review'' that 'The paintings are a show of force and theatricality. . . . Cohen has certainly gained a sensuous richness and a robust and vigorous way of handling his material'.<ref>Conroy Maddox, Arts Review, 1963.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Polichinelle (Red Punch)', 1963, acrylic on hardboard, 40 x 30 in; 101.6 x 76.2 cm. Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.jpg|thumb|left|Alfred Cohen, 'Polichinelle (Red Punch)', 1963, acrylic on hardboard, 40 x 30 in; 101.6 x 76.2 cm. Alfred Cohen Art Foundation]]\n\nThe inspiration of the ''commedia dell'arte'' was to recur throughout Cohen's work. But once again he resisted the temptation to repeat a successful formula, and completely reinvented his painting yet again. Now he turned his attention to the landscape of Kent, where he settled with his second wife, Diana Saunders, in 1963. His exhibition of 'Recent Paintings' at the Brook Street Gallery in 1965 sounded a note that was to remain important in Cohen's work, focusing on the English countryside and country people. His attraction to Britain never waned. 'I don't want to leave it. America is no longer my home. I feel more of a foreigner there than I do anywhere in Europe.'<ref>Philip Oakes, 'Cohen GB', Sunday Times (29 Dec 1968)' clipping in Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> But he was also attempting to capture the features of the land that most perplexed him. First, its postwar air of decline: 'It is crumbling from the inside, and crumbling in style. It's elegant, but there's danger in the elegance.' But also the challenge represented by its crowded seclusion. As the writer Philip Oakes explains: 'He evolved a new style, using paint like a sculptor, laying down slabs of colour, carving it with his brush so that the fields and hedges and houses seemed to be hewn from the canvas'.<ref name=\"auto2\">Oakes, 'Cohen GB'.</ref>\n\nHis British landscapes were well-received too, with critics continuing to praise his compositional intelligence. ''Pictures on Exhibit'' said:\n\nThere are very few artists of today's generation with the ability to synthesise the quality of 20th Century Ecole de l'Europe in the sense that the late impressionists and the post-impressionists did it for their epoch. Alfred Cohen is one of them, and maybe this explains his success with a wide category of collectors. Their enthusiasm is unstinting . . . . These are recognizably contemporary paintings. C\u00e9zanne's tough palette is neatly handled and we are charmed without experiencing for a split-second any doubt that these are really good paintings. . . . There are few enough painters like him nowadays; hardly one capable of capturing the British scene in such an attractive and authoritative way.<ref>P. Sheldon-Williams, Pictures on Exhibit, 1965; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref>\n\nCohen had nine one-man exhibitions in London, and others in Heidelberg, Hannover, Paris, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo, Cape Town, Belfast, and many other cities and towns in England, including Cambridge, York, Harrogate, Leeds, Rye, and King's Lynn. He had two-person exhibitions with Josef Herman, Patrick Hall, and Mary Newcomb. And his work was also included in many international mixed exhibitions, such as one at the U.S. Embassy in London of 'Five Americans in Britain', with R. B. Kitaj and others.\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Near Goudhurst', 1965, oil on board, 9.75 x 11.in; 24.8 x 29.9 cm. Private Collection.jpg|thumb|right|Alfred Cohen, 'Near Goudhurst', 1965, oil on board, 9.75 x 11.in; 24.8 x 29.9 cm. Private Collection.]]\n\nIn the late 1960s he joined Roland, Browse and Delbanco, in Cork Street, which combined exhibitions of artists such as Rodin and Matthew Smith with work from contemporary artists such as Phillip Sutton, Keith Grant and Cohen's friend Josef Herman. The first of his four exhibitions there was in 1969. It continued the exploration of the country. 'He was always effective and satisfying', wrote the ''Jewish Chronicle'', 'but his Kentish landscapes have been a consistent breakthrough . . . . He has things in common with several good artists, but most noticeable with what de Stael might have painted had he been able to sustain himself at his best. For Cohen now uses that thick impasto in jewel-like colour-blocks that are subtly balanced. The variety of blues and greens, and of reds, that he can weigh in his balance is astonishing'.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 1969; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> But he also began to return to the Channel coast, seen from both sides, and in new ways. James Burr, in ''Apollo'', noted:\n\nMany subjects have engaged the expressionist fervour of Alfred Cohen; in these recent paintings, the boats and houses of the coastlines of France predominate. He reacts with a fierce passion to direct experience that is organized into a formal structure. . . . His emotional power and exuberantly vigorous response infuses his paintings with an intensity that makes much contemporary expressionism look feeble.<ref>James Burr, Apollo, 1969.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Coastal Picture', 1966, oil on board, 8 x 10 in; 20.3 x 25.4 cm. Private Collection.jpg|thumb|left|Alfred Cohen, 'Coastal Picture', 1966, oil on board, 8 x 10 in; 20.3 x 25.4 cm. Private Collection.]]\n\nIt was this return to coastal paintings that was to characterize much of his later work. Marina Vaizey reviewed his second show at Roland, Browse and Delbanco in 1972 for the ''Financial Times'', commenting on how the works 'play on the borders of abstract and representational art', and noting: 'He is particularly fond of a deep range of blues, and sea-greens, and the compositions have a deliberate naivet\u00e9 that is charming but never cloying'.<ref>Marina Vaizey, Financial Times, 1972.</ref> The ''Jewish Chronicle'' said: 'Like Marquet, Cohen paints beautifully, but more warmly. . . a man who is passionately concerned about painting well, and who has also a first-rate sense of colour, deep and rich, belonging to the earth and the sea'.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 1972; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> Of Cohen's last exhibition with Roland's in 1976, Brian Wallworth wrote in ''Arts Review:''\n\nPaintings and drawings of astonishing vivacity and assurance. . . . Each one is a fully resolved picture of an obviously very intense visual sensation felt by the artist. . . . delicious . . . What a perceptive, revealing and loving eye this American turns on the people, places and atmospheres of Kent! . . . there is a fine wildness about Cohen's pictures that instantly commands attention. . . .<ref>Brian Wallworth, Arts Review, 1976.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Folkestone', 1974-75, oil on hardboard, 16 x 20 in; 40.6 x 50.8 cm. Private Collection.jpg|thumb|right|Alfred Cohen, 'Folkestone', 1974-75, oil on hardboard, 16 x 20 in; 40.6 x 50.8 cm. Private Collection.]]\n\nThat exhibition represented yet another new departure. As Peter Stone wrote: 'Alfred Cohen is unique. I can think of no other artist whom I have followed since his beginning and found to be literally better in each succeeding exhibition. . . . Here is a new line of free and easy drawings of characters like cartoons. You can't pass them without a chuckle'.<ref>Peter Stone, Jewish Chronicle, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s Cohen took up print-making. His hand-coloured etchings, often of flowers, were sold worldwide. He also turned his sense of space and design to the renovation of houses. In 1978 he and Diana moved to Wighton, north Norfolk, where they converted an old schoolhouse into a studio, print workshop, and art gallery. They later discovered that this was the house where Henry Moore had lived as an art student in the 1920s, and where he had begun to sculpt. When landscaping the garden, the Cohens unearthed a marble carving that had been left unfinished and they returned it to Moore.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ian Collins, Guardian (7 March 2001), 24.</ref>\n\nLike many painters, he loved the light in Norfolk, its skies, and above all its coast. He often exhibited there. Tony Warner found his exhibition at the King's Lynn arts centre in 1991 'invigorating', describing how it: 'glows with colour. . . . There is an obvious joy in the visual world. . . . each painting is carefully crafted. Layers of paint build up to an intricate pattern of complementary colours. The structures are worked out with an almost mathematical precision, each part firmly measured against the painting as a whole'.<ref>Tony Warner, Eastern Daily Press, 1991.</ref> Of his only one-man exhibition at the School House Gallery, in 1994, the ''Eastern Daily Press'' commented: 'Alfred Cohen is recognized as one of the finest colourists and draughtsmen living in England. . . .'<ref>Colin Chinery, Eastern Daily Press, 1994.</ref> His collectors latterly included Sir Keith Joseph, Judge Stephen Tumim, Lord and Lady Norwich, and John Madden.\n\nCohen continued painting, drawing, etching, and producing screenprints, collages, and assemblages up until his death, on 25 January 2001 at King's Lynn. While the paint surfaces became flatter, less illusionistic, their materiality more insistent, his attention to effects of light, water, and colour, was as intense as ever.\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Catia\u2019s Terrace, 1991, oil on canvas, 22 x 25 in; 55.9 x 63.5 cm.

Private Collection.]]\n\n== Reception ==\nObituaries appeared in all the major broadsheets. ''The Times'' praised his 'vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits', as well as his 'evocative scenes of the Thames'.<ref>Times (5 March 2001), 21.</ref> ''The Independent'' recalled that 'Once in Europe he . . . made his reputation in its galleries, where his unmistakably chunky, jewel-like canvases were for several decades much sought-after'.<ref>David Buckman, Independent (26 April 2001), The Thursday Review, 6.</ref> The ''Daily Telegraph'' concurred, recording how 'His work became increasingly sought after, by such notable collectors as James Mason, Stanley Baker, and Sam Wanamaker', adding: 'A gregarious man, and a friend to many other artists, Cohen also possessed a photographic memory and an encyclopaedic knowledge of Hollywood cinema. His conversation, like his art, bubbled with wit and satire. He hated pomposity or prejudice and was passionately liberal in his beliefs'.<ref>Obituary, Daily Telegraph (8 February 2001), 31.</ref> The ''Jewish Chronicle'' described how he 'produced a prodigious number of vibrant and colourful paintings. . . . Well received in France, he was equally acclaimed when he moved to London. . . . His hand-coloured etchings . . . were popular in Europe, the US and Japan'.<ref>Jewish Chronicle (9 March 2001), 29.</ref> And the ''Guardian'' called him 'a brilliant colourist and deft draughtsman', admiring his 'vibrant oils of the Seine, the Thames and the Channel ports, and some telling portraits', as well as his 'restless energy' and the wit of his cartoons and constructions.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nTwo retrospective exhibitions have since been held: the first at the School House Gallery from May\u2013June 2001; the second at the London Jewish Cultural Centre from October 2001 \u2013 March 2002. Derek Gillman, Director of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, wrote for the first: 'He was a grand artist, a great colourist, a forceful designer, and a highly acute observer of places and people. He also made very fine prints, with the same intelligence and wit.'<ref>Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> Lady Vaizey, opening the London exhibition, spoke of how Cohen's work was 'filled with warmth, life, affection, pleasure in the beauties and good realities of the present day'. Howard Jacobson, in the ''Independent'', praised his 'wonderfully violent paintings':\n\nhe painted sensuously, in paint rather than in epigrams, and, like many of the best artists still alive in the last quarter of the 20th century, had to take a back seat to that institutionalised facetiousness we know as conceptualism. . . . It should, of course, be Tate Modern that exhibits him, but he's a little hot for their whitened aesthetic. . . . And not only too hot, but too possessed of the satiric daemon. For me, although you can see the influences of Vuillard and Kokoschka and Soutine on Cohen, his best work has Daumier behind it, the vigorousness of caricature and the savage grotesqueries of the commedia dell'arte. . .<ref>Howard Jacobson, The Independent, 02 February 2002, The Weekend Review, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'The Entrance of Punch', 1963, oil on canvas, 40 x 32 in; 101.6 x 81.3 cm.

But with the large, ambitious, shimmering canvases of his ''Aspects of the Thames'' exhibition in 1961 Cohen really began to win critical acclaim in Britain too. \n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.jpg|frame|Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation]]\n\nThe young Anita Brookner wrote in the ''Burlington Magazine'' that he was 'a fresh and accessible artist of considerable accomplishment, whose abstract impressionist compositions were enlivened by an acute charm of colour'.<ref>Anita Brookner, Burlington Magazine, 1961</ref> ''The Tatler'' admired 'the rich sense of colour that makes his work immediately striking and lastingly memorable' and again noted the combination of abstract design and representation which remained important throughout his career: 'Look . . . at almost any few square inches of a Cohen canvas and you have a little gem of abstract painting'.<ref>Robert Wraight, Tatler, 1961</ref> Edward Lucie-Smith, in ''Arts Review'', found the paintings 'strikingly well constructed', adding: 'the architecture is nearly always firm and logical. . . . I admire these pictures most as virtuoso demonstrations of technical skill. They have immense panache and glitter, and yet they are self-consistent'.<ref>Edward Lucie-Smith, Arts Review, 1961</ref> The ''New Daily'' appreciated the 'visionary quality' of their effects of light.<ref>C. R. Cammell, New Daily, 1961.</ref>\n\nCohen followed this with an even more successful exhibition at the Brook Street Gallery in 1963, on the theme of the ''commedia dell'arte.'' The ''Daily Telegraph'' described the technical achievement of his images as 'formidable', and declared him 'one of the best draughtsmen at work today', adding that 'Only Picasso in one or two early works has in our time touched such depths through the characters of the ''Commedia dell'Arte'.''<ref>Terence Mullaly, Daily Telegraph, October 1963.</ref> Conroy Maddox, wrote in ''Arts Review'' that 'The paintings are a show of force and theatricality. . . . Cohen has certainly gained a sensuous richness and a robust and vigorous way of handling his material'.<ref>Conroy Maddox, Arts Review, 1963.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Polichinelle (Red Punch)', 1963, acrylic on hardboard, 40 x 30 in; 101.6 x 76.2 cm. Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.jpg|thumb|left|Alfred Cohen, 'Polichinelle (Red Punch)', 1963, acrylic on hardboard, 40 x 30 in; 101.6 x 76.2 cm. Alfred Cohen Art Foundation]]\n\nThe inspiration of the ''commedia dell'arte'' was to recur throughout Cohen's work. But once again he resisted the temptation to repeat a successful formula, and completely reinvented his painting yet again. Now he turned his attention to the landscape of Kent, where he settled with his second wife, Diana Saunders, in 1963. His exhibition of 'Recent Paintings' at the Brook Street Gallery in 1965 sounded a note that was to remain important in Cohen's work, focusing on the English countryside and country people. His attraction to Britain never waned. 'I don't want to leave it. America is no longer my home. I feel more of a foreigner there than I do anywhere in Europe.'<ref>Philip Oakes, 'Cohen GB', Sunday Times (29 Dec 1968)' clipping in Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> But he was also attempting to capture the features of the land that most perplexed him. First, its postwar air of decline: 'It is crumbling from the inside, and crumbling in style. It's elegant, but there's danger in the elegance.' But also the challenge represented by its crowded seclusion. As the writer Philip Oakes explains: 'He evolved a new style, using paint like a sculptor, laying down slabs of colour, carving it with his brush so that the fields and hedges and houses seemed to be hewn from the canvas'.<ref name=\"auto2\">Oakes, 'Cohen GB'.</ref>\n\nHis British landscapes were well-received too, with critics continuing to praise his compositional intelligence. ''Pictures on Exhibit'' said:\n\nThere are very few artists of today's generation with the ability to synthesise the quality of 20th Century Ecole de l'Europe in the sense that the late impressionists and the post-impressionists did it for their epoch. Alfred Cohen is one of them, and maybe this explains his success with a wide category of collectors. Their enthusiasm is unstinting . . . . These are recognizably contemporary paintings. C\u00e9zanne's tough palette is neatly handled and we are charmed without experiencing for a split-second any doubt that these are really good paintings. . . . There are few enough painters like him nowadays; hardly one capable of capturing the British scene in such an attractive and authoritative way.<ref>P. Sheldon-Williams, Pictures on Exhibit, 1965; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref>\n\nCohen had nine one-man exhibitions in London, and others in Heidelberg, Hannover, Paris, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo, Cape Town, Belfast, and many other cities and towns in England, including Cambridge, York, Harrogate, Leeds, Rye, and King's Lynn. He had two-person exhibitions with Josef Herman, Patrick Hall, and Mary Newcomb. And his work was also included in many international mixed exhibitions, such as one at the U.S. Embassy in London of 'Five Americans in Britain', with R. B. Kitaj and others.\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Near Goudhurst', 1965, oil on board, 9.75 x 11.in; 24.8 x 29.9 cm. Private Collection.jpg|thumb|right|Alfred Cohen, 'Near Goudhurst', 1965, oil on board, 9.75 x 11.in; 24.8 x 29.9 cm. Private Collection.]]\n\nIn the late 1960s he joined Roland, Browse and Delbanco, in Cork Street, which combined exhibitions of artists such as Rodin and Matthew Smith with work from contemporary artists such as Phillip Sutton, Keith Grant and Cohen's friend Josef Herman. The first of his four exhibitions there was in 1969. It continued the exploration of the country. 'He was always effective and satisfying', wrote the ''Jewish Chronicle'', 'but his Kentish landscapes have been a consistent breakthrough . . . . He has things in common with several good artists, but most noticeable with what de Stael might have painted had he been able to sustain himself at his best. For Cohen now uses that thick impasto in jewel-like colour-blocks that are subtly balanced. The variety of blues and greens, and of reds, that he can weigh in his balance is astonishing'.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 1969; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> But he also began to return to the Channel coast, seen from both sides, and in new ways. James Burr, in ''Apollo'', noted:\n\nMany subjects have engaged the expressionist fervour of Alfred Cohen; in these recent paintings, the boats and houses of the coastlines of France predominate. He reacts with a fierce passion to direct experience that is organized into a formal structure. . . . His emotional power and exuberantly vigorous response infuses his paintings with an intensity that makes much contemporary expressionism look feeble.<ref>James Burr, Apollo, 1969.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Coastal Picture', 1966, oil on board, 8 x 10 in; 20.3 x 25.4 cm. Private Collection.jpg|thumb|left|Alfred Cohen, 'Coastal Picture', 1966, oil on board, 8 x 10 in; 20.3 x 25.4 cm. Private Collection.]]\n\nIt was this return to coastal paintings that was to characterize much of his later work. Marina Vaizey reviewed his second show at Roland, Browse and Delbanco in 1972 for the ''Financial Times'', commenting on how the works 'play on the borders of abstract and representational art', and noting: 'He is particularly fond of a deep range of blues, and sea-greens, and the compositions have a deliberate naivet\u00e9 that is charming but never cloying'.<ref>Marina Vaizey, Financial Times, 1972.</ref> The ''Jewish Chronicle'' said: 'Like Marquet, Cohen paints beautifully, but more warmly. . . a man who is passionately concerned about painting well, and who has also a first-rate sense of colour, deep and rich, belonging to the earth and the sea'.<ref>Jewish Chronicle, 1972; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> Of Cohen's last exhibition with Roland's in 1976, Brian Wallworth wrote in ''Arts Review:''\n\nPaintings and drawings of astonishing vivacity and assurance. . . . Each one is a fully resolved picture of an obviously very intense visual sensation felt by the artist. . . . delicious . . . What a perceptive, revealing and loving eye this American turns on the people, places and atmospheres of Kent! . . . there is a fine wildness about Cohen's pictures that instantly commands attention. . . .<ref>Brian Wallworth, Arts Review, 1976.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Folkestone', 1974-75, oil on hardboard, 16 x 20 in; 40.6 x 50.8 cm. Private Collection.jpg|thumb|right|Alfred Cohen, 'Folkestone', 1974-75, oil on hardboard, 16 x 20 in; 40.6 x 50.8 cm. Private Collection.]]\n\nThat exhibition represented yet another new departure. As Peter Stone wrote: 'Alfred Cohen is unique. I can think of no other artist whom I have followed since his beginning and found to be literally better in each succeeding exhibition. . . . Here is a new line of free and easy drawings of characters like cartoons. You can't pass them without a chuckle'.<ref>Peter Stone, Jewish Chronicle, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s Cohen took up print-making. His hand-coloured etchings, often of flowers, were sold worldwide. He also turned his sense of space and design to the renovation of houses. In 1978 he and Diana moved to Wighton, north Norfolk, where they converted an old schoolhouse into a studio, print workshop, and art gallery. They later discovered that this was the house where Henry Moore had lived as an art student in the 1920s, and where he had begun to sculpt. When landscaping the garden, the Cohens unearthed a marble carving that had been left unfinished and they returned it to Moore.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ian Collins, Guardian (7 March 2001), 24.</ref>\n\nLike many painters, he loved the light in Norfolk, its skies, and above all its coast. He often exhibited there. Tony Warner found his exhibition at the King's Lynn arts centre in 1991 'invigorating', describing how it: 'glows with colour. . . . There is an obvious joy in the visual world. . . . each painting is carefully crafted. Layers of paint build up to an intricate pattern of complementary colours. The structures are worked out with an almost mathematical precision, each part firmly measured against the painting as a whole'.<ref>Tony Warner, Eastern Daily Press, 1991.</ref> Of his only one-man exhibition at the School House Gallery, in 1994, the ''Eastern Daily Press'' commented: 'Alfred Cohen is recognized as one of the finest colourists and draughtsmen living in England. . . .'<ref>Colin Chinery, Eastern Daily Press, 1994.</ref> His collectors latterly included Sir Keith Joseph, Judge Stephen Tumim, Lord and Lady Norwich, and John Madden.\n\nCohen continued painting, drawing, etching, and producing screenprints, collages, and assemblages up until his death, on 25 January 2001 at King's Lynn. While the paint surfaces became flatter, less illusionistic, their materiality more insistent, his attention to effects of light, water, and colour, was as intense as ever.\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Catia\u2019s Terrace, 1991, oil on canvas, 22 x 25 in; 55.9 x 63.5 cm.

''The Times'' praised his 'vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits', as well as his 'evocative scenes of the Thames'.<ref>Times (5 March 2001), 21.</ref> ''The Independent'' recalled that 'Once in Europe he . . . made his reputation in its galleries, where his unmistakably chunky, jewel-like canvases were for several decades much sought-after'.<ref>David Buckman, Independent (26 April 2001), The Thursday Review, 6.</ref> The ''Daily Telegraph'' concurred, recording how 'His work became increasingly sought after, by such notable collectors as James Mason, Stanley Baker, and Sam Wanamaker', adding: 'A gregarious man, and a friend to many other artists, Cohen also possessed a photographic memory and an encyclopaedic knowledge of Hollywood cinema. His conversation, like his art, bubbled with wit and satire. He hated pomposity or prejudice and was passionately liberal in his beliefs'.<ref>Obituary, Daily Telegraph (8 February 2001), 31.</ref> The ''Jewish Chronicle'' described how he 'produced a prodigious number of vibrant and colourful paintings. . . . Well received in France, he was equally acclaimed when he moved to London. . . . His hand-coloured etchings . . . were popular in Europe, the US and Japan'.<ref>Jewish Chronicle (9 March 2001), 29.</ref> And the ''Guardian'' called him 'a brilliant colourist and deft draughtsman', admiring his 'vibrant oils of the Seine, the Thames and the Channel ports, and some telling portraits', as well as his 'restless energy' and the wit of his cartoons and constructions.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nTwo retrospective exhibitions have since been held: the first at the School House Gallery from May\u2013June 2001; the second at the London Jewish Cultural Centre from October 2001 \u2013 March 2002. Derek Gillman, Director of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, wrote for the first: 'He was a grand artist, a great colourist, a forceful designer, and a highly acute observer of places and people. He also made very fine prints, with the same intelligence and wit.'<ref>Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> Lady Vaizey, opening the London exhibition, spoke of how Cohen's work was 'filled with warmth, life, affection, pleasure in the beauties and good realities of the present day'. Howard Jacobson, in the ''Independent'', praised his 'wonderfully violent paintings':\n\nhe painted sensuously, in paint rather than in epigrams, and, like many of the best artists still alive in the last quarter of the 20th century, had to take a back seat to that institutionalised facetiousness we know as conceptualism. . . . It should, of course, be Tate Modern that exhibits him, but he's a little hot for their whitened aesthetic. . . . And not only too hot, but too possessed of the satiric daemon. For me, although you can see the influences of Vuillard and Kokoschka and Soutine on Cohen, his best work has Daumier behind it, the vigorousness of caricature and the savage grotesqueries of the commedia dell'arte. . .<ref>Howard Jacobson, The Independent, 02 February 2002, The Weekend Review, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'The Entrance of Punch', 1963, oil on canvas, 40 x 32 in; 101.6 x 81.3 cm.

It is a story in the [[Robin Hood]] canon which has survived as, among other forms, a late seventeenth-century English [[broadside]] [[ballad]], and is one of several ballads about the medieval folk hero that form part of the [[Child ballad]] collection, which is one of the most comprehensive collections of traditional English ballads.fgyjggfufiftf\n\nFlubby [[Robin Hood]] is twenty years old he meets another brisk and fit young man named [[Little John]]. Although called \"little\", John is seven feet tall, largelimbed, and fearsome to behold. This is the story of how they met: Robin is out and about with his men and leaves them on call to rove the forest on his own in search of \"[s]port\" (5.1). In his roving, Robin meets a stranger on a bridge over a brook who won't give way. They challenge each other with their respective weapons, and the stranger remarks it's unfair that Robin has a bow and arrows while he has only a staff, so Robin agrees to take up a staff for the fight. He goes to a thicket and chooses a thick oaken staff, then runs back to the bridge where they agree to fight with their staffs until one of them falls off. They fight as viciously as if they were thrashing corn, neither willing to give in and Robin becoming especially incensed when the stranger cracks him on the crown hard enough to draw blood. The stranger responds to Robin's ire even more powerfully and sends him into the brook, whereupon Robin agrees to call a truce. As soon as Robin is out of the brook, he blows on his horn to summon his men. The men come and one of them named William Stutely asks why Robin is all wet and he says it is because he has been thrown into the brook by the stranger on the bridge. The men want to punish the stranger, but Robin holds them back, saying he can join his band and learn how to shoot a bow and arrow. The stranger agrees and reveals himself as John Little. William Stutely decides to be Little John's \"Godfather\", and the men celebrate their new comrade by shooting a lot of fat doe for their meat, changing John Little's name by switching his Christian name and surname in a \"Baptismal\" ceremony, and then gorging on meat and drink (30.2). Little John is also dressed in green like the other merry men and given a long bow. Robin says he will learn to shoot with the best and will roam the forest with him and his men, owning no land or money, because whatever they need they can steal from the clergy passing through.

Vol. 3. Ed. Francis James Child. Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, 1888 and 1889. Republished 1965 and 2003. p. 42.</ref> Child had also called the Roxburghe and Pepys collections (in which some of these ballads are included) \"'''veritable dung-hills'' ..., in which only after a great deal of sickening grubbing, one finds a very moderate jewel.'\"<ref>\"Child's Ballads and the Broadside Conundrum\" by Mary Ellen Brown.

Burlington, Vermont, USA: Ashgate Publishing Company, 2010. p. 69.</ref> Child and others were reluctant to include such broadsides in their collections because they thought they \"regularized the text, rather than reflecting and/or participating in tradition, which fostered multiformity.\"<ref name=\"Brown_69\"/> On the other hand, the broadsides are significant in themselves as showing, as English jurist and legal scholar [[John Selden]] (1584-1654) puts it, \"'how the wind sits. As take a straw and throw it up in the air; you shall see by that which way the wind is, which you shall not do by casting up a stone. More solid things do not show the complexion of the times so well as ballads and libels.'\"<ref name=\"Fumerton\">\"Introduction: Straws in the Wind\" by Patricia Fumerton and Anita Guerrini. Ch. 1 ''ibid.'', p. 1</ref> Even though the broadsides are cultural ephemera, unlike weightier tomes, they are important because they are markers of contemporary \"current events and popular trends.\"<ref name=\"Fumerton\"/> It has been speculated that in his time Robin Hood represented a figure of [[peasant]] revolt, but the [[England|English]] [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[historian]] [[J.C. Holt]] has argued that the tales developed among the gentry, that he is a yeoman rather than a peasant, and that the tales do not mention peasants' complaints, such as oppressive taxes.<ref>J. C. Holt, ''Robin Hood''. Thames and Hudson, 1989, pp. 37-38</ref> Moreover, he does not seem to rebel against societal standards but to uphold them by being munificent, devout, and affable.<ref>J. C. Holt, ''Robin Hood''. Thames and Hudson, 1989, p. 10.</ref> Other scholars have seen the literature around Robin Hood as reflecting the interests of the common people against [[feudalism]].<ref>Singman, Jeffrey L. ''Robin Hood: The Shaping of the Legend'', 1998, Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 46, and first chapter as a whole.</ref> The latter interpretation supports Selden's view that popular ballads provide a valuable window onto the thoughts and feelings of the common people on topical matters: for the peasantry, Robin Hood may have been a redemptive figure.\n\n==Library and archival holdings==\nThe [http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu English Broadside Ballad Archive] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] holds two seventeenth-century [[broadside]] [[ballad]] versions of this tale: a copy in the [[Roxburghe Ballads|Roxburghe ballad collection]] at the [[British Library]] (3.728-729) and another held in the [[James Ludovic Lindsay|Crawford]] collection at the [[National Library of Scotland]] (1320).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/search_combined/?ss=robin+hood+and+little+john |title=Ballad Archive Search - UCSB English Broadside Ballad Archive |publisher=Ebba.english.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\n[[Howard Pyle]] adapted many tales about [[Robin Hood]], [[Little John]], and other characters of the legend in his ''[[The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood]]''.
