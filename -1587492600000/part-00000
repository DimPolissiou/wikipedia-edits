As a [[fighter ace]], he claimed 65 enemy aircraft shot down in over 140 combat missions. He claimed one victoriy in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During World War II, he was credited with 64 aerial victories in [[Defense of the Reich]] all of which claimed at night and includes the destruction of 57 [[Heavy bomber|four-engined bombers]].\n\nHe was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] of [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nRadusch, an glider pilot as a student, joined the military service of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]] before transferring to the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=63}} Radusch and nine others, among them [[G\u00fcnther L\u00fctzow]], [[Wolfgang Falck]] and [[Hannes Trautloft]], were recommended for training at the [[Lipetsk fighter-pilot school]] in the Soviet Russia.{{sfn|Braatz|2005|pp=28\u201351}} He was sent to Spain as part of the [[Condor Legion]] in October 1936.{{sfn|Forsyth|2011|p=25}} He claimed his only aerial victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on 22 April 1937. Together with fellow pilot Franz Heilmayer of 2./[[Jagdgruppe 88]] they each claimed one [[Polikarpov I-15]] shot down, one of which was flown by Felipe del R\u00edo Crespo, a seven victory flying ace.{{sfn|Forsyth|2011|p=58}} Radusch also tested the [[Heinkel He 112]] 5-1 under combat conditions in Spain.{{sfn|Forsyth|2011|p=33}} For his services in Spain he received the [[Spanish Cross]] in Gold with Swords ({{lang|de|Spanienkreuz in Gold mit Schwertern}}).{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=63}}\n\n==World War II==\n[[Image:Kammhuber Line Map - Agent Tegal.png|thumb|right|A map of part of the Kammhuber Line. The 'belt' and night fighter 'boxes' are shown.]]\nFollowing the 1939 aerial [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]], bombing missions by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) shifted to the cover of darkness, initiating the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign.{{sfn|Foreman|Matthews|Parry|2004|p=9}} By mid-1940, ''[[Generalmajor]]'' (Brigadier General) [[Josef Kammhuber]] had established a night [[air defense]] system dubbed the [[Kammhuber Line]]. It consisted of a series of control sectors equipped with [[radar]]s and [[searchlight]]s and an associated night fighter. Each sector, named a ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed), would direct the night fighter into visual range with target bombers. In 1941, the Luftwaffe started equipping night fighters with airborne radar such as the [[Lichtenstein radar|''Lichtenstein'' radar]]. This airborne radar did not come into general use until early 1942.{{sfn|Foreman|Matthews|Parry|2004|p=27}}\n\n===Night fighter career===\nOn 1 July 1940, Radusch was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of I. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (1st group) of [[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1|''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' 1]] (NJG&nbsp;1\u20141st Night Fighter Wing).{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}} He remained a short time until on 7 October 1940 he was appointed commander of I.

Pilot [[Flight Lieutenant]] William Carruthers met Radusch afterwards and recalled how the German pilot him in good English that he had studied at [[Oxford University]] before the war before he handed him cigarettes and chocolate. Radusch departed after expressing his regrets at the loss of Carruthers' aircraft and crew.{{sfn|Bowman|2016b|p=24}}\n\nHe became the 444th recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub}}) on 6 April 1944 after 58 nocturnal aerial victories.{{sfn|Stockert|2007|p=94}} The presentation was made by [[Adolf Hitler]] at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], Hitler's residence in the [[Obersalzberg]] of the [[Bavarian Alps]], on 5 May 1944.{{sfn|Stockert|2007|p=107}}{{refn|Also present at the ceremony were [[G\u00fcnther Schack]], [[Emil Lang]], [[Alfred Grislawski]], [[Erich Rudorffer]], [[Martin M\u00f6bus]], [[Wilhelm Herget]], [[Hans-Karl Stepp]], [[Otto Pollmann]] and [[Fritz Breithaupt]], who all received the Oak Leaves on this date.{{sfn|Stockert|2007|p=134}}|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J27851, Staatsakt f\u00fcr Helmut Lent.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] speaking at Lent's funeral{{sfn|Hinchliffe|2003|p=267}}|alt=A black-and-white photo of six soldiers standing around a flag-covered coffin.]]\nOn 7 October, [[Helmut Lent]], the ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of NJG&nbsp;3, died of wounds sustained in a flying accident the day before. Lent's [[state funeral]] was held in the [[Reich Chancellery]], Berlin, on Wednesday 11 October 1944. Radusch, together with ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Hans-Joachim Jabs]], ''Major'' [[Rudolf Schoenert]], ''Hauptmann'' [[Heinz Str\u00fcning]], ''Hauptmann'' Karl Hadeball and ''Hauptmann'' [[Paul Zorner]], formed the [[guard of honour]].{{sfn|Hinchliffe|2003|pp=266\u2013267}} On 12 November, Radusch succeeded Lent in command of NJG&nbsp;3 which he led until the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]] in May 1945. Radusch was promoted to ''[[Oberst]]'' (colonel) on 30 January 1945.{{sfn|Stockert|2007|p=94}} He tested the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 154]] as a night fighter aircraft in February but rejected it for its less than impressive performance.{{sfn|Hermann|2006|pp=159, 162}}\n\n==Later life==\nOn 1 Septmber 1958, Radusch reentered military service in the ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' holding the rank of ''[[Oberst]]'' in the West [[German Air Force]]. Until March 1964, he commanded the flight school ({{lang|de|Flugzeugf\u00fchrerschule A}}) at [[Landsberg-Lech Air Base]].{{sfn|Br\u00fctting|1979|p=484}}\n\n==Summary of career==\n===Aerial victory claims===\nRadusch was credited with 65 aerial victories claimed in over 140 combat missions. He claimed one victory during the Spanish Civil War, the remaining 64 victories were all claimed at night and includes the destruction of 57 four-engine bombers. Foreman, Matthews and Parry, authors of ''Luftwaffe Night Fighter Claims 1939 \u2013 1945'', researched the [[German Federal Archives]] and found records for 64 nocturnal victory claims.{{sfn|Foreman|Matthews|Parry|2004|pp=18\u2013198}} Matthews and Foreman also published ''Luftwaffe Aces \u2014 Biographies and Victory Claims'', listing Radusch with 65 claims, including one as a daytime fighter pilot in Spain.{{sfn|Matthews|Foreman|2015|pp=999\u20131001}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders collapsible collapsed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; text-align:right; width: 100%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Chronicle of aerial victories\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Claim<br /><small>(total)</small>\n!scope=\"col\"| Claim<br /><small>(nocturnal)</small>\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:130px\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\"| Serial No./Squadron No.\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | \u2013 2.

It consisted of a series of control sectors equipped with [[radar]]s and [[searchlight]]s and an associated night fighter. Each sector, named a ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed), would direct the night fighter into visual range with target bombers. In 1941, the Luftwaffe started equipping night fighters with airborne radar such as the [[Lichtenstein radar|''Lichtenstein'' radar]].

Prior to their establishment of the AIA, anyone could claim to be an architect, as there were no schools of architecture or architectural licensing laws in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/>\n\nThey drafted a constitution and bylaws by March 10, 1857, under the name New York Society of Architects. Thomas U. Walter, of [[Philadelphia]], later suggested the name be changed to American Institute of Architects. The members signed the new constitution on April 15, 1857, having filed a certificate of incorporation two days earlier.<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/> The constitution was amended the following year with the mission \"to promote the artistic, scientific, and practical profession of its members; to facilitate their intercourse and good fellowship; to elevate the standing of the profession; and to combine the efforts of those engaged in the practice of Architecture, for the general advancement of the Art.\"<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/> Architects in other cities were asking to join in the 1860s, by the 1880s chapters had been formed in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Rhode Island]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] As of 2008, AIA had more than 300 chapters.<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/>\n\nThe AIA is headquartered at 1735 [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]], NW in Washington, D.C. A design competition was held in the mid-1960s to select an architect for a new AIA headquarters in Washington. Mitchell/Giurgola won the design competition but failed to get approval of the design concept from the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]]. The firm resigned the commission and helped select [[The Architects Collaborative]] (TAC) to redesign the building. The design, led by TAC principals [[Norman C. Fletcher|Norman Fletcher]] and [[Howard Elkus]], was ultimately approved in 1970 and completed in 1973. In honor of the 150th anniversary of the organization, the building was formally renamed in 2007 the \"American Center for Architecture\" and is also home to the American Institute of Architecture Students, the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture and the National Architectural Accrediting Board.\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Membership===\nMore than 90,000 licensed architects and associated professionals are members.

Allied membership is a partnership with the AIA and the American Architectural Foundation.\n\nThere is no National AIA membership category for students, but they can become members of the [[American Institute of Architecture Students]] and many local and state chapters of the AIA have student membership categories.\n\nThe AIA's most prestigious honor is the designation (FAIA) of a member as a [[FAIA|Fellow of the American Institute of Architects]]. This membership is awarded to members who have made contributions of national significance to the profession.

The AIA monitors legislative and regulatory actions and uses the collective power of its membership to participate in decision making by federal, state, and local policy makers. To serve the public, the AIA's community-based programs work with federal legislators and local governments to elevate the design of public spaces, protect the nation's infrastructure, and develop well-designed affordable housing for all Americans.\n\nThe American Institute of Architects announced in June 2013 at CGI America (an annual event of the [[Clinton Global Initiative]]) the creation of \"Designing Recovery,\" a design contest in partnership with the charities Make It Right, [[SBP (nonprofit organization)|SBP]], and [[Architecture for Humanity]].<ref name=\"contest\"/> Sponsored by Dow Building Solutions, a total of $30,000 in prize money was divided equally among three winning designs in New Orleans, Louisiana, Joplin, Missouri, and New York City.<ref name=\"contest\"/> Entrants submitted single-family housing designs with the objective of \"improving the quality, diversity and resiliency of the housing in each community.\"<ref name=\"contest\"/> Organizers made the portfolio of designs (even from non-winners) available to communities recovering from natural disasters.<ref name=\"contest\">{{cite press release|author1=PR Newswire|title=American Institute of Architects, Make It Right, St. Bernard Project and Architecture for Humanity Launch Housing Design Contest to Aid Disaster Survivors|location=Chicago, Illinois|journal=PR Newswire US|date=June 13, 2013|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/american-institute-of-architects-make-it-right-st-bernard-project-and-architecture-for-humanity-launch-housing-design-contest-to-aid-disaster-survivors-211394791.html|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Professionalism===\nThe AIA serves its members with professional development opportunities, contract documents that are the model for the design and construction industry, professional and design information services, personal benefits, and client-oriented resources.\n\nIn contributing to their profession and communities, AIA members also participate in professional interest areas from [[design]] to regional and urban development and professional academies that are both the source and focus of new ideas and responses.

They met on February 23, 1857, and decided to invite 16 other prominent architects to join them, including [[A. J. Davis (architect)|Alexander Jackson Davis]], [[Thomas U. Walter]], and [[Calvert Vaux]]. Prior to their establishment of the AIA, anyone could claim to be an architect, as there were no schools of architecture or architectural licensing laws in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/>\n\nThey drafted a constitution and bylaws by March 10, 1857, under the name New York Society of Architects. Thomas U. Walter, of [[Philadelphia]], later suggested the name be changed to American Institute of Architects. The members signed the new constitution on April 15, 1857, having filed a certificate of incorporation two days earlier.<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/> The constitution was amended the following year with the mission \"to promote the artistic, scientific, and practical profession of its members; to facilitate their intercourse and good fellowship; to elevate the standing of the profession; and to combine the efforts of those engaged in the practice of Architecture, for the general advancement of the Art.\"<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/> Architects in other cities were asking to join in the 1860s, by the 1880s chapters had been formed in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Rhode Island]], [[San Francisco]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] As of 2008, AIA had more than 300 chapters.<ref name=\"AIAHIST\"/>\n\nThe AIA is headquartered at 1735 [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]], NW in Washington, D.C. A design competition was held in the mid-1960s to select an architect for a new AIA headquarters in Washington. Mitchell/Giurgola won the design competition but failed to get approval of the design concept from the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]]. The firm resigned the commission and helped select [[The Architects Collaborative]] (TAC) to redesign the building. The design, led by TAC principals [[Norman C. Fletcher|Norman Fletcher]] and [[Howard Elkus]], was ultimately approved in 1970 and completed in 1973. In honor of the 150th anniversary of the organization, the building was formally renamed in 2007 the \"American Center for Architecture\" and is also home to the American Institute of Architecture Students, the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture and the National Architectural Accrediting Board.\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Membership===\nMore than 90,000 licensed architects and associated professionals are members.

Military races and exercises included downhill in rough terrain, target practice while skiing downhill, and 3&nbsp;km cross-country skiing with full military backpack.<ref name=\"Bergsland\">Bergsland, Einar (1946): ''P\u00e5 ski.'' Oslo: Aschehoug.</ref> Slalom (Norwegian: ''slal\u00e5m'') is a word of Norwegian origin that has entered the international skiing vocabulary. In the 1800s skiers in [[Telemark]] challenged each other on \"wild slopes\" (''ville l\u00e5mir''), more gentle slopes had the adjective \"sla\". Some races were on \"bumpy courses\" (''kneikel\u00e5m'') and sometimes included \"steep jumps\" (''spr\u00f8ytehopp'') for difficulty. These 19th century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber-slides and ended with a sharp turn (\"Telemark turn\") on a field or icy lake.<ref>B\u00f8, Olav (1993).

Military races and exercises included downhill in rough terrain, target practice while skiing downhill, and 3&nbsp;km cross-country skiing with full military backpack.<ref name=\"Bergsland\">Bergsland, Einar (1946): ''P\u00e5 ski.'' Oslo: Aschehoug.</ref> Slalom (Norwegian: ''slal\u00e5m'') is a word of Norwegian origin that has entered the international skiing vocabulary. In the 1800s skiers in [[Telemark]] challenged each other on \"wild slopes\" (''ville l\u00e5mir''), more gentle slopes had the adjective \"sla\". Some races were on \"bumpy courses\" (''kneikel\u00e5m'') and sometimes included \"steep jumps\" (''spr\u00f8ytehopp'') for difficulty. These 19th century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber-slides and ended with a sharp turn (\"Telemark turn\") on a field or icy lake.<ref>B\u00f8, Olav (1993).

Based on [[Colin Wilson]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The Space Vampires]]'', the film portrays the events that unfold after a trio of humanoids in a state of suspended animation are brought to Earth after being discovered in the hold of an alien space ship by the crew of a European space shuttle.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lifeforce | url=http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/lifeforce | publisher=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] | accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe film received negative reviews on release and was a box office failure, but has since become a [[Cult following|cult film]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2013/06/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-tobe-hoopers-underseen-lifeforce-96723/|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Tobe Hooper\u2019s Underseen \u2018Lifeforce\u2019|last=Taylor|first=Drew|last2=Taylor|first2=Drew|date=2013-06-21|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/citypaper/bcp-cms-1-1378560-migrated-story-cp-20120926-film2-20120926-story.html|title=A cult classic featuring naked space vampires.|last=Gardner|first=Lee|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/241279|title=Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce: Space Vampires, Comets, and Nudity|website=Den of Geek|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe crew of the joint British and American [[space shuttle]] ''Churchill'', under the command of Colonel Tom Carlsen, finds a 150-mile-long spaceship hidden in the [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] of [[Halley's Comet]]. Inside, the crew discovers hundreds of desiccated bat-like creatures and three naked humanoid bodies (two male and one female) in [[suspended animation]] within glass containers. The crew recovers a bat-alien and the three bodies and begins the return trip to Earth. However, during the return journey, [[mission control]] loses contact with ''Churchill'' and a rescue mission is launched to investigate.\n\nThe rescuers discover that ''Churchill'' has been gutted by fire. The present crew are dead and the escape pod is missing, yet the three containers bearing the bodies remain intact. The bodies are taken to the European Space Research Centre in London. Prior to an autopsy, the female alien awakens and drains the life force out of a guard. She then escapes the facility and proceeds to drain other humans of their life force, revealing an ability to shape-shift. The guard revives after two hours and also displays the ability to drain others of their life force. Soon thereafter, the two male vampires wake and attempt a violent escape, but are apparently destroyed by grenades thrown by the guards.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, an [[escape pod]] from ''Churchill'' is found with Carlsen inside. Carlsen is flown to London, where he describes the course of events, culminating in the draining of the ''Churchill'' crew's life force. Carlsen explains that he set fire to the shuttle with the intention of saving Earth from the same fate and escaped in the pod. However, when he is hypnotised, it becomes clear that Carlsen possesses a psychic link to the female alien. Carlsen admits to Caine that, while on ''Churchill'', he felt compelled to open the female vampire's container and share his life force with her. Carlsen and [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Colonel Colin Caine trace her to a psychiatric hospital in Yorkshire. There, the two believe they have managed to trap her within the heavily sedated body of the hospital's manager, Dr. Armstrong. Carlsen and Caine later learn they were deceived, as the aliens had wanted to draw them out of London.\n\nThe two male vampires have survived by shape-shifting into the soldiers who killed their previous bodies, and now the pair are infecting most of London's population. As Carlsen and Caine are transporting Dr. Armstrong back to London, the female alien escapes from her sedated host and disappears. Martial law is declared as the vampire plague sweeps through the city, the victims seeking out other humans to absorb their life force and perpetuate the cycle. The absorbed life forces are channeled by the male vampires to the female vampire, who transmits the accumulated energy to their spaceship, which is now in geosynchronous orbit over London.\n\nDr. Fallada impales one of the male vampires with an ancient weapon of \"leaded iron\". He contacts Carlsen and Caine and surmises that the creatures have visited Earth periodically with the coming of Halley's Comet, creating the vampire legends. He delivers the weapon to Caine before succumbing to the infection. The female vampire is tracked by Carlsen to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], where she is lying upon the altar, transferring energy to her spaceship. She reveals, much to Carlsen's shock, that they are a part of each other due to the sharing of their life forces, thus sharing their psychic bond. Caine follows Carlsen to the cathedral and is intercepted by the second male vampire, whom he kills. Caine throws Carlsen the weapon, who impales himself and the female alien simultaneously. This action causes the release of a burst of energy that blows open the dome of St. Paul's. The two ascend the column of energy to the spaceship, which then returns to the comet as Caine watches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Steve Railsback]] as Col. Tom Carlsen\n* [[Peter Firth]] as Col.

The other two films are the remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' and ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Macor |first=Alison | title=Chainsaws, Slackers, and Spy Kids |publisher=University of Texas Press |date=2010 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBQ_FGDKiSkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-292-77829-0}}</ref>\n\nFilming began on 2 February 1984. Before Hooper was finally approved, [[Michael Winner]] was offered the chance to direct the film.<ref name=\"fun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grindhousedatabase.com/index.php/Lifeforce/Fun_Facts|title=Lifeforce/Fun Facts|date=20 July 2016|work=The Grindhouse Cinema Database|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film was originally filmed and promoted under the same title as the Colin Wilson novel. Cannon Films, which reportedly spent nearly $25&nbsp;million in hopes of creating a blockbuster film, disliked ''[[The Space Vampires]]'' for sounding too much like another of the studio's typical low budget exploitation films.<ref name=\"Scapperotti\">{{cite journal|last=Scapperotti|first=Dan|title=The Hooper on Lifeforce|journal=Cinefantastique|location=Oak Park|date=July 1985}}</ref> As a result, the title was changed to ''Lifeforce'', referring to the spiritual energy the space vampires drain from their victims, and it was edited for its US theatrical release by [[TriStar Pictures]] into a 101-minute domestic cut that was partially re-scored by [[Michael Kamen]], with a majority of [[Henry Mancini]]'s original music remaining.\n\nIt has been suggested that ''Lifeforce'' is largely a remake of [[Hammer Film Productions]]'s ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]''. In an interview, director Tobe Hooper discussed how Cannon Films gave him $25 million, free rein, and Colin Wilson's book ''[[The Space Vampires]]''. Hooper then shares how giddy he was: \"I thought I'd go back to my roots and make a 70 mm Hammer film.\"<ref>''The Making of Lifeforce'' (2013) documentary, by filmmakers Calum Waddel and Naomi Holwill, included on the ''Lifeforce'' Blu-Ray.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Thomas Kent|title=Mars in the Movies: A History|location=Jefferson|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2016|isbn=9780786499144}} p. 180</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last1=Migliore|first1=Andrew |first2=John |last2=Strysik|title=Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H.P.

Tobe Hooper came up with the idea of using [[Halley's Comet]] in the screenplay, rather than the asteroid belt as originally used in the novel, as the comet was going to pass by Earth one year following the film's release. The time settings were also changed from the mid-21st century to the present day.<ref name=\"Scapperotti\"/> [[Michael Armstrong (filmmaker)|Michael Armstrong]] and [[Olaf Pooley]] were brought on during production to perform uncredited rewrites, Armstrong acting as a liaison between Hooper and the art department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/cathode-ray-tube/lifeforce-special-edition-blu-ray-review-e8d6f316a83c|title=LIFEFORCE \u2014 Special Edition Blu-Ray / Review|last=Collins|first=Frank|date=27 August 2017|website=Cathode Ray Tube|access-date=17 April 2018|via=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]}}</ref>\n\nColin Wilson was unhappy with the way the film turned out. He wrote of it, \"[[John Fowles]] had once told me that the film of ''[[The Magus (film)|The Magus]]'' was the worst movie ever made. After seeing ''Lifeforce'' I sent him a postcard telling him that I had gone one better.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Colin |title=Dreaming to Some Purpose |publisher=[[Random House]] |date=2011 |page=332 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZCvrS9DjE68C |isbn=9781446473603}}</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\nThe film marked the fourth project to feature [[special effects]] produced by [[Academy Award]] winner [[John Dykstra]], who in 1986 was granted with the \"Caixa Catalunya Award for Best Special Effects\" in the [[Sitges Film Festival]] (located in Spain) for his special effects work in ''Lifeforce''.<ref group=\"note\">This award (presented annually) is the Special Effects Award attributed by the Sitges Film Festival, but its name has changed among years, depending on different sponsors. In 1986 it was called \"''Premio Caixa Catalunya a los Mejores Efectos Especiales''\" (\"Caixa Catalunya Award for Best Special Effects\") since that year the sponsor was [[Caixa Catalunya]], a local bank.</ref> The umbrella-like alien spaceship was modelled after an [[artichoke]], while the model London destroyed in the film was actually the remains of [[Tucktonia]], a [[model village]] near [[Christchurch]], United Kingdom, that had closed not long before the shooting of the film. It took a week to film the death scene of the pathologist played by Jerome Willis, and [[bodycast]]s of Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart and [[Aubrey Morris]] were made by make-up effects supervisor [[Nick Maley]] for their death scenes.\n\nOne effect near the end of the film involving the column of energy rising from the female alien through the top of St. Paul's Cathedral to the spacecraft was engineered by art director [[Tony Reading]]. A column of 3-M material was placed against black velvet and a crew member blew cigar smoke into its bottom. This image was then [[Front projection effect|front projected]] onto a translucent projection screen behind the actors to create the energy column.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rizzo |first=Michael |title=The Art Direction Handbook for Film |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |date=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lv05yGXskQQC&pg=PT134 |isbn=9780240806808}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[James Horner]] was first asked to write the score before [[Henry Mancini]] was brought in and produced a score consisting of 90 minutes of an occasionally [[atonal]] and ambient music using the [[London Symphony Orchestra]].<ref name=\"Caps\">{{cite book |last=Caps |first=John |title=Henry Mancini: Reinventing Film Music |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]] |date=2012 |pages=193\u201398 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QK6UmDGh2V4C&pg=PA193 |isbn=9780252093845}}</ref> Mancini had agreed to do the film based on the original concept of a 15-minute essentially dialogue-free opening sequence involving the discovery and exploration of the alien spacecraft and the moving of the three aliens back to the ''Churchill'', for which he composed a tonal \"space ballet.\"<ref name=\"Caps\"/>\n\nFor the American domestic version, [[Michael Kamen]] and [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]] were asked to write occasional music cues that were placed in at the last minute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://moviemusicuk.us/2015/07/02/lifeforce-henry-mancini/|title=LIFEFORCE \u2013 Henry Mancini|date=2 July 2015|work=Movie Music UK|access-date=17 April 2018|first=Jonathan|last=Broxton}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://comingsoon.net/horror/features/786489-sound-shock-the-music-of-lifeforce|title=Sound Shock: The Music of Lifeforce|date=16 November 2016|work=ComingSoon.net|access-date=17 April 2018|publisher=[[CraveOnline Media]]|first=Chris|last=Alexander}}</ref><ref name=variety/>\n\n===Editing and post-production===\nThe initial cut of ''Lifeforce'' as edited by Tobe Hooper was 128 minutes long. This is 12 minutes longer than the final version which had several scenes cut, most of them taking place on the space shuttle ''Churchill''. According to [[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]], who played the main British astronaut, Derebridge, it was felt that there was too much material in outer space and so the majority of the ''Churchill'' scenes were deleted. Also, most of Nicholas Ball's performance ended up on the [[cutting room floor]] according to an interview he gave on the UK talk show ''[[Wogan]]'' in 1985.\n\nAccording to interviews with Bill Malin, who plays one of the male vampires, the film went over schedule during production. Because of this some important scenes were never shot, and the film was shut down at one time because the studio had simply run out of money.<ref name=\"fun\"/>\n\nDespite being credited on the US domestic cut, the following actors were deleted from that cut of the film: [[John Woodnutt]], [[John Forbes-Robertson (actor)|John Forbes-Robertson]] and Russell Sommers. The ''Churchill'' [[commanding officer]] Rawlins, played by Geoffrey Frederick, was British, but in [[post-production]] it was decided that [[Patrick Jordan]] would dub his voice. Also in the US version, some of Geoffrey Frederick's voiceover heard on the ''Churchill'' is dubbed.\n\n==Release==\n''Lifeforce'' was released on 21 June 1985 to poor box office returns.<ref name=\"caulfield\" /> The film opened in fourth place, losing a head-to-head battle against [[Ron Howard]]'s science fiction film, ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''.

Based on [[Colin Wilson]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The Space Vampires]]'', the film portrays the events that unfold after a trio of humanoids in a state of suspended animation are brought to Earth after being discovered in the hold of an alien space ship by the crew of a European space shuttle.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lifeforce | url=http://www.filmlinc.com/films/on-sale/lifeforce | publisher=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] | accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe film received negative reviews on release and was a box office failure, but has since become a [[Cult following|cult film]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2013/06/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-tobe-hoopers-underseen-lifeforce-96723/|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About Tobe Hooper\u2019s Underseen \u2018Lifeforce\u2019|last=Taylor|first=Drew|last2=Taylor|first2=Drew|date=2013-06-21|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/citypaper/bcp-cms-1-1378560-migrated-story-cp-20120926-film2-20120926-story.html|title=A cult classic featuring naked space vampires.|last=Gardner|first=Lee|website=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/241279|title=Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce: Space Vampires, Comets, and Nudity|website=Den of Geek|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe crew of the joint British and American [[space shuttle]] ''Churchill'', under the command of Colonel Tom Carlsen, finds a 150-mile-long spaceship hidden in the [[Coma (cometary)|coma]] of [[Halley's Comet]]. Inside, the crew discovers hundreds of desiccated bat-like creatures and three naked humanoid bodies (two male and one female) in [[suspended animation]] within glass containers. The crew recovers a bat-alien and the three bodies and begins the return trip to Earth. However, during the return journey, [[mission control]] loses contact with ''Churchill'' and a rescue mission is launched to investigate.\n\nThe rescuers discover that ''Churchill'' has been gutted by fire. The present crew are dead and the escape pod is missing, yet the three containers bearing the bodies remain intact. The bodies are taken to the European Space Research Centre in London. Prior to an autopsy, the female alien awakens and drains the life force out of a guard. She then escapes the facility and proceeds to drain other humans of their life force, revealing an ability to shape-shift. The guard revives after two hours and also displays the ability to drain others of their life force. Soon thereafter, the two male vampires wake and attempt a violent escape, but are apparently destroyed by grenades thrown by the guards.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, an [[escape pod]] from ''Churchill'' is found with Carlsen inside. Carlsen is flown to London, where he describes the course of events, culminating in the draining of the ''Churchill'' crew's life force. Carlsen explains that he set fire to the shuttle with the intention of saving Earth from the same fate and escaped in the pod. However, when he is hypnotised, it becomes clear that Carlsen possesses a psychic link to the female alien. Carlsen admits to Caine that, while on ''Churchill'', he felt compelled to open the female vampire's container and share his life force with her. Carlsen and [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Colonel Colin Caine trace her to a psychiatric hospital in Yorkshire. There, the two believe they have managed to trap her within the heavily sedated body of the hospital's manager, Dr. Armstrong. Carlsen and Caine later learn they were deceived, as the aliens had wanted to draw them out of London.\n\nThe two male vampires have survived by shape-shifting into the soldiers who killed their previous bodies, and now the pair are infecting most of London's population. As Carlsen and Caine are transporting Dr. Armstrong back to London, the female alien escapes from her sedated host and disappears. Martial law is declared as the vampire plague sweeps through the city, the victims seeking out other humans to absorb their life force and perpetuate the cycle. The absorbed life forces are channeled by the male vampires to the female vampire, who transmits the accumulated energy to their spaceship, which is now in geosynchronous orbit over London.\n\nDr. Fallada impales one of the male vampires with an ancient weapon of \"leaded iron\". He contacts Carlsen and Caine and surmises that the creatures have visited Earth periodically with the coming of Halley's Comet, creating the vampire legends. He delivers the weapon to Caine before succumbing to the infection. The female vampire is tracked by Carlsen to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], where she is lying upon the altar, transferring energy to her spaceship. She reveals, much to Carlsen's shock, that they are a part of each other due to the sharing of their life forces, thus sharing their psychic bond. Caine follows Carlsen to the cathedral and is intercepted by the second male vampire, whom he kills. Caine throws Carlsen the weapon, who impales himself and the female alien simultaneously. This action causes the release of a burst of energy that blows open the dome of St. Paul's. The two ascend the column of energy to the spaceship, which then returns to the comet as Caine watches.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* [[Steve Railsback]] as Col. Tom Carlsen\n* [[Peter Firth]] as Col.

The other two films are the remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' and ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Macor |first=Alison | title=Chainsaws, Slackers, and Spy Kids |publisher=University of Texas Press |date=2010 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eBQ_FGDKiSkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-292-77829-0}}</ref>\n\nFilming began on 2 February 1984. Before Hooper was finally approved, [[Michael Winner]] was offered the chance to direct the film.<ref name=\"fun\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grindhousedatabase.com/index.php/Lifeforce/Fun_Facts|title=Lifeforce/Fun Facts|date=20 July 2016|work=The Grindhouse Cinema Database|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe film was originally filmed and promoted under the same title as the Colin Wilson novel. Cannon Films, which reportedly spent nearly $25&nbsp;million in hopes of creating a blockbuster film, disliked ''[[The Space Vampires]]'' for sounding too much like another of the studio's typical low budget exploitation films.<ref name=\"Scapperotti\">{{cite journal|last=Scapperotti|first=Dan|title=The Hooper on Lifeforce|journal=Cinefantastique|location=Oak Park|date=July 1985}}</ref> As a result, the title was changed to ''Lifeforce'', referring to the spiritual energy the space vampires drain from their victims, and it was edited for its US theatrical release by [[TriStar Pictures]] into a 101-minute domestic cut that was partially re-scored by [[Michael Kamen]], with a majority of [[Henry Mancini]]'s original music remaining.\n\nIt has been suggested that ''Lifeforce'' is largely a remake of [[Hammer Film Productions]]'s ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]''. In an interview, director Tobe Hooper discussed how Cannon Films gave him $25 million, free rein, and Colin Wilson's book ''[[The Space Vampires]]''. Hooper then shares how giddy he was: \"I thought I'd go back to my roots and make a 70 mm Hammer film.\"<ref>''The Making of Lifeforce'' (2013) documentary, by filmmakers Calum Waddel and Naomi Holwill, included on the ''Lifeforce'' Blu-Ray.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Thomas Kent|title=Mars in the Movies: A History|location=Jefferson|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2016|isbn=9780786499144}} p. 180</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last1=Migliore|first1=Andrew |first2=John |last2=Strysik|title=Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H.P.

Tobe Hooper came up with the idea of using [[Halley's Comet]] in the screenplay, rather than the asteroid belt as originally used in the novel, as the comet was going to pass by Earth one year following the film's release. The time settings were also changed from the mid-21st century to the present day.<ref name=\"Scapperotti\"/> [[Michael Armstrong (filmmaker)|Michael Armstrong]] and [[Olaf Pooley]] were brought on during production to perform uncredited rewrites, Armstrong acting as a liaison between Hooper and the art department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/cathode-ray-tube/lifeforce-special-edition-blu-ray-review-e8d6f316a83c|title=LIFEFORCE \u2014 Special Edition Blu-Ray / Review|last=Collins|first=Frank|date=27 August 2017|website=Cathode Ray Tube|access-date=17 April 2018|via=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]}}</ref>\n\nColin Wilson was unhappy with the way the film turned out.

In 1986 it was called \"''Premio Caixa Catalunya a los Mejores Efectos Especiales''\" (\"Caixa Catalunya Award for Best Special Effects\") since that year the sponsor was [[Caixa Catalunya]], a local bank.</ref> The umbrella-like alien spaceship was modelled after an [[artichoke]], while the model London destroyed in the film was actually the remains of [[Tucktonia]], a [[model village]] near [[Christchurch]], United Kingdom, that had closed not long before the shooting of the film. It took a week to film the death scene of the pathologist played by Jerome Willis, and [[bodycast]]s of Frank Finlay, Patrick Stewart and [[Aubrey Morris]] were made by make-up effects supervisor [[Nick Maley]] for their death scenes.\n\nOne effect near the end of the film involving the column of energy rising from the female alien through the top of St. Paul's Cathedral to the spacecraft was engineered by art director [[Tony Reading]]. A column of 3-M material was placed against black velvet and a crew member blew cigar smoke into its bottom.

According to [[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]], who played the main British astronaut, Derebridge, it was felt that there was too much material in outer space and so the majority of the ''Churchill'' scenes were deleted. Also, most of Nicholas Ball's performance ended up on the [[cutting room floor]] according to an interview he gave on the UK talk show ''[[Wogan]]'' in 1985.\n\nAccording to interviews with Bill Malin, who plays one of the male vampires, the film went over schedule during production. Because of this some important scenes were never shot, and the film was shut down at one time because the studio had simply run out of money.<ref name=\"fun\"/>\n\nDespite being credited on the US domestic cut, the following actors were deleted from that cut of the film: [[John Woodnutt]], [[John Forbes-Robertson (actor)|John Forbes-Robertson]] and Russell Sommers. The ''Churchill'' [[commanding officer]] Rawlins, played by Geoffrey Frederick, was British, but in [[post-production]] it was decided that [[Patrick Jordan]] would dub his voice. Also in the US version, some of Geoffrey Frederick's voiceover heard on the ''Churchill'' is dubbed.\n\n==Release==\n''Lifeforce'' was released on 21 June 1985 to poor box office returns.<ref name=\"caulfield\" /> The film opened in fourth place, losing a head-to-head battle against [[Ron Howard]]'s science fiction film, ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''.
