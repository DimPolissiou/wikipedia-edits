The mountains are in the southern portion of the [[Eastern Highlands]], or Manica Highlands, a belt of highlands that extend north and south along the international border, between the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save]] rivers.\n\nThe Chimanimani Mountains include [[Monte Binga]] (2,436 m), the highest peak in [[Mozambique]] and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. The mountains are home to diverse forests, savannas, montane grasslands, and heathlands. Zimbabwe's '''Chimanimani National Park''' and Mozambique's adjacent [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] protect parts of the range. These two parks, together with a larger buffer zone, constitute '''Chimanmani Transfrontier Conservation Area'''.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

There are no weather stations in the wetter Mozambican portion of the range. The western slopes on the Zimbabean side of the range are in the mountains' rain shadow, and generally drier. Zimbabwean stations at [[Chimanimani]] and [[Chisengu]] reported 1074 mm and 1406 mm, respectively.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

The Chimanimani Mountains' montane plant communities are [[Afromontane]], and share many species with other high-elevation mountain regions scattered from South Africa to Ethiopia. 70 montane plant species are endemic to the Chimanimani Mountains.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\n====Grasslands====\nGrassland is most widespread vegetation, found on level and rolling terrain. Grasslands are of three main types - quartzite grasslands, schist grasslands, and wet or hydromorphic grasslands. The quartzite and schist grassland types are determined by the underlying geology.\n\nThe quartzite grasslands generally grow low, with [[tussock (grass)|tufted grasses]]. Common grasses are ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Sporobolus festivus]], [[Panicum brazzavillense]], [[Elionurus muticus]], [[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]], [[Panicum ecklonii]], [[Rhytachne rottboellioides]],'' and ''[[Trachypogon spicatus]]''. Quartzite grasslands cover an area of 50 to 100 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nSchist grasslands grow on soils derived from schist, which are generally red in color and deeper and more nutrient-rich than quartzite-derived soils. Schist grasslands grow taller and denser, with ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' as the dominant grass, along the grasses ''Loudetia simplex, Tristachya hispida, Monocymbium ceresiiforme'', and the sedge ''[[Bulbostylis contexta]]''. The shrubs ''[[Protea caffra]]'' subsp. ''gazensis, Indigofera cecilii'', and ''Morella chimanimaniana'' and the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' are also typical. Schist grasslands cover an area of approximately 150 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\n====Shrublands====\nShrublands grow on steeper slopes, are of two main types, Ericaceous and Proteaceous.\n\nEricaceous scrub is found on quartite-derived soils above 1200 meters elevation. It is characterized by shrubs in the heath family [[Ericaceae]], including ''[[Erica hexandra]], [[Philippia simii]], Erica pleiotricha, E. johnstonii'', and ''E. lanceolifera''. The ericaceous scrubland includes many other species, including many of the species endemic to the Eastern Highlands and Chimanimani Mountains.\n\nProteaceous scrub is found on schist-derived soils between 1100 and 1800 meters elevation, interspersed with schist grasslands. Dominant shrubs are from the protea family ([[Proteaceae]]), including ''[[Protea caffra]], [[Protea welwitschii|P . welwitschii]], [[Protea wentzeliana|P . wentzeliana]]'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'', together with smaller shrubs, herbs, and grasses.\n\nOther shrubland types are mixed sclerophyll scrub, which contains a mix of Ericaceous and Proteaceous species, and bracken scrub, characterized by the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' together with shrubs and tall grasses. Bracken scrub is found on richer soils near forest patches.\n\n====Woodlands====\nThe mountains are home to three types of [[miombo woodland]]. Trees are generally 4 to 8 meters high, with 20 to 60% canopy cover, with grasses and bracken covering the ground.\n\n[[Uapaca kirkiana|Mzhenje]] ''(Uapaca kirkiana)'' woodland is found on east-facing slopes below 1200 meters elevation, typically on schist-derived soils. Mzhenge is accompanied by the trees ''[[Brachystegia utilis]], [[Pterocarpus angolensis]]'', and ''[[Pericopsis angolensis]]'' at lower elevations. \n\n[[Brachystegia spiciformis|Msasa]] ''(Brachystegia spiciformis)'' woodland is also found on schist soils. Trees tend to grow low (2 to 4 meters high) and widely scattered at higher elevations. At lower elevations the trees grow higher and closer, and ''Uapaca kirkiana'' and ''[[Faurea saligna]]'' accompany msasa.\n\nWoodland of ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' subsp. ''microphylla'' grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of ''[[Usnea]]'' lichen.\n\n====Forests====\nMontane forests occur in scattered patches, typically in sheltered areas with access to year-round moisture. Small patches of 1 to 5 hectares are most common, with patches up to 30 km in some locations. The largest patch discovered by Timberlake et al. was 240 hectares, on a west-facing slope above the Nyahedzi River.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\nTrees form a closed canopy 10 to 15 meters high. Lianas and epiphytes are common in the canopy, and the understory plants are mostly ferns and mosses. Common forest trees include ''[[Schefflera umbellifera]], [[Ilex mitis]], [[Macaranga mellifera]], [[Maesa lanceolata]], [[Morella pilulifera]], [[Podocarpus milanjianus]]'', and ''[[Syzygium cordatum]]''.

Southern Rhodesia declared independence as Rhodesia under an exclusive white-minority government in 1965. The [[Rhodesian Bush War]], or Zimbabwe Independence War, raged from 1964 to 1979. During the war, mountain passes in the Chimanimani area were frequently used by guerilla fighters moving between Zimbabwe and their camps in [[Mozambique]], and the guerrillas laid [[land mines|mines]] along local roads to disrupt the local economy.

The mountains are in the southern portion of the [[Eastern Highlands]], or Manica Highlands, a belt of highlands that extend north and south along the international border, between the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save]] rivers.\n\nThe Chimanimani Mountains include [[Monte Binga]] (2,436 m), the highest peak in [[Mozambique]] and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. The mountains are home to diverse forests, savannas, montane grasslands, and heathlands. Zimbabwe's '''Chimanimani National Park''' and Mozambique's adjacent [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] protect parts of the range. These two parks, together with a larger buffer zone, constitute '''Chimanmani Transfrontier Conservation Area'''.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\n====Grasslands====\nGrassland is most widespread vegetation, found on level and rolling terrain. Grasslands are of three main types - quartzite grasslands, schist grasslands, and wet or hydromorphic grasslands. The quartzite and schist grassland types are determined by the underlying geology.\n\nThe quartzite grasslands generally grow low, with [[tussock (grass)|tufted grasses]]. Common grasses are ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Sporobolus festivus]], [[Panicum brazzavillense]], [[Elionurus muticus]], [[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]], [[Panicum ecklonii]], [[Rhytachne rottboellioides]],'' and ''[[Trachypogon spicatus]]''. Quartzite grasslands cover an area of 50 to 100 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nSchist grasslands grow on soils derived from schist, which are generally red in color and deeper and more nutrient-rich than quartzite-derived soils. Schist grasslands grow taller and denser, with ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' as the dominant grass, along the grasses ''Loudetia simplex, Tristachya hispida, Monocymbium ceresiiforme'', and the sedge ''[[Bulbostylis contexta]]''. The shrubs ''[[Protea caffra]]'' subsp. ''gazensis, Indigofera cecilii'', and ''Morella chimanimaniana'' and the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' are also typical. Schist grasslands cover an area of approximately 150 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\n====Shrublands====\nShrublands grow on steeper slopes, are of two main types, Ericaceous and Proteaceous.\n\nEricaceous scrub is found on quartite-derived soils above 1200 meters elevation. It is characterized by shrubs in the heath family [[Ericaceae]], including ''[[Erica hexandra]], [[Philippia simii]], Erica pleiotricha, E. johnstonii'', and ''E. lanceolifera''. The ericaceous scrubland includes many other species, including many of the species endemic to the Eastern Highlands and Chimanimani Mountains.\n\nProteaceous scrub is found on schist-derived soils between 1100 and 1800 meters elevation, interspersed with schist grasslands. Dominant shrubs are from the protea family ([[Proteaceae]]), including ''[[Protea caffra]], [[Protea welwitschii|P . welwitschii]], [[Protea wentzeliana|P . wentzeliana]]'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'', together with smaller shrubs, herbs, and grasses.\n\nOther shrubland types are mixed sclerophyll scrub, which contains a mix of Ericaceous and Proteaceous species, and bracken scrub, characterized by the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' together with shrubs and tall grasses. Bracken scrub is found on richer soils near forest patches.\n\n====Woodlands====\nThe mountains are home to three types of [[miombo woodland]]. Trees are generally 4 to 8 meters high, with 20 to 60% canopy cover, with grasses and bracken covering the ground.\n\n[[Uapaca kirkiana|Mzhenje]] ''(Uapaca kirkiana)'' woodland is found on east-facing slopes below 1200 meters elevation, typically on schist-derived soils. Mzhenge is accompanied by the trees ''[[Brachystegia utilis]], [[Pterocarpus angolensis]]'', and ''[[Pericopsis angolensis]]'' at lower elevations. \n\n[[Brachystegia spiciformis|Msasa]] ''(Brachystegia spiciformis)'' woodland is also found on schist soils. Trees tend to grow low (2 to 4 meters high) and widely scattered at higher elevations. At lower elevations the trees grow higher and closer, and ''Uapaca kirkiana'' and ''[[Faurea saligna]]'' accompany msasa.\n\nWoodland of ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' subsp. ''microphylla'' grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of ''[[Usnea]]'' lichen.\n\n====Forests====\nMontane forests occur in scattered patches, typically in sheltered areas with access to year-round moisture. Small patches of 1 to 5 hectares are most common, with patches up to 30 km in some locations. The largest patch discovered by Timberlake et al. was 240 hectares, on a west-facing slope above the Nyahedzi River.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\nTrees form a closed canopy 10 to 15 meters high. Lianas and epiphytes are common in the canopy, and the understory plants are mostly ferns and mosses. Common forest trees include ''[[Schefflera umbellifera]], [[Ilex mitis]], [[Macaranga mellifera]], [[Maesa lanceolata]], [[Morella pilulifera]], [[Podocarpus milanjianus]]'', and ''[[Syzygium cordatum]]''. ''[[Widdringtonia nodiflora]]'' occurs in drier patches.\n\nA transitional forest type can be found on the edges of forest patches, and along streams and gullies in grassland and shrubland areas, and includes a mix of forest and Ericaceous shrub species, together with grasses and bracken ferns. The transitional forests include the large shrubs and small trees ''[[Philippia mannii]], [[Englerophytum magalismontanum]], [[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'', and ''[[Myrsine africana]]''.
