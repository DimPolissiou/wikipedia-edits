{"title_page": "Tying (commerce)", "text_new": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=November 2012}}\n{{Competition law}}\n'''Tying''' (informally, '''product tying''') is the practice of selling one product or service as a mandatory addition to the purchase of a different product or service. In legal terms, a ''tying sale'' makes the sale of one [[Good (economics)|good]] (the ''tying good'') to the [[de facto]] customer (or [[de jure]] customer) conditional on the purchase of a second distinctive good (the ''tied good''). Tying is often illegal when the products are not naturally related. It is related to but distinct from [[freebie marketing]], a common (and legal) method of giving away (or selling at a substantial discount) one item to ensure a continual flow of sales of another related item.\n\nSome kinds of tying, especially by [[contract]], have historically been regarded as [[anti-competitive practices]]. The basic idea is that consumers are harmed by being forced to buy an undesired good (the tied good) in order to purchase a good they actually want (the tying good), and so would prefer that the goods be sold separately. The company doing this [[product bundling|bundling]] may have a significantly large market share so that it may impose the tie on consumers, despite the forces of market competition. The tie may also harm other companies in the market for the tied good, or who sell only single components.\n\nOne effect of tying can be that low quality products achieve a higher market share than would otherwise be the case.\n\nTying may also be a form of [[price discrimination]]: people who use more razor blades, for example, pay more than those who just need a one-time shave. Though this may improve overall welfare, by giving more consumers access to the market, such price discrimination can also transfer consumer surpluses to the producer. Tying may also be used with or in place of [[patent]]s or [[copyright]]s to help protect entry into a market, discouraging innovation.\n\nTying is often used when the supplier makes one product that is critical to many customers. By threatening to withhold that key product unless others are also purchased, the supplier can increase sales of less necessary products.\n\nIn the [[United States]], most [[U.S. state|states]] have laws against tying, which are enforced by state governments. In addition, the [[U.S.&nbsp;Department of Justice]] enforces federal laws against tying through its [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]].\n\n==Types==\n'''Horizontal tying''' is the practice of requiring consumers to pay for an unrelated product or service together with the desired one.<ref name=horizvert>{{cite web|title=Tying|url=http://www.whitecollarfirm.com/CM/Custom/Tying-Antitrust-Defense-Attorneys.asp|publisher=The Blanch Law Firm|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>  A hypothetical example would be for [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bic|Bic]] to sell its pens only with Bic lighters. (However, a company may offer a limited free item with another purchase as a promotion.)\n\n'''Vertical tying''' is the practice of requiring customers to purchase related products or services together, from the same company.<ref name=horizvert /> For example, a company might mandate that its automobiles could only be serviced by its own dealers. In an effort to curb this, many jurisdictions require that warranties not be voided by outside servicing; for example, see the [[Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act]] in the United States.\n\n==In United States law==\nCertain tying arrangements are illegal in the [[United States]] under both the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]],<ref>''See'' ''N. Pac. Ry Co. v. United States'', 356 U.S. 1 (1958); ''[[International Salt Co. v. United States]]'', [[Case citation|332 U.S. 392]] (1947)</ref> and Section 3 of the [[Clayton Act]].<ref>15 U.S.C. s. 14</ref> A tying arrangement is defined as \"an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees he will not purchase the product from any other supplier.\"<ref>''N. Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1958)''</ref> Tying may be the action of several companies as well as the work of just one firm. Success on a tying claim typically requires proof of four elements: (1) two separate products or services are involved; (2) the purchase of the tying product is conditioned on the additional purchase of the tied product; (3) the seller has sufficient market power in the market for the tying product; (4) a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product market is affected.<ref>''Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc.'', 504 U.S. 451, 461\u201362 (1992)</ref>\n\nFor at least three decades, the Supreme Court defined the required \"[[economic power]]\" to include just about any departure from [[perfect competition]], going so far as to hold that possession of a copyright or even the existence of a tie itself gave rise to a presumption of economic power.<ref>''See Fornter Enterprises v. United States Steel'', 394 U.S. 495 (1969); ''United States v. Loew's, Inc''. 372 U.S. 38 (1962)</ref> The Supreme Court has since held that a plaintiff must establish the sort of market power necessary for other antitrust violations in order to prove sufficient \"economic power\" necessary to establish a per se tie.<ref>''See Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde'', 466 U.S. 2 (1985)</ref>  More recently, the Court has eliminated any presumption of market power based solely on the fact that the tying product is patented or copyrighted.<ref>''See'' Illinois Tool Works v. Independent Ink'', 547 U.S. 28 (2006)</ref>\n\nIn recent years, changing business practices surrounding new technologies have put the legality of tying arrangements to the test. Although the Supreme Court still considers some tying arrangements as ''per se'' illegal, the Court actually uses a rule-of-reason analysis, requiring an analysis of foreclosure effects and an affirmative defense of efficiency justifications.<ref>J.

This means that the license on the operating system forbids software modification.<ref name=Jailbreaking /> However, regulators agreed that modifying an iPhone's firmware/operating system to enable it to run an application that Apple has not approved fits comfortably within the four corners of [[fair use]].<ref name=Jailbreaking />\n\n===Microsoft products===\nAnother prominent case involving a tying claim was ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]''.<ref name=\"See 2001\">''See [[United States v. Microsoft]], 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001).''</ref> By some accounts, [[Microsoft]] ties together [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Windows Media Player]], [[Outlook Express]] and [[Microsoft Office]]. The United States claimed that the bundling of Internet Explorer (IE) to sales of [[Windows 98]], making IE difficult to remove from Windows 98 (e.g., not putting it on the \"Remove Programs\" list), and designing Windows 98 to work \"unpleasantly\" with Netscape Navigator constituted an illegal tying of Windows 98 and IE.<ref>''Id.'' at 64-67, 84-86.</ref> Microsoft's counterargument was that a [[web browser]] and a mail reader are simply part of an [[operating system]], included with other [[personal computer]] operating systems, and the integration of the products was technologically justified. Just as the definition of a [[car]] has changed to include things that used to be separate products, such as [[speedometer]]s and radios, Microsoft claimed the definition of an operating system has changed to include their formerly separate products. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] rejected Microsoft's claim that Internet Explorer was simply one facet of its operating system, but the court held that the tie between Windows and Internet Explorer should be analyzed deferentially under the [[Rule of Reason]].<ref name=\"See 2001\"/>  The U.S. government claim settled before reaching final resolution.\n\nAs to the tying of Office, parallel cases against Microsoft brought by [[State Attorney General|State Attorneys General]] included a claim for harm in the market for office productivity applications.<ref>See Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft Corp. PP 88-95, 98, 117-19, No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed May 18, 1998)</ref> The Attorneys General abandoned this claim when filing an amended complaint. The claim was revived by [[Novell]] where they alleged that manufacturers of computers (\"[[OEM]]s\") were charged less for their Windows bulk purchases if they agreed to bundle Office with every PC sold than if they gave computer purchasers the choice whether or not to buy Office along with their machines \u2014 making their computer prices less competitive in the market. The Novell litigation is still ongoing.<ref>''See'' Civil No. JFM-05-1087.</ref>\n\nMicrosoft has also tied its software to the third-party [[Android OS|Android]] mobile operating system, by requiring manufacturers that license [[patent]]s it claims covers the OS and [[smartphone]]s to ship [[Microsoft Office Mobile]] and [[Skype]] applications on the devices.<ref name=\"supersite-androidpatents\">{{cite web|last1=Trent|first1=Rod|title=Microsoft Inside: 20 New Android Device Manufacturers Sign-on to Pre-Install Office and Skype|url=http://winsupersite.com/mobile/microsoft-inside-20-new-android-device-manufacturers-sign-pre-install-office-and-skype|website=SuperSite for Windows|publisher=Penton|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-xiaomims\">{{cite web|title=Xiaomi will bundle Microsoft's Office and Skype apps on its Android devices|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/1/11827268/microsoft-xiaomi-skype-office-android-apps-patent-deal|website=The Verge|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Anti-tying provision of the Bank Holding Company Act==\nIn 1970, Congress enacted section 106 of the [[Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970]] (BHCA), the anti-tying provision, which is codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1972. The statute was designed to prevent banks, whether large or small, state or federal, from imposing anticompetitive conditions on their customers. Tying is an antitrust violation, but the Sherman and Clayton Acts did not adequately protect borrowers from being required to accept conditions to loans issued by banks, and section 106 was specifically designed to apply to and remedy such bank misconduct.\n\nBanks are allowed to take measures to protect their loans and to safeguard the value of their investments, such as requiring security or guaranties from borrowers. The statute exempts so-called \u201ctraditional banking practices\u201d from its ''per se'' illegality, and thus its purpose is not so much to limit banks' lending practices, as it is to ensure that the practices used are fair and competitive. A majority of claims brought under the BHCA are denied. Banks still have quite a bit of leeway in fashioning loan agreements, but when a bank clearly steps over the bounds of propriety, the plaintiff is compensated with treble damages.\n\nAt least four regulatory agencies including the [[Federal Reserve Board]] oversee the activities of banks, their holding companies, and other related depository institutions. While each type of depository institution has a \u201cprimary regulator\u201d, the nation\u2019s \u201cdual banking\u201d system allows concurrent jurisdiction among the different regulatory agencies. With respect to the anti-tying provision, the Fed takes the preeminent role in relation to the other financial institution regulatory agencies, which reflects that it was considered the least biased (in favor of banks) of the regulatory agencies when section 106 was enacted.<ref>''See'' Timothy D.

This practises are prohibited under Article 101(1)(e) and Article 102(2)(d) and may amount to an infringement of the statute if other conditions are satisfied. However, it is noteworthy that the Court is willing to find an infringement beyond those listed in Article 102(2)(d), see Tetra Pak v Commission.<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61994CJ0333 C-333/94 P Tetra Pak v Commission  EU:C:1996:436,para 37]</ref>\n\n\n\n== Enforcement under European Law ==\n\nThe Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities sets out in which circumstances it will be appropriate taking actions against tying practises. First, it must be established whether the accused undertaking has a dominant position in the tying or tied product market<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01) The Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities], Footnote 34.</ref> . Subsequently, the next step is to determine whether the dominant undertaking tied two distinct products. This is important as two identical products cannot be considered tied under Article 102(2)(d) formulation that states products will be considered tied if they have no connects \u2018by their nature or commercial usage\u2019. This arises problems in the legal definition of what will amount to tying in scenarios of selling cars with tires or selling a car with a radio. Hence, the Commission provides guidance on this issue by citing the judgement in Microsoft<ref>[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=T-201/04 Case T-201/04 Microsoft Corp v Commission EU:T:2007:289]</ref> and states that \"two products are distinct if, in the absence of tying or bundling, a substantial number of customers would purchase or would have purchased the tying product without also buying the tied product from the same supplier, thereby allowing stand-alone production for both the tying and the tied product\"<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01) The Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities], Footnote 51.</ref> . Next issue is whether the customer was coerced to purchase both the tying and the tied products as Article 102(2)(d) suggests: \u2018making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations\u2019. In situations of contractual stipulation, it is clear that the test will be satisfied<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=1_39230 Case COMP/39230 \u2013 Rio Tinto Alcan]</ref> ; for an example of a non-contractual tying see Microsoft<ref>[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=T-201/04 Case T-201/04 Microsoft Corp v Commission EU:T:2007:289, para 963]</ref> .

In legal terms, a ''tying sale'' makes the sale of one [[Good (economics)|good]] (the ''tying good'') to the [[de facto]] customer (or [[de jure]] customer) conditional on the purchase of a second distinctive good (the ''tied good''). Tying is often illegal when the products are not naturally related. It is related to but distinct from [[freebie marketing]], a common (and legal) method of giving away (or selling at a substantial discount) one item to ensure a continual flow of sales of another related item.\n\nSome kinds of tying, especially by [[contract]], have historically been regarded as [[anti-competitive practices]]. The basic idea is that consumers are harmed by being forced to buy an undesired good (the tied good) in order to purchase a good they actually want (the tying good), and so would prefer that the goods be sold separately. The company doing this [[product bundling|bundling]] may have a significantly large market share so that it may impose the tie on consumers, despite the forces of market competition. The tie may also harm other companies in the market for the tied good, or who sell only single components.\n\nOne effect of tying can be that low quality products achieve a higher market share than would otherwise be the case.\n\nTying may also be a form of [[price discrimination]]: people who use more razor blades, for example, pay more than those who just need a one-time shave. Though this may improve overall welfare, by giving more consumers access to the market, such price discrimination can also transfer consumer surpluses to the producer. Tying may also be used with or in place of [[patent]]s or [[copyright]]s to help protect entry into a market, discouraging innovation.\n\nTying is often used when the supplier makes one product that is critical to many customers. By threatening to withhold that key product unless others are also purchased, the supplier can increase sales of less necessary products.\n\nIn the [[United States]], most [[U.S. state|states]] have laws against tying, which are enforced by state governments. In addition, the [[U.S.&nbsp;Department of Justice]] enforces federal laws against tying through its [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]].\n\n==Types==\n'''Horizontal tying''' is the practice of requiring consumers to pay for an unrelated product or service together with the desired one.<ref name=horizvert>{{cite web|title=Tying|url=http://www.whitecollarfirm.com/CM/Custom/Tying-Antitrust-Defense-Attorneys.asp|publisher=The Blanch Law Firm|accessdate=31 March 2011}}</ref>  A hypothetical example would be for [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bic|Bic]] to sell its pens only with Bic lighters. (However, a company may offer a limited free item with another purchase as a promotion.)\n\n'''Vertical tying''' is the practice of requiring customers to purchase related products or services together, from the same company.<ref name=horizvert /> For example, a company might mandate that its automobiles could only be serviced by its own dealers. In an effort to curb this, many jurisdictions require that warranties not be voided by outside servicing; for example, see the [[Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act]] in the United States.\n\n==In United States law==\nCertain tying arrangements are illegal in the [[United States]] under both the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]],<ref>''See'' ''N. Pac. Ry Co. v. United States'', 356 U.S. 1 (1958); ''[[International Salt Co. v. United States]]'', [[Case citation|332 U.S. 392]] (1947)</ref> and Section 3 of the [[Clayton Act]].<ref>15 U.S.C. s. 14</ref> A tying arrangement is defined as \"an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees he will not purchase the product from any other supplier.\"<ref>''N. Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1958)''</ref> Tying may be the action of several companies as well as the work of just one firm. Success on a tying claim typically requires proof of four elements: (1) two separate products or services are involved; (2) the purchase of the tying product is conditioned on the additional purchase of the tied product; (3) the seller has sufficient market power in the market for the tying product; (4) a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product market is affected.<ref>''Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc.'', 504 U.S. 451, 461\u201362 (1992)</ref>\n\nFor at least three decades, the Supreme Court defined the required \"[[economic power]]\" to include just about any departure from [[perfect competition]], going so far as to hold that possession of a copyright or even the existence of a tie itself gave rise to a presumption of economic power.<ref>''See Fornter Enterprises v. United States Steel'', 394 U.S. 495 (1969); ''United States v. Loew's, Inc''. 372 U.S. 38 (1962)</ref> The Supreme Court has since held that a plaintiff must establish the sort of market power necessary for other antitrust violations in order to prove sufficient \"economic power\" necessary to establish a per se tie.<ref>''See Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde'', 466 U.S. 2 (1985)</ref>  More recently, the Court has eliminated any presumption of market power based solely on the fact that the tying product is patented or copyrighted.<ref>''See'' Illinois Tool Works v. Independent Ink'', 547 U.S. 28 (2006)</ref>\n\nIn recent years, changing business practices surrounding new technologies have put the legality of tying arrangements to the test. Although the Supreme Court still considers some tying arrangements as ''per se'' illegal, the Court actually uses a rule-of-reason analysis, requiring an analysis of foreclosure effects and an affirmative defense of efficiency justifications.<ref>J.

When Apple initially released the [[iPhone]] on June 29, 2007,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/54769/2007/01/iphone.html |title=Apple unveils iPhone |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |author=Honan, Mathew |work=[[Macworld]]}}</ref> it was [[History of iPhone#Exclusivity tying of iPhone to AT&T|sold exclusively with AT&T]] (formerly [[Cingular]]) contracts in the United States.<ref name=\"CNN secrets\">{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/10/commentary/lewis_fortune_iphone.fortune/index.htm|title=How Apple kept its iPhone secrets|last=Lewis|first=Peter|date=January 12, 2007|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Money]]|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}</ref> To enforce this exclusivity, Apple employed a type of [[ Phone unlocking|software lock]] that ensured the phone would not work on any network besides AT&T's.<ref name=softwareLocking>{{ cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/29/technology/29iphone.html?_r=1 | title=Altered iPhones Freeze Up | author=Hafner, Katie | date=September 29, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> Related to the concept of [[bricking]], any user who tried to unlock or otherwise tamper with the locking software ran the risk of rendering their iPhone permanently inoperable.<ref name=softwareLocking />\nThis caused complaints among many consumers, as they were forced to pay an additional early termination fee of $175 if they wanted to unlock the device safely for use on a different carrier.<ref name=\"Democracts criticize\">{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9742441-7.html|title=Democrats criticize AT&T's exclusive iPhone deal|last=Broache|first=Anne|date=July 11, 2007|publisher=[[CNET News]]|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}</ref>  Other companies such as [[Google]] complained that tying encourages a more closed-access-based wireless service.<ref name=\"Democracts criticize\"/>{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}} Many questioned the legality of  the arrangement,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.recong2.com/journal/does_apples_tightly_controlled_ecosystem_strategy_constitute_an_illegal_tying_arrangement | title=Does Apple's Tightly Controlled Ecosystem Strategy Constitute and Illegal Tying Arrangement? |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Gonsowski, Laurie}}</ref> and in October 2007 a [[Class action lawsuit|class-action lawsuit]] was filed against Apple, claiming that its exclusive agreement with AT&T violates California [[antitrust law]].<ref name=classActionLawsuit>{{ cite news | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2007/10/california-man-seeks-class-action-lawsuit-over-iphone-bricking-lock-in.ars | title=California man seeks class action lawsuit over iPhone bricking, lock-in | date=October 7, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Chartier, David | work=[[Ars Technica]]}}</ref> The suit was filed by the Law Office of Damian R.

If done successfully, this allows one to run any application on the phone they choose, including applications not authorized by Apple.<ref name=Jailbreaking /> Apple told regulators that modifying the iPhone operating system leads to the creation of an infringing [[derivative work]] that is protected by copyright law. This means that the license on the operating system forbids software modification.<ref name=Jailbreaking /> However, regulators agreed that modifying an iPhone's firmware/operating system to enable it to run an application that Apple has not approved fits comfortably within the four corners of [[fair use]].<ref name=Jailbreaking />\n\n===Microsoft products===\nAnother prominent case involving a tying claim was ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]''.<ref name=\"See 2001\">''See [[United States v. Microsoft]], 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001).''</ref> By some accounts, [[Microsoft]] ties together [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Windows Media Player]], [[Outlook Express]] and [[Microsoft Office]]. The United States claimed that the bundling of Internet Explorer (IE) to sales of [[Windows 98]], making IE difficult to remove from Windows 98 (e.g., not putting it on the \"Remove Programs\" list), and designing Windows 98 to work \"unpleasantly\" with Netscape Navigator constituted an illegal tying of Windows 98 and IE.<ref>''Id.'' at 64-67, 84-86.</ref> Microsoft's counterargument was that a [[web browser]] and a mail reader are simply part of an [[operating system]], included with other [[personal computer]] operating systems, and the integration of the products was technologically justified. Just as the definition of a [[car]] has changed to include things that used to be separate products, such as [[speedometer]]s and radios, Microsoft claimed the definition of an operating system has changed to include their formerly separate products. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] rejected Microsoft's claim that Internet Explorer was simply one facet of its operating system, but the court held that the tie between Windows and Internet Explorer should be analyzed deferentially under the [[Rule of Reason]].<ref name=\"See 2001\"/>  The U.S. government claim settled before reaching final resolution.\n\nAs to the tying of Office, parallel cases against Microsoft brought by [[State Attorney General|State Attorneys General]] included a claim for harm in the market for office productivity applications.<ref>See Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft Corp. PP 88-95, 98, 117-19, No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed May 18, 1998)</ref> The Attorneys General abandoned this claim when filing an amended complaint. The claim was revived by [[Novell]] where they alleged that manufacturers of computers (\"[[OEM]]s\") were charged less for their Windows bulk purchases if they agreed to bundle Office with every PC sold than if they gave computer purchasers the choice whether or not to buy Office along with their machines \u2014 making their computer prices less competitive in the market. The Novell litigation is still ongoing.<ref>''See'' Civil No. JFM-05-1087.</ref>\n\nMicrosoft has also tied its software to the third-party [[Android OS|Android]] mobile operating system, by requiring manufacturers that license [[patent]]s it claims covers the OS and [[smartphone]]s to ship [[Microsoft Office Mobile]] and [[Skype]] applications on the devices.<ref name=\"supersite-androidpatents\">{{cite web|last1=Trent|first1=Rod|title=Microsoft Inside: 20 New Android Device Manufacturers Sign-on to Pre-Install Office and Skype|url=http://winsupersite.com/mobile/microsoft-inside-20-new-android-device-manufacturers-sign-pre-install-office-and-skype|website=SuperSite for Windows|publisher=Penton|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-xiaomims\">{{cite web|title=Xiaomi will bundle Microsoft's Office and Skype apps on its Android devices|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/1/11827268/microsoft-xiaomi-skype-office-android-apps-patent-deal|website=The Verge|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Anti-tying provision of the Bank Holding Company Act==\nIn 1970, Congress enacted section 106 of the [[Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970]] (BHCA), the anti-tying provision, which is codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1972. The statute was designed to prevent banks, whether large or small, state or federal, from imposing anticompetitive conditions on their customers. Tying is an antitrust violation, but the Sherman and Clayton Acts did not adequately protect borrowers from being required to accept conditions to loans issued by banks, and section 106 was specifically designed to apply to and remedy such bank misconduct.\n\nBanks are allowed to take measures to protect their loans and to safeguard the value of their investments, such as requiring security or guaranties from borrowers. The statute exempts so-called \u201ctraditional banking practices\u201d from its ''per se'' illegality, and thus its purpose is not so much to limit banks' lending practices, as it is to ensure that the practices used are fair and competitive. A majority of claims brought under the BHCA are denied. Banks still have quite a bit of leeway in fashioning loan agreements, but when a bank clearly steps over the bounds of propriety, the plaintiff is compensated with treble damages.\n\nAt least four regulatory agencies including the [[Federal Reserve Board]] oversee the activities of banks, their holding companies, and other related depository institutions. While each type of depository institution has a \u201cprimary regulator\u201d, the nation\u2019s \u201cdual banking\u201d system allows concurrent jurisdiction among the different regulatory agencies. With respect to the anti-tying provision, the Fed takes the preeminent role in relation to the other financial institution regulatory agencies, which reflects that it was considered the least biased (in favor of banks) of the regulatory agencies when section 106 was enacted.<ref>''See'' Timothy D. Naegele, The Bank Holding Company Act's Anti-Tying Provision: 35 Years Later, 122 Banking Law Journal 195 (2005); http://www.naegele.com/whats_new.html#articles.</ref>\n\n==In European Law==   \n\nTying is the \"practice of a supplier of one product, the tying product, requiring a buyer also to buy a second product, the tied product\"<ref>{{cite book\n|last1= Whish\n|first1= Richard\n|last2= Bailey\n|first2= David\n|chapter= Chapter 17 Abuse of Dominance (1): non-pricing practices\n|title= Competition Law\n|language= English\n|edition=9\n|publisher= Oxford University Press\n|date=2018\n|page=705\n|isbn=978-0-19-877906-3\n}}</ref>. The tying of a product can take various forms<ref>[[Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], para.48</ref>, that of contractual tying<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31988D0138 Eurofix-Bauci v Hilti OJ [1988<nowiki>]</nowiki> L 65/19]</ref> where a contract binds the buyer to purchase both products together, refusal to supply until the buyer agrees to purchase both products, withdrawal or withholding of a guarantee where the dominant seller will not provide the benefit of guarantee until the seller accepts to purchase that parties product<ref>[https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b3e9c82b-c78e-49c6-ab14-8d7a2159e78e {{cite book|chapter= C-New Developments|title= European Community competition policy 1996|volume= 26|publisher= Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, 1997 |date= 1997|pages= 48\u201349|isbn=92-828-0298-1 }} paras.142-143] </ref> , technical tying occurs when the products of the dominant party are physically integrated and making impossible to buy the one without the other<ref>[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=T-201/04 Case T-201/04 Microsoft Corp v Commission EU:T:2007:289]</ref>  and bundling where two products are sold in the same package with one price. This practises are prohibited under Article 101(1)(e) and Article 102(2)(d) and may amount to an infringement of the statute if other conditions are satisfied. However, it is noteworthy that the Court is willing to find an infringement beyond those listed in Article 102(2)(d), see Tetra Pak v Commission<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61994CJ0333 C-333/94 P Tetra Pak v Commission  EU:C:1996:436,para 37]</ref>.\n\n\n\n== Enforcement under European Law ==\n\nThe Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities sets out in which circumstances it will be appropriate taking actions against tying practises. First, it must be established whether the accused undertaking has a dominant position in the tying or tied product market<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01) The Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities], Footnote 34.</ref> . Subsequently, the next step is to determine whether the dominant undertaking tied two distinct products. This is important as two identical products cannot be considered tied under Article 102(2)(d) formulation that states products will be considered tied if they have no connects \u2018by their nature or commercial usage\u2019. This arises problems in the legal definition of what will amount to tying in scenarios of selling cars with tires or selling a car with a radio. Hence, the Commission provides guidance on this issue by citing the judgement in Microsoft<ref>[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=T-201/04 Case T-201/04 Microsoft Corp v Commission EU:T:2007:289]</ref> and states that \"two products are distinct if, in the absence of tying or bundling, a substantial number of customers would purchase or would have purchased the tying product without also buying the tied product from the same supplier, thereby allowing stand-alone production for both the tying and the tied product\"<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01) The Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities], Footnote 51.</ref> . Next issue is whether the customer was coerced to purchase both the tying and the tied products as Article 102(2)(d) suggests: \u2018making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations\u2019. In situations of contractual stipulation, it is clear that the test will be satisfied<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/isef/case_details.cfm?proc_code=1_39230 Case COMP/39230 \u2013 Rio Tinto Alcan]</ref> ; for an example of a non-contractual tying see Microsoft<ref>[http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=T-201/04 Case T-201/04 Microsoft Corp v Commission EU:T:2007:289, para 963]</ref> . Furthermore, for an undertaking to be deemed anti-competitive is whether the tie is cable of having foreclosure effect<ref>[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52009XC0224(01) The Guidance on Article 102 Enforcement Priorities], Footnotes 52-58.</ref>.

This lineup released ''[[Spellbound (Tygers of Pan Tang album)|Spellbound]]'' in 1981.<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/>\n\nSykes quit after the release of the third album, ''[[Crazy Nights (Tygers of Pan Tang album)|Crazy Nights]]'', to audition for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band. He was replaced by ex-[[Penetration (band)|Penetration]] guitarist Fred Purser,<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/> who had to learn the set in two days before touring.\n\nTygers of Pan Tang's fourth album, ''[[The Cage (Tygers of Pan Tang album)|The Cage]]'', was released in 1982.<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/> The band then had a disagreement with MCA, who were not prepared to promote them unless they agreed to play more cover recordings (following the band's hit with \"[[Love Potion No. 9 (song)|Love Potion No. 9]]\"). They subsequently tried to break free from their contract, but MCA's demands exceeded the willingness of any other record company to pay to free the band, and the band broke up in frustration.<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/>\n\nJohn Sykes later achieved success with [[Thin Lizzy]] and then [[Whitesnake]].\n\nSongs for a new album were demoed by the same line-up which completed the previous album. It was supposed to be called \"Square One\". The label did not approve the material and, in consequence this line-up dismembered. Songs from this aborted album ended up appearing later, in 2018, under the name \"Purser Deverill\".<ref>http://mightymusic.dk/artists/purser-deverill/</ref>\n\n===Reformation, 1985\u20131987===\nIn 1985, Jon Deverill and Brian Dick reformed the band with Steve Lamb (formerly of Sergeant) on guitar, Neil Sheppard on guitar, and ex-Warrior, ex-Satan member Clin Irwin on bass. Dave Donaldson later replaced Clin Irwin. Meanwhile, Robb Weir and Jess Cox formed the spin-off band Tyger-Tyger.<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/>\n\nThe reformed Tygers of Pan Tang released ''[[The Wreck-Age]]'' in summer 1985 through [[Music for Nations]], and ''[[Burning in the Shade]]'' in 1987, through [[Zebra Records]]. ''Burning in the Shade'' received poor reviews and they disbanded again.<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/>\n\nVarious compilations and live albums were produced by the band's two first labels, Neat Records and MCA.\n\n===Latter days, 1999\u2013present===\nDuring the 1998 [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, Jess Cox joined on stage with [[Blitzkrieg (band)|Blitzkrieg]], playing three old Tygers songs. The audience's response was positive, and a year later, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tygers of Pan Tang and the 10th Wacken Open Air, the band was invited to play on the main stage. Brian Dick and Rocky were unable to join the band, but the Tygers (now Jess Cox and Robb Weir, backed up by Blitzkrieg guitarist Glenn S Howes, bassist Gavin Gray, and drummer Chris Percy) did perform.<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/> Recordings of their performance resulted in the ''Live at Wacken'' album.\n\nIn 2000, Robb Weir reformed the band as the only original member. The other musicians were Tony Liddell (vocals), Dean Robertson (lead guitar), Brian West (bass), and Craig Ellis (drums). They released ''Mystical'' through Z-Records. They toured in several festivals, but eventually were dropped by Z-Records in 2002, due to poor record sales.\n\nThe band went on to produce the split album ''[[The Second Wave: 25 Years of NWOBHM]]'' with [[Girlschool]] and [[Oliver/Dawson Saxon]] on Communique Records, and in 2004 released ''Noises in the Cathouse'' with new singer Richie Wicks who although a singer by trade was at the time still playing bass in Angel Witch.\n\nLater that year, Richie Wicks left and was replaced by Italian vocalist Jacopo Meille. Wicks later joined [[Shadowkeep]], appearing on their 2008 album ''The Hourglass Effect'', before leaving in 2009. As of 2010, he was the vocalist in Heavenly Hell, a [[Ronnie James Dio|Dio]]-era [[Black Sabbath]] tribute band, and in 2013 he commenced fronting the band [[Black Sabbath|Black]], [[Whitesnake|White]] [[Deep Purple|& Purple]] with fellow ex-[[Angel Witch]] guitarist Keith Herzberg and current [[Praying Mantis (band)|Praying Mantis]] drummer Gary MacKenzie, along with [[Shadowkeep]]'s ex-bassist Mark Fielden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/voiceoflucifer|title=Richie Wicks (voiceoflucifer) on Myspace|website=Myspace.com|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nJon Deverill went on to work as an actor under the name of Jon De Ville, and as of October 2007 was performing in '[[The Sound of Music]]' at the [[London Palladium]] with television star [[Connie Fisher]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jon De Ville \u2013 Franz |work=The Official Sound of Music London Web Site |publisher=The Really Useful Group Ltd. |url=http://www.soundofmusiclondon.com/cast/jondeville.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517165402/http://www.soundofmusiclondon.com/cast/jondeville.php |archivedate=17 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2007, the band issued a limited edition five track [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Back and Beyond'', which featured reworkings of three Tygers songs from the early 1980s, along with two new tracks taken from their forthcoming album.

The audience's response was positive, and a year later, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tygers of Pan Tang and the 10th Wacken Open Air, the band was invited to play on the main stage. Brian Dick and Rocky were unable to join the band, but the Tygers (now Jess Cox and Robb Weir, backed up by Blitzkrieg guitarist Glenn S Howes, bassist Gavin Gray, and drummer Chris Percy) did perform.<ref name=\"Larkin80\"/> Recordings of their performance resulted in the ''Live at Wacken'' album.\n\nIn 2000, Robb Weir reformed the band as the only original member.

The proprietary TwinVQ codec supports [[constant bit rate]] [[code|encoding]] at 80, 96, 112, 128, 160 and 192 kbit/s. It was claimed that TwinVQ files are about 30 to 35% smaller than [[MP3]] files of adequate quality. For example, a 96 kbit/s TwinVQ file allegedly has roughly the same quality as a 128 kbit/s MP3 file. The higher quality is achieved at the cost of higher processor usage.\n\nYamaha marketed TwinVQ as an alternative to MP3, but the format never became very popular. This could be attributed to the proprietary nature of the format\u2014third party software was scarce and there was no hardware support. Also the encoding was extremely slow and there was not much music available in TwinVQ format. As other MP3 alternatives emerged, TwinVQ quickly became obsolete.\n\nThe proprietary version of TwinVQ can be also used for [[speech encoding]]. Compression technology specifically designed to handle voice compression was published by NTT.

The proprietary TwinVQ codec supports [[constant bit rate]] [[code|encoding]] at 80, 96, 112, 128, 160 and 192 kbit/s. It was claimed that TwinVQ files are about 30 to 35% smaller than [[MP3]] files of adequate quality. For example, a 96 kbit/s TwinVQ file allegedly has roughly the same quality as a 128 kbit/s MP3 file. The higher quality is achieved at the cost of higher processor usage.\n\nYamaha marketed TwinVQ as an alternative to MP3, but the format never became very popular. This could be attributed to the proprietary nature of the format\u2014third party software was scarce and there was no hardware support. Also the encoding was extremely slow and there was not much music available in TwinVQ format. As other MP3 alternatives emerged, TwinVQ quickly became obsolete.\n\nThe proprietary version of TwinVQ can be also used for [[speech encoding]]. Compression technology specifically designed to handle voice compression was published by NTT.

Other types of transportation were tested including [[taxicab]]s and [[steamboat]]s, along with the operation of some destination sites such as [[amusement park]]s. It existed under the TCRT name from a merger in the 1890s until it was purchased in 1962. At its height in the early 20th century, the company operated an intercity streetcar system that was believed{{by whom|date=March 2012}} to be one of the best in the United States. It is a predecessor of the current [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] bus and [[METRO (Minnesota)|light rail]] system that operates in the metro area.\n\n==Establishment==\n[[File:051907-010-Minneapolis1904.jpg|thumb|left|TCRT commissioned water-color painting of the streetcar system in the Twin Cities, originally completed in 1904; updated 1916.]] \nThe origins of street rail transport in the Twin Cities are not entirely known. Some sources state that it dates back to 1865, when businessman and mayor [[Dorilus Morrison]] began building rails in downtown [[Minneapolis]]. He quickly joined forces with Colonel [[William S. King]] and other Minneapolis businessmen to create the Minneapolis Street Railway. However, the lines didn't go very far and the railway was useless for a time. There are some indications that a streetcar was purchased but never used, collecting dust for several years.\n\nOn the other side of the Mississippi River, the St. Paul Railway Company started the first successful [[horsecar|horse-drawn streetcar]] system of the metro area in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Then in 1875, the reformed Minneapolis Street Railway made a deal with the Minneapolis City Council where the company would have exclusive access to street rails for 50 years if they could be up and operating in four months. The company recruited [[real-estate]] mogul [[Thomas Lowry]], who on September 2, 1875, brought on line a route between downtown Minneapolis and the [[University of Minnesota]].\n\nThe streetcars became popular because they rode on smooth rails, while most of the streets of the era were dirt or made of [[cobblestone]] [[paving stone (flooring)|pavers]]. These roads became treacherous to pedestrians and uncomfortable to ride on in horse-drawn [[horse and buggy|buggies]], especially during [[Climate of Minnesota|Minnesota winters]].\n\nThomas Lowry envisioned linking together the various railways that were cropping up around Minneapolis. While other systems were popping up with more horse-drawn carriages or [[cable car (railway)|cable car]]s, Lowry pushed forward with [[electricity|electrification]] of the lines. Starting in the late-1880s, electric streetcars began moving in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. Cable cars quickly lost favor as they struggled through snowy Minnesota winters and the public quickly grew weary{{weasel-inline|date=March 2012}} of slow horsecars.\n\n==Rise of the system==\nIn 1890, the two cities were connected with a railway along [[University Avenue (Minneapolis-St. Paul)|University Avenue]], the first of four rail lines linking them together.<ref>{{cite book|last=Issacs|first=Aaron|title=The 1940s's|year=1995|publisher=Minnesota Transportation Museum|page=4}}</ref> A merger of the two city systems, the St. Paul City Railway Co. and Minneapolis Street Railway, formed the Twin City Rapid Transit Company. It went on a building spree, quickly doubling the amount of electrified track in the system.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kieffer|first=Stephen A.|title=Transit and the Twins|year=1958|publisher=Twin Cities Rapid Transit Company|page= 20}}</ref>\n\nThe company continued absorbing smaller competitors for the next 40 years. In 1898, the company began a transition to using company-built streetcars and machinery (such as [[crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[snowplow]]s) rather than purchasing the cars from other companies. The first such car was built as a personal streetcar for company president Thomas Lowry, although his was a special-order. The car featured one end with large windows, to make the scenery more visible. This car was used on special occasions, such as the opening of new lines and a visit by United States President [[William McKinley]].\n\nTCRT built some of the largest streetcars in the country. The Twin City Rapid Transit Company got into the business of building street cars at its Nicolett Shops in 1898 after concluding that cars it was operating from Eastern manufactures couldn't hold up to Minnesota's harsh winters. By 1906 they opened a manufacturing facility at its Snelling Shops where they not only manufactured cars for TCRT but also Chattanooga, Duluth, Seattle and Chicago among others. These cars were larger than traditional streetcars, being {{convert|45|ft|m|2}} long and {{convert|9|ft|m|2}} wide.\n\n[[File:Streetcar-Minneapolis-1939.jpg|thumb|right|Streetcar in downtown Minneapolis, 1939.]]\nOld track was also upgraded. In the early days, a number of lines had been laid down with [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]]{{which|date=June 2013}}<!-- {{RailGauge|3ft6in}}? --> track. These were all [[Track gauge conversion|upgraded]] to {{RailGauge|ussg}} ([[standard gauge]]). In addition, the basic construction of the lines improved. The rails of the Twin Cities were upgraded to the most expensive track in the country, running [[United States dollar|US$]]60,000 per mile. Tracks featured [[welding|welded]] ([[thermite]]) joints, and were commonly surrounded by cobblestone or [[asphalt]]. By 1909, 95 percent of the rails were of this type of construction. They were used until the company ended streetcar service.\n\n[[File:TCRT Trolley Boat.jpg|thumb|left|\"Streetcar boat\" ''Hopkins'' on Lake Minnetonka]]\nFrom 1906 to 1926, TCRT experimented with \"streetcar boats.\" Officially known as Express Boats, they were steam-powered vessels with designs reminiscent of the streetcars of the day. The boats operated between communities on [[Lake Minnetonka]], but improved roads in that area hit ridership hard in the 1920s. Ultimately, seven were built, but most of them were scuttled in the lake in 1926.\n\nTCRT also expanded into the suburban [[amusement park]] business by opening the Wildwood Amusement Park on [[White Bear Lake (Minnesota)|White Bear Lake]] and [[Big Island Amusement Park|Big Island Park]] on Lake Minnetonka. The park on Big Island was serviced by three large [[ferry boats]] from [[Excelsior, Minnesota|Excelsior]]. \n\nThe [[internal combustion engine]] didn't escape notice.{{by whom|date=March 2012}} The Twin City Rapid Transit acquired several bus lines that began to pop up around the time of [[World War I]]. They also acquired a taxicab company in the 1920s.\n\nWhen the transportation system peaked in 1922, it had nearly {{convert|530|mi|km}} of track and 1021 streetcars.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1     = Prosser | first1 = Richard\n| last2     = Hofsommer | first2 = Don L\n| title     = [[Rails to the North Star]]\n| place     = Minneapolis\n| publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]]\n| pages     = 95\u2013106\n| year      = 2007\n| isbn      = 978-0-8166-5267-9 }}\n</ref> Rail extended a distance of about {{convert|50|mi|km}} from [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]] on the bank of the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] in the east to Lake Minnetonka in the west. For a time, TCRT was the largest employer in the area.\n\nIt is rumored that anyone who lived in Minneapolis was no farther than {{convert|400|yd|m}} (less than {{convert|1/4|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or}}) from the nearest station at that time.\n\n==Changing labor conditions==\n[[File:Snowplow streetcar Minneapolis 1939.jpg|thumb|right|Snowplow streetcar, 1939.]]\nIn 1917, a major labor [[strike action|strike]] took place in the months after the United States entered World War I. It began on October 6, and was influenced by the organization [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW, also known as the \"Wobblies\"), a militant group that had been organizing [[labor union|unions]] in the region, particularly in the northern [[Mesabi Iron Range]]. Horace Lowry, son of Thomas Lowry, headed the company at this time and absolutely refused to negotiate with the striking workers. This angered workers and others who felt sympathy for them.\n\nAngry strikers in St. Paul damaged streetcars and harassed those who had continued to work. The Minnesota Commission of Public Safety ordered the workers back on the job and they complied for a while. People again left work in late-November. On December 2, a crowd energized by speakers from the [[Nonpartisan League]] again grew angry after TCRT cut off electricity to the streetcars in downtown St. Paul, making it impossible for many people to return home. Over the following days, many were arrested and the strike was effectively broken. 800 people were eventually replaced by non-union workers.\n\nThings turned out differently in the 1930s, although it was not a smooth transition. In 1932, most of the system's streetcars were converted to \"one-man operation\" where, rather than requiring both a motorman to drive in front and a conductor to take fares in the rear, the motorman took over both operations. The doors on the streetcars were modified to allow easier boarding in front. So-called \"gate cars\" which had used open grating on the rear of the cars mostly disappeared from the lines. The transition from two-man to one-man operation was taking place on many streetcar lines across the country around this time.\n\nThe conversion to single-man operation meant that about half of the company's workforce was suddenly surplus. Many employees found it hard to get work and were often forced to take strange shifts. One worker recorded having a 17-hour shift from 4:24&nbsp;p.m. on Sunday to 9:49&nbsp;a.m. on Monday. There was a company union, although it hadn't done much good. By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor [[Floyd B. Olson]], St. Paul Mayor [[William Mahoney (mayor)|William Mahoney]] and the [[National Recovery Administration]], among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the [[Amalgamated Transit Union]].\n\n==Competition from automobiles==\nWith the [[Great Depression]] and the rise of the [[automobile]], the rail lines began to decline. Buses were frequently used toward the edges of the system as long routes, especially those with low ridership, were cut back. [[World War II]] allowed the system to bounce back for a time, since strict fuel [[rationing]] and citizens' efforts to conserve resources made automobile use rather un-patriotic. However, the restrictions also hit TCRT itself since they could not afford to build many new streetcars. The company was forced to add more buses to shore up the system's various routes.\n\nAfter the war, trolley riders returned to their automobiles. TCRT's management explored ways to upgrade the line to bring people back. Heavy wartime use meant that the rails needed to be repaired. Competition from other forms of transportation required modernization. In 1945, the company received its first streamlined [[PCC streetcar]]. The following years saw dozens of new PCC cars on the streets, although the first one remained unique in the fleet because it was the only one to have [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s. All of the PCCs were several inches wider than standard, to match the {{convert|9|ft|m|2|adj=on|spell=in}} width of the company's older streetcars.\n\n==Company takeover and decline==\n[[File:1954 Twin City Rapid Transit bus 1303 on display 2011.jpg|thumb|A 1954-built Twin City Lines bus, now preserved, in 2011]]\nThe company had a long-standing policy of reinvestment in the rail system. When profits appeared, they were usually used to pay off loans and improve the rails, streetcars and other hardware the company owned. It was rare for the company to pay out [[dividend]]s. In 1948, [[Wall Street]] [[speculation|speculator]] Charles Green bought 6000 shares of TCRT stock. He expected to quickly gain profit, but found he had purchased stock just as the company decided to set forth on some major construction. Knowing this would demolish his anticipated dividends, Green contacted other shareholders and urged them to vote out the company's president, D. J. Strouse and put him in charge instead.\n\nGreen took control of the company in 1949 and quickly started dismantling the railway system, announcing that the company would completely switch to buses by 1958. The system's PCCs were sold to Mexico City (91), Newark NJ (30) and Shaker Heights OH (20). Green sold his shares in 1950 to be briefly replaced by Emil B. Anderson before local lawyer [[Fred Ossanna]] ascended to head the company the next year. Ossanna held off on the teardown for a short while, but soon announced that the process would be accelerated. Lines would be removed and replaced by buses in two years.\n\n==End of the streetcar system==\n\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{POV-section|date=October 2014}}\n{{weasel|section|date=October 2014}}\n{{disputed section|date=October 2014}}\n}}\n[[File:En-Thomas Lowry.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup view of the Thomas Lowry Memorial statue in Smith Triangle Park at the intersection of Hennepin Avenue, Emerson Avenue, and 24th Street in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. The inscription reads: \"The lesson of a public-spirited life is as a tree ever bearing new fruit.\" Lowry died in 1909.]]\nOn June 19, 1954, four years before Green had envisioned, the very last streetcars ran in Minneapolis. The leftover vehicles were unceremoniously burned to recover the scrap metal they contained. The last streetcar was very famously photographed alight behind Fred Ossanna and James Towley as Towley presented Ossanna with a [[cheque|check]].<ref>https://digitalcollections.hclib.org/digital/collection/MplsPhotos/id/14097/</ref>\n\nOthers{{who|date=April 2019}} point out that these allegations fail to account for the issues facing TCRT. Automobiles were more flexible than trains, didn't require the rider to abide by a schedule and afforded some privacy. A population growing more wealthy could afford such luxuries. Highway development enabled settlement over a wider area. Minneapolis' population peak in the late 1940s and St. Paul's a decade later in the late 1950s. Population growth and job growth was spread out in less dense suburbs where capital requirements for building new rail were too high compared to the potential ridership. Building rails to service these areas was cost prohibitive. Buses though could be profitable on such routes. More so other streetcar lines without connection to NCL also converted to buses, frequently having done so long before the TCRT began the process.\n\nFred Ossanna came to work at TCRT as a lawyer for Charles Green in the 1949 takeover of the company. Reportedly{{by whom|date=October 2014}}, Ossanna planned to order 25 buses from General Motors and was instead offered 525. The vast majority of buses in TCRT's eventual bus fleet were built by GM.\n\nMost of the activity was geared toward stripping TCRT of its [[asset]]s to fill the pockets of owners and investors. Ossanna was convicted in 1960 of illegally taking personal profit from the company during the transition period. He was [[prison|imprisoned]] along with other accomplices. [[Carl Pohlad]], who became the owner of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1984, was the eventual successor of Fred Ossanna as head of Twin City Lines in the 1960s. He ultimately sold the company in 1970.\n\n==Streetcar preservation==\nBefore the dismantling began, TCRT had purchased a significant number of [[PCC streetcar]]s. These were sold off in 1952 and 1953, still in very good operating condition. The cars ended up in [[Mexico City]] (91 cars), [[Newark, New Jersey]] (30) and [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]] (20). Relatively few places could have taken them because of their extra width and each of these buyers had significant amounts of dedicated [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]]. For instance, the [[Shaker Heights Rapid Transit]] commuter line in [[Cleveland]] was grade-separated in many areas. The vast majority of the older wooden streetcars, mostly built by TCRT itself, were destroyed. Out of 1240 built by the company, only five have survived to be restored and operated by rail museums.\n\nOnly two of the wooden streetcars in use in the 1950s had been given away to [[railfan]] groups before the rest of the fleet was burned. They are owned by the [[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]] (TCRT No. 1300) and the [[Seashore Trolley Museum]] (TCRT No. 1267) in [[Maine]]. One other steel-sheathed car (TCRT No. 1583) had been sent to a railway to the north in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]-[[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], but it was never used. It now resides at the [[East Troy Electric Railroad Museum]] in [[Wisconsin]]. A few additional cars escaped the burn pits, but they were still subjected to harsh conditions and only two are restored.\n\n[[File:TCRT PCC streetcar.jpg|thumb|right|TCRT PCC Streetcar Number 322 is now owned by the [[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]] and is pictured here riding near [[Lake Harriet (Hennepin County, Minnesota)|Lake Harriet]] on the museum's route.]]\nOne of the streetcar boats, the ''Minnehaha'', was found by divers and then brought to the surface in 1980. After a long wait, it was restored and has been operating on Lake Minnetonka from 1996 to 2004 by the [[Minnesota Transportation Museum]] and since then by the [[Museum of Lake Minnetonka]]. MTM also restored one of TCRT's old PCC cars (TCRT No. 322), operated now by the [[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]].\n\nSome{{which|date=March 2012}} of the PCC cars once owned by Twin City Rapid Transit are just beginning their lives as museum pieces. The [[Newark City Subway]] finished operation of their 24 remaining cars on August 24, 2001, replacing the cars with new light-rail trainsets. Fifteen have been sold to the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni), for their collection of classic streetcars on the [[Market Street Railway (nonprofit)|Market Street Railway]]. In addition, 12 PCCs that ran on the Shaker Heights line are now owned by the [[Brooklyn Historic Railway Association]]. Many of these cars owe their longevity to the fact that the Twin Cities area makes heavy use of salt to de-ice roadways in the winter. In anticipation of this, the cars were largely made of [[stainless steel]] to prevent [[corrosion]].\n\n==Historical remnants==\nOther vestiges of the company's streetcar history remained in the Twin Cities, and some surviving elements are now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. One of the oldest structures to survive is a building in Minneapolis now known as the [[Colonial Warehouse]]. First built in 1885, it housed the headquarters of the Minneapolis Street Railway Co. during the early horsecar era and also later served as a powerhouse as the system was converted. The lines needed a lot of electricity, so [[hydroelectric]] generators were installed at [[Saint Anthony Falls]] about a mile away and the [[Southeast Steam Plant]] was also constructed nearby. The old headquarters was sold in 1908, soon after these were constructed. The steam plant was bought by the [[University of Minnesota]], which now uses it for providing heat to the campus downriver.\n\nA large building on Snelling Avenue in St. Paul first served as the main construction and repair shop for the streetcars when it was built in 1907. It was expanded and remodeled over the years, later becoming a major garage for the bus system. However, the complex became outdated, with poor ventilation, a leaky roof and other problems. It was finally shut down and demolished in September 2001.\n\n[[Selby Hill]] in St. Paul was a steep climb and was a place where cable cars were used in the late 19th century before Selby Hill Tunnel was constructed in 1905 to provide a more gradual incline. The tunnel still exists, but the ends have been blocked off. It is near the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral of St. Paul]].\n\n[[Billboard (advertising)|Billboards]] across the area were originally laid out to target passengers of the rail lines with advertising. Many of these billboards remained for decades afterward, despite the fact that automobile traffic frequently favored different routes. These finally disappeared due to city beautification efforts in the 1990s.\n\n==Legacy to 21st century rail==\nIn the 1970s, the bus lines (some of which still trace former horse-drawn buggy paths) were shifted to a partially publicly funded operation overseen by the [[Metropolitan Council]]. All regional transportation for the metropolitan area was soon overseen by the Met Council's transit agency which would take on the name [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]]. Twenty years after rails disappeared from Twin Cities streets, politicians and planners began proposing new [[light rail]] systems. Congestion was bad enough in 1972 that there were proposals to build new [[rapid transit|subway]]s or [[people mover]]s, but excessively high costs prevented any of the projects from getting anywhere until the end of the century. The University of Minnesota did a fair amount of research on [[personal rapid transit]] (PRT) systems and has held a number of patents on the idea.\n\nRail transport returned to the Twin Cities with the construction of the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]], which began operations in 2004. A proposal for a [[heritage streetcar]] line running east-west through the city, possibly including PCC cars once owned by TCRT, has been examined. A [[Northstar Line|Northstar]] [[commuter rail]] line, tracing [[U.S. Route 10 in Minnesota|U.S. Highway 10]] northwest out of Minneapolis, opened in 2009. [[Green Line (Minnesota)|A connection between both of the twin cities]], called the Green Line, opened on June 14, 2014. [[Southwest Corridor (Minneapolis)|Light rail west from Minneapolis to the southwest suburbs]] is being constructed as of 2020. Other proposals have included adding both a commuter connection to [[Rush Line Corridor|the complete North]] and [[Red Rock Corridor|Southeast]] of downtown Saint Paul. A light rail alignment to [[Pilot Knob Central Corridor|the Southwest]] of downtown Saint Paul has been previously discussed, but dismissed due to the expectation of low ridership.\n\n==See also==\n*[[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]]\n*[[Light rail in Minnesota]]\n*[[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040311061629/http://www.rakemag.com/features/detail.asp?catID=46&itemID=1326&pg=1 Get Rail!].

('''TCL'''), was a transportation company that operated [[streetcar]]s and buses in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] [[metropolitan area]] in the U.S. state of [[Minnesota]]. Other types of transportation were tested including [[taxicab]]s and [[steamboat]]s, along with the operation of some destination sites such as [[amusement park]]s. It existed under the TCRT name from a merger in the 1890s until it was purchased in 1962. At its height in the early 20th century, the company operated an intercity streetcar system that was believed{{by whom|date=March 2012}} to be one of the best in the United States. It is a predecessor of the current [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] bus and [[METRO (Minnesota)|light rail]] system that operates in the metro area.\n\n==Establishment==\n[[File:051907-010-Minneapolis1904.jpg|thumb|left|TCRT commissioned water-color painting of the streetcar system in the Twin Cities, originally completed in 1904; updated 1916.]] \nThe origins of street rail transport in the Twin Cities are not entirely known. Some sources state that it dates back to 1865, when businessman and mayor [[Dorilus Morrison]] began building rails in downtown [[Minneapolis]]. He quickly joined forces with Colonel [[William S. King]] and other Minneapolis businessmen to create the Minneapolis Street Railway. However, the lines didn't go very far and the railway was useless for a time. There are some indications that a streetcar was purchased but never used, collecting dust for several years.\n\nOn the other side of the Mississippi River, the St. Paul Railway Company started the first successful [[horsecar|horse-drawn streetcar]] system of the metro area in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Then in 1875, the reformed Minneapolis Street Railway made a deal with the Minneapolis City Council where the company would have exclusive access to street rails for 50 years if they could be up and operating in four months. The company recruited [[real-estate]] mogul [[Thomas Lowry]], who on September 2, 1875, brought on line a route between downtown Minneapolis and the [[University of Minnesota]].\n\nThe streetcars became popular because they rode on smooth rails, while most of the streets of the era were dirt or made of [[cobblestone]] [[paving stone (flooring)|pavers]]. These roads became treacherous to pedestrians and uncomfortable to ride on in horse-drawn [[horse and buggy|buggies]], especially during [[Climate of Minnesota|Minnesota winters]].\n\nThomas Lowry envisioned linking together the various railways that were cropping up around Minneapolis. While other systems were popping up with more horse-drawn carriages or [[cable car (railway)|cable car]]s, Lowry pushed forward with [[electricity|electrification]] of the lines. Starting in the late-1880s, electric streetcars began moving in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. Cable cars quickly lost favor as they struggled through snowy Minnesota winters and the public quickly grew weary{{weasel-inline|date=March 2012}} of slow horsecars.\n\n==Rise of the system==\nIn 1890, the two cities were connected with a railway along [[University Avenue (Minneapolis-St. Paul)|University Avenue]], the first of four rail lines linking them together.<ref>{{cite book|last=Issacs|first=Aaron|title=The 1940s's|year=1995|publisher=Minnesota Transportation Museum|page=4}}</ref> A merger of the two city systems, the St. Paul City Railway Co. and Minneapolis Street Railway, formed the Twin City Rapid Transit Company. It went on a building spree, quickly doubling the amount of electrified track in the system.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kieffer|first=Stephen A.|title=Transit and the Twins|year=1958|publisher=Twin Cities Rapid Transit Company|page= 20}}</ref>\n\nThe company continued absorbing smaller competitors for the next 40 years. In 1898, the company began a transition to using company-built streetcars and machinery (such as [[crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[snowplow]]s) rather than purchasing the cars from other companies. The first such car was built as a personal streetcar for company president Thomas Lowry, although his was a special-order. The car featured one end with large windows, to make the scenery more visible. This car was used on special occasions, such as the opening of new lines and a visit by United States President [[William McKinley]].\n\nTCRT built some of the largest streetcars in the country. The Twin City Rapid Transit Company got into the business of building street cars at its Nicolett Shops in 1898 after concluding that cars it was operating from Eastern manufactures couldn't hold up to Minnesota's harsh winters. By 1906 they opened a manufacturing facility at its Snelling Shops where they not only manufactured cars for TCRT but also Chattanooga, Duluth, Seattle and Chicago among others. These cars were larger than traditional streetcars, being {{convert|45|ft|m|2}} long and {{convert|9|ft|m|2}} wide.\n\n[[File:Streetcar-Minneapolis-1939.jpg|thumb|right|Streetcar in downtown Minneapolis, 1939.]]\nOld track was also upgraded. In the early days, a number of lines had been laid down with [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]]{{which|date=June 2013}}<!-- {{RailGauge|3ft6in}}? --> track. These were all [[Track gauge conversion|upgraded]] to {{RailGauge|ussg}} ([[standard gauge]]). In addition, the basic construction of the lines improved. The rails of the Twin Cities were upgraded to the most expensive track in the country, running [[United States dollar|US$]]60,000 per mile. Tracks featured [[welding|welded]] ([[thermite]]) joints, and were commonly surrounded by cobblestone or [[asphalt]]. By 1909, 95 percent of the rails were of this type of construction. They were used until the company ended streetcar service.\n\n[[File:TCRT Trolley Boat.jpg|thumb|left|\"Streetcar boat\" ''Hopkins'' on Lake Minnetonka]]\nFrom 1906 to 1926, TCRT experimented with \"streetcar boats.\" Officially known as Express Boats, they were steam-powered vessels with designs reminiscent of the streetcars of the day. The boats operated between communities on [[Lake Minnetonka]], but improved roads in that area hit ridership hard in the 1920s. Ultimately, seven were built, but most of them were scuttled in the lake in 1926.\n\nTCRT also expanded into the suburban [[amusement park]] business by opening the Wildwood Amusement Park on [[White Bear Lake (Minnesota)|White Bear Lake]] and [[Big Island Amusement Park|Big Island Park]] on Lake Minnetonka. The park on Big Island was serviced by three large [[ferry boats]] from [[Excelsior, Minnesota|Excelsior]]. \n\nThe [[internal combustion engine]] didn't escape notice.{{by whom|date=March 2012}} The Twin City Rapid Transit acquired several bus lines that began to pop up around the time of [[World War I]]. They also acquired a taxicab company in the 1920s.\n\nWhen the transportation system peaked in 1922, it had nearly {{convert|530|mi|km}} of track and 1021 streetcars.<ref>{{Citation\n| last1     = Prosser | first1 = Richard\n| last2     = Hofsommer | first2 = Don L\n| title     = [[Rails to the North Star]]\n| place     = Minneapolis\n| publisher = [[University of Minnesota Press]]\n| pages     = 95\u2013106\n| year      = 2007\n| isbn      = 978-0-8166-5267-9 }}\n</ref> Rail extended a distance of about {{convert|50|mi|km}} from [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]] on the bank of the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] in the east to Lake Minnetonka in the west. For a time, TCRT was the largest employer in the area.\n\nIt is rumored that anyone who lived in Minneapolis was no farther than {{convert|400|yd|m}} (less than {{convert|1/4|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or}}) from the nearest station at that time.\n\n==Changing labor conditions==\n[[File:Snowplow streetcar Minneapolis 1939.jpg|thumb|right|Snowplow streetcar, 1939.]]\nIn 1917, a major labor [[strike action|strike]] took place in the months after the United States entered World War I. It began on October 6, and was influenced by the organization [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW, also known as the \"Wobblies\"), a militant group that had been organizing [[labor union|unions]] in the region, particularly in the northern [[Mesabi Iron Range]]. Horace Lowry, son of Thomas Lowry, headed the company at this time and absolutely refused to negotiate with the striking workers. This angered workers and others who felt sympathy for them.\n\nAngry strikers in St. Paul damaged streetcars and harassed those who had continued to work. The Minnesota Commission of Public Safety ordered the workers back on the job and they complied for a while. People again left work in late-November. On December 2, a crowd energized by speakers from the [[Nonpartisan League]] again grew angry after TCRT cut off electricity to the streetcars in downtown St. Paul, making it impossible for many people to return home. Over the following days, many were arrested and the strike was effectively broken. 800 people were eventually replaced by non-union workers.\n\nThings turned out differently in the 1930s, although it was not a smooth transition. In 1932, most of the system's streetcars were converted to \"one-man operation\" where, rather than requiring both a motorman to drive in front and a conductor to take fares in the rear, the motorman took over both operations. The doors on the streetcars were modified to allow easier boarding in front. So-called \"gate cars\" which had used open grating on the rear of the cars mostly disappeared from the lines. The transition from two-man to one-man operation was taking place on many streetcar lines across the country around this time.\n\nThe conversion to single-man operation meant that about half of the company's workforce was suddenly surplus. Many employees found it hard to get work and were often forced to take strange shifts. One worker recorded having a 17-hour shift from 4:24&nbsp;p.m. on Sunday to 9:49&nbsp;a.m. on Monday. There was a company union, although it hadn't done much good. By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor [[Floyd B. Olson]], St. Paul Mayor [[William Mahoney (mayor)|William Mahoney]] and the [[National Recovery Administration]], among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the [[Amalgamated Transit Union]].\n\n==Competition from automobiles==\nWith the [[Great Depression]] and the rise of the [[automobile]], the rail lines began to decline. Buses were frequently used toward the edges of the system as long routes, especially those with low ridership, were cut back. [[World War II]] allowed the system to bounce back for a time, since strict fuel [[rationing]] and citizens' efforts to conserve resources made automobile use rather un-patriotic. However, the restrictions also hit TCRT itself since they could not afford to build many new streetcars. The company was forced to add more buses to shore up the system's various routes.\n\nAfter the war, trolley riders returned to their automobiles. TCRT's management explored ways to upgrade the line to bring people back. Heavy wartime use meant that the rails needed to be repaired. Competition from other forms of transportation required modernization. In 1945, the company received its first streamlined [[PCC streetcar]]. The following years saw dozens of new PCC cars on the streets, although the first one remained unique in the fleet because it was the only one to have [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s. All of the PCCs were several inches wider than standard, to match the {{convert|9|ft|m|2|adj=on|spell=in}} width of the company's older streetcars.\n\n==Company takeover and decline==\n[[File:1954 Twin City Rapid Transit bus 1303 on display 2011.jpg|thumb|A 1954-built Twin City Lines bus, now preserved, in 2011]]\nThe company had a long-standing policy of reinvestment in the rail system. When profits appeared, they were usually used to pay off loans and improve the rails, streetcars and other hardware the company owned. It was rare for the company to pay out [[dividend]]s. In 1948, [[Wall Street]] [[speculation|speculator]] Charles Green bought 6000 shares of TCRT stock. He expected to quickly gain profit, but found he had purchased stock just as the company decided to set forth on some major construction. Knowing this would demolish his anticipated dividends, Green contacted other shareholders and urged them to vote out the company's president, D. J. Strouse and put him in charge instead.\n\nGreen took control of the company in 1949 and quickly started dismantling the railway system, announcing that the company would completely switch to buses by 1958. The system's PCCs were sold to Mexico City (91), Newark NJ (30) and Shaker Heights OH (20). Green sold his shares in 1950 to be briefly replaced by Emil B. Anderson before local lawyer [[Fred Ossanna]] ascended to head the company the next year. Ossanna held off on the teardown for a short while, but soon announced that the process would be accelerated. Lines would be removed and replaced by buses in two years.\n\n==End of the streetcar system==\n\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{POV-section|date=October 2014}}\n{{weasel|section|date=October 2014}}\n{{disputed section|date=October 2014}}\n}}\n[[File:En-Thomas Lowry.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup view of the Thomas Lowry Memorial statue in Smith Triangle Park at the intersection of Hennepin Avenue, Emerson Avenue, and 24th Street in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. The inscription reads: \"The lesson of a public-spirited life is as a tree ever bearing new fruit.\" Lowry died in 1909.]]\nOn June 19, 1954, four years before Green had envisioned, the very last streetcars ran in Minneapolis. The leftover vehicles were unceremoniously burned to recover the scrap metal they contained. The last streetcar was very famously photographed alight behind Fred Ossanna and James Towley as Towley presented Ossanna with a [[cheque|check]]<ref>https://digitalcollections.hclib.org/digital/collection/MplsPhotos/id/14097/</ref>.\n\nOthers{{who|date=April 2019}} point out that these allegations fail to account for the issues facing TCRT. Automobiles were more flexible than trains, didn't require the rider to abide by a schedule and afforded some privacy. A population growing more wealthy could afford such luxuries. Highway development enabled settlement over a wider area. Minneapolis' population peak in the late 1940s and St. Paul's a decade later in the late 1950s. Population growth and job growth was spread out in less dense suburbs where capital requirements for building new rail were too high compared to the potential ridership. Building rails to service these areas was cost prohibitive. Buses though could be profitable on such routes. More so other streetcar lines without connection to NCL also converted to buses, frequently having done so long before the TCRT began the process.\n\nFred Ossanna came to work at TCRT as a lawyer for Charles Green in the 1949 takeover of the company. Reportedly{{by whom|date=October 2014}}, Ossanna planned to order 25 buses from General Motors and was instead offered 525. The vast majority of buses in TCRT's eventual bus fleet were built by GM.\n\nMost of the activity was geared toward stripping TCRT of its [[asset]]s to fill the pockets of owners and investors. Ossanna was convicted in 1960 of illegally taking personal profit from the company during the transition period. He was [[prison|imprisoned]] along with other accomplices. [[Carl Pohlad]], who became the owner of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1984, was the eventual successor of Fred Ossanna as head of Twin City Lines in the 1960s. He ultimately sold the company in 1970.\n\n==Streetcar preservation==\nBefore the dismantling began, TCRT had purchased a significant number of [[PCC streetcar]]s. These were sold off in 1952 and 1953, still in very good operating condition. The cars ended up in [[Mexico City]] (91 cars), [[Newark, New Jersey]] (30) and [[Shaker Heights, Ohio]] (20). Relatively few places could have taken them because of their extra width and each of these buyers had significant amounts of dedicated [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]]. For instance, the [[Shaker Heights Rapid Transit]] commuter line in [[Cleveland]] was grade-separated in many areas. The vast majority of the older wooden streetcars, mostly built by TCRT itself, were destroyed. Out of 1240 built by the company, only five have survived to be restored and operated by rail museums.\n\nOnly two of the wooden streetcars in use in the 1950s had been given away to [[railfan]] groups before the rest of the fleet was burned. They are owned by the [[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]] (TCRT No. 1300) and the [[Seashore Trolley Museum]] (TCRT No. 1267) in [[Maine]]. One other steel-sheathed car (TCRT No. 1583) had been sent to a railway to the north in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]-[[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], but it was never used. It now resides at the [[East Troy Electric Railroad Museum]] in [[Wisconsin]]. A few additional cars escaped the burn pits, but they were still subjected to harsh conditions and only two are restored.\n\n[[File:TCRT PCC streetcar.jpg|thumb|right|TCRT PCC Streetcar Number 322 is now owned by the [[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]] and is pictured here riding near [[Lake Harriet (Hennepin County, Minnesota)|Lake Harriet]] on the museum's route.]]\nOne of the streetcar boats, the ''Minnehaha'', was found by divers and then brought to the surface in 1980. After a long wait, it was restored and has been operating on Lake Minnetonka from 1996 to 2004 by the [[Minnesota Transportation Museum]] and since then by the [[Museum of Lake Minnetonka]]. MTM also restored one of TCRT's old PCC cars (TCRT No. 322), operated now by the [[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]].\n\nSome{{which|date=March 2012}} of the PCC cars once owned by Twin City Rapid Transit are just beginning their lives as museum pieces. The [[Newark City Subway]] finished operation of their 24 remaining cars on August 24, 2001, replacing the cars with new light-rail trainsets. Fifteen have been sold to the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] (Muni), for their collection of classic streetcars on the [[Market Street Railway (nonprofit)|Market Street Railway]]. In addition, 12 PCCs that ran on the Shaker Heights line are now owned by the [[Brooklyn Historic Railway Association]]. Many of these cars owe their longevity to the fact that the Twin Cities area makes heavy use of salt to de-ice roadways in the winter. In anticipation of this, the cars were largely made of [[stainless steel]] to prevent [[corrosion]].\n\n==Historical remnants==\nOther vestiges of the company's streetcar history remained in the Twin Cities, and some surviving elements are now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. One of the oldest structures to survive is a building in Minneapolis now known as the [[Colonial Warehouse]]. First built in 1885, it housed the headquarters of the Minneapolis Street Railway Co. during the early horsecar era and also later served as a powerhouse as the system was converted. The lines needed a lot of electricity, so [[hydroelectric]] generators were installed at [[Saint Anthony Falls]] about a mile away and the [[Southeast Steam Plant]] was also constructed nearby. The old headquarters was sold in 1908, soon after these were constructed. The steam plant was bought by the [[University of Minnesota]], which now uses it for providing heat to the campus downriver.\n\nA large building on Snelling Avenue in St. Paul first served as the main construction and repair shop for the streetcars when it was built in 1907. It was expanded and remodeled over the years, later becoming a major garage for the bus system. However, the complex became outdated, with poor ventilation, a leaky roof and other problems. It was finally shut down and demolished in September 2001.\n\n[[Selby Hill]] in St. Paul was a steep climb and was a place where cable cars were used in the late 19th century before Selby Hill Tunnel was constructed in 1905 to provide a more gradual incline. The tunnel still exists, but the ends have been blocked off. It is near the [[Cathedral of Saint Paul (Minnesota)|Cathedral of St. Paul]].\n\n[[Billboard (advertising)|Billboards]] across the area were originally laid out to target passengers of the rail lines with advertising. Many of these billboards remained for decades afterward, despite the fact that automobile traffic frequently favored different routes. These finally disappeared due to city beautification efforts in the 1990s.\n\n==Legacy to 21st century rail==\nIn the 1970s, the bus lines (some of which still trace former horse-drawn buggy paths) were shifted to a partially publicly funded operation overseen by the [[Metropolitan Council]]. All regional transportation for the metropolitan area was soon overseen by the Met Council's transit agency which would take on the name [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]]. Twenty years after rails disappeared from Twin Cities streets, politicians and planners began proposing new [[light rail]] systems. Congestion was bad enough in 1972 that there were proposals to build new [[rapid transit|subway]]s or [[people mover]]s, but excessively high costs prevented any of the projects from getting anywhere until the end of the century. The University of Minnesota did a fair amount of research on [[personal rapid transit]] (PRT) systems and has held a number of patents on the idea.\n\nRail transport returned to the Twin Cities with the construction of the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]], which began operations in 2004. A proposal for a [[heritage streetcar]] line running east-west through the city, possibly including PCC cars once owned by TCRT, has been examined. A [[Northstar Line|Northstar]] [[commuter rail]] line, tracing [[U.S. Route 10 in Minnesota|U.S. Highway 10]] northwest out of Minneapolis, opened in 2009. [[Green Line (Minnesota)|A connection between both of the twin cities]], called the Green Line, opened on June 14, 2014. [[Southwest Corridor (Minneapolis)|Light rail west from Minneapolis to the southwest suburbs]] is being constructed as of 2020. Other proposals have included adding both a commuter connection to [[Rush Line Corridor|the complete North]] and [[Red Rock Corridor|Southeast]] of downtown Saint Paul. A light rail alignment to [[Pilot Knob Central Corridor|the Southwest]] of downtown Saint Paul has been previously discussed, but dismissed due to the expectation of low ridership.\n\n==See also==\n*[[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]]\n*[[Light rail in Minnesota]]\n*[[Minnesota Streetcar Museum]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040311061629/http://www.rakemag.com/features/detail.asp?catID=46&itemID=1326&pg=1 Get Rail!].
