Today, the Lower Mainland includes two [[List of British Columbia Regional Districts|regional districts]]: the [[Metro Vancouver Regional District]] (MVRD) and the [[Fraser Valley Regional District, British Columbia|Fraser Valley Regional District]] (FVRD). Both regional districts, however, include areas outside the traditional limits of the Lower Mainland. Metro Vancouver includes areas like Surrey and Langley that are geographically in the [[Fraser Valley]].\n\nThe Metro Vancouver Regional District is made up of 21 municipalities. The MVRD is bordered on the west by the Strait of Georgia, to the north by the [[Squamish-Lillooet Regional District]], on the east by the Fraser Valley Regional District, and to the south by [[Whatcom County, Washington]], in the [[United States]].\n\nThe Fraser Valley Regional District lies east of the Greater Vancouver Regional District, and comprises the cities of [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] and [[Chilliwack]], the [[District municipality|district municipalities]] of [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]], [[Agassiz, British Columbia|Kent]], and [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and the village of [[Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia|Harrison Hot Springs]]. It also includes many unincorporated areas in the Fraser Valley and along the west side of the [[Fraser Canyon]] (the Fraser Canyon is not in the Lower Mainland).\n\nRegional district powers are very limited and other localized provincial government services are delivered through other regionalization systems.\n\n==Indigenous territories==\nThe traditional territories of the [[Musqueam]] and [[Tsleil-Waututh First Nation|Tsleil'waututh]] lie completely within the region; the southern portion of [[Squamish people|Squamish]] traditional territory is also in the region. Its claims overlap those of the Tsleil-waututh, Musqueam, and Kwikwetlem. Other peoples whose territories lie within the region are the [[Sto:lo]], [[Sts'Ailes|Chehalis]], [[Katzie First Nation|Katzie]], [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen]], [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]], and [[Semiahmoo First Nation|Semiahmoo]]; many of their territories overlap with those of the Musqueam, and with each other.

There have been two major floods, the largest in 1894 and the second largest in 1948.

Higher than normal snow packs in the [[British Columbia Interior]] prompted municipal governments to start taking emergency measures in the region. [[Dike (construction)|Dikes]] along the [[Fraser River]] are regulated to handle about 8.5 m at the Mission Gauge (the height above sea level of the dykes at Mission). Warmer than normal weather in the interior caused large amounts of snow to melt prematurely, resulting in higher than normal water levels, which, nevertheless, remained well below flood levels.<ref>\n{{cite news\n |title       = Fraser Valley prepares for possible flooding\n |publisher   = CBC News\n |date        = 5 June 2007\n |url         = https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/fraser-valley-prepares-for-possible-flooding-1.648037\n |accessdate  = 2007-06-24\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709215645/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/fraser-valley-prepares-for-possible-flooding-1.648037\n |archivedate = 9 July 2007\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>Nguyen, Linda (7 June 2007).

Today, the Lower Mainland includes two [[List of British Columbia Regional Districts|regional districts]]: the [[Metro Vancouver Regional District]] (MVRD) and the [[Fraser Valley Regional District, British Columbia|Fraser Valley Regional District]] (FVRD). Both regional districts, however, include areas outside the traditional limits of the Lower Mainland. Metro Vancouver includes areas like Surrey and Langley that are geographically in the [[Fraser Valley]].\n\nThe Metro Vancouver Regional District is made up of 21 municipalities. The MVRD is bordered on the west by the Strait of Georgia, to the north by the [[Squamish-Lillooet Regional District]], on the east by the Fraser Valley Regional District, and to the south by [[Whatcom County, Washington]], in the [[United States]].\n\nThe Fraser Valley Regional District lies east of the Greater Vancouver Regional District, and comprises the cities of [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] and [[Chilliwack]], the [[District municipality|district municipalities]] of [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]], [[Agassiz, British Columbia|Kent]], and [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and the village of [[Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia|Harrison Hot Springs]]. It also includes many unincorporated areas in the Fraser Valley and along the west side of the [[Fraser Canyon]] (the Fraser Canyon is not in the Lower Mainland).\n\nRegional district powers are very limited and other localized provincial government services are delivered through other regionalization systems.\n\n==Indigenous territories==\nThe traditional territories of the [[Musqueam]] and [[Tsleil-Waututh First Nation|Tsleil'waututh]] lie completely within the region; the southern portion of [[Squamish people|Squamish]] traditional territory is also in the region. Its claims overlap those of the Tsleil-waututh, Musqueam, and Kwikwetlem. Other peoples whose territories lie within the region are the [[Sto:lo]], [[Sts'Ailes|Chehalis]], [[Katzie First Nation|Katzie]], [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen]], [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]], and [[Semiahmoo First Nation|Semiahmoo]]; many of their territories overlap with those of the Musqueam, and with each other. Many other peoples of the [[Georgia Strait]] region also frequented the lower Fraser, including those from Vancouver Island and what is now [[Whatcom County, Washington]].\n\nSto:lo traditional territory, known as ''Solh Temexw'' in [[Halkomelem]], more or less coincides with the traditional conception of the Lower Mainland, except for the inclusion of [[Port Douglas, British Columbia|Port Douglas]] at the head of Harrison Lake, which is in [[In-SHUCK-ch]] territory, and the lands around Burrard Inlet.\n\n==Health regions==\nHealth system services and governance in the Lower Mainland are provided by [[Vancouver Coastal Health]], serving Vancouver, Richmond and the North Shore, and the mainland coast as far north as the [[Coast of British Columbia|Central Coast]] region, and [[Fraser Health]], which serves the area of the Lower Mainland east of Vancouver and Richmond.<ref>BC Ministry of Health.

[[Dike (construction)|Dikes]] along the [[Fraser River]] are regulated to handle about 8.5 m at the Mission Gauge (the height above sea level of the dykes at Mission).

Impressed with his performance, Madhava Rao was transferred to the Revenue Department in which he rose step by step to become Diwan in 1857.\n\nMadhava Rao served as Diwan of Travancore from 1857 to 1872 bringing about developments in education, legislation, [[public works]], medicine, [[vaccination]] and [[public health]] and agriculture. He was also responsible for clearing Travancore's public debts. Madhava Rao quit as Diwan of Travancore and returned to Madras in 1872. He served as Diwan of Indore from 1873 to 1875 and as Diwan of Baroda from 1875 to 1882. In his later life, Madhava Rao actively participated in politics and was one of the early pioneers of the [[Indian National Congress]]. Madhava Rao died in 1891 in [[Mylapore]], Madras at the age of 63.\n\nMadhava Rao was respected and regarded for his administrative abilities. British Liberal statesman [[Henry Fawcett]] called him \"the [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] of India\". In 1866, he was made a [[Order of the Star of India|Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nMadhava Rao was born on 20 November 1828 in a prominent [[Thanjavur Marathi (people)|Thanjavur Marathi]] [[Deshastha Brahmin]] family.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&id=WxPmlV2KMu4C&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=brahmin   A National Biography for India, Volume 1 By Jyotis Chandra Das Gupta , Page 64]</ref> His great-grandfather Gopal Pant and his grandfather, Gundo Pant, held offices of trust and power under the British as also various Indian princes.  His paternal uncle Rai Raya Rai Venkatta Rao was a former [[Dewan]] of [[Travancore]] and later even his father Ranga Rao became the Premier of Travancore, although only for a short while. Madhava Rao had two older brothers.\n\nMadhava Rao spent his early life in Madras city where he studied at the Government High School (later [[Presidency College, Madras]]). As a student, Madhava Rao was a diligent and careful and strong in mathematics and science.  In 1846, he received his Proficient's Degree with high honours. Soon afterwards, Powell appointed him tutor of Mathematics and Physics at the High School. However, Madhava Rao quit in a short while to take up a job in the office of the Accountant General. In 1848, he was appointed tutor to the princes of Travancore at the recommendation of the English Resident which he accepted. Madhava worked for four years as tutor to the Travancore princes. Impressed with his performance, he was offered a position in the Revenue Department of Travancore. In a short time, Madhava Rao rose to be Diwan Peishkar of the [[Southern Division (Travancore)|Southern division]].\n\nDuring this time, Travancore was facing a severe financial crisis and the treasury was empty. A large amount of subsidy due to the Madras government remained unpaid. Not long after promulgating his infamous [[Doctrine of Lapse]], [[Lord Dalhousie]] was looking forward to annexe Travancore too under this pretext. At this juncture, the Raja of Travancore [[Uthram Thirunal]] chose Madhava Rao to negotiate a deal with the British government which he did successfully. As a result, Madhava Rao was appointed next Diwan of Travancore.\n\n==Dewan of Travancore==\n[[File:Ayilyam Thirunal and Madhava Rao.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Madhava Rao with ''(from left)'' the [[heir-apparent]] [[Visakham Thirunal]] and the [[Maharaja]] of Travancore, [[Ayilyam Thirunal of Travancore|Ayilyam Thirunal]]]]\n\nAt that time the entire administration of the state was in a disorganised state, public treasuries were empty and large arrears of payments in way of salaries and otherwise were pending. The Maharajah had already taken a loan from the [[Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] of [[Trivandrum]] and adding the subsidy to be paid to the British Government, the state of affairs was bad enough to deter anyone from taking up the post of Dewan. Soon after Madhava Rao's appointment the Shanar agitations took place in Travancore which added to the problems of the state.\n\nIn 1860 however, the orthodox Maharajah died and Madhava Rao's own pupil, the late Maharajah's nephew, [[Ayilyam Thirunal]] succeeded. Under the new and relatively less orthodox Maharajah Madhava Rao's administration started its progress. Monopolies, numerous petty taxes and cessations were abolished and land tax was reduced. By 1863 the debts of the Travancore Government were cleared and the Dewan proudly declared that \"Travancore has no public debt now\". Salaries of public servants were raised by more than 50 percent and its morale and efficiency was improved. Madhava Rao's progressive financial measures were testified by the fact that when he assumed the office of Dewan he had an indebted and empty treasury whereas when he left the state in 1872 the state had a reserve fund of forty lakhs of rupees, a great amount in those days.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJBAQAAMAAJ&dq=raja+sir+tanjore+madhava+rao+caste&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=sir+t.+madhava+rao+   Indian Magazine and Review, Issues 241-252 By National Indian Association in Aid of Social Progress and Education in India., 1891 - Education , Page 310]</ref>\nWhile Madhava Rao is described essentially as a financier, he also brought a great deal of development in Education, legislation, public works, medicine, vaccination and public health, agriculture etc. Year after year his work was commended by the Madras Government. He also drew up State papers on special subjects such as Boundary disputes, trade reports and so on and started maintaining records of every department. In recognition of his services, by public subscription, a bronze statue of Madhava Rao was erected in Travancore.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=b1HPMi9ml4MC   Educational Development in South India By K. G. Vijayalekshmy,Mittal Publications, 1993,Page-6]</ref>\n\nHowever, due to misunderstandings which arose between the Dewan and the Maharajah, Madhava Rao retired in February 1872.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJBAQAAMAAJ  Indian Magazine and Review, Issues 241-252 By National Indian Association in Aid of Social Progress and Education in India., 1891 - Education , Page 310]</ref> The Maharajah, however, respected his work and granted him a pension of Rs. 1000, a princely amount in those days. His initial plan was to retire to [[Madras]] but instead there was great demand for his services among the Princes of India, because of his having secured for [[Travancore]] the appellation of \"Model State of India\" by the British Government. [[Henry Fawcett]] described, on hearing of his retirement in 1872, Madhava Rao as:\n\n{{cquote|Sir Madhava Rao administered Travancore with so much skill as justly to entitle him to be considered the Turgot of India.. He found Travancore when he went there in 1858 in the lowest state of degradation. He has left it a Model State.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/speechesonsomec00fawcgoog   Speeches on Some Current Political Questions By Henry Fawcett , Macmillan Publishers,1893,Page-102]</ref> }}\nMadhava Rao was instrumental in recognising and employing [[Chattampi Swamikal]] at the Trivandrum secretariat.<ref>Raman Nair, R and Sulochana Devi, L (2010).

Chattampi Swami Archive, Centre for South Indian Studies, Trivandrum</ref>\n\n==Indore and Baroda==\n[[File:Group portrait of Madhava Rao and ministers of Baroda 1880.jpg|thumb|Group portrait of Madhava Rao and ministers of Baroda (circa 1880)]]\n[[File:Tanjore Madhava Rao 1880.jpg|thumb|Tanjore Madhava Rao (C.1880)]]\nIn 1872, at the request of [[Tukojirao Holkar II]] of [[Indore]], the Government of India persuaded Madhava Rao out of his retirement to take charge as the Diwan of Indore. Madhava Rao served as Diwan from 1873 to 1875, during which he commenced the drafting of the [[Indian Penal Code]] and wrote minutes on the opium question and the extension of railways in Indore. Shortly afterwards, the Government of India requested Madhava Rao to take over as Diwan-Regent of Baroda whose ruler [[Malhar Rao Gaekwad]] had been deposed for mal-administration.\n\nMadhava Rao reformed the revenue administration of Baroda and curbed the power of revenue officials called ''Sirdars''. The land rights of the ''Sirdars'' were cancelled and their lands were annexed by the state. During his tenure as Diwan-Regent, Madhava Rao also effectively re-organized the army, schools, courts of law and libraries. He also introduced a lot of town-planning measures.\n\nMadhava Rao resigned in September 1882 due to disagreements with the new Maharaja [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III]]. He retired to his home in Mylapore on pension.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GOBJ96iWAeUC&pg=PA163 Nationalism and Social Reform in &#91;sic&#93; Colonial Situation By Aravind Ganachari, pages 163-170]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZY4AAwAAQBAJ Princely India and the British: Political Development and the Operation of Empire By Caroline Keen, page 242]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kz1-mtazYqEC The Indian Princes and their States By Barbara N.Ramusack, Cambridge University Press page 185]</ref>\n\n==Indian National Congress==\n\nMadhava Rao involved himself in politics in the later years of his life. He joined the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1887, two years after its formation. He served as the President of the Reception Committee during the 1887 Madras session. In 1888, he was offered a seat in the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] by the then [[Viceroy of India]] [[Lord Dufferin]] but Madhava Rao declined the offer on ground of health.\n\nWhile delivering the inaugural address during the 1887 session, Madhava Rao described the Indian National Congress as\n\n{{quotation|..the soundest triumph of British administration and a crown of glory to the great British nation.}}\n\nHowever, at the same time, he warned that\n\n{{quotation|The great experience of Europe has shown that representative government contains mucnh good and much evil. In introducing it into India, therefore, responsible British statesmen have to exercise great care and caution, that the good is produced and evil is excluded. In these circumstances it might be wrong to introduce that system into India at once, mereley because the Congress asks for it. It is absolutely necessary to take measures gradually, and tentatively}}\n\nMadhava Rao resigned from the Standing Committee in 1889 due to differences with other members over the resolution passed on reformed legislative councils.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xozJ7y89bScC   The Indian Nation Builders, Volume 2 By Mittal Publications,Pages 347-352]</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nIn his later years, Madhava Rao strove to reform the educational system. Even while serving as Diwan of Baroda, Rao was made a fellow of the [[Madras University]]. He campaigned in support of women's education and attacked child marriage. He also criticised the literal interpretation of Hindu ''shastras''. However, Madhava Rao was, till the end, a pacifist and was moderate and unreactionary in his views on social reforms.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2IPDQAAQBAJ   Pathways to Nationalism: Social Transformation and Nationalist Consciousness in Colonial Tamil Nadu, 1858\u20131918 By S.

E. Grant Duff|Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant-Duff]], Madhava Rao presided over the Malabar Land Tenure Commission. In 1887, he presided over the convocation of the Madras University. In December 1887, Madhava Rao presided over the inaugural session of Indian National Social Conference.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=d0gFAAAAMAAJ   The growth of public opinion in the Madras Presidency, 1858-1909 By D. Sadasivan,University of Madras, page 37]</ref>\n\nMadhava Rao took a liking for British sociologist and political theorist [[Herbert Spencer]] and spent the last days of his life studying his works. He contributed articles to newspapers on a variety of topics ranging from politics and religion to astronomy. Under the pseudonyms \"Native Thinker\" and \"Native Observer\", Madhava Rao wrote opinion pieces on the German occupation of Africa and on the dress code to adopted by Hindu women in public. He forwarded his article on the German occupation of Africa to the German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] who replied with a letter of acknowledgement and appreciation. In 1889, he published a pamphlet titled \"Hints on the training of native children by a native Thinker\" which was translated into various Indian languages as Gujarati, Marathi and Malayalam. He also composed a few small poems in Tamil.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hQY3AAAAMAAJ   A history of Indian English literature By M. K.

Madhava Rao died three months later, on 4 April 1891 at the age of sixty-three.\n\n==Family==\nT. Madhava Rao married Yamuna Bai. The couple had five children, three son's, [[T.

Impressed with his performance, Madhava Rao was transferred to the Revenue Department in which he rose step by step to become Diwan in 1857.\n\nMadhava Rao served as Diwan of Travancore from 1857 to 1872 bringing about developments in education, legislation, [[public works]], medicine, [[vaccination]] and [[public health]] and agriculture. He was also responsible for clearing Travancore's public debts. Madhava Rao quit as Diwan of Travancore and returned to Madras in 1872. He served as Diwan of Indore from 1873 to 1875 and as Diwan of Baroda from 1875 to 1882. In his later life, Madhava Rao actively participated in politics and was one of the early pioneers of the [[Indian National Congress]]. Madhava Rao died in 1891 in [[Mylapore]], Madras at the age of 63.\n\nMadhava Rao was respected and regarded for his administrative abilities. British Liberal statesman [[Henry Fawcett]] called him \"the [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] of India\". In 1866, he was made a [[Order of the Star of India|Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nMadhava Rao was born on 20 November 1828 in a prominent [[Thanjavur Marathi]] [[Deshastha Brahmin]] family.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&id=WxPmlV2KMu4C&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=brahmin   A National Biography for India, Volume 1 By Jyotis Chandra Das Gupta , Page 64]</ref> His great-grandfather Gopal Pant and his grandfather, Gundo Pant, held offices of trust and power under the British as also various Indian princes.  His paternal uncle Rai Raya Rai Venkatta Rao was a former [[Dewan]] of [[Travancore]] and later even his father Ranga Rao became the Premier of Travancore, although only for a short while. Madhava Rao had two older brothers.\n\nMadhava Rao spent his early life in Madras city where he studied at the Government High School (later [[Presidency College, Madras]]). As a student, Madhava Rao was a diligent and careful and strong in mathematics and science.  In 1846, he received his Proficient's Degree with high honours. Soon afterwards, Powell appointed him tutor of Mathematics and Physics at the High School. However, Madhava Rao quit in a short while to take up a job in the office of the Accountant General. In 1848, he was appointed tutor to the princes of Travancore at the recommendation of the English Resident which he accepted. Madhava worked for four years as tutor to the Travancore princes. Impressed with his performance, he was offered a position in the Revenue Department of Travancore. In a short time, Madhava Rao rose to be Diwan Peishkar of the [[Southern Division (Travancore)|Southern division]].\n\nDuring this time, Travancore was facing a severe financial crisis and the treasury was empty. A large amount of subsidy due to the Madras government remained unpaid. Not long after promulgating his infamous [[Doctrine of Lapse]], [[Lord Dalhousie]] was looking forward to annexe Travancore too under this pretext. At this juncture, the Raja of Travancore [[Uthram Thirunal]] chose Madhava Rao to negotiate a deal with the British government which he did successfully. As a result, Madhava Rao was appointed next Diwan of Travancore.\n\n==Dewan of Travancore==\n[[File:Ayilyam Thirunal and Madhava Rao.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Madhava Rao with ''(from left)'' the [[heir-apparent]] [[Visakham Thirunal]] and the [[Maharaja]] of Travancore, [[Ayilyam Thirunal of Travancore|Ayilyam Thirunal]]]]\n\nAt that time the entire administration of the state was in a disorganised state, public treasuries were empty and large arrears of payments in way of salaries and otherwise were pending. The Maharajah had already taken a loan from the [[Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] of [[Trivandrum]] and adding the subsidy to be paid to the British Government, the state of affairs was bad enough to deter anyone from taking up the post of Dewan. Soon after Madhava Rao's appointment the Shanar agitations took place in Travancore which added to the problems of the state.\n\nIn 1860 however, the orthodox Maharajah died and Madhava Rao's own pupil, the late Maharajah's nephew, [[Ayilyam Thirunal]] succeeded. Under the new and relatively less orthodox Maharajah Madhava Rao's administration started its progress. Monopolies, numerous petty taxes and cessations were abolished and land tax was reduced. By 1863 the debts of the Travancore Government were cleared and the Dewan proudly declared that \"Travancore has no public debt now\". Salaries of public servants were raised by more than 50 percent and its morale and efficiency was improved. Madhava Rao's progressive financial measures were testified by the fact that when he assumed the office of Dewan he had an indebted and empty treasury whereas when he left the state in 1872 the state had a reserve fund of forty lakhs of rupees, a great amount in those days.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJBAQAAMAAJ&dq=raja+sir+tanjore+madhava+rao+caste&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=sir+t.+madhava+rao+   Indian Magazine and Review, Issues 241-252 By National Indian Association in Aid of Social Progress and Education in India., 1891 - Education , Page 310]</ref>\nWhile Madhava Rao is described essentially as a financier, he also brought a great deal of development in Education, legislation, public works, medicine, vaccination and public health, agriculture etc. Year after year his work was commended by the Madras Government. He also drew up State papers on special subjects such as Boundary disputes, trade reports and so on and started maintaining records of every department. In recognition of his services, by public subscription, a bronze statue of Madhava Rao was erected in Travancore.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=b1HPMi9ml4MC   Educational Development in South India By K. G. Vijayalekshmy,Mittal Publications, 1993,Page-6]</ref>\n\nHowever, due to misunderstandings which arose between the Dewan and the Maharajah, Madhava Rao retired in February 1872.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dEJBAQAAMAAJ  Indian Magazine and Review, Issues 241-252 By National Indian Association in Aid of Social Progress and Education in India., 1891 - Education , Page 310]</ref> The Maharajah, however, respected his work and granted him a pension of Rs. 1000, a princely amount in those days. His initial plan was to retire to [[Madras]] but instead there was great demand for his services among the Princes of India, because of his having secured for [[Travancore]] the appellation of \"Model State of India\" by the British Government. [[Henry Fawcett]] described, on hearing of his retirement in 1872, Madhava Rao as:\n\n{{cquote|Sir Madhava Rao administered Travancore with so much skill as justly to entitle him to be considered the Turgot of India.. He found Travancore when he went there in 1858 in the lowest state of degradation. He has left it a Model State.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/speechesonsomec00fawcgoog   Speeches on Some Current Political Questions By Henry Fawcett , Macmillan Publishers,1893,Page-102]</ref> }}\nMadhava Rao was instrumental in recognising and employing [[Chattampi Swamikal]] at the Trivandrum secretariat.<ref>Raman Nair, R and Sulochana Devi, L (2010).

Chattampi Swami Archive, Centre for South Indian Studies, Trivandrum</ref>\n\n==Indore and Baroda==\n[[File:Group portrait of Madhava Rao and ministers of Baroda 1880.jpg|thumb|Group portrait of Madhava Rao and ministers of Baroda (circa 1880)]]\n[[File:Tanjore Madhava Rao 1880.jpg|thumb|Tanjore Madhava Rao (C.1880)]]\nIn 1872, at the request of [[Tukojirao Holkar II]] of [[Indore]], the Government of India persuaded Madhava Rao out of his retirement to take charge as the Diwan of Indore. Madhava Rao served as Diwan from 1873 to 1875, during which he commenced the drafting of the [[Indian Penal Code]] and wrote minutes on the opium question and the extension of railways in Indore. Shortly afterwards, the Government of India requested Madhava Rao to take over as Diwan-Regent of Baroda whose ruler [[Malhar Rao Gaekwad]] had been deposed for mal-administration.\n\nMadhava Rao reformed the revenue administration of Baroda and curbed the power of revenue officials called ''Sirdars''. The land rights of the ''Sirdars'' were cancelled and their lands were annexed by the state. During his tenure as Diwan-Regent, Madhava Rao also effectively re-organized the army, schools, courts of law and libraries. He also introduced a lot of town-planning measures.\n\nMadhava Rao resigned in September 1882 due to disagreements with the new Maharaja [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III]]. He retired to his home in Mylapore on pension.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GOBJ96iWAeUC&pg=PA163 Nationalism and Social Reform in &#91;sic&#93; Colonial Situation By Aravind Ganachari, pages 163-170]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZY4AAwAAQBAJ Princely India and the British: Political Development and the Operation of Empire By Caroline Keen, page 242]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kz1-mtazYqEC The Indian Princes and their States By Barbara N.Ramusack, Cambridge University Press page 185]</ref>\n\n==Indian National Congress==\n\nMadhava Rao involved himself in politics in the later years of his life. He joined the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1887, two years after its formation. He served as the President of the Reception Committee during the 1887 Madras session. In 1888, he was offered a seat in the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] by the then [[Viceroy of India]] [[Lord Dufferin]] but Madhava Rao declined the offer on ground of health.\n\nWhile delivering the inaugural address during the 1887 session, Madhava Rao described the Indian National Congress as\n\n{{quotation|..the soundest triumph of British administration and a crown of glory to the great British nation.}}\n\nHowever, at the same time, he warned that\n\n{{quotation|The great experience of Europe has shown that representative government contains mucnh good and much evil. In introducing it into India, therefore, responsible British statesmen have to exercise great care and caution, that the good is produced and evil is excluded. In these circumstances it might be wrong to introduce that system into India at once, mereley because the Congress asks for it. It is absolutely necessary to take measures gradually, and tentatively}}\n\nMadhava Rao resigned from the Standing Committee in 1889 due to differences with other members over the resolution passed on reformed legislative councils.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xozJ7y89bScC   The Indian Nation Builders, Volume 2 By Mittal Publications,Pages 347-352]</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n\nIn his later years, Madhava Rao strove to reform the educational system. Even while serving as Diwan of Baroda, Rao was made a fellow of the [[Madras University]]. He campaigned in support of women's education and attacked child marriage. He also criticised the literal interpretation of Hindu ''shastras''. However, Madhava Rao was, till the end, a pacifist and was moderate and unreactionary in his views on social reforms.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2IPDQAAQBAJ   Pathways to Nationalism: Social Transformation and Nationalist Consciousness in Colonial Tamil Nadu, 1858\u20131918 By S.

E. Grant Duff|Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant-Duff]], Madhava Rao presided over the Malabar Land Tenure Commission. In 1887, he presided over the convocation of the Madras University. In December 1887, Madhava Rao presided over the inaugural session of Indian National Social Conference.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=d0gFAAAAMAAJ   The growth of public opinion in the Madras Presidency, 1858-1909 By D. Sadasivan,University of Madras, page 37]</ref>\n\nMadhava Rao took a liking for British sociologist and political theorist [[Herbert Spencer]] and spent the last days of his life studying his works. He contributed articles to newspapers on a variety of topics ranging from politics and religion to astronomy. Under the pseudonyms \"Native Thinker\" and \"Native Observer\", Madhava Rao wrote opinion pieces on the German occupation of Africa and on the dress code to adopted by Hindu women in public. He forwarded his article on the German occupation of Africa to the German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] who replied with a letter of acknowledgement and appreciation. In 1889, he published a pamphlet titled \"Hints on the training of native children by a native Thinker\" which was translated into various Indian languages as Gujarati, Marathi and Malayalam. He also composed a few small poems in Tamil.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hQY3AAAAMAAJ   A history of Indian English literature By M. K.

The VU's arrival was a full 36 months after the [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] sedan, meaning it arrived in time for the launch of Holden's [[Holden VX Commodore|VX Commodore]] series. The VU utilises the same [[wheelbase]] as the VT Commodore station wagon and [[Holden Caprice#WH|WH Statesman/Caprice]], meaning a wheelbase increase of {{convert|116|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The Ute employs the same interior as the Commodore, while also picking up the VX's upgraded equipment lists and re-styled exterior design.\n*'''Base ''': Built up from the Commodore Executive's specification.

Available with a 5.7-litre {{Convert|225|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nThe range received a minor refresh with the VX Series 2 models 12 months later, with the major upgrade being an additional {{Convert|5|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} to Holden's [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8's]].\n\nIn October 2001 The VU Ute came out in a special edition \"SS Fifty\" (pictured right) to mark the 50th anniversary.\nThis model has 500 units and will not become a collector's item; every SS 50 was identical in terms of color schemes, all 500 units were released with a black exterior and a partial leather interior that contained plenty of \"hyper yellow\" accents.\nOther items that made the SS 50 different were the chrome sports bar on the back, unique black-and-yellow engine cover, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, handbrake cover and gear knob as well as a color-coded instrument cluster to match the leather bolsters on the sports seats.\n\nThe VU's were superseded by the VY range in September 2002.\n\n=== VY ===\n{{Main|Holden VY Commodore}}\n\n[[File:2003-2004 Holden VY II Crewman utility 01.jpg|thumb|left|2003\u20132004 Holden VY II Crewman]]\n[[File:2003-2004 Holden VY II Ute S 01.jpg|thumb|right|2003\u20132004 Holden VY II Ute S]]\n[[File:2003-2005 Holden VY II Crewman Cross 8 utility 01.jpg|thumb|left|2003\u20132004 Holden VY II Crewman Cross 8]]\n[[File:2002-2003 Holden VY Ute S 01.jpg|thumb|right|2002\u20132003 Holden VY II Ute S]]\n\nThe Ute range received its first major facelift in the form of the 2002 '''VY''' range. VY Ute's received the same upgrades as the sedan/wagon range, which involved a new, sharper-designed nose, and more European-styled interior. The same three specification models were carried over for the VY, and picked up the same upgraded equipment lists as the VY sedans.\nThe VY range marked major change for Holden's Ute range, with the 2003 addition of two new models: the return of the '''One Tonner''' cab-chassis utility after a 18-year hiatus; and the introduction of Holden's first-ever 4-door utility, arriving in the form of the '''Crewman'''. The Crewman brought a longer wheelbase \u2013 {{convert|3206|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2939|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute; and a shorter tray \u2013 {{convert|1463|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2193|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute<ref>[http://www.holden.com.au/pdf/chooseavehicle/fullfeatures/LCVVZ_SpecFeat.pdf Holden Ute range features] Retrieved 20 October 2007 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In December 2003, Holden released an [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] variant of the Crewman known as the Crewman Cross 8. Powered by a {{Convert|225|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]], the Cross 8 featured a modified appearance, more suited to an off-road vehicle.\n\nBoth the Crewman and One Tonner models added instant sales to the Holden range, sparking rapid expansion of the Holden Ute range, its first major growth spurt since its 1990 re-introduction. Once again the same three specifications were carried over for the VY, with the Ute range available in base '''Ute''', '''S''' & '''SS''' forms. The same did not apply for the One-Tonner cab-chassis range though \u2013 it was available in just two model forms, base and S.\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification.

By December 2003 the Crewman range had expanded to include Holden's very first AWD utility in the form of the Crewman Cross 8. The Cross 8 received bolstered wheelarches, raised ride height as well as additional equipment, with the sole drivetrain being the recently upgraded Gen.3 V8 connected to a 4-speed automatic. V6-powered versions of the One Tonner & Crewman were only available with automatic transmission. The VY's were superseded by the arrival of the VZ range in August 2004\n\n=== VZ ===\n{{Main|Holden VZ Commodore}}\n\n[[File:2006-2007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS 01.jpg|thumb|2006\u20132007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS]]\n[[File:Holden VZ Crewman S.jpg|thumb|2004\u20132007 Holden VZ Crewman S.]]\n\nThe final series of Holden's VT-generation was the VZ range, launched in August 2004. Holden's main upgrade for the VZ's was the introduction of an all-new [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]], replacing Holden's previous [[Buick V6 engine|Ecotec V6's]] which had been in use since the 1995 launch of the VS Commodore. Whilst the sedan VZ range received both versions of the ''Alloytec'' V6, the ute range received just the lower-capacity ''Alloytec 175'' - it was the standard engine across the entire ute range with a six-speed manual - an upgraded 4-speed automatic was available as an option. Once again the One Tonner & Crewman ranges shared the same specification models, as shown below:\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nThis model was rebranded as SV6 in August 2006, and the 5-speed auto from the sedan became available for the first time as well as a power increase to {{convert|190|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n*'''SS''': Based on Commodore SS specification (minus side-impact airbags on cab-chassis). Available with a 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]], or the new {{Convert|260|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 6.0-litre [[Generation 4 V8 'L98']] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nCrewman's were once again available in Cross 8 form, whilst the VZ range added the Crewman '''Cross 6''', essentially a V6 version of the Cross 8.\n\nOne-Tonners were available with the following specifications:\n*'''Base''' :Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto or 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification minus fog-lights.

Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|195|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual\n\nTo make room in the factory for the upcoming VE Commodore, production of the One Tonner ceased in December 2005.\n\nThe Ute range continued without any updates for the next 18 months, until the January 2006 addition of Holden's new [[GM LS engine#L76|L76 V8's]]. Holden's new V8 range was introduced after its previous [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] failed to meet new [[Euro III]] emission standards introduced in Australia on January 1, 2006. The new [[GM LS engine|Generation 4 V8's]] contained an additional {{Convert|10|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} compared to their predecessors (the ute's had previously received an addition {{Convert|15|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power, inline with the VZ Sedan range), but were missing two key features compared to their American counterparts: both [[Active Fuel Management|Displacement on Demand]] and [[variable valve timing]] had been removed. The Alloytec 175 also lost {{Convert|3|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power due tweaks made to meet [[Euro III]] standards.'\nThe VZ Utes remained on sale well after the introduction of Holden's next-generation '''VE''' sedans, as did the VZ Wagons. By December of the same year, the Crewman and all AWD variants of the ute were gone from showrooms after Holden ceased production, whilst the curtain was brought down on the One-Tonner range once again after poor sales results. Holden's VZ Utes were superseded by the 8th-generation VE Ute range in September 2007.\n\n== Second generation (2007\u20132017) ==\n[[File:2007-2008 Holden VE Ute Omega 01.jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute Omega.]]\n[[File:2008 Holden VE Commodore SS V Ute (rear view).jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute SS V.]]\n\n=== VE ===\n{{Main|Holden VE Commodore}}\n\n2007 saw the launch of Holden's eagerly anticipated VE Ute range, unveiled to the media in August, with showroom sales began later in the month. The new generation designated '''VE''', based on the [[Holden Commodore|VE Commodore]] tackles an upward consumer tendency towards using utes as lifestyle vehicles. This further shifts the ute away from the traditional workhorse market.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = 2007-08-22 | url = http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | title = Revealed: Holden Commodore VE Ute | work = Drive | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-09-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180748/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n*'''Omega''': The base model, having similar standard features to the Omega sedan but can carry more than the SS-V, SS and SV6.

A 5.7-litre ''[[GM LS engine#LS1|Generation III]]'' [[V8 engine]] option was also available, but this was replaced by the 6.0-litre ''[[GM LS engine#L76|Generation 4]]'' in 2006, and updated to the ''[[GM LS engine#L98|L98]]'' specification later on that year. In 2004, Holden replaced the venerable V6 with a 3.6-litre ''[[GM High Feature engine|Alloytec]]'' unit.\n\nThe Australian-assembled Ute was to be sold in the [[United States]] as the [[Pontiac G8]] ST starting in 2009 alongside the four-door Commodore-based G8 sedan.<ref>{{cite web | last = Levine | first = Mike | title = The Pontiac G8 ST is Coming to the New York Auto Show | publisher = PickupTruck.com | date = 2008-01-25 | url = http://www.pickuptruck.com/html/autoshows/nyas2008/gm/pontiac/g8stcoming.html | accessdate = 2008-01-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080129003403/http://www.pickuptruck.com/html/autoshows/nyas2008/gm/pontiac/g8stcoming.html | archive-date = 29 January 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> However, due to GM's company-wide model review, a result of the [[Global financial crisis of 2008|2008 global financial crisis]], such plans were shelved on 6 January 2009.

The VU's arrival was a full 36 months after the [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]] sedan, meaning it arrived in time for the launch of Holden's [[Holden VX Commodore|VX Commodore]] series. The VU utilises the same [[wheelbase]] as the VT Commodore station wagon and [[Holden Caprice#WH|WH Statesman/Caprice]], meaning a wheelbase increase of {{convert|116|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The Ute employs the same interior as the Commodore, while also picking up the VX's upgraded equipment lists and re-styled exterior design.\n*'''Base ''': Built up from the Commodore Executive's specification.

Available with a 5.7-litre {{Convert|225|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nThe range received a minor refresh with the VX Series 2 models 12 months later, with the major upgrade being an additional {{Convert|5|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} to Holden's [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8's]].\n\nIn October 2001 The VU Ute came out in a special edition \"SS Fifty\" (pictured right) to mark the 50th anniversary.\nThis model has 500 units and will not become a collector's item; every SS 50 was identical in terms of color schemes, all 500 units were released with a black exterior and a partial leather interior that contained plenty of \"hyper yellow\" accents.\nOther items that made the SS 50 different were the chrome sports bar on the back, unique black-and-yellow engine cover, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, handbrake cover and gear knob as well as a color-coded instrument cluster to match the leather bolsters on the sports seats.\n\nThe VU's were superseded by the VY range in September 2002.\n\n=== VY ===\n{{Main|Holden VY Commodore}}\n\n[[File:2003-2004 Holden VY II Crewman utility 01.jpg|thumb|left|2003\u20132004 Holden VY II Crewman]]\n[[File:2003-2004 Holden VY II Ute S 01.jpg|thumb|right|2003\u20132004 Holden VY II Ute S]]\n[[File:2003-2005 Holden VY II Crewman Cross 8 utility 01.jpg|thumb|left|2003\u20132004 Holden VY II Crewman Cross 8]]\n[[File:2002-2003 Holden VY Ute S 01.jpg|thumb|right|2002\u20132003 Holden VY II Ute S]]\n\nThe Ute range received its first major facelift in the form of the 2002 '''VY''' range. VY Ute's received the same upgrades as the sedan/wagon range, which involved a new, sharper-designed nose, and more European-styled interior. The same three specification models were carried over for the VY, and picked up the same upgraded equipment lists as the VY sedans.\nThe VY range marked major change for Holden's Ute range, with the 2003 addition of two new models: the return of the '''One Tonner''' cab-chassis utility after a 18-year hiatus; and the introduction of Holden's first-ever 4-door utility, arriving in the form of the '''Crewman'''. The Crewman brought a longer wheelbase \u2013 {{convert|3206|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2939|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute; and a shorter tray \u2013 {{convert|1463|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|2193|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of the Ute<ref>[http://www.holden.com.au/pdf/chooseavehicle/fullfeatures/LCVVZ_SpecFeat.pdf Holden Ute range features] Retrieved 20 October 2007 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In December 2003, Holden released an [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] variant of the Crewman known as the Crewman Cross 8. Powered by a {{Convert|225|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine]], the Cross 8 featured a modified appearance, more suited to an off-road vehicle.\n\nBoth the Crewman and One Tonner models added instant sales to the Holden range, sparking rapid expansion of the Holden Ute range, its first major growth spurt since its 1990 re-introduction. Once again the same three specifications were carried over for the VY, with the Ute range available in base '''Ute''', '''S''' & '''SS''' forms. The same did not apply for the One-Tonner cab-chassis range though \u2013 it was available in just two model forms, base and S.\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification.

By December 2003 the Crewman range had expanded to include Holden's very first AWD utility in the form of the Crewman Cross 8. The Cross 8 received bolstered wheelarches, raised ride height as well as additional equipment, with the sole drivetrain being the recently upgraded Gen.3 V8 connected to a 4-speed automatic. V6-powered versions of the One Tonner & Crewman were only available with automatic transmission. The VY's were superseded by the arrival of the VZ range in August 2004\n\n=== VZ ===\n{{Main|Holden VZ Commodore}}\n\n[[File:2006-2007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS 01.jpg|thumb|2006\u20132007 Holden VZ Ute Thunder SS]]\n[[File:Holden VZ Crewman S.jpg|thumb|2004\u20132007 Holden VZ Crewman S.]]\n\nThe final series of Holden's VT-generation was the VZ range, launched in August 2004. Holden's main upgrade for the VZ's was the introduction of an all-new [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]], replacing Holden's previous [[Buick V6 engine|Ecotec V6's]] which had been in use since the 1995 launch of the VS Commodore. Whilst the sedan VZ range received both versions of the ''Alloytec'' V6, the ute range received just the lower-capacity ''Alloytec 175'' - it was the standard engine across the entire ute range with a six-speed manual - an upgraded 4-speed automatic was available as an option. Once again the One Tonner & Crewman ranges shared the same specification models, as shown below:\n*'''Base''': Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nThis model was rebranded as SV6 in August 2006, and the 5-speed auto from the sedan became available for the first time as well as a power increase to {{convert|190|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n*'''SS''': Based on Commodore SS specification (minus side-impact airbags on cab-chassis). Available with a 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]], or the new {{Convert|260|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} 6.0-litre [[Generation 4 V8 'L98']] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\nCrewman's were once again available in Cross 8 form, whilst the VZ range added the Crewman '''Cross 6''', essentially a V6 version of the Cross 8.\n\nOne-Tonners were available with the following specifications:\n*'''Base''' :Based on Commodore Executive specification. Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|175|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto or 5.7-litre {{Convert|235|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] - 6sp manual or 4sp auto\n*'''S''': Based on Commodore SV6 specification minus fog-lights.

Available with 3.6-litre {{Convert|195|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} [[GM High Feature engine#LY7|Alloytec V6]] - 5-speed automatic or 6-speed manual\n\nTo make room in the factory for the upcoming VE Commodore, production of the One Tonner ceased in December 2005.\n\nThe Ute range continued without any updates for the next 18 months, until the January 2006 addition of Holden's new [[GM LS engine#L76|L76 V8's]]. Holden's new V8 range was introduced after its previous [[GM LS engine|Generation 3 V8]] failed to meet new [[Euro III]] emission standards introduced in Australia on January 1, 2006. The new [[GM LS engine|Generation 4 V8's]] contained an additional {{Convert|10|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} compared to their predecessors (the ute's had previously received an addition {{Convert|15|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power, inline with the VZ Sedan range), but were missing two key features compared to their American counterparts: both [[Active Fuel Management|Displacement on Demand]] and [[variable valve timing]] had been removed. The Alloytec 175 also lost {{Convert|3|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} of power due tweaks made to meet [[Euro III]] standards.'\nThe VZ Utes remained on sale well after the introduction of Holden's next-generation '''VE''' sedans, as did the VZ Wagons. By December of the same year, the Crewman and all AWD variants of the ute were gone from showrooms after Holden ceased production, whilst the curtain was brought down on the One-Tonner range once again after poor sales results. Holden's VZ Utes were superseded by the 8th-generation VE Ute range in September 2007.\n\n== Second generation (2007\u20132017) ==\n[[File:2007-2008 Holden VE Ute Omega 01.jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute Omega.]]\n[[File:2008 Holden VE Commodore SS V Ute (rear view).jpg|thumb|right|2007\u20132008 Holden VE Ute SS V.]]\n\n=== VE ===\n{{Main|Holden VE Commodore}}\n\n2007 saw the launch of Holden's eagerly anticipated VE Ute range, unveiled to the media in August, with showroom sales began later in the month. The new generation designated '''VE''', based on the [[Holden Commodore|VE Commodore]] tackles an upward consumer tendency towards using utes as lifestyle vehicles. This further shifts the ute away from the traditional workhorse market.<ref>{{cite web | last = Hagon | first = Toby | date = 2007-08-22 | url = http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | title = Revealed: Holden Commodore VE Ute | work = Drive | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | accessdate = 2007-09-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180748/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/revealed-holden-commodore-ve-ute-20070822-141ti.html | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n*'''Omega''': The base model, having similar standard features to the Omega sedan but can carry more than the SS-V, SS and SV6.
