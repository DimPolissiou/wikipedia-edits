Prior to Barry becoming the Flash, Iris often chides Barry for his frequently being late due to his repeatedly being lost in thought at work as a forensic scientist, a tendency which continues even after he becomes a high-speed superhero.

Still overjoyed by the return of Barry, she does not get much time to spend with him, as Barry is still mentally scarred from his deathly ordeal and staunchly refuses to stop and enjoy even a moment of \"normal\" life.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> She is also shown to be much younger than she previously had appeared (she was depicted as a middle-age woman after the events of ''Crisis''), about the same age as when Barry first met her, which later implied by the resurrected Professor Zoom that Iris's rejuvenation is a side effect of close contact to her husband's Speed Force since ''Final Crisis''. She resumes her career as a crime reporter at Central City.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 3, #1 (April 2010)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Iris is not married to Barry, but they still know each other because of their respective occupations. It is hinted that Iris has a romantic attraction to Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' #1</ref> She is accidentally trapped in the Speed Force by [[Top (comics)|Turbine]], but is freed by Barry's alter-ego.<ref>''The Flash'' #7</ref> Later issues confirm that she is in love with Barry. Barry does not yet reciprocate Iris' affections, though he hints at it when he's forced to take on the role of the Black Racer and goes to Iris for help.<ref>''Justice League: Darkseid War - The Flash'' #1</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nDuring the [[DC Rebirth]] events, when Iris and [[Wally West II]] were attacked by Eobard Thawne, Iris had glimpses of her pre-''Flashpoint'' life with Barry, including them as husband and wife and had a family in the other timeline, and learning that he is the Flash in the process. Knowing that Barry is indirectly responsible for the alteration of their lives through time-travel and kept it a secret from her, Iris now distrusts Barry. She also kills Thawne after he lost his powers in retaliation of him hurting Wally II after Barry rescued them,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 5 #24 (August 2017)</ref> though Thawne later again resurrected from his death. She later appears at the cemetery where Barry asks her for her forgiveness for lying to her. She forgives him, because she is curious about the Flash. He takes her to the Watchtower. She is interested in other secrets Barry is keeping from her. \n\nSince the Flash Family defeated Grodd and stop the Negative Speed Force from spreading Central City, both she and Barry have rekindled their romances with each other. She is subsequently re-introduced to the pre-''Flashpoint'' Wally West, swiftly regaining her memories of him when she sees him, simultaneously inspiring Wally's own memories of those he has forgotten.<ref> \"The Flash\" Vol 5 #45</ref> She is later bought to trial in the 25th century for Eobard Thawne's murder. She and Barry later have Wally to be taken care of in the rehabilitation center called the Sanctuary, in which she is so happy about Wally being a better hero today. During her romance with Barry, she begins to remember their marriage, and beginning to put pieces together about the new forces that appear in Central City.<ref> \"The Flash\" Vol 5 #52</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''The New Frontier''===\nIn [[DC: The New Frontier|The New Frontier]] universe, Iris West is a reporter and engaged to crime forensic Barry Allen. During the Cold War and the rise of McCarthyism, Iris wrote her article \"Washington Declares War On Mystery Men\" on the current events following the death of Hourman and the social bias against masked vigilantes. In 1957, Iris was interviewing Ted \"Wildcat\" Grant in Las Vegas. While on a phone call with Barry Allen, Captain Cold appeared and froze Iris's hand that was on the phone. Barry heard everything that happened and traveled to Las Vegas as The Flash. In the process he freed an unconscious Iris and stopped Captain Cold. A year later in 1958, after Barry had retired from crime fighting and the subsequent appearance of the Centre, Iris had known for some time that her husband was the Flash and did not reveal this until she convinced him to become a hero once again.\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam]] universe, Iris was combined with Marvel's [[Roxanne Simpson]] to form Iris Simpson. When Iris became married to Blaze Allen, her life and soul were taken by the [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Night]] [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], which threw Blaze into a depression until he bonded with the demon Etrigan to become Speed Demon. Her soul was eventually freed by Blaze and her nephew Wally, who became the third Speed Demon.<ref>''Speed Demon'' #1 (1996)</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries (an event prior to the New 52 relaunch, when an alternate timeline was created by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]<ref>''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>), Iris West is unmarried and in a relationship with someone called \"John\" at the ''Central City Citizen'', where she works.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Later Iris is seen with her nephew and cameraman, [[Wally West]], covering a battle between [[Captain Cold|Citizen Cold]] and [[Mister Freeze]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Iris was invited to dinner by Citizen Cold. When she asks him for an interview, he is interrupted by his emergency calls. Later, Citizen Cold is injured during his battle with the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] and while collapsing in his car, confronts Iris.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Iris then brings him to her home. After he recovers, he gives her a key to his penthouse, and an offer to join him when he leaves Central City. When Citizen Cold returns home, Iris learns from [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], that Citizen Cold is a criminal and murdered her nephew. Citizen Cold attacks Pied Piper, but Iris uses one of his own weapons to freeze him in a block of ice, just as he had Wally.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #3 (August 2011)</ref> Afterwards, Iris visits her nephew's grave along with her husband John.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' prequel series, Barry met with Iris sometime after Superman killed the Joker where she expressed her disapproval of Superman's actions. She's convinced that Flash would not do the same if he was in Superman's scenario (where Iris would be murdered instead of Lois), and tells Barry to not condone Superman's actions and to promise her that he will stand up to Superman if he goes down the wrong path. Five years later, Barry goes to see Iris after Superman lashes out at him for letting Batman get away, where it's shown that they've broken up as Iris is upset with Barry for breaking his promise and supporting Superman. Later, Flash sees Iris being arrested by Girder and King Shark for treason against the Regime from joining a Central City Insurgent group.<ref>''Injustice: Gods Among Us Year Five'' #27 (June 2016)</ref> Flash tries to defend them from the two villains and ends up killing King Shark in the process. Iris is disgusted by Barry's actions and offers to arrest herself just to not deal with Barry. Barry talks with her, and she tells him that her faith in him was shattered five years ago when she was undercover in Australia where she witnessed Superman and Wonder Woman brutally beat and cripple a rebellious hero named Galaxor while Flash did nothing to help the young man (who committed suicide shortly afterwards though that later turns out to be a myth). Iris ultimately rejects Barry and tells him that he's not the man she thought he was. Iris and the rest of her group afterwards are arrested by Flash and Girder, and was set to stand trial for her actions.<ref>''Injustice: Gods Among Us Year Five'' #28 (June 2016)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Iris West made her first live-action and media appearance as a guest star in the two-hour pilot episode of the 1990 television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]],'' played by actress [[Paula Marshall]].

In \"Downtime\", she and Barry are shown attending [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]'s birthday party with Wally West. In \"Failsafe\", Iris was reporting on an alien invasion before being killed. The entire situation is later revealed to be part of Martian Manhunter's mind-training exercise. During \"Coldhearted\" Iris gives a shout out to Wally on the news as a birthday present before reporting school closings. She later reports Queen Perdita's death on the news. In the episode \"Bloodlines\", she is revealed to be pregnant with twins. Her time-traveling grandson [[Bart Allen]] tells her that her unborn son will grow up to be his father. In \"[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]\", she is irritated that people have forgotten she is a reporter ever since she has given birth to the twins.\n* [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West]] appears in the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Candice Patton]].

Here, she is also portrayed as the girlfriend of Barry Allen and having deduced his identity too.\n* Iris West next appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. In an alternate timeline created accidentally by Flash/Barry Allen, she is no longer married to Barry and instead married and had a child with someone else.

Her plan is to somehow put her grandson, who, by then, had taken up the Flash mantle, out of commission for a week to protect him from a future she is determined to change; however, her plan is corrupted by Bart's clone \"brother [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and a weakened Bart is beaten to death by the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].<ref>''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #13</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #1, Iris has since moved to her old home in Central City where she is seen tearfully looking over photographs of her late husband, when a disembodied voice calls her name: her late husband, Barry Allen.<ref>''DC Universe'' #0 (June 2008)</ref> Iris spends some time as part of a [[Darkseid]]-resistance cell operating out of the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]] alongside Black Lightning, Green Arrow, the Ray, [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] and her two children.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #2 (August 2008)</ref> Soon after, Iris is corrupted by the [[Anti-Life Equation]] but Barry is able to break its hold over her by kissing her & enveloping her in the [[Speed Force]]. Iris starts crying at the sight of Barry, who reassures her everything will be okay.<ref>''Final Crisis'' #4 (November 2008)</ref>\n\nAfter [[The Flash: Rebirth|the return of her husband]], Iris is shown fully returning to her life alongside the rest of the Flash family. Still overjoyed by the return of Barry, she does not get much time to spend with him, as Barry is still mentally scarred from his deathly ordeal and staunchly refuses to stop and enjoy even a moment of \"normal\" life.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)</ref> She is also shown to be much younger than she previously had appeared (she was depicted as a middle-age woman after the events of ''Crisis''), about the same age as when Barry first met her, which later implied by the resurrected Professor Zoom that Iris's rejuvenation is a side effect of close contact to her husband's Speed Force since ''Final Crisis''. She resumes her career as a crime reporter at Central City.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 3, #1 (April 2010)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Iris is not married to Barry, but they still know each other because of their respective occupations. It is hinted that Iris has a romantic attraction to Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' #1</ref> She is accidentally trapped in the Speed Force by [[Top (comics)|Turbine]], but is freed by Barry's alter-ego.<ref>''The Flash'' #7</ref> Later issues confirm that she is in love with Barry. Barry does not yet reciprocate Iris' affections, though he hints at it when he's forced to take on the role of the Black Racer and goes to Iris for help.<ref>''Justice League: Darkseid War - The Flash'' #1</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nDuring the [[DC Rebirth]] events, when Iris and [[Wally West II]] were attacked by Eobard Thawne, Iris had glimpses of her pre-''Flashpoint'' life with Barry, including them as husband and wife and had a family in the other timeline, and learning that he is the Flash in the process. Knowing that Barry is indirectly responsible for the alteration of their lives through time-travel and kept it a secret from her, Iris now distrusts Barry. She also kills Thawne after he lost his powers in retaliation of him hurting Wally II after Barry rescued them,<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 5 #24 (August 2017)</ref> though Thawne later again resurrected from his death. She later appears at the cemetery where Barry asks her for her forgiveness for lying to her. She forgives him, because she is curious about the Flash. He takes her to the Watchtower. She is interested in other secrets Barry is keeping from her. \n\nSince the Flash Family defeated Grodd and stop the Negative Speed Force from spreading Central City, both she and Barry have rekindled their romances with each other. She is subsequently re-introduced to the pre-''Flashpoint'' Wally West, swiftly regaining her memories of him when she sees him, simultaneously inspiring Wally's own memories of those he has forgotten.<ref> \"The Flash\" Vol 5 #45</ref> She is later bought to trial in the 25th century for Eobard Thawne's murder. She and Barry later have Wally to be taken care of in the rehabilitation center called the Sanctuary, in which she is so happy about Wally being a better hero today. During her romance with Barry, she begins to remember their marriage, and beginning to put pieces together about the new forces that appear in Central City.<ref> \"The Flash\" Vol 5 #52</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''The New Frontier''===\nIn [[DC: The New Frontier|The New Frontier]] universe, Iris West is a reporter and engaged to crime forensic Barry Allen. During the Cold War and the rise of McCarthyism, Iris wrote her article \"Washington Declares War On Mystery Men\" on the current events following the death of Hourman and the social bias against masked vigilantes. In 1957, Iris was interviewing Ted \"Wildcat\" Grant in Las Vegas. While on a phone call with Barry Allen, Captain Cold appeared and froze Iris's hand that was on the phone. Barry heard everything that happened and traveled to Las Vegas as The Flash. In the process he freed an unconscious Iris and stopped Captain Cold. A year later in 1958, after Barry had retired from crime fighting and the subsequent appearance of the Centre, Iris had known for some time that her husband was the Flash and did not reveal this until she convinced him to become a hero once again.\n\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam]] universe, Iris was combined with Marvel's [[Roxanne Simpson]] to form Iris Simpson. When Iris became married to Blaze Allen, her life and soul were taken by the [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Night]] [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], which threw Blaze into a depression until he bonded with the demon Etrigan to become Speed Demon. Her soul was eventually freed by Blaze and her nephew Wally, who became the third Speed Demon.<ref>''Speed Demon'' #1 (1996)</ref>\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' miniseries (an event prior to the New 52 relaunch, when an alternate timeline was created by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]<ref>''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>), Iris West is unmarried and in a relationship with someone called \"John\" at the ''Central City Citizen'', where she works.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Later Iris is seen with her nephew and cameraman, [[Wally West]], covering a battle between [[Captain Cold|Citizen Cold]] and [[Mister Freeze]].<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #1 (June 2011)</ref> Iris was invited to dinner by Citizen Cold. When she asks him for an interview, he is interrupted by his emergency calls. Later, Citizen Cold is injured during his battle with the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] and while collapsing in his car, confronts Iris.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #2 (July 2011)</ref> Iris then brings him to her home. After he recovers, he gives her a key to his penthouse, and an offer to join him when he leaves Central City. When Citizen Cold returns home, Iris learns from [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]], that Citizen Cold is a criminal and murdered her nephew. Citizen Cold attacks Pied Piper, but Iris uses one of his own weapons to freeze him in a block of ice, just as he had Wally.<ref>''Flashpoint: Citizen Cold'' #3 (August 2011)</ref> Afterwards, Iris visits her nephew's grave along with her husband John.<ref>''Flashpoint: Kid Flash Lost'' #3 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn the ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' prequel series, Barry met with Iris sometime after Superman killed the Joker where she expressed her disapproval of Superman's actions. She's convinced that Flash would not do the same if he was in Superman's scenario (where Iris would be murdered instead of Lois), and tells Barry to not condone Superman's actions and to promise her that he will stand up to Superman if he goes down the wrong path. Five years later, Barry goes to see Iris after Superman lashes out at him for letting Batman get away, where it's shown that they've broken up as Iris is upset with Barry for breaking his promise and supporting Superman. Later, Flash sees Iris being arrested by Girder and King Shark for treason against the Regime from joining a Central City Insurgent group.<ref>''Injustice: Gods Among Us Year Five'' #27 (June 2016)</ref> Flash tries to defend them from the two villains and ends up killing King Shark in the process. Iris is disgusted by Barry's actions and offers to arrest herself just to not deal with Barry. Barry talks with her, and she tells him that her faith in him was shattered five years ago when she was undercover in Australia where she witnessed Superman and Wonder Woman brutally beat and cripple a rebellious hero named Galaxor while Flash did nothing to help the young man (who committed suicide shortly afterwards though that later turns out to be a myth). Iris ultimately rejects Barry and tells him that he's not the man she thought he was. Iris and the rest of her group afterwards are arrested by Flash and Girder, and was set to stand trial for her actions.<ref>''Injustice: Gods Among Us Year Five'' #28 (June 2016)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Iris West made her first live-action and media appearance as a guest star in the two-hour pilot episode of the 1990 television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]],'' played by actress [[Paula Marshall]]. Here, she is portrayed as Barry's girlfriend, just as she is in the comics, but unlike her comic book version, she's a computer graphics artist, and not a reporter.  When last heard, she got an apartment in [[Paris]] and never returned to Central City.\n* Iris West appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' voiced by [[Nicole Dubuc]]. In \"Downtime\", she and Barry are shown attending [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]'s birthday party with Wally West. In \"Failsafe\", Iris was reporting on an alien invasion before being killed. The entire situation is later revealed to be part of Martian Manhunter's mind-training exercise. During \"Coldhearted\" Iris gives a shout out to Wally on the news as a birthday present before reporting school closings. She later reports Queen Perdita's death on the news. In the episode \"Bloodlines\", she is revealed to be pregnant with twins. Her time-traveling grandson [[Bart Allen]] tells her that her unborn son will grow up to be his father. In \"[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]\", she is irritated that people have forgotten she is a reporter ever since she has given birth to the twins.\n* [[Iris West (Arrowverse)|Iris West]] appears in the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Candice Patton]]. This is the first live-action version of Iris to be portrayed as African-American. Iris is Detective [[Joe West (Arrowverse)|Joe West]]'s daughter and Barry Allen's childhood friend, later his fiance, as of the crossover event entitled \"Crisis on Earth X\", she marries Barry and becomes his wife. Her Earth-2 counterpart is introduced in \"[[Welcome to Earth-2]]\". In this universe, Iris is a police detective and is married to the Earth-2 Barry; her father, Joe, is a [[nightclub singer]]. Iris is first mentioned in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' episode \"The Man Under the Hood\" as regularly visiting Barry in his coma.\n\n===Film===\n* Iris West's first animated appearance was in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' voiced by [[Vicki Lewis]]. Here, she is also portrayed as the girlfriend of Barry Allen and having deduced his identity too.\n* Iris West next appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'' voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]. In an alternate timeline created accidentally by Flash/Barry Allen, she is no longer married to Barry and instead married and had a child with someone else. In contrast with the comic book source material, Barry's marriage to Iris is restored in the film's conclusion based on the story.\n\n====DC Extended Universe====\n[[Kiersey Clemons]] was cast as Iris West in ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'', though her scenes were cut. She is slated to appear in the upcoming film ''[[Flash in other media#DC Extended Universe|The Flash]]'', which is a part of the larger [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/the-flash-movie-kiersey-clemons-iris-west-1201822282/|title=\u2018The Flash\u2019: \u2018Dope\u2019 Actress Kiersey Clemons to Star as Iris West in Movie (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=Variety|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=July 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/krolljvar/status/793882510602039296|title=Justin Kroll on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Video game===\nIn ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Iris is mentioned by the Regime's Flash.

In late 1998, Fowles left the group to serve a two-year [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission]] for the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] in Ohio. Though he didn't record on Death by Stereo's debut LP ''[[If Looks Could Kill, I'd Watch You Die]]'', he was given writing credits on nine of the album's fourteen songs, many of which had appeared on earlier demos and EPs.<ref name=\"BonesInterview\" />\n\n;The Aquabats\nIn 2006, Fowles joined the [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]] [[superhero]]-themed comedy rock band [[The Aquabats]] as a full-time member, succeeding longtime guitarist [[Courtney Pollock|Corey Pollock]] (aka \"Chainsaw, the Prince of Karate\"). His [[stage name]] was conceived in The Aquabats' van during his first tour with the band: \"Bones\" was derived from his slender stature, while the bird names were playing off his surname's similarity to \"[[fowl]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2012/03/ian_fowles_talks_about_the_aqu.php |title=Ian Fowles on Joining the Aquabats and Playing Eagle \"Bones\" Falconhawk |publisher=[[OC Weekly]] |date=March 6, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerdlike.com/2012/the-aquabats-supershow-tvs-newest-superheroes |title=The Aquabats Supershow: TV\u2019s Newest Superheroes |publisher=Nerdlike |date=March 7, 2012 |access-date=May 27, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630191132/http://nerdlike.com/2012/the-aquabats-supershow-tvs-newest-superheroes |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Fowles first started writing and recording with the band in 2007 on original songs for the [[children's television series]] ''[[Yo Gabba Gabba!]]'', on which he also appeared onscreen with the band and played a guitar solo as part of the show's \"Cool Tricks\" segment. He later made his album debut with The Aquabats on their 2010 EP ''[[Radio Down!]]''.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Fowles portrayed Eaglebones Falconhawk in two seasons of The Aquabats' live-action cable television series ''[[The Aquabats! Super Show!]]'', on which he also worked composing original songs as well as bits of the series' [[Film score|score]]. Starting in September 2019, he has since continued this role on the series' independent [[YouTube]]-based relaunch, ''[[The Aquabats! RadVentures!]]''.\n\n;Other musical endeavors\n[[File:Gerard Way Webster Hall - Juarez.png|thumb|left|250px|Fowles (left) performing with [[Gerard Way]] in New York in 2014.]]\nFowles has played live and/or recorded with a myriad of other projects, typically spanning the genres of [[pop punk]] and [[alternative rock]]. While attending high school in the mid 90's he played in the bands CleanX and D-cons. In late 2000 he formed a short-lived 80's pop tribute band called The Electric Youth that featured friends from Esperanza High School [[Brandon Saller]] of [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]] and  Nathan Willett of [[Cold War Kids]]. In 2003 he was the touring guitarist of [[Sense Field]]. In 2005-2006 he toured as the guitarist of [[Further Seems Forever]]. Among the groups he has collaborated with are Checkpoint Charley, [[Brandon Saller]], and [[Dead Sara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linescratchers.com/?p=3414 |title=Interview - Arthur Hatton, founder of Linescratchers |date=December 19, 2011}}</ref> In 2007, Fowles played bass for [[AFI (band)|AFI]] member [[Hunter Burgan]]'s side project Hunter Revenge, who accompanied The Aquabats on their winter holiday tour that year.

J. Ramone]]{{'}}s band for an East Coast tour with [[Shonen Knife]]. Fowles has continued to play guitar for [[C.J. Ramone]] from time to time since.\n\nIn August 2014, Fowles was revealed to be the guitarist for former [[My Chemical Romance]] frontman [[Gerard Way]]{{'}}s solo project, recording guitar and percussion for Way's debut album ''[[Hesitant Alien]]'' , appearing in the music video for its single \"[[No Shows]]\", and doing all the live touring with him during 2014-2015.\n\n;Personal life\nFowles is [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], and currently plays a left-handed Fender Squier Vintage Modified [[Jazzmaster]] model guitar with The Aquabats and a left-handed Fender Kurt Cobain Jaguar model with Gerard Way.\n\nLike fellow Aquabats bandmates [[Christian Jacobs]] and [[Chad Larson]], Fowles is a practicing [[Latter-day Saint]]. He is also a doctoral student at [[Claremont Graduate University]], where he studies at the School of Religion. In November 2010, Fowles published his first book, an extension of his master's thesis entitled ''A Sound Salvation: Rock N' Roll as a Religion'', a thesis which argues that rock music and culture satisfy an influential definition of \"religion\" in contemporary religious studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asoundsalvation.com/ |title=A Sound Salvation |access-date=2010-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303094323/http://www.asoundsalvation.com/ |archive-date=2011-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''A Sound Salvation: Rock N' Roll as a Religion'' (2010)\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Television===\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The trunk is short and robust, while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped. The region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump and the neck is short and thick to the point of being nearly immobile. The animal's head is very large, taking up to one-third of the body's entire length.<ref name=heptner1988 /> The structure of the head is well suited for digging. The head acts as a plough, while the powerful neck muscles allow the animal to upturn considerable amounts of soil:<ref name=\"marsan70\">{{Harvnb|Marsan|Mattioli|2013|pp=70\u201372}}</ref> it is capable of digging {{convert|8|-|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} into frozen ground and can upturn rocks weighing {{convert|40|-|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=baskin2003 /> The eyes are small and deep-set and the ears long and broad. The species has well developed [[canine teeth]], which protrude from the mouths of adult males. The middle hooves are larger and more elongated than the lateral ones and are capable of quick movements.<ref name=heptner1988 /> The animal can run at a maximum speed of 40&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph) and jump at a height of {{convert|140|-|150|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=baskin2003 />\n\n[[Sexual dimorphism]] is very pronounced in the species, with males being typically 5\u201310% larger and 20\u201330% heavier than females. Males also sport a mane running down the back, which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter.<ref name=\"marsan26\">{{Harvnb|Marsan|Mattioli|2013|pp=26}}</ref> The canine teeth are also much more prominent in males and grow throughout life. The upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life, though they gradually curve upwards. The lower canines are much sharper and longer, with the exposed parts measuring {{convert|10|-|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. In the breeding period, males develop a coating of [[subcutaneous tissue]], which may be {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, extending from the shoulder blades to the rump, thus protecting vital organs during fights. Males sport a roughly egg-sized sack near the opening of the penis, which collects urine and emits a sharp odour. The function of this sack is not fully understood.<ref name=heptner1988 />\n[[File:PigSkelLyd2.png|thumb|Skeleton, as illustrated by [[Richard Lydekker]].]]\n[[File:Hoffmann, Hans - A Wild Boar Piglet - 1578.jpg|thumb|A European wild boar piglet, painted by [[Hans Hoffmann (painter)|Hans Hoffman]] in 1578. Note the stripes, a characteristic feature of piglets.]]\nAdult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors; boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water. In most of [[Europe]], males average {{convert|75|-|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight, {{convert|75|-|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height and {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} in body length, whereas females average {{convert|60|-|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight, {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height and {{convert|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} in body length. In Europe's [[Southern Europe|Mediterranean regions]], males may reach average weights as low as {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with shoulder heights of {{convert|63|-|65|cm|in|abbr=on}}. In the more productive areas of [[Eastern Europe]], males average {{convert|110|-|130|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight, {{convert|95|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height and {{convert|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in body length, while females weigh {{convert|95|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, reach {{convert|85|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height and {{convert|145|cm|in|abbr=on}} in body length. In [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], the largest males weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. In Northeastern Asia, large males can reach [[brown bear]]-like sizes, weighing {{convert|270|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and measuring {{convert|110|-|118|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height. Some adult males in [[Primorsky Krai|Ussuriland]] and [[Manchuria]] have been recorded to weigh {{convert|300|-|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and measure {{convert|125|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height.

The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around the face and limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around [[Lake Balkhash]] are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from [[Belarus]] and Ussuriland can be black.

By 1950, wild boar had once again reached their original northern boundary in many parts of their Asiatic range. By 1960, they reached [[Leningrad]] and Moscow and by 1975, they were to be found in [[Archangelsk]] and [[Astrakhan]]. In the 1970s they again occurred in Denmark and Sweden, where captive animals escaped and now survive in the wild. In England, wild boar populations re-established themselves in the 1990s, after escaping from specialist farms that had imported European stock.<ref name=\"britishwildboar.org.uk\" />\n\n=== Status in Great Britain ===\n[[File:Wild Boar at Culzie - geograph.org.uk - 1017910.jpg|thumb|Mixed sounder of wild boar and domestic pigs at Culzie, [[Scotland]]]]\nWild boars were apparently already becoming rare by the 11th century since a 1087 forestry law enacted by [[William the Conqueror]] punishes through blinding the unlawful killing of a boar. [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to reintroduce the species into the [[New Forest]], though this population was exterminated during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nBetween their medieval extinction and the 1980s, when wild boar farming began, only a handful of captive wild boar, imported from the continent, were present in Britain. Occasional escapes of wild boar from wildlife parks have occurred as early as the 1970s, but since the early 1990s significant populations have re-established themselves after escapes from farms, the number of which has increased as the demand for meat from the species has grown. A 1998 [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|MAFF]] (now [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|DEFRA]]) study on wild boar living wild in Britain confirmed the presence of two populations of wild boar living in Britain; one in [[Kent]]/[[East Sussex]] and another in [[Dorset]].<ref name=\"britishwildboar.org.uk\" /> Another DEFRA report, in February 2008,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080504155956/http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2008/080219b.htm Government supports local communities to manage wild boar].

A 'new breeding population' was also identified in [[Devon]]. There is another significant population in [[Dumfries]] and [[Galloway]]. Populations estimates were as follows:\n* The largest population, in Kent/East Sussex, was then estimated at approximately 200 animals in the core distribution area.\n* The second largest, in Gloucestershire/Herefordshire, was first estimated to be in excess of 100 animals. Legally classified as dangerous wild animals, the group is known to be feral descendants of domestic (Tamworth) pigs abandoned nearby. Their numbers grew by 2016 to at least 1,500 and the Forestry Commission planned to reduce the total to a manageable 400. \"Adult males can reach {{convert|20|st|kg lb|spell=in|disp=sqbr}}, run at {{convert|30|mph|km/h|spell=in|disp=sqbr}}, and can jump or barge through all but the strongest fences.

In some jurisdictions, it is illegal to import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/70843.html|title=Eurasian Boar - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== History ====\nWhile domestic pigs, both captive and feral (popularly termed \"[[Feral pig|razorback]]s\"), have been in North America since the earliest days of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], pure wild boars were not introduced into the New World until the 19th century. The suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowners as big game animals. The initial introductions took place in fenced enclosures, though several escapes occurred, with the escapees sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig populations.\n\nThe first of these introductions occurred in [[New Hampshire]] in 1890. Thirteen wild boars from Germany were purchased by [[Austin Corbin]] from [[Carl Hagenbeck]] and released into a {{convert|9500|ha|acre|adj=on}} game preserve in [[Sullivan County, New Hampshire|Sullivan County]]. Several of these boars escaped, though they were quickly hunted down by locals. Two further introductions were made from the original stocking, with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve's fencing. These escapees have ranged widely, with some specimens having been observed crossing into [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"mayer2009\">Mayer, J. J. et al.

Several specimens escaped six years later, dispersing into the [[William C. Whitney Wilderness Area]], with their descendants surviving for at least 20 years.<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nThe most extensive boar introduction in the US took place in western [[North Carolina]] in 1912, when 13 boars of undetermined European origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a game preserve in [[Hooper Bald]], [[Graham County, North Carolina|Graham County]]. Most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade, until a large-scale hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape. Some of the boars migrated to [[Tennessee]], where they intermixed with both free-ranging and feral pigs in the area. In 1924, a dozen Hooper Bald wild pigs were shipped to [[California]] and released in a property between [[Carmel River|Carmel Valley]] and the [[Los Padres National Forest]]. These hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state, as well as in other states like [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nSeveral wild boars from [[Leon Springs, Texas|Leon Springs]] and the [[San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium|San Antonio]], [[Saint Louis Zoo|Saint Louis]] and [[San Diego Zoo]]s were released in the Powder Horn Ranch in [[Calhoun County, Texas|Calhoun County]], Texas, in 1939. These specimens escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal areas, with some crossing the [[Espiritu Santo Bay]] and colonizing [[Matagorda Island]]. Descendants of the Powder Horn Ranch boars were later released onto [[San Jos\u00e9 Island (Texas)|San Jos\u00e9 Island]] and the coast of [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]], Louisiana.<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nWild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the [[Edwards Plateau]] in the 1940s, only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig populations, later spreading into neighboring counties.<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nStarting in the mid-1980s, several boars purchased from the San Diego Zoo and [[Tierpark Berlin]] were released into the United States. A decade later, more specimens from farms in [[Canada]] and Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest were let loose. In recent years, wild pig populations have been reported in 44 states within the US, most of which are likely wild boar\u2013feral hog hybrids.

This theme also occurs in [[Irish mythology|Irish]] and [[Egyptian mythology]], where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of October, therefore autumn. This association likely arose from aspects of the boar's actual nature.

According to [[Tacitus]], the [[Baltic people|Baltic]] [[Aesti]] featured boars on their helmets and may have also worn boar masks (see for example the [[Guilden Morden boar]]). The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the [[Celts]], who considered them to be their most important sacred animal.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] inherited this tradition, with one of its first practitioners being [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. Boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the 3rd century BC as preparation for manhood and battle. A typical Roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large nets, then flushing the boar with dogs and immobilizing it with smaller nets. The animal would then be dispatched with a ''venabulum'', a short [[spear]] with a [[crossguard]] at the base of the blade. More than their Greek predecessors, the Romans extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture. With the ascension of [[Constantine the Great]], boar hunting took on Christian allegorical themes, with the animal being portrayed as a \"black beast\" analogous to the dragon of [[Saint George and the Dragon|Saint George]]. Boar hunting continued after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], though the Germanic tribes considered the [[red deer]] to be a more noble and worthy quarry. The post-Roman nobility hunted boar as their predecessors did, but primarily as training for battle rather than sport. It was not uncommon for medieval hunters to deliberately hunt boars during the breeding season, when the animals were more aggressive. During the [[Renaissance]], when [[deforestation]] and the introduction of [[firearm]]s reduced boar numbers, boarhunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility, one of many charges brought up against the rich during the [[German Peasants' War]] and the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"scheggi9\">{{Harvnb|Scheggi|1999|pp=9\u201358}}</ref> During the mid-20th century, 7,000\u20138,000 boars were caught in the Caucasus, 6,000\u20137,000 in Kazakhstan and about 5,000 in Central Asia during the [[Soviet]] period, primarily through use of dogs and beats.<ref name=heptner1988 /> In Nepal, farmers and poachers eliminate boars by baiting balls of wheat flour containing explosives with kerosene oil, with the animals' chewing motions triggering the devices.<ref>Shreshta, Tej Kumar (1997).

Populations living on the outskirts of towns or farms can dig up [[potato]]es and damage [[melon]]s, [[watermelon]]s and [[maize]]. However, they generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce. In the [[Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest|Belovezh forest]] for example, 34\u201347% of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods. While the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated,<ref name=heptner1988 /> cases are known of boar depredations causing [[famine]]s, as was the case in [[Hachinohe, Aomori|Hachinohe]], Japan in 1749, where 3,000 people died of what became known as the \"wild boar famine\". Still, within Japanese culture, the boar's status as vermin is expressed through its title as \"king of pests\" and the popular saying (addressed to young men in rural areas) \"When you get married, choose a place with no wild boar.\"<ref name=knight2003 /><ref>Walker, B. \"Commercial Growth and Environmental Change in Early Modern Japan: Hachinohe's Wild Boar Famine,\" ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 60, No. 2 (May, 2001), pp. 331.</ref>\n\nIn Central Europe, farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright, while in Kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations. Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as [[European chafer|June bugs]] under control.<ref name=heptner1988 /> The growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.<ref name=cahill2012>{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = S. | last2 = Llimona | first2 = F. | last3 = Caba\u00f1eros | first3 = L. | last4 = Calomardo | first4 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Characteristics of wild boar (''Sus scrofa'') habituation to urban areas in the Collserola Natural Park (Barcelona) and comparison with other locations | url = http://abc.museucienciesjournals.cat/files/ABC_35-2_pp_221-233.pdf | journal = Animal Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 221\u2013233 }}</ref>\n\n=== Attacks on humans ===\n[[File:Rock Shelter 15, Bhimbetka 02.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a stylised boar attacking a man, [[Bhimbetaka]], [[India]]]]\nActual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They generally occur during the boars' [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] season from November to January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the [[thigh]] region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated.<ref name=manipady2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Manipady | first1 = S. |display-authors=etal | year = 2006 | title = Death by attack from a wild boar | url = http://www.phossil.com/thom/4th%20July%20Hog/Wild%20Boar%20Attacks/Death%20By%20Wild%20Boar.pdf | journal = Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 89\u201391 | doi=10.1016/j.jcfm.2005.08.007| pmid = 16263321 }}</ref><ref name=gunduz2007>{{cite journal | last1 = Gunduz | first1 = A. |display-authors=etal | year = 2007 | title = Wild Boar Attacks | url = http://www.phossil.com/thom/4th%20July%20Hog/Wild%20Boar%20Attacks/Wild%20Boar%20Attack%20III.pdf | journal = Wilderness and Environmental Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 117\u2013119 | doi=10.1580/06-weme-cr-033r1.1 | pmid=17590063}}</ref>\n\nBoar attacks on humans have been documented since the [[Stone Age]], with one of the oldest depictions being a cave painting in [[Bhimbetaka]], [[India]]. The Romans and Ancient Greeks wrote of these attacks ([[Odysseus]] was wounded by a boar and [[Adonis]] was killed by one). A 2012 study compiling recorded attacks from 1825\u20132012 found accounts of 665 human victims of both wild boars and feral pigs, with the majority (19%) of attacks in the animal's native range occurring in India. Most of the attacks occurred in rural areas during the winter months in non-hunting contexts and were committed by solitary males.<ref name=mayer2013>Mayer, John J.

The trunk is short and robust, while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped. The region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump and the neck is short and thick to the point of being nearly immobile. The animal's head is very large, taking up to one-third of the body's entire length.<ref name=heptner1988 /> The structure of the head is well suited for digging.

The middle hooves are larger and more elongated than the lateral ones and are capable of quick movements.<ref name=heptner1988 /> The animal can run at a maximum speed of 40&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph) and jump at a height of {{convert|140|-|150|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=baskin2003 />\n\n[[Sexual dimorphism]] is very pronounced in the species, with males being typically 5\u201310% larger and 20\u201330% heavier than females. Males also sport a mane running down the back, which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter.<ref name=\"marsan26\">{{Harvnb|Marsan|Mattioli|2013|pp=26}}</ref> The canine teeth are also much more prominent in males and grow throughout life. The upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life, though they gradually curve upwards. The lower canines are much sharper and longer, with the exposed parts measuring {{convert|10|-|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. In the breeding period, males develop a coating of [[subcutaneous tissue]], which may be {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, extending from the shoulder blades to the rump, thus protecting vital organs during fights. Males sport a roughly egg-sized sack near the opening of the penis, which collects urine and emits a sharp odour. The function of this sack is not fully understood.<ref name=heptner1988 />\n[[File:PigSkelLyd2.png|thumb|Skeleton, as illustrated by [[Richard Lydekker]].]]\n[[File:Hoffmann, Hans - A Wild Boar Piglet - 1578.jpg|thumb|A European wild boar piglet, painted by [[Hans Hoffmann (painter)|Hans Hoffman]] in 1578. Note the stripes, a characteristic feature of piglets.]]\nAdult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors; boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water. In most of [[Europe]], males average {{convert|75|-|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight, {{convert|75|-|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height and {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} in body length, whereas females average {{convert|60|-|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight, {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height and {{convert|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} in body length.

In [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], the largest males weigh {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. In Northeastern Asia, large males can reach [[brown bear]]-like sizes, weighing {{convert|270|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and measuring {{convert|110|-|118|cm|in|abbr=on}} in shoulder height.

The length of these bristles varies along the body, with the shortest being around the face and limbs and the longest running along the back. These back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males and stand erect when the animal is agitated. Colour is highly variable; specimens around [[Lake Balkhash]] are very lightly coloured, and can even be white, while some boars from [[Belarus]] and Ussuriland can be black.

Prior to mating, the males develop their subcutaneous armour in preparation for confronting rivals. The [[testicles]] double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid. Once ready to reproduce, males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows, eating little on the way. Once a sounder has been located, the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows.

In some jurisdictions, it is illegal to import, breed, release, possess, sell, distribute, trade, transport, hunt, or trap Eurasian boars. Hunting and trapping is done systematically, to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars, which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/70843.html|title=Eurasian Boar - NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== History ====\nWhile domestic pigs, both captive and feral (popularly termed \"[[Feral pig|razorback]]s\"), have been in North America since the earliest days of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]], pure wild boars were not introduced into the New World until the 19th century. The suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowners as big game animals. The initial introductions took place in fenced enclosures, though several escapes occurred, with the escapees sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig populations.\n\nThe first of these introductions occurred in [[New Hampshire]] in 1890. Thirteen wild boars from Germany were purchased by [[Austin Corbin]] from [[Carl Hagenbeck]] and released into a {{convert|9500|ha|acre|adj=on}} game preserve in [[Sullivan County, New Hampshire|Sullivan County]]. Several of these boars escaped, though they were quickly hunted down by locals. Two further introductions were made from the original stocking, with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve's fencing. These escapees have ranged widely, with some specimens having been observed crossing into [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"mayer2009\">Mayer, J. J. et al.

Several specimens escaped six years later, dispersing into the [[William C. Whitney Wilderness Area]], with their descendants surviving for at least 20 years.<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nThe most extensive boar introduction in the US took place in western [[North Carolina]] in 1912, when 13 boars of undetermined European origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a game preserve in [[Hooper Bald]], [[Graham County, North Carolina|Graham County]]. Most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade, until a large-scale hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape. Some of the boars migrated to [[Tennessee]], where they intermixed with both free-ranging and feral pigs in the area. In 1924, a dozen Hooper Bald wild pigs were shipped to [[California]] and released in a property between [[Carmel River|Carmel Valley]] and the [[Los Padres National Forest]]. These hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state, as well as in other states like [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nSeveral wild boars from [[Leon Springs, Texas|Leon Springs]] and the [[San Antonio Zoo and Aquarium|San Antonio]], [[Saint Louis Zoo|Saint Louis]] and [[San Diego Zoo]]s were released in the Powder Horn Ranch in [[Calhoun County, Texas|Calhoun County]], Texas, in 1939. These specimens escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal areas, with some crossing the [[Espiritu Santo Bay]] and colonizing [[Matagorda Island]]. Descendants of the Powder Horn Ranch boars were later released onto [[San Jos\u00e9 Island (Texas)|San Jos\u00e9 Island]] and the coast of [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]], Louisiana.<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nWild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the [[Edwards Plateau]] in the 1940s, only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig populations, later spreading into neighboring counties.<ref name=\"mayer2009\" />\n\nStarting in the mid-1980s, several boars purchased from the San Diego Zoo and [[Tierpark Berlin]] were released into the United States. A decade later, more specimens from farms in [[Canada]] and Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest were let loose.

This theme also occurs in [[Irish mythology|Irish]] and [[Egyptian mythology]], where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of October, therefore autumn. This association likely arose from aspects of the boar's actual nature. Its dark colour was linked to the night, while its solitary habits, proclivity to consume crops and nocturnal nature were associated with evil.<ref name=\"scheggi14\">{{Harvnb|Scheggi|1999|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> The [[Origin myth|foundation myth]] of [[Ephesus]] has the city being built over the site where Prince Androklos of [[Athens]] killed a boar.<ref name=\"scheggi16\">{{Harvnb|Scheggi|1999|pp=16}}</ref> Boars were frequently depicted on Greek funerary monuments alongside [[lion]]s, representing gallant losers who have finally met their match, as opposed to victorious hunters as lions are.

According to [[Tacitus]], the [[Baltic people|Baltic]] [[Aesti]] featured boars on their helmets and may have also worn boar masks (see for example the [[Guilden Morden boar]]). The boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the [[Celts]], who considered them to be their most important sacred animal. Some [[Celtic deities]] linked to boars include [[Moccus]] and [[Veteris]].

Among Japanese hunters, the boar's courage and defiance is a source of admiration and it is not uncommon for hunters and [[mountain people]] to name their sons after the animal ''inoshishi'' (\u732a). Boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity; in some regions, it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women, and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boar hunting.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] inherited this tradition, with one of its first practitioners being [[Scipio Aemilianus]]. Boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the 3rd century BC as preparation for manhood and battle. A typical Roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large nets, then flushing the boar with dogs and immobilizing it with smaller nets. The animal would then be dispatched with a ''venabulum'', a short [[spear]] with a [[crossguard]] at the base of the blade. More than their Greek predecessors, the Romans extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture. With the ascension of [[Constantine the Great]], boar hunting took on Christian allegorical themes, with the animal being portrayed as a \"black beast\" analogous to the dragon of [[Saint George and the Dragon|Saint George]]. Boar hunting continued after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], though the Germanic tribes considered the [[red deer]] to be a more noble and worthy quarry. The post-Roman nobility hunted boar as their predecessors did, but primarily as training for battle rather than sport. It was not uncommon for medieval hunters to deliberately hunt boars during the breeding season, when the animals were more aggressive. During the [[Renaissance]], when [[deforestation]] and the introduction of [[firearm]]s reduced boar numbers, boarhunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility, one of many charges brought up against the rich during the [[German Peasants' War]] and the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"scheggi9\">{{Harvnb|Scheggi|1999|pp=9\u201358}}</ref> During the mid-20th century, 7,000\u20138,000 boars were caught in the Caucasus, 6,000\u20137,000 in Kazakhstan and about 5,000 in Central Asia during the [[Soviet]] period, primarily through use of dogs and beats.<ref name=heptner1988 /> In Nepal, farmers and poachers eliminate boars by baiting balls of wheat flour containing explosives with kerosene oil, with the animals' chewing motions triggering the devices.<ref>Shreshta, Tej Kumar (1997).

Although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth, they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as [[European chafer|June bugs]] under control.<ref name=heptner1988 /> The growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food. As in natural conditions, sounders in peri-urban areas are matriarchal, though males tend to be much less represented and adults of both sexes can be up to 35% heavier than their forest-dwelling counterparts. As of 2010, at least 44 cities in 15 countries have experienced problems of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar.<ref name=cahill2012>{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = S. | last2 = Llimona | first2 = F. | last3 = Caba\u00f1eros | first3 = L. | last4 = Calomardo | first4 = F. | year = 2012 | title = Characteristics of wild boar (''Sus scrofa'') habituation to urban areas in the Collserola Natural Park (Barcelona) and comparison with other locations | url = http://abc.museucienciesjournals.cat/files/ABC_35-2_pp_221-233.pdf | journal = Animal Biodiversity and Conservation | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 221\u2013233 }}</ref>\n\n=== Attacks on humans ===\n[[File:Rock Shelter 15, Bhimbetka 02.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a stylised boar attacking a man, [[Bhimbetaka]], [[India]]]]\nActual attacks on humans are rare, but can be serious, resulting in penetrating injuries to the lower part of the body. They generally occur during the boars' [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] season from November to January, in agricultural areas bordering forests or on paths leading through forests. The animal typically attacks by charging and pointing its tusks towards the intended victim, with most injuries occurring on the [[thigh]] region. Once the initial attack is over, the boar steps back, takes position and attacks again if the victim is still moving, only ending once the victim is completely incapacitated.<ref name=manipady2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Manipady | first1 = S. |display-authors=etal | year = 2006 | title = Death by attack from a wild boar | url = http://www.phossil.com/thom/4th%20July%20Hog/Wild%20Boar%20Attacks/Death%20By%20Wild%20Boar.pdf | journal = Journal of Clinical Forensic Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 89\u201391 | doi=10.1016/j.jcfm.2005.08.007| pmid = 16263321 }}</ref><ref name=gunduz2007>{{cite journal | last1 = Gunduz | first1 = A. |display-authors=etal | year = 2007 | title = Wild Boar Attacks | url = http://www.phossil.com/thom/4th%20July%20Hog/Wild%20Boar%20Attacks/Wild%20Boar%20Attack%20III.pdf | journal = Wilderness and Environmental Medicine | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 117\u2013119 | doi=10.1580/06-weme-cr-033r1.1 | pmid=17590063}}</ref>\n\nBoar attacks on humans have been documented since the [[Stone Age]], with one of the oldest depictions being a cave painting in [[Bhimbetaka]], [[India]]. The Romans and Ancient Greeks wrote of these attacks ([[Odysseus]] was wounded by a boar and [[Adonis]] was killed by one). A 2012 study compiling recorded attacks from 1825\u20132012 found accounts of 665 human victims of both wild boars and feral pigs, with the majority (19%) of attacks in the animal's native range occurring in India. Most of the attacks occurred in rural areas during the winter months in non-hunting contexts and were committed by solitary males.<ref name=mayer2013>Mayer, John J.

After returning to Finland, he served in the Finnish army and became a national hero in the [[Battle of Kollaa]] during the [[Winter War]] with the [[Soviet Union]]. He was wounded three times during [[World War II]].\n\n==Early life==\nJuutilainen was born in [[Sortavala]] on 18 October 1904. His brother was [[flying ace]] [[Ilmari Juutilainen]].\n\n==Career==\n=== French Foreign Legion ===\nOn 20 June 1930, Juutilainen travelled to [[France]] and joined the [[French Foreign Legion]]. He was transferred to [[Fort St. Nicolas]] in [[Southern France]], near [[Marseille]], and from there to [[Oran]] in [[Algeria]]. He spent time in a Foreign Legion training camp in the town of [[Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s]]. From there he was transferred to [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] and fought in several battles against the [[berbers|berber]] [[Rebellion|rebels]] in the [[Atlas Mountains]]. Because of his service in Morocco, he was called \"The Terror of Morocco\" by Finnish troops.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Marokon Kauhu|trans-title=Terror of Morocco|last=M\u00e4kel\u00e4|first=Jukka L.|publisher=W. S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m|location=Porvoo|language=Finnish|year=1969|oclc=3935082}}</ref>\n\nThe war in the Atlas Mountains was long, and in 1931 the berber offensive surrendered.{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} Juutilainen returned to Finland on 20 June 1935, by which that time the southern part of [[Morocco]] was under French protectorate.\n\n=== The Winter War ===\nIn November 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] attacked Finland, starting the Winter War.

{"title_page": "Quantum field theory in curved spacetime", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|Physical theories}}\n{{quantum field theory}}\n\nIn [[particle physics]], '''quantum field theory in curved spacetime''' is an extension of standard, [[Minkowski space]] [[quantum field theory]] to [[curved space]]time. A general prediction of this theory is that particles can be created by time-dependent [[gravitational field]]s (multi[[graviton]] [[pair production]]), or by time-independent gravitational fields that contain horizons.\n\n==Description==\n\nInteresting new phenomena occur; owing to the [[equivalence principle]] the quantization procedure locally resembles that of [[normal coordinates]] where the [[affine connection]] at the origin is set to zero and a nonzero [[Riemann tensor]] in general once the proper ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]]) formalism is chosen; however, even in [[flat spacetime]] quantum field theory, the number of particles is not well-defined locally. For non-zero [[cosmological constant]]s, on curved spacetimes quantum fields lose their interpretation as asymptotic [[Elementary particle|particle]]s. Only in certain situations, such as in asymptotically flat spacetimes (zero [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Curvature#Curvature_of_space|curvature]]), can the notion of incoming and outgoing particle be recovered, thus enabling one to define an [[S-matrix]]. Even then, as in flat spacetime, the asymptotic particle interpretation depends on the observer (i.e., different observers may measure different numbers of [[asymptotic particle]]s on a given spacetime).\n\nAnother observation is that unless the background [[metric tensor]] has a global timelike [[Killing vector]], there is no way to define a [[vacuum]] or ground state canonically. The concept of a vacuum is not invariant under [[diffeomorphism]]s. This is because a mode decomposition of a field into positive and negative frequency modes is not invariant under diffeomorphisms. If ''t''&prime;(''t'') is a diffeomorphism, in general, the [[Fourier transform]] of exp[''ikt''&prime;(''t'')] will contain negative frequencies even if ''k'' > 0. [[Creation and annihilation operators|Creation operators]] correspond to positive frequencies, while [[Creation and annihilation operators|annihilation operators]] correspond to negative frequencies. This is why a state which looks like a vacuum to one observer cannot look like a vacuum state to another observer; it could even appear as a [[heat bath]] under suitable hypotheses.\n\nSince the end of the eighties, the [[local quantum field theory]] approach due to [[Rudolf Haag]] and [[Daniel Kastler]] has been implemented in order to include an algebraic version of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Indeed, the viewpoint of local quantum physics is suitable to generalize the [[renormalization]] procedure to the theory of quantum fields developed on curved backgrounds. Several rigorous results concerning QFT in the presence of a black hole have been obtained. In particular the algebraic approach allows one to deal with the problems, above mentioned, arising from the absence of a preferred reference vacuum state, the absence of a natural notion of particle and the appearance of unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables.

A general prediction of this theory is that particles can be created by time-dependent [[gravitational field]]s (multi[[graviton]] [[pair production]]), or by time-independent gravitational fields that contain horizons.\n\n==Description==\n\nInteresting new phenomena occur; owing to the [[equivalence principle]] the quantization procedure locally resembles that of [[normal coordinates]] where the [[affine connection]] at the origin is set to zero and a nonzero [[Riemann tensor]] in general once the proper ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]]) formalism is chosen; however, even in [[flat spacetime]] quantum field theory, the number of particles is not well-defined locally. For non-zero [[cosmological constant]]s, on curved spacetimes quantum fields lose their interpretation as asymptotic [[Elementary particle|particle]]s. Only in certain situations, such as in asymptotically flat spacetimes (zero [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Curvature#Curvature_of_space|curvature]]), can the notion of incoming and outgoing particle be recovered, thus enabling one to define an [[S-matrix]]. Even then, as in flat spacetime, the asymptotic particle interpretation depends on the observer (i.e., different observers may measure different numbers of [[asymptotic particle]]s on a given spacetime).\n\nAnother observation is that unless the background [[metric tensor]] has a global timelike [[Killing vector]], there is no way to define a [[vacuum]] or ground state canonically. The concept of a vacuum is not invariant under [[diffeomorphism]]s. This is because a mode decomposition of a field into positive and negative frequency modes is not invariant under diffeomorphisms. If ''t''&prime;(''t'') is a diffeomorphism, in general, the [[Fourier transform]] of exp[''ikt''&prime;(''t'')] will contain negative frequencies even if ''k'' > 0. [[Creation and annihilation operators|Creation operators]] correspond to positive frequencies, while [[Creation and annihilation operators|annihilation operators]] correspond to negative frequencies. This is why a state which looks like a vacuum to one observer cannot look like a vacuum state to another observer; it could even appear as a [[heat bath]] under suitable hypotheses.\n\nSince the end of the eighties, the [[local quantum field theory]] approach due to [[Rudolf Haag]] and [[Daniel Kastler]] has been implemented in order to include an algebraic version of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Indeed, the viewpoint of local quantum physics is suitable to generalize the [[renormalization]] procedure to the theory of quantum fields developed on curved backgrounds. Several rigorous results concerning QFT in the presence of a black hole have been obtained. In particular the algebraic approach allows one to deal with the problems, above mentioned, arising from the absence of a preferred reference vacuum state, the absence of a natural notion of particle and the appearance of unitarily inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables.

{"title_page": "List of mustelids", "text_new": "{{short description|Species in mammal family Mustelidae}}\n[[File:Mustelidae-01.jpg|thumb|right|6 of the 23 extant mustelid genera left-to-right, top-to-bottom: ''[[Martes]]'', ''[[Meles (genus)|Meles]]'', ''[[Lutra]]'', ''[[Gulo]]'', ''[[Mustela]]'', and ''[[Mellivora]]'']]\n[[Mustelidae]] is a [[family (biology)|family]] of [[mammal]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]], which includes [[weasel]]s, [[badger]]s, [[otter]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[marten]]s, [[mink]]s, and [[wolverine]]s, and many other [[extant taxon|extant]] and [[extinction|extinct]] mammals. A member of this family is called a mustelid; Mustelidae is the largest family in Carnivora, and its extant species are divided into eight [[subfamily|subfamilies]]. They are found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, and are a diverse family; sizes range, including tails, from the widespread 17&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;in) [[least weasel]] to the 1.8-meter (6&nbsp;ft) [[giant otter]] of Amazonian South America. Habitats vary widely as well, from the [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] [[marten]] to the tunnel-dwelling [[European badger]] to the [[marine ecosystem|marine]] [[sea otter]]. Population sizes are largely unknown, though one species, the [[sea mink]], was hunted to extinction in 1894 and several other species are [[endangered species|endangered]]. The [[ferret]] subspecies of the [[European polecat]] has been domesticated, as have some populations of the South American [[tayra]] species. Mustelidae is one of the oldest families in Carnivora; early mustelids first appeared around 28\u201333 million years ago.<ref name=\"MustelidaeDiversity\"/>\n\nThe 23 [[genus|genera]] and 59 species of Mustelidae are split into 8 subfamilies: [[Guloninae]], martens and wolverines; [[Helictidinae]], ferret-badgers; [[Ictonychinae]], African polecats and [[grison]]s; [[Lutrinae]], otters; [[Melinae]], Eurasian badgers; [[Mellivorinae]], the [[honey badger]]; [[Mustelinae]], weasels and minks; and [[Taxidiinae]], the [[American badger]]. In addition to the extant subfamilies, Mustelidae comprises three extinct subfamilies designated as Leptarctinae, Mustelavinae, and [[Oligobuninae]]. Extinct species have also been placed into all of the extant subfamilies besides Helictidinae, in both extant and extinct genera; around 200 extinct Mustelidae species have been found, as well as fossil genera not given a species name, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed.\n\n==Conventions==\n{{IUCN statuses|ex=1|ew=0|en=7|vu=6|nt=6|lc=37|dd=1|ne=0}}\n\nConservation status codes listed follow the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]]. Range maps are provided wherever possible; if a range map is not available, a description of the mustelid's range is provided. Ranges are based on the IUCN red list for that species unless otherwise noted. All extinct species or subspecies listed alongside extant species went extinct after 1500 CE, and are indicated by a [[Dagger (typography)|dagger]] symbol \"{{dagger|alt=Extinct}}\". Population figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\n==Classification==\nThe family Mustelidae consists of 59 extant species belonging to 23 genera and divided into hundreds of extant subspecies,<!-- A monotypic species counts as 1 subspecies --> as well the extinct [[sea mink]], which is the only mustelid species to go extinct since prehistoric times. This does not include hybrid species or extinct prehistoric species. Modern molecular studies indicate that the 23 genera can be grouped into 8 [[subfamily|subfamilies]], though some prior classification schemes divided the family solely between the aquatic otters and all other species.\n\n{{col-float}}\n{{col-float-break|width=50%}}\n'''Subfamily [[Guloninae]]''' (Martens and wolverines)\n*Genus ''[[Eira (genus)|Eira]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Gulo]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Martes]]'': seven species\n*Genus ''[[Pekania]]'': one species\n'''Subfamily [[Helictidinae]]''' (Ferret-badgers)\n*Genus ''[[Melogale]]'': five species\n'''Subfamily [[Ictonychinae]]''' (African polecats and grisons)\n*Genus ''[[Galictis]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Ictonyx]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Lyncodon]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Poecilogale]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Vormela]]'': one species\n'''Subfamily [[Lutrinae]]''' (Otters)\n*Genus ''[[Aonyx]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Enhydra]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Lontra]]'': four species\n*Genus ''[[Lutra]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Hydrictis]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Lutrogale]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Pteronura]]'': one species\n{{col-float-break|width=50%}}\n'''Subfamily [[Melinae]]''' (Eurasian badgers)\n*Genus ''[[Arctonyx]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Meles (genus)|Meles]]'': three species\n'''Subfamily [[Mellivorinae]]''' (Honey badger)\n*Genus ''[[Mellivora]]'': one species\n'''Subfamily [[Mustelinae]]''' (Weasels and minks)\n*Genus ''[[Mustela]]'': seventeen species\n*Genus ''[[Neovison]]'': two species\n'''Subfamily [[Taxidiinae]]''' (American badger)\n*Genus ''[[Taxidea]]'': one species\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n==Mustelids==\nThe following classification is based on the taxonomy described by ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' (2005), with augmentation by generally accepted proposals made since using [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic analysis]]; this includes reclassifying [[Guloninae]], [[Helictidinae]], [[Ictonychinae]], [[Melinae]], [[Mellivorinae]], and [[Taxidiinae]] as subfamilies rather than as part of a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group with [[Mustelinae]].

A member of this family is called a mustelid; Mustelidae is the largest family in Carnivora, and its extant species are divided into eight [[subfamily|subfamilies]]. They are found on all continents except Antarctica and Australia, and are a diverse family; sizes range, including tails, from the widespread 17&nbsp;cm (7&nbsp;in) [[least weasel]] to the 1.8-meter (6&nbsp;ft) [[giant otter]] of Amazonian South America. Habitats vary widely as well, from the [[arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] [[marten]] to the tunnel-dwelling [[European badger]] to the [[marine ecosystem|marine]] [[sea otter]]. Population sizes are largely unknown, though one species, the [[sea mink]], was hunted to extinction in 1894 and several other species are [[endangered species|endangered]]. The [[ferret]] subspecies of the [[European polecat]] has been domesticated, as have some populations of the South American [[tayra]] species. Mustelidae is one of the oldest families in Carnivora; early mustelids first appeared around 28\u201333 million years ago.<ref name=\"MustelidaeDiversity\"/>\n\nThe 23 [[genus|genera]] and 59 species of Mustelidae are split into 8 subfamilies: [[Guloninae]], martens and wolverines; [[Helictidinae]], ferret-badgers; [[Ictonychinae]], African polecats and [[grison]]s; [[Lutrinae]], otters; [[Melinae]], Eurasian badgers; [[Mellivorinae]], the [[honey badger]]; [[Mustelinae]], weasels and minks; and [[Taxidiinae]], the [[American badger]]. In addition to the extant subfamilies, Mustelidae comprises three extinct subfamilies designated as Leptarctinae, Mustelavinae, and [[Oligobuninae]]. Extinct species have also been placed into all of the extant subfamilies besides Helictidinae, in both extant and extinct genera; around 200 extinct Mustelidae species have been found, as well as fossil genera not given a species name, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed.\n\n==Conventions==\n{{IUCN statuses|ex=1|ew=0|en=7|vu=6|nt=6|lc=37|dd=1|ne=0}}\n\nConservation status codes listed follow the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]]. Range maps are provided wherever possible; if a range map is not available, a description of the mustelid's range is provided. Ranges are based on the IUCN red list for that species unless otherwise noted. All extinct species or subspecies listed alongside extant species went extinct after 1500 CE, and are indicated by a [[Dagger (typography)|dagger]] symbol \"{{dagger|alt=Extinct}}\". Population figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.\n\n==Classification==\nThe family Mustelidae consists of 59 extant species belonging to 23 genera and divided into hundreds of extant subspecies,<!-- A monotypic species counts as 1 subspecies --> as well the extinct [[sea mink]], which is the only mustelid species to go extinct since prehistoric times. This does not include hybrid species or extinct prehistoric species. Modern molecular studies indicate that the 23 genera can be grouped into 8 [[subfamily|subfamilies]], though some prior classification schemes divided the family solely between the aquatic otters and all other species.\n\n{{col-float}}\n{{col-float-break|width=50%}}\n'''Subfamily [[Guloninae]]''' (Martens and wolverines)\n*Genus ''[[Eira (genus)|Eira]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Gulo]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Martes]]'': seven species\n*Genus ''[[Pekania]]'': one species\n'''Subfamily [[Helictidinae]]''' (Ferret-badgers)\n*Genus ''[[Melogale]]'': five species\n'''Subfamily [[Ictonychinae]]''' (African polecats and grisons)\n*Genus ''[[Galictis]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Ictonyx]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Lyncodon]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Poecilogale]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Vormela]]'': one species\n'''Subfamily [[Lutrinae]]''' (Otters)\n*Genus ''[[Aonyx]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Enhydra]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Lontra]]'': four species\n*Genus ''[[Lutra]]'': two species\n*Genus ''[[Hydrictis]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Lutrogale]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Pteronura]]'': one species\n{{col-float-break|width=50%}}\n'''Subfamily [[Melinae]]''' (Eurasian badgers)\n*Genus ''[[Arctonyx]]'': one species\n*Genus ''[[Meles (genus)|Meles]]'': three species\n'''Subfamily [[Mellivorinae]]''' (Honey badger)\n*Genus ''[[Mellivora]]'': one species\n'''Subfamily [[Mustelinae]]''' (Weasels and minks)\n*Genus ''[[Mustela]]'': seventeen species\n*Genus ''[[Neovison]]'': two species\n'''Subfamily [[Taxidiinae]]''' (American badger)\n*Genus ''[[Taxidea]]'': one species\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n==Mustelids==\nThe following classification is based on the taxonomy described by ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' (2005), with augmentation by generally accepted proposals made since using [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic analysis]]; this includes reclassifying [[Guloninae]], [[Helictidinae]], [[Ictonychinae]], [[Melinae]], [[Mellivorinae]], and [[Taxidiinae]] as subfamilies rather than as part of a [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] group with [[Mustelinae]].

Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers around 1894\u20131895. He received the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for his radio work.

Since the length of the antenna is one half the [[wavelength]] of the wave, the oscillating field induces [[standing wave]]s of voltage ''(<span style=\"color:red;\">V, represented by red band</span>)'' and current in the rods. The oscillating currents ''(black arrows)'' flow down the transmission line and through the receiver (represented by the resistance ''R'').]]\n\nRadio waves are radiated by [[electric charge]]s when they are [[acceleration|accelerated]].  They are produced artificially by time-varying [[electric current]]s, consisting of [[electron]]s flowing back and forth in a specially-shaped metal conductor called an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. An electronic device called a [[radio transmitter]] applies oscillating electric current to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the power as radio waves.  They are received by another antenna attached to a [[radio receiver]].  When they strike the receiving antenna they push the electrons in the metal back and forth, creating tiny oscillating currents which are detected by the receiver. \n\n==Speed, wavelength, and frequency==\nRadio waves in a vacuum travel at the [[speed of light]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1728.org/freqwave.htm|title=Electromagnetic Frequency, Wavelength and Energy ''Ultra'' Calculator|website=1728.org|publisher=1728 Software Systems|accessdate=15 Jan 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves|title=How Radio Waves Are Produced|publisher=[[National Radio Astronomy Observatory|NRAO]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328011153/http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/learn/radioastronomy/radiowaves|archive-date=28 Mar 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=15 Jan 2018}}</ref> When passing through a material medium, they are slowed according to that object's [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] and [[permittivity]].

Radio waves passing through different environments experience [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[diffraction]], and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].  Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, making certain [[radio band]]s more useful for specific purposes than others.  Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:<ref name=\"Seybold\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&pg=PA6|title=Introduction to RF Propagation|last1=Seybold|first1=John S.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=|isbn=0471743682|location=|pages=3\u201310|chapter=1.2 Modes of Propagation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n*''[[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]]:'' This refers to radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.  It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions.  This is the only method of propagation possible at frequencies above 30&nbsp;MHz.  On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual [[horizon]] to about 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi).   This is the method used by [[cell phone]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[radar]].  By using [[dish antenna]]s to transmit beams of microwaves, point-to-point [[microwave radio relay|microwave relay]] links transmit telephone and television signals over long distances up to the visual horizon.   [[satellite ground station|Ground stations]] can communicate with [[artificial satellite|satellites]] and spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.\n**''Indirect propagation'': Radio waves can reach points beyond the line-of-sight by ''[[diffraction]]'' and ''reflection''.<ref name=\"Seybold\" />  Diffraction allows a radio wave to bend around obstructions such as a building edge, a vehicle, or a turn in a hall.  Radio waves also partially reflect from surfaces such as walls, floors, ceilings, vehicles and the ground.  These propagation methods occur in short range radio communication systems such as [[cell phone]]s, [[cordless phone]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s, and [[wireless network]]s.  A drawback of this mode is ''[[multipath propagation]]'', in which radio waves travel from the transmitting to the receiving antenna via multiple paths.  The waves [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]], often causing [[fading]] and other reception problems.\n*''[[Ground wave]]s:'' At lower frequencies below 2&nbsp;MHz, in the [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] bands, due to diffraction [[vertical polarization|vertically polarized]] radio waves can bend over hills and mountains, and propagate beyond the horizon, traveling as [[surface wave]]s which follow the contour of the Earth.   This allows mediumwave and longwave broadcasting stations to have coverage areas beyond the horizon, out to hundreds of miles.  As the frequency drops, the losses decrease and the achievable range increases.  Military [[very low frequency]] (VLF) and [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) communication systems can communicate over most of the Earth, and with submarines hundreds of feet underwater.\n*''[[Skywave]]s:'' At [[medium wave]] and [[shortwave]] wavelengths, radio waves reflect off conductive layers of charged particles ([[ions]]) in a part of the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]].   So radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon;  this is called \"skip\" or \"skywave\" propagation.  By using multiple skips communication at intercontinental distances can be achieved.  Skywave propagation is variable and dependent on atmospheric conditions; it is most reliable at night and in the winter. Widely used during the first half of the 20th century, due to its unreliability skywave communication has mostly been abandoned.    Remaining uses are by military [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon (OTH) radar]] systems, by some automated systems, by [[radio amateur]]s, and by shortwave broadcasting stations to broadcast to other countries.\n\n==Radio communication==\n{{main|Radio}}\nIn [[radio communication]] systems, information is carried across space using radio waves.  At the sending end, the information to be sent, in the form of a time-varying electrical signal, is applied to a [[radio transmitter]].<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\">{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio8.htm|title=How Radio Works|last=Brain|first=M|date=7 Dec 2000|website=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=11 Sep 2009}}</ref>  The information signal can be an [[audio signal]] representing sound from a [[microphone]], a [[video signal]] representing moving images from a [[video camera]], or a [[digital signal]] representing data from a [[computer]].  In the transmitter, an [[electronic oscillator]] generates an [[alternating current]] oscillating at a [[radio frequency]], called the ''[[carrier wave]]'' because it serves to \"carry\" the information through the air.  The information signal is used to [[modulation|modulate]] the carrier, altering some aspect of it, \"piggybacking\" the information on the carrier.  The modulated carrier is amplified and applied to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]].  The oscillating current pushes the [[electron]]s in the antenna back and forth, creating oscillating [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s, which radiate the energy away from the antenna as radio waves.  The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\n\nAt the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  This voltage is applied to the [[radio receiver]], which extracts the information signal.  The receiver first uses a [[bandpass filter]] to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then [[amplifier|amplifies]] the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a [[demodulator]].  The recovered signal is sent to a [[loudspeaker]] or [[earphone]] to produce sound, or a television [[Display device|display screen]] to produce a visible image, or other devices.  A digital data signal is applied to a [[computer]] or [[microprocessor]], which interacts with a human user.\n\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other.  They can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words each transmitter has a different [[frequency]], measured in [[kilohertz]] (kHz), [[megahertz]] (MHz) or [[gigahertz]] (GHz).  The [[bandpass filter]] in the receiver consists of a [[tuned circuit]] which acts like a [[resonator]], similarly to a tuning fork.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  It has a natural [[resonant frequency]] at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station.  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\n\n==Biological and environmental effects==\nRadio waves are ''[[ionizing radiation|nonionizing radiation]]'', which means they do not have enough energy to separate [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, [[ionization|ionizing]] them, or break [[chemical bond]]s, causing chemical reactions or [[DNA damage]].  The main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them, similarly to the [[infrared]] waves radiated by sources of heat such as a [[space heater]] or wood fire.  The oscillating electric field of the wave causes [[polar molecule]]s to vibrate back and forth, increasing the temperature; this is how a [[microwave oven]] cooks food.  However, unlike infrared waves, which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating, radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues.   The depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency, and also depends on the material's [[resistivity]] and [[permittivity]]; it is given by a parameter called the ''[[skin depth]]'' of the material, which is the depth within which 63% of the energy is deposited.   For example, the 2.45&nbsp;GHz radio waves (microwaves) in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately 2.5 to 3.8&nbsp;cm (1 to 1.5 inches).   Radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of [[diathermy]] for deep heating of body tissue, to promote increased blood flow and healing.  More recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in [[hyperthermia]] treatment and to kill cancer cells.  Looking into a source of radio waves at close range, such as the [[waveguide]] of a working radio transmitter, can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating. A strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause [[cataract]]s.<ref name=\"Kitchen\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc|url-access=registration|title=RF and Microwave Radiation Safety Handbook|last1=Kitchen|first1=Ronald|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750643552|edition=2nd|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc/page/64 64]\u201365|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"VanderVorst\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV3FPLJoyzMC&pg=PA121|title=RF/Microwave Interaction with Biological Tissues|last1=VanderVorst|first1=Andr\u00e9|last2=Rosen|first2=Arye|last3=Kotsuka|first3=Youji|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=0471752045|location=|pages=121\u2013122|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Graf\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc_ACUbCqqQC&pg=PA234|title=Build Your Own Low-power Transmitters: Projects for the Electronics Experimenter|last1=Graf|first1=Rudolf F.|last2=Sheets|first2=William|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750672447|location=|pages=234|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Elder\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKIKAQAAMAAJ&pg=SA5-PA116|title=Biological Effects of Radiofrequency Radiation|last1=Elder|first1=Joe Allen|last2=Cahill|first2=Daniel F.|date=1984|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5.116\u20135.119|chapter=Biological Effects of RF Radiation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Hitchcock\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOMWHnZ4h_cC&pg=PA178|title=Radio-Frequency and ELF Electromagnetic Energies: A Handbook for Health Professionals|last1=Hitchcock|first1=R.

One can speak of an [[electromagnetic field]], and these units are used to provide information about the levels of electric and magnetic [[field strength]] at a measurement location.\n\nAnother commonly used unit for characterizing an RF electromagnetic field is ''power density''. Power density is most accurately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from the RF emitter to be located in what is referred to as the [[far field]] zone of the radiation pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|title=Antenna & Tower Regulation Handbook|last=National Association of Broadcasters|date=1996|publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]], Science and Technology Department|isbn=9780893242367|pages=186|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501015942/https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|archivedate=1 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In closer proximity to the transmitter, i.e., in the \"near field\" zone, the physical relationships between the electric and magnetic components of the field can be complex, and it is best to use the field strength units discussed above.

Italian inventor [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers around 1894-1895. He received the 1909 [[Nobel Prize in physics]] for his radio work.

The oscillating currents ''(black arrows)'' flow down the transmission line and through the receiver (represented by the resistance ''R'').]]\n\nRadio waves are radiated by [[electric charge]]s when they are [[acceleration|accelerated]].  They are produced artificially by time-varying [[electric current]]s, consisting of [[electron]]s flowing back and forth in a specially-shaped metal conductor called an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. An electronic device called a [[radio transmitter]] applies oscillating electric current to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the power as radio waves.

Radio waves passing through different environments experience [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[diffraction]], and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]].  Different frequencies experience different combinations of these phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, making certain [[radio band]]s more useful for specific purposes than others.  Practical radio systems mainly use three different techniques of radio propagation to communicate:<ref name=\"Seybold\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&pg=PA6|title=Introduction to RF Propagation|last1=Seybold|first1=John S.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=|isbn=0471743682|location=|pages=3\u201310|chapter=1.2 Modes of Propagation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref>\n*''[[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]]:'' This refers to radio waves that travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.  It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings, foliage and other obstructions.  This is the only method of propagation possible at frequencies above 30&nbsp;MHz.  On the surface of the Earth, line of sight propagation is limited by the visual [[horizon]] to about 64&nbsp;km (40&nbsp;mi).   This is the method used by [[cell phone]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[television broadcasting]] and [[radar]].  By using [[dish antenna]]s to transmit beams of microwaves, point-to-point [[microwave radio relay|microwave relay]] links transmit telephone and television signals over long distances up to the visual horizon.   [[satellite ground station|Ground stations]] can communicate with [[artificial satellite|satellites]] and spacecraft billions of miles from Earth.\n**''Indirect propagation'': Radio waves can reach points beyond the line-of-sight by ''[[diffraction]]'' and ''reflection''.<ref name=\"Seybold\" />  Diffraction allows a radio wave to bend around obstructions such as a building edge, a vehicle, or a turn in a hall.  Radio waves also partially reflect from surfaces such as walls, floors, ceilings, vehicles and the ground.  These propagation methods occur in short range radio communication systems such as [[cell phone]]s, [[cordless phone]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s, and [[wireless network]]s.  A drawback of this mode is ''[[multipath propagation]]'', in which radio waves travel from the transmitting to the receiving antenna via multiple paths.  The waves [[interference (wave propagation)|interfere]], often causing [[fading]] and other reception problems.\n*''[[Ground wave]]s:'' At lower frequencies below 2&nbsp;MHz, in the [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] bands, due to diffraction [[vertical polarization|vertically polarized]] radio waves can bend over hills and mountains, and propagate beyond the horizon, traveling as [[surface wave]]s which follow the contour of the Earth.   This allows mediumwave and longwave broadcasting stations to have coverage areas beyond the horizon, out to hundreds of miles.  As the frequency drops, the losses decrease and the achievable range increases.  Military [[very low frequency]] (VLF) and [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) communication systems can communicate over most of the Earth, and with submarines hundreds of feet underwater.\n*''[[Skywave]]s:'' At [[medium wave]] and [[shortwave]] wavelengths, radio waves reflect off conductive layers of charged particles ([[ions]]) in a part of the atmosphere called the [[ionosphere]].   So radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon;  this is called \"skip\" or \"skywave\" propagation.  By using multiple skips communication at intercontinental distances can be achieved.  Skywave propagation is variable and dependent on atmospheric conditions; it is most reliable at night and in the winter. Widely used during the first half of the 20th century, due to its unreliability skywave communication has mostly been abandoned.    Remaining uses are by military [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon (OTH) radar]] systems, by some automated systems, by [[radio amateur]]s, and by shortwave broadcasting stations to broadcast to other countries.\n\n==Radio communication==\n{{main|Radio}}\nIn [[radio communication]] systems, information is carried across space using radio waves.

The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\n\nAt the receiver, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the incoming radio wave push the electrons in the receiving antenna back and forth, creating a tiny oscillating voltage which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  This voltage is applied to the [[radio receiver]], which extracts the information signal.  The receiver first uses a [[bandpass filter]] to separate the desired radio station's radio signal from all the other radio signals picked up by the antenna, then [[amplifier|amplifies]] the signal so it is stronger, then finally extracts the information-bearing modulation signal in a [[demodulator]].  The recovered signal is sent to a [[loudspeaker]] or [[earphone]] to produce sound, or a television [[Display device|display screen]] to produce a visible image, or other devices.  A digital data signal is applied to a [[computer]] or [[microprocessor]], which interacts with a human user.\n\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other.  They can be separated in the receiver because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words each transmitter has a different [[frequency]], measured in [[kilohertz]] (kHz), [[megahertz]] (MHz) or [[gigahertz]] (GHz).  The [[bandpass filter]] in the receiver consists of a [[tuned circuit]] which acts like a [[resonator]], similarly to a tuning fork.<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" />  It has a natural [[resonant frequency]] at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency is set equal to the frequency of the desired radio station.  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\n\n==Biological and environmental effects==\nRadio waves are ''[[ionizing radiation|nonionizing radiation]]'', which means they do not have enough energy to separate [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s, [[ionization|ionizing]] them, or break [[chemical bond]]s, causing chemical reactions or [[DNA damage]].  The main effect of absorption of radio waves by materials is to heat them, similarly to the [[infrared]] waves radiated by sources of heat such as a [[space heater]] or wood fire.  The oscillating electric field of the wave causes [[polar molecule]]s to vibrate back and forth, increasing the temperature; this is how a [[microwave oven]] cooks food.  However, unlike infrared waves, which are mainly absorbed at the surface of objects and cause surface heating, radio waves are able to penetrate the surface and deposit their energy inside materials and biological tissues.   The depth to which radio waves penetrate decreases with their frequency, and also depends on the material's [[resistivity]] and [[permittivity]]; it is given by a parameter called the ''[[skin depth]]'' of the material, which is the depth within which 63% of the energy is deposited.   For example, the 2.45&nbsp;GHz radio waves (microwaves) in a microwave oven penetrate most foods approximately 2.5 to 3.8&nbsp;cm (1 to 1.5 inches).   Radio waves have been applied to the body for 100 years in the medical therapy of [[diathermy]] for deep heating of body tissue, to promote increased blood flow and healing.  More recently they have been used to create higher temperatures in [[hyperthermia]] treatment and to kill cancer cells.  Looking into a source of radio waves at close range, such as the [[waveguide]] of a working radio transmitter, can cause damage to the lens of the eye by heating. A strong enough beam of radio waves can penetrate the eye and heat the lens enough to cause [[cataract]]s.<ref name=\"Kitchen\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc|url-access=registration|title=RF and Microwave Radiation Safety Handbook|last1=Kitchen|first1=Ronald|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750643552|edition=2nd|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rfmicrowaveradia0000kitc/page/64 64]\u201365|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"VanderVorst\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lV3FPLJoyzMC&pg=PA121|title=RF/Microwave Interaction with Biological Tissues|last1=VanderVorst|first1=Andr\u00e9|last2=Rosen|first2=Arye|last3=Kotsuka|first3=Youji|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=0471752045|location=|pages=121\u2013122|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Graf\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc_ACUbCqqQC&pg=PA234|title=Build Your Own Low-power Transmitters: Projects for the Electronics Experimenter|last1=Graf|first1=Rudolf F.|last2=Sheets|first2=William|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|year=|isbn=0750672447|location=|pages=234|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Elder\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKIKAQAAMAAJ&pg=SA5-PA116|title=Biological Effects of Radiofrequency Radiation|last1=Elder|first1=Joe Allen|last2=Cahill|first2=Daniel F.|date=1984|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]]|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5.116\u20135.119|chapter=Biological Effects of RF Radiation|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref><ref name=\"Hitchcock\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOMWHnZ4h_cC&pg=PA178|title=Radio-Frequency and ELF Electromagnetic Energies: A Handbook for Health Professionals|last1=Hitchcock|first1=R.

The unit ''volts per meter'' (V/m) is used for the electric component, and the unit ''amperes per meter'' (A/m) is used for the magnetic component. One can speak of an [[electromagnetic field]], and these units are used to provide information about the levels of electric and magnetic [[field strength]] at a measurement location.\n\nAnother commonly used unit for characterizing an RF electromagnetic field is ''power density''. Power density is most accurately used when the point of measurement is far enough away from the RF emitter to be located in what is referred to as the [[far field]] zone of the radiation pattern.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|title=Antenna & Tower Regulation Handbook|last=National Association of Broadcasters|date=1996|publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]], Science and Technology Department|isbn=9780893242367|pages=186|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501015942/https://books.google.com/books?id=5u_iAAAAMAAJ&q=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&dq=power+density+commonly+used+unit+for+characterizing+an+RF+electromagnetic+field+is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj967xl6fVAhVG0FQKHTgTDh0Q6AEILDAB|archivedate=1 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In closer proximity to the transmitter, i.e., in the \"near field\" zone, the physical relationships between the electric and magnetic components of the field can be complex, and it is best to use the field strength units discussed above. Power density is measured in terms of power per unit area, for example, milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). When speaking of frequencies in the microwave range and higher, power density is usually used to express intensity since exposures that might occur would likely be in the far field zone.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Portal|Radio|Telecommunication}}\n\n*[[Radio astronomy]]\n*[[Television transmitter]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=James Clerk|author-link=James Clerk Maxwell|date=1865|title=VIII.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.
