In 1896, Vrubel married the famous singer [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]] whom he regularly painted. \n\nSoviet historian {{ill|Nina Dmitrieva|ru|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} compared Vrubel\u2019s artistic biography to a three-act drama with prologue and epilogue, while the transition between acts was rapid and unexpected. The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

Great-grandfather of the artist \u2013 Anton Antonovich Vrubel \u2013 was originally from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and served as a judge in his local town. His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military. He retired at the rank of Major General, was twice married and had three sons and four daughters.{{sfn|\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430|1914|p=156}} For the last ten years of his life, Mikhail Antonovich served as an [[ataman]] of the [[Astrakhan Cossacks]]. At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863. From the left \u2013 Elizaveta Vessel-Vrubel]]\nDue to constant relocations of their father, Anna and Mikhail spent their childhood moving to the places where Alexander was assigned to serve. In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting. According to Dmitrieva, \"the boy was like a boy, gifted, but rather promising a versatile amateur than an obsessed artist, whom he later became\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel with his sister Anna.

At that time, a copy of \"[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The last Judgement]]\" by [[Michelangelo]] was exhibited in Saratov. The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A. I. Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century.

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition.

According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio.

The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle. Fresco sketch for the Vladimir Cathedral, 1887]]\nAfter returning from Venice in 1885, Vrubel spent May and part of June in Kiev. There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"... But still tell me, Mikhail Alexandrovich, why did you cut yourself \u2013 it must be painful. What is this \u2013 like a surgery?\" I looked closer \u2013 yes, these were large white scars, lots of them. \"Will you understand \u2013 said Mikhail Alexandrovich \u2013 It means that I loved a woman, she did not love me - maybe loved me, but much interfered with her understanding of me. I suffered from the inability to explain this to her. I suffered, but when I cut myself, the suffering decreased.{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d|1990|p=117}}}}\nAt the end of June 1885, Vrubel traveled to Odessa where he renewed his acquaintance with the Russian sculptor {{ill|Boris Edwards|ru|\u042d\u0434\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0441, \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} with whom he previously attended classes at the Art school. Edwards, together with [[Kyriak Kostandi]], tried to reform the Odessa Art School and decided to decided to elicit Vrubel's help. He settled Vrubel in his own house and tried to persuade him to stay in Odessa forever.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=151\u2014153}} In summer, Serov arrived in Odessa and Vrubel for the first time told him about his plan to paint the \"[[Demon (poem)|Demon]]\". In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version. Akvarel, 1887. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nAt the same time, Adrian Prakhov organized painting of the [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] and, without regard to his personal attitudes, invited Vrubel. Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalanced the relative integrity of the already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously was drawn to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer techniques acquired during the painting of sacred images to completely opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles. Alexander Vrubel was terrified with Mikhail's lifestyle: \"no warm blanket, no warm coat, no cloth except the one that is on him\u2026 Painfully, bitterly to tears\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=178}} The father also saw the first version of the \"Demon\" that disgusted him. He even noted that this painting would be unlikely to connect with either the public or with representatives of the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued together the pieces of the destroyed work. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich, the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait-fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis is clear in the following incident. On a visit to Prakhov, where a group of artists were participating in the painting of the cathedral, Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and so he needed urgently to travel to Kharkiv. The painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for his son. Confused Prakhov had to explain to him that Vrubel\u2019s disappearance was due to his infatuation with an English singer from the caf\u00e9-chantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=183\u2014184}} Nevertheless, friends tried to ensure that Vrubel had regular income. He was assigned a minor work in the Vladimyr's Cathedral \u2013 to draw ornaments and the \"Seven days for an eternity\" in one of the [[plafond]]s according to the sketches made by brothers [[Pavel Svedomsky|Pavel]] and {{ill|Alexander Swedomsky|ru|\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov. Later, Korovin introduced Vrubel to the famous patron of the arts [[Savva Mamontov]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=207}} In December, Vrubel moved to the Mamontov's house on the {{ill|Sadovaya-Spasskaya street|ru|\u0421\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f-\u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}} ( [[outbuilding of the town estate of Savva Mamontov]]).

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. Of these, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the the publishers' attention to Vrubel.

Due to their complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. The main difficulty, however, was that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. In spite of this, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] on April 10, 1891. Immediately thereafter the publication was widely discussed in the press who harshly criticized illustrations for their \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him. So the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious for him as \"incomprehensibility\" was for others.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the subject and made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist. The Demon was an archetypal \"fallen angel\" who simultaneously bridged men and female figures. Tamara was differently depicted on every image, and that emphasized her unavoidable choice between earthly and heavenly.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=14}} According to Dmitrieva, Vrubel\u2019s illustrations show the painter to be at the peak of his ability as a graphic artist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=37}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Demon Seated, 1890.

He became so fond of the local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that he proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and was trying his best to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to depend noble families for his support and started earning good money by completing several  several ceramic commissions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A.

Vrubel became one of the founders of the \u201cRussian Art Nouveau\u201d \u2013  the \"new style\" that added to the neo-Russian romanticism of the Mamontov's circle, and partially grew out of it.\"{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=65}}\n\n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d \"\u0412\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0438 \u041c\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\" \u0432 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0411\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Fireplace \"Volga Svyatoslavich and Mikula Selyaninovich\" in the {{ill|Dom Bazhanova|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043c \u0411\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430}}, 1908]]\nMamontov\u2019s studio in Abramtsevo and [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]'s studio in [[Talashkino]] embodied the principles of the \"[[Arts and Crafts movement]],\" initially founded by [[William Morris]] and his followers. Supporters discussed a revival of Russian traditional crafts at the same time as machine fabrication contradicted the uniqueness which was the main art principle in Art Nouveau.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|pp=195\u2014196}} Vrubel worked in both Abramtsevo and Talashkino. However, both of these studies differed in the aspects of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of [[maiolia]] in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved). Elizaveta Mamontova later wrote:\n{{Quote|I visited Vrubel, he painted a life-size Snow Maiden's head in watercolour against the background of a pine tree covered with snow. Beautiful in colours, but the face had gumboil and angry eyes. How ironic, he had to come to Rome to paint the Russian winter.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=268}}}}\n\nVrubel continued to work in Abramtsevo.

The main feature of this composition is its timelessness \u2013 it is impossible to say when the action took place. The figures were chaotically arranged, \"compressing\" space, which is projected onto the plane. A pair for the Venice became the \"Spain\" which critics recognize as one of the Vrubel's most perfectly arranged paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=55}}\n\n===Decorative works===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0438\u043d\u0438.jpg|thumb|left|\u201dRobert and the Nuns.

Due to regular commissioned works made for Mamontov, Vrubel\u2019s reputation in Moscow grew greatly. For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A. Morozov's house in Podsosenskiy lane.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=272}}\n\nVrubel' decorative works illustrate how universal his talents were. The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau. The artist created several compositions (small sculptural plastics from maiolica and tiles) which decorated important buildings in modern and pseudo-Russian style ([[Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station]], {{ill|Osobnyak M.

Thus, the Vrubel's candidature seemed very suitable \u2013 Mikhail could not stand gambling and even left the casino in [[Monte Carlo]], saying \"what a bore!\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=278}} In April, after coming back to Odessa, Vrubel again found himself in a situation of chronic poverty and family quarrels. Then he once again came back to maiolic art while creating the Demon's head. Artsybushev bought this work, and with the money received, Vrubel returned to Moscow.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=280\u2014281}}\n\n[[File:Michail Alexandrowitsch Wrubel 001.jpg|thumb|right|The Fortune Teller, 1895]]\nApproximately at the same time, Vrubel painted \"The Fortune Teller\" in one day, following the strong internal desire.

Black haired woman of Eastern type does not pay attention to cards and her face remains impenetrable. In terms of colours, the focus is on a pink scarf on the girl's shoulders.

According to the Korovin\u2019s memoirs, after getting a large salary for watercolour panels, he spent them as follows:\n{{quote|He organized the dinner in the hotel \"Paris\" where he also lived. He invited everyone who stayed there. When I joined after the theatre, I saw tables covered with bottles of wine, champagne, a lot of people, among guests \u2013 gypsies, guitarists, an orchestra, some military men, actors, and Misha Vrubel treated everyone like a [[ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel]] pouring champagne from the bottle that was wrapped in a napkin. \"How happy I am,\" he told me. \"I feel like a rich man.\" See how well everyone feels and how happy they are.<br>\nFive thousand rubles gone, and it still was not enough to cover the expenses.

Savva Mamontov was a curator of the exposition dedicated to the [[Far North (Russia)|Russian North]]. It was him who noticed that the neighbouring section of arts lacks the paintings that would cover two large empty walls. Mamontov discussed with the Minister of Finance his idea to cover these walls with large panels with total area 20 \u00d7 5 m and ordered these panels from Vrubel.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=297}} At that time, the painter was busy decorating the Morozov's mansion in Moscow.

At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee.

Around the same time, the Russian premiere of the [[fairy-tail opera]] \u201c[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]\u201d was about to take place. Savva Mamontov got carried away by this staging and even personally translated the [[libretto]] as well as sponsored the [[combination company]] of the {{ill|Panaevski theatre |ru|\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440}}.

Originally, Konstantin Korovin was responsible for the decorations and costumes but because of illness had to renounce the order in favour of Mikhail Vrubel who had never even attended an opera before. On one of the rehearsals, the painter saw [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]] who played the role of Gretel\u2019s little sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=312\u2014313}} This is how Nadezhda Zabela later recalled her first meeting with Mikhail:\n{{quote|On the break (I remember that I stood behind the curtain), I was shocked that some man ran to me and, kissing my arm, exclaimed: \u201cWhat an amazing voice!\u201d.

Nevertheless, on July 28 they engaged in the [[Russian Church, Geneva|Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross]] in Geneva, Switzerland. The couple spent their honeymoon in a guesthouse in [[Lucerne]]. Then Vrubel continued his work on the panel for the Morozov\u2019s gothic cabinet. At the point of their engagement, Vrubel was utterly broke and even had to go from the station to Nadezhda's house by walk.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=317}}\n\nFor the fall of 1896, Nadezhda Zabela Vrubel had a short contract with the Kharkiv opera. However, Vrubel did not many commissions in the city and had to live on his wife\u2019s money. This prompted him to turn to theatrical painting and costume designs.

His [[migraine]]s got so strong that the painter had to take [[phenacetin]] in large quantities (according to his sister in law \u2013 up to 25 [[grain]]s and more).

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]]. The plot was drawn in a canvas on which he previously started to paint the portrait of his wife.

Stored at the [[Russian Museum]]]]\nTen years later, Vrubel returned to the theme of Demon which is evident from his correspondence with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the end of 1898. Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n\n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom. His eyes, as if prophetically, captured the whole tragic fate of his fragility.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}}}\n\nThe birth of Savva led to a dramatic change in the routine of the family. Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively. Despite usual 3-4 hours, he worked up to 14 hours, and sometimes even more, with a flash of artificial lightning, never leaving the room and barely coming off the painting. Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910) ==\n\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis ===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

At the same time, Vrubel\u2019s hallucinations were caused by a [[bipolar disorder]] common among artists.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=437}} Due to progressive methods applied in the Usoltsev's clinic and frequent visits of Nadezhda and Anna Vrubel (they rented a house nearby and visited Mikhail daily), Vrubel almost fully rehabilitated. Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients. The doctor constantly invited artists and singers for organized house concerts. Patients attended evening events together with medical staff{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}. Usoltsev valued Vrubel's art and in every possible way, encouraged his creative pursuits.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906.

His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time. But, unfortunately, he tore his new summer coat and trousers apart. He pretended to be calm, went to bed, covered himself with a blanket, and started to tugging the cloth underneath and tearing it into strips before the servant had noticed \u2026 His physical strength is high, which is rare for an intelligent person\u2026 You asked, should you write to him or not.

However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis. In addition, the painter was diagnosed with an [[optic neuropathy]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=449\u2014450}} Mikhail was kept in the clinic almost exclusively at the expense of his wife, which was not an easy task because a month of stay in the Usoltsev's clinic cost 100-150 rubles. On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in. He entered with a wrong, heavy gait as if he was dragging his feet. To tell the truth, I was shocked when I saw Vrubel. It was a frail and sick person in a dirty, crumpled shirt. He had a reddish face and bird of prey eyes; protruding hair instead of a beard. First impression: crazy! <...> In real life, all small Vrubel's movement reflected his disorder. However, when his hand took a pencil or a lump of coal, it became very steady and confident. Lines that he drew were infallible.\n\nHis artistic strength survived everything else in him. The human died, was destroyed, but the master continued to live.\n\nDuring the first session, the first draft was already finished.

They organized the work, so Vrubel was able to paint Bruysov in the mornings, while Serov painted Vrubel in the afternoons.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=453}} Even though Nadezhda Zabela was concerned if Vrubel could handle such stress, Usoltsev categorically said that \"as an artist, he was healthy and deeply healthy.\" The first issue of the \"Zolotoe runo\" was published on February 1, 1906, with the Bryusov's poem \"To M. A. Vrubel\" opening the issue. Twelve days later, Vrubel complained to his wife that he could not read or paint.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses. The request was approved, and Vrubel started receiving 75 rubles in summer and 100 rubles in winter months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=458}}\n\nAfter Vrubel lost his sight, his violent seizures occurred much rarer. Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him. Especially often they re-read [[Ivan Turgenev]] 's [[prose poetry]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] 's novella [[The Steppe (novella)|The Steppe]] on the grounds of which Vrubel once created a painting. Ekaterina Ge later recalled:\n{{quote|...

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute.

Hence he borrowed 25 rubles from me and left. He came back soon, took a large basin and a bucket of water, and poured some cologne from a beautiful bottle from  [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]]  into the water.

According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia.

19th-20th century Russian painter who worked in all genres of art, including painting, graphics, decorative sculpture, and theatrical art. In 1896, Vrubel married the famous singer [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]] whom he regularly painted. \n\nSoviet historian {{ill|Nina Dmitrieva|ru|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430}} compared Vrubel\u2019s artistic biography to a three-act drama with prologue and epilogue, while the transition between acts was rapid and unexpected. The \u201cPrologue\u201d refers to his earlier years of studying and choosing a career path. The \u201cfirst act\u201d peaked in the 1880s when Vrubel was studying at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and then moved to [[Kiev]] to study [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]. The \u201csecond act\u201d corresponded to the so-called \u201cMoscow period\u201d that started in 1890 with the painting  \u201c[[The Demon Seated]]\u201d and ended in 1902 with the \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d and the subsequent hospitalization of the artist. The \u201cthird act\u201d lasted from 1903 to 1906 when Vrubel was suffering from his mental illness that gradually undermined his physical and intellectual capabilities. For the last four years of his life, already being blind, Vrubel lived only physically.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=20}}\n\nIn 1880-1890, Vrubel's creative aspirations did not find support of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and art critics. However, many private collectors and patrons were fascinated with his paintings, including famous [[wikt:Maecenas|maecenas]] [[Savva Mamontov]], as well as painters and critics who coalesced around the journal \u201c[[Mir iskusstva]]\u201d. Eventually, Vrubel's works were exhibited at Mir Iskusstva's own art exhibitions and [[Sergei Diaghilev]] retrospectives. At the beginning of the 20th century, Vrubel's art became an organic part of the Russian [[Art Nouveau]]. On November 28, 1905, he was awarded the title of Academician of Painting for his \u201cfame in the artistic field\u201d \u2013 just when Vrubel almost finished his career as an artist. \n\n==Becoming a painter==\n===Origin.

Great-grandfather of the artist \u2013 Anton Antonovich Vrubel \u2013 was originally from [[Bia\u0142ystok]] and served as a judge in his local town. His son {{ill|Mikhail Antonovich Vrubel|ru|\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (1799-1859) became a professional military. He retired at the rank of Major General, was twice married and had three sons and four daughters.{{sfn|\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430|1914|p=156}} For the last ten years of his life, Mikhail Antonovich served as an [[ataman]] of the [[Astrakhan Cossacks]]. At that time, the Astrakhan governor was a famous cartographer and admiral {{ill|Grigori Basargin|ru|\u0411\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0433\u0438\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. The governor\u2019s daughter Anna later married the second son of Mikhail Antonovich from the first marriage, Alexander, who previously graduated from the [[Cadet Corps]], served in the Tengin Infantry Regiment, participated in the [[Caucasian War|Caucasian]] and [[Crimean War]]s. In 1855, their first child Anna Aleksandrovna (1855-1928) was born. Altogether, they had four children, each of whom was born one after the other.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=7\u201412}}\n\nMikhail Vrubel was born on March 17, 1856. At that time, the Vrubel family lived in [[Omsk]] where Alexander was serving as a desk officer of the [[2nd Steppe Siberian Corps]]. Two other children, Alexander and Ekaterina, were also born in Omsk, however, they died before adolescence. Frequent childbirth and adverse [[Siberia]]n climate significantly weakened Mikhail\u2019s mother's health and in 1859 she died from [[tuberculosis|consumption]]. The future painter was only three years old when his mother died. One of the memories that Mikhail had from that period is how his sick mother lay in bed and cut out for her children \"little people, horses and different fantastic figures\" from paper.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=12\u201413}} Being a weak child from birth, Mikhail started to walk only at the age of three.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=5}}\n\n[[File:I 029.png|thumb|left|The Vrubel family in 1863. From the left \u2013 Elizaveta Vessel-Vrubel]]\nDue to constant relocations of their father, Anna and Mikhail spent their childhood moving to the places where Alexander was assigned to serve. In 1859, he was appointed to serve in  [[Astrakhan]] where he had relatives able to help him with children, but  already in 1861 the family had to relocate to  [[Kharkiv]]. There, little Mikhail quickly learned how to read and developed his interest in book illustrations, especially those from the journal \"[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=14\u201415}}\n\nIn 1863, Alexander Vrubel got married for the second time to Elizaveta Vessel from Saint Petersburg, who dedicated herself to her husband's children (her own child was born only in 1867). In 1867, the family moved to [[Saratov]] where [[podpolkovnik]] Vrubel took command of the provincial garrison. The Vessel family belonged to [[intelligentsia]] \u2013 a status class of educated people engaged in shaping the culture and politics of their society. Elizaveta\u2019s sister Alexandra Vessel graduated from the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] and largely contributed to the introducing Mikhail to the world of music. Elizaveta herself spent a lot of time on improving Mikhail\u2019s health; later he even ironically recalled that she made him follow  the \"diet of raw meat and fish oil\". However, there is no doubt that he owes his physical strength to the regime maintained by his stepmother.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=16\u201418}} In addition, Elizaveta's brother, professional teacher {{ill|Nicolai Vessel|ru|\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, also participated in children's education by introducing educational games and home entertainments. Despite the generally good relationships among all the relatives, Anna and Mikhail kept a little aloof from them. Sometimes they behaved coldly to their stepmother calling her with an ironic nickname \"Madrin'ka \u2014 perl materei\". They also explicitly expressed their desire to start an independent life outside home thus making their father upset.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=20\u201422}} By the age of 10, Mikhail expressed artistic talents through drawing, theater and music practicing; that altogether occupied in his future life no less place than painting. According to Dmitrieva, \"the boy was like a boy, gifted, but rather promising a versatile amateur than an obsessed artist, whom he later became\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|Vrubel with his sister Anna. Gymnasium photo from the 1870s]]\nIn addition, Alexander Vrubel hired for Mikhail a private teacher Andrei Godin from the Saratov gymnasium who taught advanced painting techniques. At that time, a copy of \"[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The last Judgement]]\" by [[Michelangelo]] was exhibited in Saratov. The painting impressed Mikhail so much, that, according to his sister, he reproduced it from his memory in all details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=28}}\n\n===Gymnasium===\n\nMikhail Vrubel started his education at the {{ill|Fifth St. Petersburg Gymnasium|ru|\u041f\u044f\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f}} where the school directorate paid particular attention to the modernization of teaching methods, the advancement of [[Classics|classical studies]], the literary development of high school students, dance and gymnastics lessons. His father Alexander was also in Saint Petersburg, voluntarily attending lectures at the [[Alexander Military Law Academy]] as an auditor. In addition to his studies at the gymnasium, Mikhail attended painting classes at the school of the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]]. However, he was most interested in natural sciences thanks to his teacher Nicolai Peskov who was a political exile. In 1870, after living three years in Saint Petersburg , the Vrubel family moved to [[Odessa]] where Alexander was appointed as a judge in the garrison court.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=30\u201431}}\n\nIn Odessa, Mikhail studied at the [[Richelieu Lyceum]]. Several letters from him to his sister Anna who was  receiving teacher education in Saint Petersburg have been preserved. The first letter dated October 1872; both letters are large and easy to read, with many quotes in French and [[Latin]]. In these letters, Mikhail mentioned the paintings that he made \u2013 the portrait of his smaller brother Alexander who died in 1869 (reproduced from the photograph), and the portrait of Anna hanging in the father's office. However, comparing to other interests that Mikhail had, painting classes did not occupy much of his time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=5\u20147}}{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=33\u201434}} Vrubel was a quick learner and was the first in his class. He had a special interest in literature, languages, history, and, on vacations,  he loved to read to his sister in original Latin. The future painter devoted even his free time to favourite activities. For instance, in one of his letters, he complained to Anna that instead of reading [[Goethe's Faust]] in original and completing  50 exercises in English textbook, he copied in oil \"Sunset at Sea\" by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}} At the same time, one might say that at that time Mikhail was more interested in theatrical art rather than painting, since he barely mentioned the \"[[Peredvizhniki]]\" exhibition in Odessa but spent several pages describing the Saint Petersburg opera troupe.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}}\n\n===University===\n[[File:Anna Karenina Wrubel.jpg|thumb|right|The date of Anna Karenina with the son, 1878]]\n\nAfter graduating with a distinction, neither Vrubel nor his parents thought of his career as an artist. It was decided to send Mikhail to Saint Petersburg where he could study at the  [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and live with his uncle Nicolai Vessel, who would also cover Vrubel\u2019s everyday expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=40}} Mikhail\u2019s decision to study  at the [[Saint Petersburg State University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] was differently interpreted by Vrubel\u2019s biographers. For example, [[Alexandre Benois]], who studied at the same faculty, suggested that the rationale behind this decision was the family tradition and values that legal profession had among their social circles. In 1876, Vrubel had to repeat the second year due to poor grades and a desire to strengthen his knowledge on the subjects. However, even though Mikhail studied for a year more than was expected, he could not defend his thesis and graduated in the rank of \"{{ill|deistvitel'nyi student|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442}}\" which was the lowest scientific degree that one can graduate with.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=41}} Despite deep engagement with philosophy and, particularly, the theory of aesthetics by [[Immanuel Kant]], Mikhail\u2019s s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle that his uncle allowed him to maintain was partly to blame for not finishing the university. At that time, Vrubel did not spend much time on practicing painting,{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=48\u201450}} though he made several illustrations for literary works  both classic and contemporary. According to Dmitrieva, \"in general\u2026 Vrubel's art is thoroughly \"literary\": a rare work of his does not originate in a literary or  theatrical source\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=18}} One of the most famous compositions from that period is \"The date of [[Anna Karenina]] with the son\". According to Domitieva, this was his \"pre-Vrubel\" stage since the painting mostly reminds of journal illustrations of that time: \"utterly romantic, even melodramatic, and very carefully decorated\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=50\u201452}} Active participation in theatrical life (Vrubel personally knew [[Modest Mussorgsky]] who frequently visited the Vessel's house) required considerable expenses which is why Vrubel regularly worked as a tutor and a [[governess]]. In 1875, he even travelled to Europe with one of his pupils; together, they visited [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]]. In addition, Mikhail spent the summer of 1875 at the estate belonged to a Russian lawyer {{ill|Dmitrii Berr|ru|\u0411\u0435\u0440, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} (His wife Yulia Berr was a niece of [[Mikhail Glinka]]). Then, due to the excellent knowledge of Latin, Vrubel was hired as a tutor at the Papmel family where he guided his former university classmate.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=57\u201459}} According to the memoirs of A.

Ivanov:\n\n{{Quote|Vrubel lived with the Papmel family as a relative: in the winter he went to the opera with them, in the summer he moved with everyone to their cottage in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]]. Papmels put on quite a spread and everything about them was opposite to the way the Vrubel family lived; their house was a full bowl, even in an excessively literal sense, and during his time with Papmels, Vrubel firstly discovered his passion for wine which was never been lacking.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=61}}}}\n\nIt was the Papmel family prone to [[aestheticism]] and bohemian lifestyle that encouraged Vrubel's [[dandy]]ism and a desire to paint. In one of his letters from 1879, Vrubel mentioned that he renewed his acquaintance with a Russian watercolourist Emilie Villiers, who in every possible way patronized Mikhail' pictorial experiences in Odessa. Later, Vrubel began to communicate closely with students of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] who worked under the patronage of a famous Russian painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]]. Vrubel started attending evening academic classes where auditioning was allowed, and started to hone plastic skills.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=63\u201464}} As a result, at the age of 24, Vrubel had a crucial turning point in his life \u2013 after graduating from the university and serving a short military service, Vrubel was admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=7}}\n\n==The 1880s==\n===The Academy of Arts===\n[[File:Serov Chistyakov.jpg|thumb|left|The portrait of Chistyakov by [[Valentin Serov]], 1881]]\n\nAccording to Domiteeva, Vrubel's decision to study at the Academy of Arts came from his engagement with the Kant's theory of aesthetic ideas. His younger colleague and an admirer {{ill|Stepan Yaremich|ru|\u042f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u0447, \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} suggested that Vrubel adopted Kant's philosophy that \"clarity of the division between physical and moral life\" led over time to a separation of these areas in the real life. Mikhail Vrubel demonstrated \"softness, pliability, shyness in little things in everyday life; while iron perseverance accompanied his general higher direction of life\". However, this was only one side of the story \u2013 undoubtedly, at the age of 24, Vrubel considered himself as a genius. According to the Kant's theory of aesthetics, the  \u201cgenius\u201d category  implied working in a sphere \u201cbetween freedom and nature\u201d that could only be achieved in the field of arts. For a young and gifted Vrubel that inspired his long-term life plan.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=66\u201467}}\n\nStarting from the autumn of 1880, Vrubel audited classes in the Academy and, presumably, started having private lessons at the [[Pavel Chistyakov|Chistyakov's]] studio. However, these lessons were documented only starting from 1882; the painter himself claimed that he studied with Chistyakov for four years. In his autobiography dated 1901, the painter characterized years spent in the Academy as \"the brightest in his artistic career\" thanks to Chistyakov. This does not contradict what he wrote to his sister in 1883 (when they renewed mutual correspondence that was broken off for six years):\n\n{{Quote|When I started my lessons with Chistyakov, I passionately followed his main statements because they were nothing less than a formula of my living attitude towards nature, that is embedded in me.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=21}}}}\n\nAmong Chistyakov\u2019s students there were  [[Ilya Repin]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], and [[Valentin Serov]] all of whom painted in different styles. All of them, including Vrubel, recognized Chistyakov as their only teacher, honouring him to the last days. Due to scepticism prevailed among the second generation of scholars, this type of relationship between the mentor and his students was not quite appreciated. Chistyakov's method was purely [[Academic Art|academic]], but very \u201cindividualistic\u201d since Pavel inspired \"sacred concepts\" in working on a plastic form, but also taught conscious drawing as well as structural analysis of the form. According to Chistyakov, in order to construct the painting one needs to break it down to several small planes transmitted by flatnesses, and these planes would form the faces of the volume with its hollows and bulges. Vrubel's  \"crystal-like\" technique was thus fully mastered by his teacher.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=22\u201423}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041f\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|right|Feasting Romans, 1883]]\nOne of the most crucial acquaintances that Vrubel met during his time in the Academy was [[Valentin Serov]]. Despite a 10-year age difference, they were connected on different levels, including the deepest one.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=72\u201474}} Throughout the years spent at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel's motives drastically changed: his dandyism was replaced with [[asceticism]], about which he proudly wrote to his sister.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=81}} Starting from 1881,  after transferring to a life model class, Mikhail visited both Chistyakov's classes and morning watercolour lessons at the Repin's studio. However, their relationship with Repin got complicated quickly due to the argument on the painting \"[[Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate]]\". In one of the letters to his sister, Vrubel mentioned that by \"taking advantage of the [public] ignorance, Repin stole that special pleasure that distinguishes the state of mind before a work of art from the state of mind before the expanded printed sheet\". This quote clearly illustrates Chistyakov's influence on Vrubel\u2019s philosophy since Pavel was the one who suggested that obedience of techniques to art is the fundamental spiritual property of the Russian creativity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=84\u201485}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0449\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435 \u0420\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430.jpg|thumb|left|Model in a Renaissance setting]] \nOne of the brightest examples of Vrubel's academic work is his sketch \"Feasting Romans\". Even though it formally compiled with rules of academic art, the painting violates all  the main canons of academism \u2013  the composition does not have the main focus, the plot is unclear.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=28}}\n\nJudging by the correspondence between Vrubel and his sister, the painter spent almost two years on the painting. The plot was simple: a cupbearer and  a young [[citharode]] wink to each other sitting nearby the sleeping [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]. The view was quite whimsical \u2013 from somewhere on the balcony or a high window. It implied a dim lighting \"after sunset, without any reflections of light\" for strengthening the silhouette effects. Vrubel's intention was to make \"some similarities with [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\". The final watercolour sketch grew with sub-stickers and caused Repin\u2019s enthusiasm. However, Vrubel felt intuitively the limit of unsteady forms and eventually abandoned the unfinished paintings refusing to paint a historical picture.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=104\u2014106}}\n\n[[File:\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c - \u0413\u0430\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u041e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u0438\u044f (1884).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hamlet and Ophelia, 1884]]\nHowever, Vrubel did not abandon his idea to get paid for his creative work. Thanks to the Papmel family, he received a commission from the industrialist {{ill|Leopold Koenig|ru|\u041a\u0451\u043d\u0438\u0433, \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0434 \u0415\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. According to the mutual agreement,  the subject and technique of the painting would be left at the discretion of the artist and the fee would be 200 rubles. Mikhail also decided to participate in the contest initiated by the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] and chose the plot of \"[[Hamlet]] and [[Ophelia]]\" in the style of [[Madonna of Loreto| Rafael's realism]]. The self-portrait sketches of Hamlet and watercolors for the general composition which depict the Danish prince as represented by Vrubel have been preserved.  However, the work on the painting was complicated with worsening relationship between the painter and his father.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=106\u2014108}} Having failed with the \"Hamlet\" as well, Vrubel was persuaded by his friends to depict a real life model. For this role, they chose an experienced model Agafya who was put in the same chair that served as decorations for the \u201cHamlet\u201d, while student {{ill|Vladimir Derviz|ru|\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0437, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} brought some [[Florence|Florentine]] [[velvet]], [[Venice|Venetian]] brocade and other things from the [[Renaissance]] period from his parents house.  Vrubel successfully finished the painting  \"Sitter in the Renaissance Setting\" with characteristic for Vrubel \u201cpainting embossing\u201d . Under the impression from the \"Sitter\", Vrubel returned to \"Hamlet\". This time he painted with oil on a canvas with Serov as a model.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=108\u2014110}}\n\nDespite the formal success, Vrubel was not able to graduate from the Academy. However, in 1883, his painting \"Betrothal of Mary and Joseph\" received the silver medal from the Academy. Following the recommendation of Chistyakov, in the autumn of 1883, professor [[Adrian Prakhov]] invited Vrubel to [[Kiev]] to work on a restoration of the 12th century [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's Monastery]]. The offer was flattering and promised good earnings therefore the artist agreed to go after the end of the academic year.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=111}}\n\n===Kiev===\n[[File:Vrubel Self Portrait 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait, 1885]]\n\nThe years that Vrubel spent in Kiev turned out to be almost the most important in his career. For the first time in Vrubel\u2019s life, the painter was able to pursue his monumental intentions and return to the fundamentals of the Russian art. In five years, Mikhail completed an enormous amount of paintings. For instance, he single-handedly painted murals and icons for the  [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|St. Cyril's church]], as well as made 150 drawings for the restoration the figure of an angel in the dome of the St. Sophia Cathedral. As Dmitrieva noted:\n{{Quote|Such a \"co-authorship\" with the masters of the 12th century was unknown to any of the great artists of the 19th century. The 1880s have just only passed, the first search for national antiquity just started, which no one else besides specialists was interested in, and even those specialists were interested more from the historical point rather than artistic <\u2026> Vrubel in Kiev was the first who bridged archaeological pioneering and restorations to a live contemporary art. At the same time, he did not think of stylization. He felt like an accomplice in the hard work of the ancient masters and tried to be worthy of them.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}}}}\n\nPrakhov\u2019s invitation was almost coincidental, as he was looking for a qualified painter with some academic training to paint murals in the church, but at the same time not to be recognised enough so he would not require a higher salary.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=113}} Judging from the correspondence with the family, Vrubel's contract with Prakhov was for the completion of four icons in the duration of 76 days.

Lev Kovalsky, who in 1884 was a student at the  Kiev Art School appointed to pick Mikhail up in the station, later recalled:\n{{Quote|... Against a background of primitive Kirillovsky hills, a blond, almost white, young man with a particular head and small, almost white, moustaches, stood behind my back.

The fresco reflected most of the Vrubel's characteristic features and depicted twelve Apostles that are situated in a semicircle at the box vault of the choirs. The standing figure of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is located in the center of the composition. The background is coloured in blue while the golden rays are coming up to the apostles from the circle featuring the [[Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=34}} The model for the Mary\u2019s figure was a paramedic M. Ershova \u2013 a frequent guest in the Prakhov's house and the future wife of one of the painters participating in the restoration process.  To Mary\u2019s left stands the apostle that was painted from [[protoiereus]] Petr (Lebedintsev) who at that time taught at the Richelieu lyceum. To Mary's right stands the second apostle for whom the Kiev archaeologist {{ill|Viktor Goshkevich|ru|\u0413\u043e\u0448\u043a\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} was modelling. The third from the right was the head of the Kirillovsky parish Peter Orlovsky who originally discovered the remains of old paintings and interested the [[Imperial Russian Archaeological Society]] in their reconstruction. The fourth apostle, folded his hands in a prayer, was Prakhov. Besides the \"Descent\", Vrubel painted the \"The entry into Jerusalem\" and \"The Angels\u2019Lamentation\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=124}} The \"Descent\" was painted directly on the wall, without any cardboard and even any preliminary sketches \u2013 only certain details were previously specified on small sheets of paper. Remarkably, the painting depicts Apostles in a semicircle with their [[Halo (religious iconography)|limbs]] connecting to the Holy Spirit emblem. This painting style was of Byzantine origin and was inspired with hammered [[winged altarpiece]] from one of the [[\u0422\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0438|Tiflis]] monasteries.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=123\u2014125}}\n\n===The first trip to Italy===\n[[File:Vrubel Moses.jpg|thumb|right|Icon of the Prophet Moses]]\nVrubel travelled to Venice together with Samuel Gaiduk who was a young artist painting in accordance with Mikhail's sketches.  Their trip had been not without some \u201cadventures\u201d, however. According to Prakhov, Vrubel met his friend from St. Petersburg with whom they went out partying during the transfer in [[Vienna]]. Gaiduk, who successfully reached Venice,  waited two days for Vrubel to arrive. Life in Venice in winter was cheap, and painters shared a studio in the city centre on Via San Maurizio. They both were interested in churches on the abandoned island [[Torcello]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=134\u2014135}}\n\nDmitrieva described Vrubel's artistic evolution as following: \"Neither [[Titian]] and [[Paolo Veronese]], nor magnificent [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] atmosphere of the Venetian [[Cinquecento]] attracted him. The range of his Venetian addictions is clearly defined: from medieval mosaics and stained glass of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] and [[Torcello Cathedral]] to painters of the early Renaissance [[Vittore Carpaccio]], [[Cima da Conegliano]] (the figures of which Vrubel found especially noble), [[Giovanni Bellini]]. <...> If the first meeting with Byzantine-Russian art in Kiev enriched Vrubel's envisioning of plastic forms, then Venice enriched his palette and awakened his gift as a colourist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|pp=37\u201438}}\"\n\nThese features can be clearly observed in all the three icons that Vrubel painted in Venice for the St. Cyril's Church \u2013 \"Saint Kirill\", \"Saint Afanasii\", and gloomy-coloured \"Christ the Savior\". Being accustomed to intensive work at the Chistyakov's studio, Vrubel painted all four icons in a month and a half and felt a crave for activities and the lack of communication. In Venice, he accidentally met [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] who was married to one of the Chistyakov' students. Together they discussed how to preserve paintings in the condition of high humidity as well as argued on the advantages of writing in oil on [[zinc]] boards before painting on a canvas. The zinc boards for Vrubel' icons were delivered directly from Kiev; however, for a long time painter could not establish his own techniques and the paint could not stick to the metal. In April, Vrubel only wanted to come back to Russia.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=140,148\u2014149}}\n\n===Kiev and Odessa===\n[[File:Vrubel Angel.jpg|thumb|right|Angel with censer and candle.

There were rumours that immediately after he came back, he proposed to Emily Prakhova despite her being a married woman. According to one version of the story, Vrubel proclaimed his decision not to Emily but to her husband Adrian Prakhov. Even though Mikhail Vrubel was not denied access to the house, Prakhov was definitely \"afraid of him\" while Emily resented his immaturity.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=150}} Apparently, the incident described a year later by Vrubel\u2019s friend [[Konstantin Korovin]] belongs to this period:\n{{Quote|It was a hot summer. We went swimming at the big lake in the garden. <...> \"What are these big white strips at your chest that look like scars?\" \u2013\" Yes, these are scars. I cut myself with a knife.\" <...> \"...

In letters to his family, Vrubel also mentioned a [[tetralogy]] that probably became one of his side interests. In 1886 Vrobel went to Kiev to celebrate the new year using the money that his father sent him for a trip home (at that time the family resided in Kharkiv).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=162\u2014163}}\n\nIn Kiev, Vrubel met frequently with associates of writer [[Ieronim Yasinsky]]. He also met Korovin for the first time. Despite the intensive work, the painter led a \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle and became a regular in the [[caf\u00e9-chantant]] \u00abShato-de-fler\u00bb. This depleted his meager salary and the main source of income became the sugar manufacturer [[Ivan Tereshchenko]] who immediately gave the painter 300 rubles toward the expenses of his planned \"Oriental Tale\". Vrubel used to throw his money in the caf\u00e9-\u0441hantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=174\u2014177}}\n\n[[File:\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0447.jpg|thumb|left|Tombstone Crying, the second version.

Despite Vrubel's carelessness towards his works inspired with his \u201cbohemian\u201d lifestyle, he created no less than six versions of the \"Tombstone Crying\" (only four of them have been preserved). The story is not included in the [[Gospel]] and not usual for the [[Russian icons|Russian Orthodox]] art, but can be seen in some icons from the Italian Renaissance. Though he clearly understood their significance and originality, Prakhov rejected Vrubel's independent paintings since they differed significantly from the works of other participating colleagues and would have unbalanced the relative integrity of the already-assembled murals.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=10}} Prakhov once noted that the a new cathedral \"in a very special style\" would need to be built to accommodate Vrubel' paintings.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=44}}\n\nIn addition to commissioned works, Vrubel attempted to paint \"Praying for the cup\" just \"for himself\". However, he experienced a severe mental crisis while trying to finish it. He wrote to his sister:\n{{Quote|I draw and paint Christ with all my might, but, at the same time, presumably, because I am far away from my family, all religious rituals, including [[Resurrection of Jesus]] look so alien, that I am even annoyed with it.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=48}}}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - The Girl Against the Background of Persian Carpet.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet, 1886. Stored at the Kiev Art Gallery]]\nWhile painting murals in the Kiev churches, Vrubel simultaneously was drawn to the image of the Demon. According to P. Klimov, it was quite logical and even natural for Vrubel to transfer techniques acquired during the painting of sacred images to completely opposite images, and it illustrates the direction of his pursuits.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=11}} His father Alexander visited him in Kiev when Mikhail had some intense mental struggles.

He even noted that this painting would be unlikely to connect with either the public or with representatives of the Academy of art.  As a result, Mikhail destroyed the painting, and many other works that he created in Kiev.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=179}} To earn a living, the painter started to paint the already promised \"Oriental Tail\", but could only finish a watercolour. He tried to give it to Emily Prakhova as a gift; and tore it up after she rejected it.  But then he reconsidered and glued together the pieces of the destroyed work. The only finished painting from this period was the \"Portrait of a Girl against a Persian Carpet\" depicting Mani Dakhnovich, the daughter of the loan office owner. Dmitrieva defined the genre of this painting as a \u201cportrait-fantasy\u201d. The customer, though, did not like the final version, and the work was later bought by Tereshchenko.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=20\u201423}}\n\nThe painter's mental crisis is clear in the following incident. On a visit to Prakhov, where a group of artists were participating in the painting of the cathedral, Vrubel proclaimed that his father died and so he needed urgently to travel to Kharkiv. The painters raised money for his trip. The next day, Alexander Vrubel came to Prakhov looking for his son. Confused Prakhov had to explain to him that Vrubel\u2019s disappearance was due to his infatuation with an English singer from the caf\u00e9-chantant.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=183\u2014184}} Nevertheless, friends tried to ensure that Vrubel had regular income.

Most likely, he travelled there because he fell in love with a circus horsewoman which he met thanks to Yasinsky's brother who performed under the pseudonym \"Alexander Zemgano\". As a result, Vrubel settled at the Korovin\u2019s studio on the {{ill|Dolgorukovskaya street|ru|\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=193\u2014194}} Vrubel, Korovin and Serov even had an idea to share a studio but, however, it did not translate into reality due to deteriorating relations with Serov.

Altogether, there were 18 painters, including Ilya Repin, [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Leonid Pasternak]], [[Apollinary Vasnetsov]]. Of these, Vrubel was the only one who was completely unknown to the public.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} It is not known who drew the the publishers' attention to Vrubel. According to different versions, Vrubel was introduced to Konchalovsky by Mamontov, Korovin and even Pasternak who was responsible for editing.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=225}} The salary for the work was quite small (800 rubles for 5 big and 13 small illustrations){{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=238}}. Due to their complexity, his paintings were hard to reproduce and Vrubel had to amend them. The main difficulty, however, was that his colleagues did not understand Vrubel's art. In spite of this, the illustrated publication was approved by the [[Censorship in the Russian Empire|censorship authorities]] on April 10, 1891. Immediately thereafter the publication was widely discussed in the press who harshly criticized illustrations for their \"rudeness, ugliness, caricature, and absurdity\" (it is interesting that in 20 years critics will argue that it was Vrubel who was able to \"translate into a new language\" the poetic essence of Lermontov's spirit).{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=231\u2014232}} Even people who were well-disposed to Vrubel did not understand him. So the painter changed his views on aesthetics suggesting that the \"true art\" is incomprehensible to almost anyone, and \"comprehensibility\" was as suspicious for him as \"incomprehensibility\" was for others.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=62}}\n\nVrubel made all his illustrations in black watercolour; monochromaticity made it possible to emphasize the dramatic nature of the subject and made it possible to show the range of textured pursuits explored by the artist. The Demon was an archetypal \"fallen angel\" who simultaneously bridged men and female figures. Tamara was differently depicted on every image, and that emphasized her unavoidable choice between earthly and heavenly.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=14}} According to Dmitrieva, Vrubel\u2019s illustrations show the painter to be at the peak of his ability as a graphic artist.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=37}}\n\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel - \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Demon Seated, 1890.

He became so fond of the local landscapes that decided to stay in there. In Abramtsevo, Vrubel became fascinated with [[ceramic]]s and soon after that he proudly mentioned to his sister Anna that he now heads the \"factory of ceramic tiles and [[terracotta]] decorations\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=253, 246}} Savva Mamontov did not understand Vrubel' aesthetic aspirations but recognized his talent, and was trying his best to create a suitable living environment for the painter. For the first time in his life, Vrubel ceased to depend noble families for his support and started earning good money by completing several  several ceramic commissions; decorating a majolica chapel on the grave of A. Mamontov; projecting the extension in the \"Roman-Byzantine style\" to the Mamontov's mansion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=245\u2014246}} According to Dmitrieva, \"Vrubel\u2026 seemed to be irreplaceable as he could easily do any art, except writing texts.

However, both of these studies differed in the aspects of art. For instance, Mamontov mostly concentrated on theatrical and architecture projects while Tenisheva focused on Russian national traditions.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=199}}   Ceramics of the Abramtsevo Potter's Factory played a significant role in the revival of maiolic art in Russia. Vrubel was attracted to maiolica because of its simplicity, spontaneity of generalization of form with a rough texture and whimsical spills of glaze. Ceramics allowed Vrubel to experiment freely with plastic and artistic possibilities of the material. The lack of craftsmanship with its patterns allowed to put his fantasies into life.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=203}} In Abramtsevo, Vrubel' plans were supported and brought to life by the famous ceramist [[Peter Vaulin]].{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=209}}\n\n===The return trip to Italy===\nIn 1891, the Mamontov family went to Italy. They planned travel itineraries around the interests of Abramtsevo pottery studio. Vrubel accompanied the family as a consultant which led to a conflict between him and Mamontov's wife, Elizaveta. Thus, Mamontov and Vrubel went to [[Milan]] where Vrubel\u2019s sister Elizaveta (Liliia) was studying.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=263}} It was suggested that the painter would spend winter in [[Rome]] where he might finish the Mamontov's order \u2013 decorations for \"[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]\" and design the new curtain for the [[Private Opera]]. Savva Mamontov paid Vrubel a monthly salary; however, an attempt to settle him in the Mamontov's house led to a scandal with Elizaveta after which Vrubel decided to stay with Svedomsky.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=264}}\n\nVrubel did not get along with other Russian artists working in Rome and continuously accused them with the lack of artistic talent, plagiarism, and other things. He was much closer to brothers Alexander and Pavel Svedomsky with whom he regularly visited variete \"Apollon\" and cafe \"Aran'o\". He also enjoyed their studio which was rebuilt from the former greenhouse. It had glass walls and the Roman ceiling which made it very hard to stay there in winter due to cold.  Svedomskys unconditionally recognized Vrubel's creative superiority and not only settled him at their house but also shared commercial orders with him.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=264\u2014266}} In the end, Mamontov arranged Vrubel's stay at the studio of half Italian [[Alexander Rizzoni]] who graduated from the Russian Academy of Arts. Vrubel highly respected him and willingly worked under the Rizzoni's supervision. The main reason for this was that Rizzoni considered himself as not entitled to interfere in the painter's personal style, but was picky about diligence. Vrubel subsequently wrote that \"I have not heard from many people so much fair but benevolent criticism\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=267}}\n\nIn winter 1892, Vrubel decided to participate in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] where he got an idea for the painting \"Snow-maiden\" (not preserved).

Due to regular commissioned works made for Mamontov, Vrubel\u2019s reputation in Moscow grew greatly. For instance, the painter received the order to decorate the Dunker family mansion on the Povarskaya Street. Also, together with the most famous architect of Moscow Art Nouveau [[Fyodor Schechtel]], Vrubel decorated the Zinaida Morozova's mansion on Spiridonovka street and A. Morozov's house in Podsosenskiy lane.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=272}}\n\nVrubel' decorative works illustrate how universal his talents were. The painter combined painting with architecture, sculpture and applied art. Karpova recognized his leading role in creating ensembles of Moscow Modern. Vrubel's sculpture attracted the attention of his contemporaries. For instance, at the end of his life,  [[Aleksandr Matveyev (sculptor)|Aleksandr Matveyev]] mentioned that \"without Vrubel there would be no [[Sergey Konenkov]]...\".{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}}\n\nThe gothic composition \"Robert and the Nuns\" is usually considered as the most important Vrubel's sculpture; it decorates the staircase of the Morozov mansion.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=267}} Literature on architecture emphasizes the exclusive role that Vrubel played in forming artistic appearances of the Moscow Art Nouveau.

The painting was painted over the destroyed portrait of the Mamontov's brother Nicolai.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=288\u2014289}}\n\nVrubel continued to follow his bohemian lifestyle. According to the Korovin\u2019s memoirs, after getting a large salary for watercolour panels, he spent them as follows:\n{{quote|He organized the dinner in the hotel \"Paris\" where he also lived. He invited everyone who stayed there.

Savva Mamontov was a curator of the exposition dedicated to the [[Far North (Russia)|Russian North]]. It was him who noticed that the neighbouring section of arts lacks the paintings that would cover two large empty walls. Mamontov discussed with the Minister of Finance his idea to cover these walls with large panels with total area 20 \u00d7 5 m and ordered these panels from Vrubel.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=297}} At that time, the painter was busy decorating the Morozov's mansion in Moscow. However, he agreed to take the offer even though the order was quite big \u2013 the total area of paintings was 100 square meters, and it needed to be finished in three months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=299}} He planned to decorate the first wall with the painting \"[[Mikula Selyaninovich]]\" that metaphorically depicted the Russian land. For the second wall, Vrubel chose \"The Princess of the Dream\" inspired by a work of the same name made by the French poet [[Edmond Rostand]]. The second painting symbolically represented the painter's dream of beauty.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=60}}\n\nIt was impossible to complete the order in such short notice. That is why Vrubel instructed painter T. Safonov from Nizhny Novgorod to start working on \"Mikula\". Safonov was supposed to paint according to Vrubel's sketches. The decorative frieze was finished by A. Karelin \u2013 son of a Russian photographer {{ill|Andrei Karelin|ru|\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d, \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041e\u0441\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=303}}\n\nOn March 5, 1896, academician [[Albert Nikolayevitch Benois]] reported to the Academy of Arts that the work that was being carried out in the art pavilion is incompatible with its thematic goals. Thus, Benois demanded from Vrubel sketches of the alleged panels. After arriving in Nizhny Novgorod on April 25, Benois sent a telegram: \n{{quote| Vrubel's panels are terrifying; we need to take them off, waiting for the juri.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=304}}}}\n[[File:Mikhail Vrubel.

The committee included [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Beklemishev]], [[Konstantin Savitsky]], [[Pavel Brullov]], and others. They concluded that it is impossible to exhibit Vrubel's works. Mamontov told Vrubel to continue working and went to Saint Petersburg to persuade the members of the committee. At the same time, while trying to put the plot of \"Mikula Selyaninovich\" on a canvas , Vrubel realized that he previously was not able to proportionate the figures properly. Thus he started to paint the new version right on the stage of the pavilion. Mamontov attempted to protect the painter and called for the convening of the new committee. However, his claims were rejected, and on May 22 Vrubel had to leave the exhibition hall while all of his works had been already taken.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=304\u2014305}}\n\nVrubel lost nothing financially since Mamontov bought both paintings for {{nobr|5 000}} rubles each. He also agreed with [[Vasily Polenov]] and Konstantin Korovin for them finishing the half-ready \"Mikula\". Canvases were rolled up and brought back to Moscow where Polenov and Korovin started working on them while Vrubel was finishing \"The Princess of the Dream\" in a shed of the Abramtsevo Pottery factory. Both canvases arrived in Nizhny Novgorod right before the emperor's visit scheduled on July 15-17.

According to the memoirs of his acquaintances, Vrubel started designing costumes for Nadezhda, redoing costumes for Tatiana Larina.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=319}} As was noted by Dmitrieva, Vrubel owes the fruitfulness of the ''Moscow period'' to Nadezhda and her admiration with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=75}} They personally met each other in 1898 when Nadezhda was invited to the [[Private Opera|Moscow private opera]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=64}} Zabela remembered that Vrubel listens to the opera \u201cSadko\u201d in which she sang the role of Princess of Volkhov no less than 90 times.

The painter was able to finish ''Pan'' in one day while being in [[Princess Maria Tenisheva|Tenisheva]]\u2019s mansion in [[Talashkino]]. The plot was drawn in a canvas on which he previously started to paint the portrait of his wife.

Stored at the [[Russian Museum]]]]\nTen years later, Vrubel returned to the theme of Demon which is evident from his correspondence with [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] at the end of 1898. Starting from the next year, the painter was torn between the paintings \u201c{{ill|Flying Demon|ru|\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043b\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439}}\u201d and \u201c[[The Demon Downcast]]\u201d. As a result, he chose the first variant, but the painting remained unfinished. The painting and several illustrations were inspired by intertwined plots of Lermontov\u2019s Demon and Pushkin\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet\u201d.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2001|p=17}} \n\n[[File:Wrubel-Portrait of Son-1902.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the painter\u2019s son, 1902.

The baby boy was born strong with well-developed muscles but had an [[Cleft lip and cleft palate|orofacial cleft]]. Nadezhda\u2019s sister, Ekaterina Ge, suggested that Mikhail had \u201ca particular taste hence he could find beauty in a certain irregularity. And this child, despite his lip, was so cute with his big blue eyes that his lip shocked people only in the first moment and then everyone would forget about it\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}\nWhile working on \u201cDemon\u201d, the painter created the large watercolour portrait of a six-month child sitting in a baby carriage. As [[Nikolai Tarabukin]] later recalled:\n{{Quote|The scared and mournful face of this tiny creature flashed like a meteor in this world and was full of unusual expressiveness and some childish wisdom. His eyes, as if prophetically, captured the whole tragic fate of his fragility.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=97}}}}\n\nThe birth of Savva led to a dramatic change in the routine of the family. Nadezhda Vruble decided to take a break in her career and refused to hire a nanny. Hence, Mikhail Vrubel had to support his family. Starting from September-October 1901, Vrubel had experienced first depression symptoms due to drastically increased number of working hours. Starting from November, he stopped working on \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d. Vrubel\u2019s biographer later wrote:\n{{Quote|For the whole winter Vrubel worked very intensively. Despite usual 3-4 hours, he worked up to 14 hours, and sometimes even more, with a flash of artificial lightning, never leaving the room and barely coming off the painting. Once a day he put up a coat, opened window leaf and inhaled some cold air \u2013 and called it his \u201cpromenade\u201d. Fully engaged in work, he became intolerant to any disturbance, did not want to see any guests and barely talked to the family. The ''Demon'' was many times almost finished, but Vrubel re-painted it over and over again.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=397}}}}\n{{wide image|Vrubel Fallen Demon.jpg|500px|''Demon Downcast'', 1902.

It is unusually spectacular, and was, even more, striking upon its creation when the pink crown sparkled, the peacock feathers flickered and shimmered (after a few years, the dazzling colours began to darken, dry up and now almost blackened). This exaggerated decorative effect itself deprives the painting of actual depth. To amaze and shock, the artist, who had already lost his emotional balance, betrayed his \u201ccult of a deep nature\u201d - and ''The Demon Dawncast'', from the purely formal side, more than any other paintings by Vrubel, was painted in the modern style\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=79}}\n\nVrubel\u2019s mental health continued to worsen. He started suffering from insomnia, from day to day, his anxiety increased, and the painter became unusually self-confident and verbose. On February 2, 1902, unsuccessful exposition of \u201cThe Demon Downcast\u201d in Moscow (the painter hoped that the painting would be bought for the Tretyakov Gallery) coincided with a suicide of [[Alexander Rizzoni]] following incorrect criticism in the \u201cMir isskusstva\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=408\u2014410}}\n\nThen the painting was brought to Saint Petersburg where Vrubel continued to constantly re-paint it. However, according to his friends, he only damaged it. Due to the painter\u2019s anxiety, his friends brought him to a famous psychiatrist [[Vladimir Bekhterev]] who diagnosed Vrubel with an ''incurable, progressive paralysis'' or [[Syphilis#Tertiary|tertiary syphilis]]. Mikhail Vrubel travelled to Moscow without knowing the diagnosis where his condition only worsened.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=412}} His painting was bought for 3 000 rubles by the famous collector {{ill|Vladimir von Meck|ru|\u0424\u043e\u043d \u041c\u0435\u043a\u043a, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}. Judging by the correspondence between Nadezhda Zabela and Rimsky-Korsakov, Vrubel ''got crazy'', drank a lot, wasted money and quickly broke off for any reason. His wife and son tried to escape him and ran to relatives in Ryazan, but he followed them. At the beginning of April, Vrubel was hospitalized to a private hospital run by Savvy Magilevich.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=413}}\n\n== Disease. Dying (1903-1910) ==\n\n===The first crisis===\nVrubel\u2019s madness attracted the attention of the press; however, the reviews were mostly negative. For example, the newspaper ''Russian leaflet'' published the article \u201cMental Decadents\u201d that led to the official statement of denying. Soon, the established painters started to publish articles where they claimed that ''The Demon Downcast'' ''has something that needs to be in every true artistic composition''.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=414}} [[Alexandre Benois]] also changed his opinion on Vrubel\u2019 paintings; he even added an emotional passage about the ''true poetic nature''of Vrubel\u2019s paintings to his book \u201cHistory of Russian XIX century Art\u201d.{{sfn|\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430|1999|p=409}} Then, Benois and Diaghilev decided to prove Vrubel\u2019s sanity to the public, and in 1902 organized the exhibition of 36 works, including all three of his \u201cDemons\u201d. This exhibition was a tipping point in defining public attitudes to Vrubel\u2019s art; however, not many believed in his potential recovery. Authors of the articles in \u201cMir Isskustva\u201d even wrote about Vrubel in the past tense as if they had already summed up his artistic career.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}}\n\nFrom April to August 1902, Vrubel\u2019s mental health was indeed so bad that even his sister and wife were not allowed to visit him. He was wild and needed constant supervision. In the moments when the disease receded, he was able to speak coherently and attempted to paint. However, all his drawings from this period presented \u201cprimitive pornography\u201d. Additionally, his [[grandiose delusions]] also strengthened. One of the main symptoms of his disease was a constant desire to tore the cloth and underwear apart. In September 1902, Vrubel\u2019s condition had improved somewhat, and he even stopped bugging and drawing pornography became polite. Thus, it was decided to transfer him to the [[Serbsky Center]] at the Moscow University run by [[Vladimir Serbsky]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=414\u2014415}} In the clinic, Vrubel\u2019s health generally improved even though his family was still prohibited from visiting. The painter started writing to his wife, mostly in a self-deprecating tone. Serbsky confirmed the diagnosis \u201cprogressive paralysis due to syphilitic infection\u201d of Vladimir Bekhterev and even found out that the contamination took place in 1892. After Vrubel was prescribed with mercury drugs and sedatives, his behaviour became more predictable. Mikhail started to receive guests, including Vladimir von Meck and [[Pyotr Konchalovsky]]. However, the painter avoided conversations about art and was constantly gloomy. The only expected outcome was physical and mental [[wikt:degradation|degradation]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=418\u2014419}}\n\n=== Death of son. The second crisis ===\n[[File:Six-winged Seraph (Azrael). 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Six-winged Seraph, 1904. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nIn February 1903, Vrubel was discharged from the clinic. He was lethargic and absent-minded, all attempts to paint led to nothing. Doctors advised to send him to [[Crimea]], however, by April, his [[apathy]] transformed into a heavy depression and the painter had to return to Moscow. Vladimir von Meck suggested the Vrubel family spend the summer in his mansion in the [[Kiev Governorate]]. That somehow cheered Vrubel up and Nadezhda was happy as well. Right before the departure, a two-years-old Savva Vrubel got sick. In Kiev, his disease got stronger, and on May 3, the child died. Vrubel moved from apathy to grief, starting actively plan the funeral. He tried to look peppy and support his wife, who did not say a word.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}} Savva was buried in the [[Baikove Cemetery]]. After losing their only child, the spouses went to von Meck since they did not know what to do next and how to behave. In the mansion, Vrubel's mental health significantly worsened, and in a week he said categorically: \"please, put me somewhere; otherwise, I will do you trouble\". However, he was very afraid of the clinic at the [[St. Cyril's Monastery (Kiev)|Saint Cyril\u2019s Monastery]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=103}}\n\nFollowing the advice of close to them doctor Tilling, it was decided to bring the painter to [[Riga]] where he was assigned to the country institution. Vrubel was in a heavy depression and wanted to commit suicide for which he refused to take any food. Symptoms were quite different from the previous crisis \u2013 instead of grandiose illusions Vrubel experienced delusions of self-abasement and hallucinations. However, the local doctor did not confirm the diagnosis of Bekhterev and Serbsky, claiming that Vrubel is an artist in melancholy and he needs to work. Thus, Vrubel returned to his old work the \"Easter jungle\" which was re-painted to \"Azrail\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=434}} Nadezhda Vrubel wrote to Anna Vrubel that Mikhail is sleep-deprived and he is again not satisfied with the face which he redrew continuously. Work did not improve his mental health. In addition, the painter became so weak that he could only move in a wheelchair while the flu that he had led to a [[rheumatism]]. His family and friends thought that he would not survive the following spring. However, the painter survived and in the summer, following the Serbsky's advise, on July 9, 1904, Vrubel was put in the sanitary clinic of {{ill|Fedor Usoltsev|ru|\u0423\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0424\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in Petrovsky park.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=436}}\n\n=== Treatment in the Usoltsev's clinic.

Sometimes he was even released to spend several hours alone with his wife. The idea behind rehabilitation in the Usoltsev's clinic was that patients would feel themselves like at home \u2013 that is why the clinic was in the private house of doctor Usoltsev where he and his family lived together with the patients.

At that time, the painter primarily drew portraits of doctors, orderlies, patients, acquaintances, players in cards and chess, landscape sketches. He also sketched the corners of his room and some simple objects, such as chairs, a dress threw on a chair, a crumpled bed (seria \"Insomnia\"), candlestick, carafe, a rose in a glass. Perhaps, with coming back to art, he felt the need to \"study [[figure drawing]] hard and humbly\". Instead of stylization, the painter applied a \"naive transfer of the most detailed life impressions\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1990|p=80}} Among other, Vrubel painted doctor Usoltsev, his wife and a student brother. The unfinished portrait of doctor Usoltsev against a gilded icon has been preserved. The painter was able to reflect on the patterned texture of the background and highlights on the image with only one black pencil without any colours, and he \"saved\" the face in these small details.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=116}}\n\nIn summer 1904, Nadezhda Zabela got an offer from the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. Since Vrubel could not imagine his life without her and doctor Usoltsev did not insist on his staying in the clinic; spouses moved to Saint Petersburg. Soon after that, Nadezhda realized that her voice lost its previous tonality due to experienced events. Thus, she could not anymore perform in the opera and eventually found herself in a [[chamber music]]. In that period, Vrubel painted a large number of her portraits depicting Nadezhda in different scenes. One of these paintings is a two-meter canvas \"After a concert\" that depicted Zabela in a dress created according to a Vrubel's design.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=442}}\n\n[[File:1905 Vrubel nach dem Konzert anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|\u201dAfter a concert\u201d, 1905.

A double issue of the journal \"Mir Isskustva\" (issue 10-11, 1903) was fully dedicated to Vrubel and his legacy. The issue published reproductions of his paintings and many critics publicly renounced their previously published negative reviews. One of the reasons for such a drastic change was recognition of [[impressionism]] and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] among European artistic circles. Thus, a particular symbolism, emotionality and figurativism of Vrubel' paintings came into fashion.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|pp=117\u2014118}}\n\n[[File:\u00ab\u0416\u0435\u043c\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430\u00bb.jpg|thumb|left|The Pearl Shell, 1904.

As with the illustrations for Lermontov' works, Vrubel created a lot of graphic sketches trying to catch and solve the problem of a \"black-white colourness\". However, the final version had the figures of sea princess on it, about which Vrubel later told to Prakhov:\n{{Quote|After all, I did not intend to paint any \"sea princesses\" in my \"Pearl\". I wanted to convey the drawing with all reality from which the game of pearl is constructed, and only after when I did several drawings with pencil and charcoal, I saw these princesses when I started to paint with colours\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}}}\n\nAt the same time, Dmitrieva did not appreciate this approach: \"figures that he unexpectedly for himself put in a pearl shell, hardly worthy of such a magical grotto. These cutesy figures are too reminiscent of their many long-haired sisters from a typical Art Nouveau decor; the artist himself vaguely felt it - he was not satisfied with his [[naiad]]s\". Later Vrubel kept seeing in their figures something obscene that appeared in the painting against his own will.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1984|p=125}}\n\nIn February 1905, Vrubel again started having the symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Nadezhda summoned Usoltsev from Moscow to look after his patient. Mikhail Vrubel understood everything and did not resist. Before departure to Moscow on March 6, he started saying goodbye to his friends and relatives, came to see Pavel Chistyakov in the Academy of Arts and visited the Panaevsky Theatre where he saw his wife for the first time.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=446}}\n\n===Last artistic activity===\n[[File:Vrubel Videnie proroka Iezekiilya 1906.jpg|thumb|The last Vrubel's painting \"The Vision of the Prophet Ezekiel\", 1906. Stored at the Russian Museum]]\nVera Usoltseva, the wife of doctor Usoltsev, described Vrubel's condition to Nadezhda Vrubel as follows:\n{{Quote| Mikhail's condition did not change. His sleep seemed to be a bit longer. He usually sleeps through the night for five hours, and a rare day so that he does not sleep at least three hours. He eats well and in due time. But, unfortunately, he tore his new summer coat and trousers apart. He pretended to be calm, went to bed, covered himself with a blanket, and started to tugging the cloth underneath and tearing it into strips before the servant had noticed \u2026 His physical strength is high, which is rare for an intelligent person\u2026 You asked, should you write to him or not. No, you should not. He does not pay attention to letters and does not write them himself.

However, his letters to Zabela are full of self-abasement and repentance. Despite the \"voices\" that tormented him, he returned to the theme of the Prophet, began to write the \"Six-winged Seraph\", and addressed the topic of vision of the Prophet [[Ezekiel]]. However, the painting remained unfinished since in the beginning of 1906, his vision started to drastically decrease proving the diagnosis of progressive paralysis. In addition, the painter was diagnosed with an [[optic neuropathy]].{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=449\u2014450}} Mikhail was kept in the clinic almost exclusively at the expense of his wife, which was not an easy task because a month of stay in the Usoltsev's clinic cost 100-150 rubles. On the contrary, the university clinic run by Serbsky costed only 9 rubles. The theatre administration understood the difficulty of Nadezhda's position. It kept her in the troupe on a salary of 3600 rubles per year that was sufficient enough to cover the expenses.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=452}}\n\n[[File:Vrubel Bryusov.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Valery Bryusov, 1906.

On  November 28 1905, he was awarded the title Academician of painting \"for fame in the artistic field\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|pp=452\u2014453}} After that, the editor of \"{{ill|Zolotoe runo|ru|\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u043d\u043e (\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b)}}\" Nicolai Ryabushinsky visited Vrubel in the clinic with the offer to paint  [[Valery Bryusov]]. The idea was to publish a series of portraits of famous contemporary writers. These portraits were supposed to be painted by the most acknowledged painters in the field. For instance, Serov was offered to paint [[Konstantin Balmont]]. Ryabushinsky paid 300 rubles for the portrait in advance and in addition bought  the [[self-portrait]] \u201cHead of Prophet\u201d for 100 rubles.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=451}} Bryusov later described the work on the portrait as follows:\n\n{{Quote|The door opened, and Vrubel came in. He entered with a wrong, heavy gait as if he was dragging his feet. To tell the truth, I was shocked when I saw Vrubel. It was a frail and sick person in a dirty, crumpled shirt. He had a reddish face and bird of prey eyes; protruding hair instead of a beard. First impression: crazy! <...> In real life, all small Vrubel's movement reflected his disorder. However, when his hand took a pencil or a lump of coal, it became very steady and confident. Lines that he drew were infallible.\n\nHis artistic strength survived everything else in him. The human died, was destroyed, but the master continued to live.\n\nDuring the first session, the first draft was already finished. I am really sorry that nobody thought of taking a picture of this dark drawing. It was almost even more remarkable in terms of performance, facial expression, and similarity than the later portrait painted with coloured pencils.{{sfn|\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432|2002|pp=242\u2014244}}}}\n\nThen Ryabushinsky commissioned Serov to paint the portrait of Vrubel. They organized the work, so Vrubel was able to paint Bruysov in the mornings, while Serov painted Vrubel in the afternoons.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=453}} Even though Nadezhda Zabela was concerned if Vrubel could handle such stress, Usoltsev categorically said that \"as an artist, he was healthy and deeply healthy.\" The first issue of the \"Zolotoe runo\" was published on February 1, 1906, with the Bryusov's poem \"To M. A. Vrubel\" opening the issue. Twelve days later, Vrubel complained to his wife that he could not read or paint. In few days, he became completely blind.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=456}}\n\n===Fading away.

After consulting with Usoltsev, it was decided to bring Vrubel back to Saint Petersburg since he did need any medical treatment only support from relatives and loved ones. Anna and Nadezhda settled in one apartment while Mikhail Vrubel was put in the excellent clinic run by doctor Konasevich where the painter celebrated his 50 years anniversary. However, the clinic was far away from home and had strict orders regarding the regime. Hence it was decided to transfer Vrubel to a hospital of Adolf Bari that was located on the 4-5 line of [[Vasilyevsky Island]] nearby the Academy of Arts and had a completely free regime.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=457}} Serov addressed the Academy of Arts with a request to pay Vrubel a monthly allowance that would cover some hospital expenses. The request was approved, and Vrubel started receiving 75 rubles in summer and 100 rubles in winter months.{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=458}}\n\nAfter Vrubel lost his sight, his violent seizures occurred much rarer. Nadezhda visited him regularly and sometimes even organized home concerts. Anna Vrubel visited brother daily, walked with him and read to him. Especially often they re-read [[Ivan Turgenev]] 's [[prose poetry]] and [[Anton Chekhov]] 's novella [[The Steppe (novella)|The Steppe]] on the grounds of which Vrubel once created a painting. Ekaterina Ge later recalled:\n{{quote|...

Some days he experienced enlightening and then complained about the misfortune that befell him.

In severe February of 1910, he deliberately stood idle near with an open window and provoked pneumonia, which turned into a transient [[tuberculosis]]. At the same time, he retained his inherent aesthetics until the very last minute. Ekaterina Ge remembered that he \"took [[quinine]] almost with pleasure, and when he saw a [[sodium salicylate]], he said: \"This is so ugly\". Even before that the doctor Usoltsev wrote that \"It was different with him than with any other patients that usually lose the most thin or aesthetic sense first because for them they come the last; Vrubel's aesthetic sense died last because it was the first for him\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0430|2014|p=461}}\n\nOn the eve of his death on 1 (14) April, 1910, Vrubel put himself in order, washed with cologne, and at night said to the nurse who was caring of him: \u201cNikolay, it\u2019s enough for me to lie here \u2013 we will go to the Academy.\u201d Indeed, the next day the coffin with Vrubel was put in the Academy of Arts.

She was buried near with her husband. Russian sculptor [[Leonid Sherwood]] decided to construct the tombstone on their graves, but by 1913 he was able only to set up the black granite pedestal. After the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] was severely damaged and many graves were destroyed. In the 1930s, a necropolis museum was organized in the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]]. Then they started to move the graves of famous artists from the Novodevichy Cemetery to a new museum, but the transfer remained unfinished due to lack of finance and later beginning of the [[World War II|war]]. An alleged transfer of the Vrubel\u2019s ash did not take place as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://family-history.ru/material/biography/mesto/vrubel/mogila/ |title=\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c\u0435\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u0432 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 |publisher=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Family-History.ru |access-date=2014-11-17}}</ref> In 2015, the public initiated establishment of the new tombstone on the Vrubel\u2019s grave, but local authorities refused the installation.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=\u041f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://planeta.ru/campaigns/mihail_vrubel |publisher=Planeta.ru |access-date=2017-10-29}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0410. |title=\u0412 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0435 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f |url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26736/3763475/ |date=2017-09-26 |publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 |access-date=2017-10-29}}</ref>\n\nVrubel\u2019s works are exhibited in [[The State Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow, [[Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg, Vrubel Museum of Fine Arts in Omsk, Kiev Art Gallery, [[Odessa Art Museum]], [[Belarusian National Arts Museum]], and other places.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D|title=\u041c. \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c \u201c\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u201d - \u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c |publisher=www.artmuseum.by|accessdate=2019-01-11 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103060635/http://www.artmuseum.by/ru/vyst/50-shedevrov-naczionalnogo-xudozhestvennogo-muzeya/m.-vrubel-%E2%80%9Cgenzel-i-gretel%E2%80%9D |archivedate=2019-01-03}}</ref> Many commemorative sights and objects are named after Vrubel in Omsk, Kiev, Voronezh, Moscow, Saratov, Odessa.\n\nMany researchers and critics have differently evaluated the impact that Vrubel had on Russian and Global art. According to Dmitrieva, his role was \u201cexclusive and separated\u201d.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} She did not consider Vrubel as a typical representative of Art Nouveau, mainly because he \"coincided with Art Nouveau in his far from best features\".{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=331}} According to Dmitrieva, Art Nouveau was not organic enough for Vrubel, much less than it was for [[L\u00e9on Bakst]] or Valentin Serov since Vrubel followed the \"cult of a deep nature\" that was not \"modern\" in its nature.{{sfn|\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430|1993|p=338}}\n\nAccording to {{ill|Vladimir Lenyashin|ru|\u041b\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0448\u0438\u043d, \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, Mikhail Vrubel was able to implement [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] as a harmonious aesthetic and philosophical system in the visual arts. At the same time, as a creator, he was supposed to be alone making the evolution from \"hermit, alchemist, alien from another esoteric space\" to the prophet{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=10}}. P. Klimov, who deliberately considered Vrubel's art in the context of Russian Art Nouveau, recognized him as a representative of the revolutionary thread of the Russian modern. Klimov also noted that Vrubel's position and significance in that cultural environment were only comparable to the place of [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]] in [[neoclassicism]]. This was due to a combination of natural Vrubel's gift and his later familiarization with Russian artistic world in general.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=64}}\n\nKlimov suggested that Vrubel started to express specific features of Art Nouveau already in the paintings from the \"Kiev period\", such as stylization as the main principle of form interpretation, aspiration for synthesis, emphasis on the role of the silhouette, cold colouring, symbolism of mood.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}}\n\nRapid evolution in the Vrubel's style could be explained with his detachment from any mainstream artistic movements of that time, such as neoclassicism or Peredvizhniki. Hence, he did not try to overcome the doctrines. Vrubel perceived academism as a starting point for his own movement forward, as a combination of essential professional skills.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68}} In terms of personality and artistic thinking, Mikhail was a pronounced individualist; he was alien to the ideas of social justice, collegiality or Orthodox unity that inspired other artists of his generation. Moreover, the loneliness of Vrubel can be purely explained by his social environment since being a bourgeois art form Art Nouveau in the 1880s had not yet had its followers in Russia. Vrubel had to wait for his admirers, customers and patrons to appear only in the mid-1890s.{{sfn|\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432|2010|p=68, 73}}\n\n==In the cinema==\n* [[1953]] \u2014 ''[[Rimsky-Korsakov (film)|Rimsky-Korsakov]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430, \u0410. \u041d.\n|title=\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0432 XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0435\n|publisher=\u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|year=1999\n|pages=448\n|isbn=5-250-02693-1\n|ref=\u0411\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412. \u042f.\n|title=\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430. \u041f\u0438\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u041e\u041b\u041c\u0410-\u041f\u0420\u0415\u0421\u0421\n|year=2002\n|pages=415\n|isbn=5-94850-030-6\n|ref=\u0411\u0440\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\n|title=\u0412\u0435\u0441\u044c \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433 \u043d\u0430 1914 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0430\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0433. \u0421.-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\n|place=Saint Petersburg\n|publisher=\u0422\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0410. \u0421. \u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u2013 \u00ab\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\u00bb\n|year=1914\n|isbn=5-94030-052-9\n|ref=Suvorkin}} \n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\n|title=\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430. \u0412\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435\n|place=Leningrad\n|publisher=\u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\n|year=1976\n|pages=383\n|ref=\u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d, \u041c. \u042e.\n|title=\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c. \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438\n|place=Moscow\n|publisher=\u0410\u0412\u0420\u041e\u0420\u0410\n|year=2010\n|pages=160\n|isbn=978-5-7300-0825-0\n|ref=\u0413\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d}}\n*{{cite book\n|author=\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d. \u0410.\n|title=\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432. \u0412\u044b\u043f.

He is the only British man to have won [[gold medal]]s in the [[100 metres]] at all four major competitions open to British athletes: the [[Olympic Games]], the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]], the [[European Athletics Championships|European Championships]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]]. He was the first European to break the [[10-second barrier]] in the 100&nbsp;m and still holds the [[UK records in athletics|British record]] in the event. He is a former [[world indoor record]] holder over [[200 metres]], and a former [[List of European records in athletics|European record]] holder in the [[60 metres]], 100 m and [[4 \u00d7 100 metres relay]].\n\nHe remains one of the most highly decorated British athletes of all-time. By the end of his track career Christie had won 24 medals overall, more than any other British male athlete before or since. In 1993 he was awarded the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award|BBC Sports Personality of the Year]].\nDespite first testing positive for a prohibited substance in 1988, it was only following his failed drug testing in 1999 that he was banned from competition by IAAF.\n\n==Early life and education==\nChristie was born in [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew, Jamaica]], where he was brought up by his grandmother. At the age of seven he followed his parents, who had emigrated to [[Acton, London]], England, five years before. He was educated at [[Fulham College Boys\u2019 School|Henry Compton Secondary School]] in [[Fulham]], London and excelled in [[physical education]]. He competed in the very first [[London Youth Games]] in 1977 for the borough of [[Hammersmith & Fulham]].<ref>[http://www.londonyouthgames.org/page.asp?section=23&sectionTitle=Hall+of+Fame Hall of Fame] Retrieved on 2013-02-19</ref> He also joined the [[Air Training Corps]] in 1978, 336 (Hammersmith) Squadron. He did not take up athletics seriously until he was 19.\n\n==Professional athletics career==\nChristie's early track career was not promising. He failed to make the Great Britain team for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], not even being included in the sprint relay squad. It was not until he began to work in earnest under the coaching of [[Ron Roddan]] that he began to fulfill his potential.\n\nIn 1986, he was the surprise winner of the 100&nbsp;m at the [[1986 European Championships in Athletics#Track|European Championships]] and finished second in the same event at the [[Commonwealth Games]] in Edinburgh, behind [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]. At the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics]] in Rome, Christie came fourth in the 100&nbsp;m, but was later awarded the [[bronze medal]], when winner Johnson was disqualified after admitting years of [[doping in sport|steroid use]].\n\nAt the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], Christie won the 100&nbsp;m [[Silver medal|silver]] behind [[Carl Lewis]] after Johnson, who set a world record in 9.79&nbsp;seconds, was again disqualified following a positive drug test. Christie's time was 9.97 seconds, a new European record by 0.03 seconds and only happened twice until before then that anyone had ever broken the ten-second barrier but not won the race.\n\nIn 1992, Christie became the third British athlete to win the Olympic 100&nbsp;m, after [[Harold Abrahams]] and [[Allan Wells]], winning the title ahead of [[Frankie Fredericks]] of [[Namibia]] at the [[Barcelona Olympic Games]]. In the absence of his great rival Lewis, Christie ran 9.96&nbsp;s in the final, and at the age of 32 years 121 days became the oldest Olympic 100&nbsp;m champion by four years and 38 days.\n\nIn 1993, he became the first man in history to hold the Olympic, World, [[1990 European Championships in Athletics#Track|European]] and Commonwealth titles in the 100&nbsp;m as he was victorious at the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics|Stuttgart World Championships]] in his fastest ever time of 9.87.<ref name=\"Athlete Profile\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=41565|title=Power of 10: Linford Christie|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> That year he was also voted [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]].

McVicar had insinuated in a satirical magazine that Christie's remarkable rise from 156th in the world to triumph at an age when he should have been in decline could only have been achieved through performance-enhancing drugs. The jury found in Christie's favour by a 10\u20132 majority. The judge ordered that McVicar should be bound by an injunction restraining him from accusing Christie of taking banned substances. The modest \u00a340,000 damages awarded were outweighed by the legal costs that Christie incurred to bring the case. After the judgment, McVicar called Christie \"The [[Judy Garland]] of the 100 metres\", referring to the emotion that Christie had given before the court.<ref>Thackray, Rachelle (28 June 1998).

A routine unannounced drug test found the banned substance [[nandrolone]]. After a six-month delay, a disciplinary hearing was convened by the [[UK Athletics|British Athletic Federation]] which found Christie to be not guilty. But the [[IAAF]] overruled and confirmed a two-year suspension. He was found to have more than 100 times normal levels of the metabolites of nandrolone in his urine. Various explanations were offered to explain the results, including eating avocado, or using nutritional supplements.<ref>Professor Ron Maughan, [[University of Aberdeen]].

By way of context, [[Nandrolone]] is a long-acting [[anabolic steroid]], and is well-known in athlete circles to be detectable in blood and urine screenings for long periods; ranging from 6 to 18 months.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ayotte |first1=C. |title=Significance of 19\u2010norandrosterone in athletes' urine samples |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657496/ |website=NCBI |publisher=British Journal of Sports Medicine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Skeptics of Christie's positive, and other [[Nandrolone]] sanctions in the late 1990s, have cited this detection window as a major deterrent to using the drug at any point during training or competition periods. Around this time [[Androgen_prohormone|pro-hormones]] like [[Bolandione|19-norandrostenedione]], [[Androstenedione]], and [[1-Testosterone]], among others, abounded in the American supplement market, and were not yet codified as '[[anabolic agents]]' under the [[Controlled_Substances_Act|Federal Controlled Substances Act]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=G.A. |last2=Vukovich |first2=M. |last3=King |first3=D.S. |title=Testosterone prohormone supplements |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16888459 |website=NCBI |publisher=Medical Science of Sport and Exercise |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Given that Christie tested positive for Nandrolone, it is conceivable that he had been taking 19-norandrostenedione, a metabolic precursor to [[Nandrolone]] sold over-the-counter in the United States until 2004. At the time Christie had been training in Florida in the winter months, and may have been using the prohormone without knowing it could produce a [[positive test]].\nAlternatively, Christie may have been under the impression he was administering a different anabolic steroid with a narrower testing window. Substances like [[Masteron]] and [[Primobolan]] are esterified in oil similar to Nandrolone, and would be indistinguishable if mislabeled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Masteron |url=https://www.evolutionary.org/masteron |website=evolutionary.org |publisher=Evolutionary.Org |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ALL THE INFORMATIONS ABOUT METHENOLONE ENANTHATE (PRIMOBOLAN DEPOT) EFFECT AND USAGE |url=http://primobolan.online/ |publisher=Primobolan Online |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Granted, there is no evidence to support this, but it would certainly explain why an athlete of his maturity and stature was found positive for metabolites well-known to stay in adipose tissue for many months.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ayotte |first1=C. |title=Significance of 19\u2010norandrosterone in athletes' urine samples |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657496/ |website=NCBI |publisher=British Journal of Sports Medicine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>        \n\nChristie has always denied any wrongdoing. \"If I took drugs there had to be a reason to take drugs.

Only by testing all athletes will the sport be kept clean of drugs.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nChristie was banned for life from the [[British Olympic Association]], who announced that Christie would not be accredited for any future Olympic Games, in accordance with their regulations. The ban also resulted in [[Puma AG|Puma]] opting not to continue Christie's \u00a3100,000 sponsorship contract.

The term ''Linford's lunchbox'' had been coined by ''The Sun'' newspaper in reference to the bulge of Christie's genitalia in his [[Lycra]] shorts.

Jamaican-born British former [[Sprint (running)|sprinter]]. He is the only British man to have won [[gold medal]]s in the [[100 metres]] at all four major competitions open to British athletes: the [[Olympic Games]], the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]], the [[European Athletics Championships|European Championships]] and the [[Commonwealth Games]]. He was the first European to break the [[10-second barrier]] in the 100&nbsp;m and still holds the [[UK records in athletics|British record]] in the event. He is a former [[world indoor record]] holder over [[200 metres]], and a former [[List of European records in athletics|European record]] holder in the [[60 metres]], 100 m and [[4 \u00d7 100 metres relay]].\n\nHe remains one of the most highly decorated British athletes of all-time. By the end of his track career Christie had won 24 medals overall, more than any other British male athlete before or since. In 1993 he was awarded the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award|BBC Sports Personality of the Year]].\nDespite first testing positive for a prohibited substance in 1988, it was only following his failed drug testing in 1999 that he was banned from competition by IAAF.\n\n==Early life and education==\nChristie was born in [[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew, Jamaica]], where he was brought up by his grandmother. At the age of seven he followed his parents, who had emigrated to [[Acton, London]], England, five years before. He was educated at [[Fulham College Boys\u2019 School|Henry Compton Secondary School]] in [[Fulham]], London and excelled in [[physical education]]. He competed in the very first [[London Youth Games]] in 1977 for the borough of [[Hammersmith & Fulham]].<ref>[http://www.londonyouthgames.org/page.asp?section=23&sectionTitle=Hall+of+Fame Hall of Fame] Retrieved on 2013-02-19</ref> He also joined the [[Air Training Corps]] in 1978, 336 (Hammersmith) Squadron. He did not take up athletics seriously until he was 19.\n\n==Professional athletics career==\nChristie's early track career was not promising. He failed to make the Great Britain team for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], not even being included in the sprint relay squad. It was not until he began to work in earnest under the coaching of [[Ron Roddan]] that he began to fulfill his potential.\n\nIn 1986, he was the surprise winner of the 100&nbsp;m at the [[1986 European Championships in Athletics#Track|European Championships]] and finished second in the same event at the [[Commonwealth Games]] in Edinburgh, behind [[Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]. At the [[1987 World Championships in Athletics]] in Rome, Christie came fourth in the 100&nbsp;m, but was later awarded the [[bronze medal]], when winner Johnson was disqualified after admitting years of [[doping in sport|steroid use]].\n\nAt the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], Christie won the 100&nbsp;m [[Silver medal|silver]] behind [[Carl Lewis]] after Johnson, who set a world record in 9.79&nbsp;seconds, was again disqualified following a positive drug test. Christie's time was 9.97 seconds, a new European record by 0.03 seconds and only happened twice until before then that anyone had ever broken the ten-second barrier but not won the race.\n\nIn 1992, Christie became the third British athlete to win the Olympic 100&nbsp;m, after [[Harold Abrahams]] and [[Allan Wells]], winning the title ahead of [[Frankie Fredericks]] of [[Namibia]] at the [[Barcelona Olympic Games]]. In the absence of his great rival Lewis, Christie ran 9.96&nbsp;s in the final, and at the age of 32 years 121 days became the oldest Olympic 100&nbsp;m champion by four years and 38 days.\n\nIn 1993, he became the first man in history to hold the Olympic, World, [[1990 European Championships in Athletics#Track|European]] and Commonwealth titles in the 100&nbsp;m as he was victorious at the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics|Stuttgart World Championships]] in his fastest ever time of 9.87.<ref name=\"Athlete Profile\">{{cite web|url= http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=41565|title=Power of 10: Linford Christie|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> That year he was also voted [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]]. The following year, in 1994, he defended his [[1994 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] title in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in his second fastest ever 100 m time of 9.91.<ref name=\"Athlete Profile\" />\n\nDefending his [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympic title in 1996]], Christie was disqualified in the final after two false starts. He said: \"The first one I knew I did, but on the second one I felt I reacted perfectly to the gun. I have never been disqualified from a race before in my life. What a place to do it.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/christie-self-destructs-in-defence-of-his-title-1330976.html | title=Christie self-destructs in defence of his title| date=29 July 1996}}</ref> His reaction time was 0.086 seconds. Under IAAF rules, sprinters are not allowed to start from their blocks faster than 0.1 seconds.\n\nChristie retired from representative international competition in 1997,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/412020.stm Christie: Legend under fire] [[BBC Sport]] (4 August 1999) Retrieved on 2009-01-20</ref> although he continued to make appearances at invitation meetings.\n\n===Allegations of doping and ban===\nChristie faced an [[International Olympic Committee]] disciplinary hearing at the 1988 Seoul Olympics because of an adverse drug test for the banned stimulant [[pseudoephedrine]] after he ran in the heats of the 200m. He escaped sanction after the committee voted by a margin of 11 to 10 and gave Christie \"the benefit of the doubt.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/and-what-inquired-mlud-is-linfords-lunch-box-1165856.html |title = And what, inquired M'Lud, is Linford's lunch box?|date = 19 June 1998}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/1033514.stm Christie takes the stand] [[BBC Sport]] (21 November 2000) Retrieved on 2009-01-20</ref> Christie argued that he had taken it inadvertently in [[ginseng tea]].\n\nAt the 1994 European championships staged in [[Helsinki]], where British team captain Christie won his third European 100 m title, he was caught up in a doping controversy after [[Solomon Wariso]], a [[400 metres|400 m]] runner making his international championship debut, tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine. Wariso revealed that he had used an over-the-counter pick-you-up called \"Up Your Gas\", which Christie had bought at a Florida pharmacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/athletics/4768790/Shadow-over-Christies-reputation.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Shadow over Christie's reputation | first=Tom | last=Knight | date=22 August 2000 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, less than six months before his first positive drug test, Christie won a [[libel]] action against the journalist [[John McVicar]]. McVicar had insinuated in a satirical magazine that Christie's remarkable rise from 156th in the world to triumph at an age when he should have been in decline could only have been achieved through performance-enhancing drugs. The jury found in Christie's favour by a 10\u20132 majority. The judge ordered that McVicar should be bound by an injunction restraining him from accusing Christie of taking banned substances. The modest \u00a340,000 damages awarded were outweighed by the legal costs that Christie incurred to bring the case. After the judgment, McVicar called Christie \"The [[Judy Garland]] of the 100 metres\", referring to the emotion that Christie had given before the court.<ref>Thackray, Rachelle (28 June 1998).

A routine unannounced drug test found the banned substance [[nandrolone]]. After a six-month delay, a disciplinary hearing was convened by the [[UK Athletics|British Athletic Federation]] which found Christie to be not guilty. But the [[IAAF]] overruled and confirmed a two-year suspension. He was found to have more than 100 times normal levels of the metabolites of nandrolone in his urine. Various explanations were offered to explain the results, including eating avocado, or using nutritional supplements.<ref>Professor Ron Maughan, [[University of Aberdeen]].

By way of context, [[Nandrolone]] is a long-acting [[anabolic steroid]], and is well-known in athlete circles to be detectable in blood and urine screenings for long periods; ranging from 6 to 18 months.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ayotte |first1=C. |title=Significance of 19\u2010norandrosterone in athletes' urine samples |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657496/ |website=NCBI |publisher=British Journal of Sports Medicine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Skeptics of Christie's positive, and other [[Nandrolone]] sanctions in the late 1990s, have cited this detection window as a major deterrent to using the drug at any point during training or competition periods. Around this time [[Androgen_prohormone|pro-hormones]] like [[19-norandrostenedione]], [[Androstenedione]], and [[1-Testosterone]], among others, abounded in the American supplement market, and were not yet codified as '[[anabolic agents]]' under the [[Controlled_Substances_Act|Federal Controlled Substances Act]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=G.A. |last2=Vukovich |first2=M. |last3=King |first3=D.S. |title=Testosterone prohormone supplements |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16888459 |website=NCBI |publisher=Medical Science of Sport and Exercise |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Given that Christie tested positive for Nandrolone, it is conceivable that he had been taking [[19-norandrostenedione]], a metabolic precursor to [[Nandrolone]] sold over-the-counter in the United States until 2004. At the time Christie had been training in Florida in the winter months, and may have been using the prohormone without knowing it could produce a [[positive test]].\nAlternatively, Christie may have been under the impression he was administering a different anabolic steroid with a narrower testing window. Substances like [[Masteron]] and [[Primobolan]] are esterified in oil similar to Nandrolone, and would be indistinguishable if mislabeled.<ref>{{cite web |title=Masteron |url=https://www.evolutionary.org/masteron |website=evolutionary.org |publisher=Evolutionary.Org |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=ALL THE INFORMATIONS ABOUT METHENOLONE ENANTHATE (PRIMOBOLAN DEPOT) EFFECT AND USAGE |url=http://primobolan.online/ |publisher=Primobolan Online |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> Granted, there is no evidence to support this, but it would certainly explain why an athlete of his maturity and stature was found positive for metabolites well-known to stay in adipose tissue for many months.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ayotte |first1=C. |title=Significance of 19\u2010norandrosterone in athletes' urine samples |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657496/ |website=NCBI |publisher=British Journal of Sports Medicine |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>        \n\nChristie has always denied any wrongdoing. \"If I took drugs there had to be a reason to take drugs. I had pretty much retired from the sport.\" Furthermore, he denied that his physique was gained through drug use and promoted an anti-steroid approach: \"It does not follow that all athletes who are big take drugs... Only by testing all athletes will the sport be kept clean of drugs.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nChristie was banned for life from the [[British Olympic Association]], who announced that Christie would not be accredited for any future Olympic Games, in accordance with their regulations. The ban also resulted in [[Puma AG|Puma]] opting not to continue Christie's \u00a3100,000 sponsorship contract. Three years earlier, at the Atlanta Olympics, Christie had worn contact lenses embossed with the Puma logo at the press conference preceding the 100&nbsp;m final.<ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/OlympicsGallery/jul25_eyes.html Olympics Photo gallery] Canoe.ca (25 July 1996) Retrieved 2009-01-20</ref> [[Reebok]] had paid $40&nbsp;million to be the official sponsor, and Christie's actions were seen as [[ambush marketing]] and a breach of Olympic rules on the wearing of sponsor's logos by athletes.<ref>[http://www.iprights.com/publications/articles/article.asp?articleID=165 Incoming URL Redirect] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928042353/http://www.iprights.com/publications/articles/article.asp?articleID=165 |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nSince his retirement, Christie worked as a presenter on the BBC programmes ''[[Record Breakers]]'' and ''[[Garden Invaders]]'', and also had a contract with BBC Sport. He has spent less time as a public figure and has devoted most of his time to managing his company.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267215/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Record Breakers at IMDB]</ref> In 2000 he made his acting debut in the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Grange Hill]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0834284/ Grange Hill at IMDB]</ref> Later he appeared in another [[BBC]] programme ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]''. In 2010, Christie appeared on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television channel's ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]'' show, subsequently becoming the sixth person to be eliminated, on 30 November 2010.\n\nDuring the McVicar case, Christie raised another of his grievances with the media \u2013 comments about the figure-hugging running suits that Christie wore in his races. The term ''Linford's lunchbox'' had been coined by ''The Sun'' newspaper in reference to the bulge of Christie's genitalia in his [[Lycra]] shorts. He said \"''Linford's lunchbox'' is one of my grievances with the media. I don't like it ... Nobody ever goes on about [[Sally Gunnell]]'s breasts ...

The picker would be expected to only select the ripest and healthiest fruits. An observer who only sees the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most, or even all, of the tree's fruit is in a likewise good condition. This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit (since it is only a sample and is not a [[representative sample]]). A concept sometimes confused with cherry picking is the idea of gathering only the fruit that is easy to harvest, while ignoring other fruit that is higher up on the tree and thus more difficult to obtain (see [[low-hanging fruit]]).\n\nCherry picking has a negative connotation as the practice neglects, overlooks or directly suppresses evidence that could lead to a complete picture. \n\nCherry picking can be found in many [[fallacy|logical fallacies]]. For example, the \"fallacy of [[anecdotal evidence]]\" tends to overlook large amounts of data in favor of that known personally, \"selective use of evidence\" rejects material unfavorable to an argument, while a [[false dichotomy]] picks only two options when more are available. Cherry picking can refer to the selection of data or data sets so a study or survey will give desired, predictable results which may be misleading or even completely contrary to reality.<ref name=\"Goldacre2008\">{{cite book|last=Goldacre|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Goldacre|title=Bad Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gv1NQubrGNIC|year=2008|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-728319-4|pages=97\u201399}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAn anecdotal story about the 5th century BC atheist philosopher [[Diagoras of Melos]] says how, when shown the votive gifts of people who had supposedly escaped death by shipwreck by praying to gods, he pointed out that many people ''had'' died at sea in spite of their prayers, yet these cases were not likewise commemorated.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jennifer Michael|last=Hecht|authorlink=Jennifer Michael Hecht|title=Doubt: A History|publisher=Harper San Francisco|year=2003|chapter=Whatever Happened to Zeus and Hera?, 600 BCE-1 CE|pages=9\u201310|isbn=0-06-009795-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QJb16_AAePkC&pg=PA10}}</ref> [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533-1592) in his [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay on prophecies]] comments on people willing to believe in the validity of supposed seers: \n{{quote|I see some who are mightily given to study and comment upon their almanacs, and produce them to us as an authority when anything has fallen out pat; and, for that matter, it is hardly possible but that these alleged authorities sometimes stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite number of lies. ...

Cherry picking in debates is a large problem as the facts themselves are true but need to be put in context.

It may not even make the argument unsound. The fallacy consists in persuading readers, and perhaps ourselves, that we have said enough to tilt the scale of evidence and therefore enough to justify a judgment. If we have been one-sided, though, then we haven't yet said enough to justify a judgment. The arguments on the other side may be stronger than our own. We won't know until we examine them.  So the one-sidedness fallacy doesn't mean that your premises are false or irrelevant, only that they are incomplete.\"<ref name=\"Suber\">{{cite web |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/inflogic/onesided.htm |title=The One-Sidedness Fallacy |author=Peter Suber |accessdate=25 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"With rational messages, you need to decide if you want to use a one-sided argument or a two-sided argument. A one-sided argument only presents the pro side of the argument, while a two-sided argument presents both sides. Which one you use will depend on which one meets your needs and the type of audience. Generally, one-sided arguments are better with audiences already favorable to your message. Two-sided arguments are best with audiences who are opposed to your argument, are better educated or have already been exposed to counter arguments.\"<ref name=\"Suber\"/>\n\n'''Card stacking''' is a [[propaganda]] technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another.<ref>{{cite book |title=The fine art of propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin's s=Institute for Propaganda Analysis |first= |authorlink= |year=1939 |publisher=Harcourt Brace and Company |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=95\u2013101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzVMAAAAIAAJ&q=%22card+stacking%22&dq=%22card+stacking%22&hl=en&ei=61PtTK63KYOglAe5hpmcAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> Such emphasis may be achieved through [[media bias]] or the use of [[One-sided argument|one-sided]] testimonials, or by simply [[Censorship|censoring]] the voices of critics.

The picker would be expected to only select the ripest and healthiest fruits. An observer who only sees the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most, or even all, of the tree's fruit is in a likewise good condition. This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit (since it is only a sample and is not a [[representative sample]]). A concept sometimes confused with cherry picking is the idea of gathering only the fruit that is easy to harvest, while ignoring other fruit that is higher up on the tree and thus more difficult to obtain (see [[low-hanging fruit]]).\n\nCherry picking has a negative connotation as the practice neglects, overlooks or directly suppresses evidence that could lead to a complete picture. \n\nCherry picking can be found in many [[fallacy|logical fallacies]]. For example, the \"fallacy of [[anecdotal evidence]]\" tends to overlook large amounts of data in favor of that known personally, \"selective use of evidence\" rejects material unfavorable to an argument, while a [[false dichotomy]] picks only two options when more are available.

Cherry picking in debates is a large problem as the facts themselves are true but need to be put in context. Because research cannot be done live and is often untimely, cherry-picked facts or quotes usually stick in the public mainstream and, even when corrected, lead to widespread misrepresentation of groups targeted.\n\n==One-sided argument<!--'One-sided argument' redirects here-->==\nA '''one-sided argument''' (also known as '''card stacking''', '''stacking the deck''', '''ignoring the counterevidence''', '''slanting''', and '''suppressed evidence''')<ref name=stacking>{{cite web|title=One-Sidedness - The Fallacy Files|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/onesided.html|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> is an [[informal fallacy]] that occurs when only the reasons supporting a proposition are supplied, while all reasons opposing it are omitted.\n\nPhilosophy professor [[Peter Suber]] has written: \"The one-sidedness fallacy does not make an argument invalid. It may not even make the argument unsound. The fallacy consists in persuading readers, and perhaps ourselves, that we have said enough to tilt the scale of evidence and therefore enough to justify a judgment. If we have been one-sided, though, then we haven't yet said enough to justify a judgment. The arguments on the other side may be stronger than our own. We won't know until we examine them.  So the one-sidedness fallacy doesn't mean that your premises are false or irrelevant, only that they are incomplete.\"<ref name=\"Suber\">{{cite web |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/inflogic/onesided.htm |title=The One-Sidedness Fallacy |author=Peter Suber |accessdate=25 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"With rational messages, you need to decide if you want to use a one-sided argument or a two-sided argument. A one-sided argument only presents the pro side of the argument, while a two-sided argument presents both sides. Which one you use will depend on which one meets your needs and the type of audience. Generally, one-sided arguments are better with audiences already favorable to your message. Two-sided arguments are best with audiences who are opposed to your argument, are better educated or have already been exposed to counter arguments.\"<ref name=\"Suber\"/>\n\n'''Card stacking''' is a [[propaganda]] technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another.<ref>{{cite book |title=The fine art of propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin's s=Institute for Propaganda Analysis |first= |authorlink= |year=1939 |publisher=Harcourt Brace and Company |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=95\u2013101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzVMAAAAIAAJ&q=%22card+stacking%22&dq=%22card+stacking%22&hl=en&ei=61PtTK63KYOglAe5hpmcAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}</ref> Such emphasis may be achieved through [[media bias]] or the use of [[One-sided argument|one-sided]] testimonials, or by simply [[Censorship|censoring]] the voices of critics.
