It occurred about {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} southwest of the fortress of Groznaya (now [[Grozny]]) between forces of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and North Caucasian mountaineers led by the ''naib'' (viceroy) Ahberdila Muhammad. It remains famous because of the poem \"[[Valerik (poem)|Valerik]]\" by [[Mikhail Lermontov]], a participant.\n\n==Situation in the eastern Caucasus on the eve of the battle==\nAn attempt to disarm the population of [[Chechnya]] in the spring of 1840 had caused unrest which grew into open rebellion against the Russian authorities. The Caucasus resistance leader, [[Imam Shamil]], took this opportunity to appoint Ahberdila Muhammad as ''naib'' (governor) of Lesser Chechnya and call for a general uprising of the [[Nadterechny District|''Nadterechny'']] Chechens, the tribes inhabiting [[Ingushetia]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Galashevtsy|ru|3=\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b}} ([[Galashki]]ans), and the [[Arshtins]]. The Russian authorities felt compelled to organize a military expedition against the rebels.\n\n[[File:Chechen group actions-1840.07.06-14.svg|thumb|left|Movements of the Galafeyev detachment July 6\u201314, 1840]]\nOn July 6, the Galafeyev detachment set out from the Groznaya fortress and began destroying the fields and villages to the south and southwest of the fortress, as the inhabitants fled. The rebels did not resist directly, but engaged in constant harassing actions which afflicted the Russians and caused losses.\n\nThe detachment's line of march led toward the village of [[Achkhoy-Martan|Achkhoy]], the road to which passed through the Chekhinsky Forest and crossed the [[Valerik River]]. The rebels apparently anticipated the Russian movement and for three days fortified the banks of the Valerik with [[abatis]] and debris. On July 11 the Galafeyev detachment decamped from the village of Gekhi and moved toward the Valerik.\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===The Russians===\n{| width = \"60%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n |+'''Composition and size of the detachment of Lieutenant General A.

The approaches to the river saw the first clash as the rebels fired on the column from the forest undergrowth. The Russian advance guard, however, quickly chased off the enemy and the column's battle order was restored.\n\nSoon a Russian detachment reached the Valerik. The river at this point intersects the road the Russians were using almost perpendicularly, and in normal conditions is easily fordable. The bank on the Russian side is an open beach, but the opposite bank is steep and wooded. On both sides of the road the rebels had cut down trees to create a clear field of fire about the length of a musket shot.\n\nApproaching the river to within [[Canister shot|canister]] range, the Russian gunners [[Reconnaissance by fire|fired a volley]] into the thicket on the opposite shore, but no reaction was seen.\n\nThe vanguard of the infantry battalions were preparing to cross the river and occupy the forest on both sides of the road, to facilitate the passage of the baggage train and other units. Parts of the main body were deployed in their support. At this point, the rebels began to fire on the Russians from across the river.\n\nThe battalions of the Kurinsky Regiment, with [[combat engineers]], rushed forward on both sides of the road and crossed the river, where on the opposite side was a rebel fortified blockhouse of logs, and engaged the enemy in a bayonet fight in the forest thicket. The rebels broke before the onslaught and started to retreat, but many of them, cut off from their own people, ran out of the woods near the river where they came under Russian artillery fire from the opposite bank, which drove them back into the woods.\n\nSeparate groups of rebels cut off from the main forces attempted to attack the convoy and the headquarters of General Galafeyev, but were everywhere repulsed. Skirmishes continued for some time in the forest near the abatis, which the rebels defended particularly tenaciously, but by six o'clock the battle began to subside and the engineers, withdrawn from the forest, began to assist the convoy in crossing the Valerik.\n\n===Casualties===\nAccording to the action report of the Galafeyev detachment, the unit's losses were:\n*Killed: One officer, 65 lower ranks\n*Wounded: Two staff officers, 15 other officers, 198 lower ranks\n*Shell-shocked: Four officers, 46 lower ranks\n*Missing: One officer, seven lower ranks\n\n29 Russian horses were killed and 42 injured.\n\nThe rebels left 150 dead on the battlefield. According to the reports of spies, Ahberdila Muhammad was shot in the leg. Lermontov stated in a letter that 600 bodies were left by the rebels.<ref name=AATSEEL/>\n\n==  Results and implications==\nAfter crossing the Valerik, the Galafeyev detachment moved to Achkhoy, meeting no further serious resistance. Some minor clashes and skirmishes continued.\n\nLocal residents said that the rebels had been sure that the Russians would not be able to cross the Valerik, so at Achkhoy and other nearby villages the residents did not leave until the Russians actually arrived. Here the Galafeyev detachment was met by troops under Major General [[Ivan Labyntsev]] who had been performing similar operations in Ingushetia. On July 14 the Galafeyev detachment returned to Groznaya.\n\nAfter a series of similar operations in the late summer and autumn of 1840, the rebellion in Chechnya and Ingushetia was extinguished. The rebels, who did not want to accept this situation, were forced to leave the mountainous region of [[Dagestan]], and a strategic success against the Russian authorities was not obtained.\n\n==Lermontov's role and poem==\n{{Main|Valerik (poem)}}\n[[Mikhail Lermontov]], a lieutenant in the Tenginsky Regiment, showed exemplary valor in the battle. The official battle report stated:\n{{quotation|This officer [Lermontov], disregarding any danger, fulfilled his duties with outstanding courage and composure, and was with the first rank of the bravest soldiers assaulting the enemy's entrenchments.}}\nFor this, Lermontov was awarded the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] Fourth Class, but he never received the award as his name was removed from the final list of recipients by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Czar Nicholas I]], who harbored a strong dislike for the [[wikt:contumacious|contumacious]] poet.<ref name=Rumyantsev/>\n\nLermontov's poem \"Valerik\" was first published (with omissions) in 1843 in the anthology ''Dawn''.

It occurred about {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} southwest of the fortress of Groznaya (now [[Grozny]]) between forces of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] and North Caucasian mountaineers led by the ''naib'' (viceroy) Ahberdila Muhammad.

The Caucasus resistance leader, [[Imam Shamil]], took this opportunity to appoint Ahberdila Muhammad as ''naib'' (governor) of Lesser Chechnya and call for a general uprising of the [[Nadterechny District|''Nadterechny'']] Chechens, the tribes inhabiting [[Ingushetia]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Galashevtsy|ru|3=\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0446\u044b}} ([[Galashki]]ans), and the [[Arshtins]]. The Russian authorities felt compelled to organize a military expedition against the rebels.\n\n[[File:Chechen group actions-1840.07.06-14.svg|thumb|left|Movements of the Galafeyev detachment July 6\u201314, 1840]]\nOn July 6, the Galafeyev detachment set out from the Groznaya fortress and began destroying the fields and villages to the south and southwest of the fortress, as the inhabitants fled. The rebels did not resist directly, but engaged in constant harassing actions which afflicted the Russians and caused losses.\n\nThe detachment's line of march led toward the village of [[Achkhoy-Martan|Achkhoy]], the road to which passed through the Chekhinsky Forest and crossed the [[Valerik River]]. The rebels apparently anticipated the Russian movement and for three days fortified the banks of the Valerik with [[abatis]] and debris.

The approaches to the river saw the first clash as the rebels fired on the column from the forest undergrowth. The Russian advance guard, however, quickly chased off the enemy and the column's battle order was restored.\n\nSoon a Russian detachment reached the Valerik. The river at this point intersects the road the Russians were using almost perpendicularly, and in normal conditions is easily fordable. The bank on the Russian side is an open beach, but the opposite bank is steep and wooded. On both sides of the road the rebels had cut down trees to create a clear field of fire about the length of a musket shot.\n\nApproaching the river to within [[Canister shot|canister]] range, the Russian gunners [[Reconnaissance by fire|fired a volley]] into the thicket on the opposite shore, but no reaction was seen.\n\nThe vanguard of the infantry battalions were preparing to cross the river and occupy the forest on both sides of the road, to facilitate the passage of the baggage train and other units. Parts of the main body were deployed in their support. At this point, the rebels began to fire on the Russians from across the river.\n\nThe battalions of the Kurinsky Regiment, with [[combat engineers]], rushed forward on both sides of the road and crossed the river, where on the opposite side was a rebel fortified blockhouse of logs, and engaged the enemy in a bayonet fight in the forest thicket. The rebels broke before the onslaught and started to retreat, but many of them, cut off from their own people, ran out of the woods near the river where they came under Russian artillery fire from the opposite bank, which drove them back into the woods.\n\nSeparate groups of rebels cut off from the main forces attempted to attack the convoy and the headquarters of General Galafeyev, but were everywhere repulsed. Skirmishes continued for some time in the forest near the abatis, which the rebels defended particularly tenaciously, but by six o'clock the battle began to subside and the engineers, withdrawn from the forest, began to assist the convoy in crossing the Valerik.\n\n===Casualties===\nAccording to the action report of the Galafeyev detachment, the unit's losses were:\n*Killed: One officer, 65 lower ranks\n*Wounded: Two staff officers, 15 other officers, 198 lower ranks\n*Shell-shocked: Four officers, 46 lower ranks\n*Missing: One officer, seven lower ranks\n\n29 Russian horses were killed and 42 injured.\n\nThe rebels left 150 dead on the battlefield. According to the reports of spies, Ahberdila Muhammad was shot in the leg. Lermontov stated in a letter that 600 bodies were left by the rebels.<ref name=AATSEEL/>\n\n==  Results and implications==\nAfter crossing the Valerik, the Galafeyev detachment moved to Achkhoy, meeting no further serious resistance. Some minor clashes and skirmishes continued.\n\nLocal residents said that the rebels had been sure that the Russians would not be able to cross the Valerik, so at Achkhoy and other nearby villages the residents did not leave until the Russians actually arrived. Here the Galafeyev detachment was met by troops under Major General [[Ivan Labyntsev]] who had been performing similar operations in Ingushetia. On July 14 the Galafeyev detachment returned to Groznaya.\n\nAfter a series of similar operations in the late summer and autumn of 1840, the rebellion in Chechnya and Ingushetia was extinguished. The rebels, who did not want to accept this situation, were forced to leave the mountainous region of [[Dagestan]], and a strategic success against the Russian authorities was not obtained.\n\n==Lermontov's role and poem==\n{{Main|Valerik (poem)}}\n[[Mikhail Lermontov]], a lieutenant in the Tenginsky Regiment, showed exemplary valor in the battle. The official battle report stated:\n{{quotation|This officer [Lermontov], disregarding any danger, fulfilled his duties with outstanding courage and composure, and was with the first rank of the bravest soldiers assaulting the enemy's entrenchments.}}\nFor this, Lermontov was awarded the [[Order of St. Vladimir]] Fourth Class, but he never received the award as his name was removed from the final list of recipients by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Czar Nicholas I]], who harbored a strong dislike for the [[wikt:contumacious|contumacious]] poet.<ref name=Rumyantsev/>\n\nLermontov's poem \"Valerik\" was first published (with omissions) in 1843 in the anthology ''Dawn''.

The battle was fought between [[Russia]]n troops and a coalition of [[France|French]], [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia|Sardinian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops. The Chornaya River is on the outskirts of [[Sevastopol]].  The battle ended in a Russian retreat and a victory for the French, Sardinians and Turks.\n\n==Planning==\nThe battle was planned as an offensive by the Russians with the aim of forcing the Allied forces (French, British, Sardinian, and Ottoman) to retreat and abandon their siege of Sevastopol. Czar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] had ordered his commander in chief in the Crimea, [[Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov|Prince Michael Gorchakov]] to attack the besieging forces before they were reinforced further. The Czar hoped that by gaining a victory, he could force a more favorable resolution to the conflict. Gorchakov didn\u2019t think that an attack would be successful but believed the greatest chance of success to be near the French and Sardinian positions on the Chornaya River. The Czar ordered the hesitating Gorchakov to hold a war council to plan the attack. The attack was planned for the morning of August 16 in the hope to surprise the French and Sardinians as they had just celebrated the Feast day of the Emperor (France) and [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption Day]] (Sardinians). The Russians hoped that because of these feasts the enemy would be tired and less attentive to the Russians.<ref name=\"Figes\">{{cite book |last=Figes |first=Orlando |title=Crimea.

Although the British correspondents were amazed at the courageousness and impetuosity of their attack, the assault of the Russian army was handicapped by poor organization and lack of experienced soldiers which, due to Sevastopol, forced their corps to consist mostly of militia.\n\nIn the cover of the morning fog, the Russians advanced on [[Traktirburg]] with 47,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and 270 cannon under command of General [[Pavel Liprandi]] on the left and General N. A. Read on the right.  The two generals had been ordered by Gorchakov not to cross the river until given explicit orders.  Annoyed that things weren\u2019t happening fast enough, Gorchakov sent a note to his generals with the words ''\"Let's start it.\"'' By this, Gorchakov only meant that the Russians should start to deploy their forces. Unfortunately his generals interpreted his words as his order to attack and they acted accordingly, although reserve forces were still en route to the battlefield. The attacking Russians immediately met stiff resistance from the French and Sardinians. Read's forces crossed the river near Traktirburg but without cavalry and artillery support, they were easily stopped by the French on the [[Fedyukhin Heights]] (\u0424\u0435\u0434\u044e\u0445\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u044b). Read then ordered his reserve formation, the 5th Infantry Division, to attack the Heights but instead of launching a coordinated assault, he fed them piecemeal in to the fray. Going in regiment by regiment, the assaulting reserve troops accomplished nothing. Seeing this Gorchakov ordered Read to deploy the entire division against the French. This forced the French back up the hill but the Russians could not capture the Heights. In the following retreat General Read was killed. Upon the death of Read, Gorchakov took personal command of the right and ordered 8 battalions of Liprandi's left wing to reinforce the right wing. These forces came under fire from the Sardinians and were driven back. At 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, Gorchakov concluded that the situation was hopeless and ordered a general retreat.<ref name=\"Figes\"/>\n\nThe bravery of Sardinian troops and the French soldiers of the 50th, 82nd, 95th, 97th of the line; the 19th Foot Chasseurs; and the 2nd and 3rd [[Zouave]]s was especially noted.  The Italian troops' valiant effort at the battle was a contributing factor to their inclusion at the negotiation tables at the end of the war; It was there that the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] began looking for the aide of other European nations in the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n==Tolstoy==\nRussian Count [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a participant in the Battle of the Chernaya River. He witnessed as the Russians crossed the river and started up the hillside in the morning sunlight. Tolstoy saw Russian soldiers being killed in clusters as shells exploded around them. Before the morning was over, the Russians were forced to retreat. They left thousands of their dead comrades behind. Tolstoy was depressed and angered by the slaughter.  He believed much of it was due to incompetent generals and staff. Tolstoy vented his anger by composing a [[:s:ru:\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0435 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 4 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 1855 \u0433.

The Italian troops' valiant effort at the battle was a contributing factor to their inclusion at the negotiation tables at the end of the war; It was there that the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] began looking for the aide of other European nations in the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n==Tolstoy==\nRussian Count [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a participant in the Battle of the Chernaya River. He witnessed as the Russians crossed the river and started up the hillside in the morning sunlight. Tolstoy saw Russian soldiers being killed in clusters as shells exploded around them. Before the morning was over, the Russians were forced to retreat. They left thousands of their dead comrades behind. Tolstoy was depressed and angered by the slaughter.  He believed much of it was due to incompetent generals and staff. Tolstoy vented his anger by composing a [[:s:ru:\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0435 \u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 4 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 1855 \u0433.

Some of the high-ranking prisoners taken at the battle were exchanged for their 'pledges' at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on 10 January 1543.<ref>''Acts of the Privy Council of England'', vol. 1 (1890), 63, 69.</ref> Chapuys said the return of some prisoners was prevented at this time by the Scottish government which claimed they were traitors for losing the battle, or suspected they were now being influenced by Henry. As their families were arrested, these prisoners could not provide their pledges and stayed on the border at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Spanish'', vol.6 part 2 (London, 1895), p.222, 228 no.94.</ref>\n\nHowever, a modern historian [[Marcus Merriman]] sees the battle and hostage-taking more as the culmination of James V's war rather than the beginning of Henry VIII's [[Rough Wooing]].

One of the combatants on the Guelph side was [[Dante Alighieri]], twenty-four years old at the time.\n\n==Background to the battle==\nLater, in the mid-14th century, [[Giovanni Villani]] recorded the long-remembered details\u2014 as Florentines remembered them\u2014 in his chronicle, though the ''casus belli'' he offers are merely conventional \"outrages\" on the part of Arezzo; the elaborately staged raid and fight led by aristocrats on both sides sounds like stylized gang warfare, though carried out, according to Villani, under the battle standard of the absent [[Charles II of Naples|Charles, the Angevine King of Naples]]. The immediate cause of the battle were reports that the Guelphs were ravaging the places of Conte Guido Novello, who was [[podest\u00e0]] of Arezzo, and, worse, threatening the fortified place called [[Bibbiena|Bibbiena Civitella]]. This led to an Aretine force being quickly assembled and marching out to counter the threat. It was reported by Villani that a plot had been intercepted at Arezzo, by which the bishop agreed to give over to the Florentines Bibbiena Civitella, and all the villages of his see, in return for a life annuity of 5,000 golden florins a year, guaranteed by the bank of the [[Cerchi family]]. The plot was uncovered by his nephew [[Pazzi|Guglielmo de' Pazzi]], and they hustled the bishop onto his horse and brought him to the battlefield, where they left him dead among the slain of the battle and its aftermath: Guglielmino de' Pazzi in [[Valdarno]] and [[Buonconte II da Montefeltro|Buonconte]], the son of [[Guido I da Montefeltro]].\n\n==Opposing forces==\n=== Guelph army ===\nThe Guelphs had the numerical advantage in the battle,{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=54}} with about 12,000 combatants.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=21}} Most of these troops had been raised by Florence,{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=28}} and were generally well-equipped due to their hometown's wealth. Florence was well known at the time as a producer of highly regarded weapons and armour, and its troops probably had better weaponry than the Ghibellines.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=21\u201328, 30\u201334}} The Florentines were reinforced by other Tuscan Guelphs, including [[Bologna]], [[Pistoia]], [[Lucca]], [[San Gimignano]], [[San Miniato]], [[Siena]], [[Volterra]], and other small towns.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=26, 27, 54}} Furthermore, small contingents of Guelphs from [[Romagna]] and Guelph exiles from Arezzo fought at Campaldino.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=54}} The Guelph cavalry lacked combat experience and suffered from indiscipline,{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=21, 22, 25, 26}} so that the about 10,000 infantrymen formed the actual core of the Guelph army. At least half of the infantry were better-trained specialists who operated as spearmen, [[Pavise|pavisiers]], crossbowmen, and archers, while the rest consisted of less effective, but still reliable militiamen.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=28}} In general, the Italian Guelph troops were less experienced than the Ghibellines.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=21\u201331}} In addition to these local forces, about 400 French knights of [[Amerigo di Narbona]]'s retinue fought at Campaldino; they were experienced veterans who were highly regarded for their combat prowess.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=26, 27}}\n\nThe Guelph army was officially led by Amerigo di Narbona, who served as [[Charles II of Naples]]'s representative for Tuscany and had been appointed as a compromise, since the Italian Guelphs could not agree on one of their own to lead them. Though he probably possessed some combat experience and proved to be a competent commander, Amerigo's relative lack of military skill, youth, and the fact that he did not speak Tuscan Italian meant that his command of the army was mostly nominal.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=18}} As a result, the ''de facto'' leader of the army was a [[Carcassonne]] knight in Amerigo's retinue, [[Guillaume da Durfort]], a highly experienced veteran of several wars.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=18, 19}} Under these two, several Italian Guelphs served as sub-commanders, with the most notable being [[Corso Donati]], [[Vieri de' Cerchi]],{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=19, 54}} and the [[Barone de Mangiadori]].{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=54, 56, 57}}\n\n===Ghibelline army ===\nThe Ghibelline army was of similar size, but differed drastically in its composition from the Guelph force.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=21}} Unlike their opponents, the Ghibellines relied less on ''ad hoc'' city militias and were instead mostly composed of feudal lords and their retinues, who were generally much better trained and more experienced than their opponents. The Ghibelline cavalry and infantry were thus of higher quality than their opponents, with Villani describing them as \"the flower of the Ghibellines of Tuscany, of [[Marche|the March]], and of the [[Urbino|Duchy]], and of [[Romagna]]\" who were \"practised in weapons and in war\".{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=29, 30}} The Ghibelline infantry consisted of fewer spearmen, pavisiers, and crossbowmen than its Guelph counterparts; instead, it relied on offensive close-quarters combat with swords and [[buckler]]s.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=31}} Despite this, many Ghibelline fiefs were rather poor, and both their cavalry and infantry were probably less well equipped than the Guelphs.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=30, 31}}\n\nThe Ghibelline army had three main commanders: First, Guglielmo Ubertini who had served for forty years as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro|bishop of Arezzo]] by the time of the battle. \"A man of the sword as much as of the pen\", Ubertini had proven to be a capable, ruthless, and brave military commander during several conflicts before 1289, though his strategic acumen was impeded by his interest in defending the possessions of his family at any cost. This greatly influenced his decision to seek battle at Campaldino, despite having been advised against it.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=19, 20}} The second most important Ghibelline commander was Guido Novello Guidi, the Count of Poppi, a veteran of several campaigns, and long-time leader of the Ghibelline cause in Tuscany. A shrewd and opportunistic politician and military leader, he was one of the few Ghibelline commanders to survive the Battle of Campaldino. Finally, there was Buonconte di Montefeltro, an accomplished strategist and tactician who had led the Ghibellines to a \"brilliant\" victory at Pieve al Toppo in 1288. Montefeltro was one of those who argued against seeking battle at Campaldino, but nevertheless drew up a good battle-plan when forced to do so.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=20}}\n\n==The battle==\n===Deployment===\nThe Florentines deployed an advance guard of cavalry, behind which, in the centre of their line stood the bulk of their cavalry. On each wing they placed their infantry, slightly forward so the line was crescent shaped. Behind this force, they drew up their baggage and, behind that, a reserve of infantry and cavalry. The Aretines drew up in four lines; the first, second, and fourth of cavalry, the third of infantry.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mercenaries and their Masters |last=Mallett |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1974|publisher=Bodley Head |location=London |isbn=0-370-10502-8 |page= |pages=21\u20133 |url= |accessdate=}}\n</ref>\n\n===The course of the battle===\nThe Aretines attacked with their first three lines, scattering the Florentine advanced guard and pushing back the main body towards the wagons. However, they now came under crossfire from the flanking infantry. The Florentine reserve now made a flanking attack, trapping the Aretines.<ref>Mallett (1974), p. 23</ref> According to Villani, [[Corso Donati]], podest\u00e0 of Pistoia, though under orders to stand ready in reserve, shouted \u201cIf we lose, I will die in the battle with my fellow citizens; and if we conquer, let him that will, come to us at Pistoia to exact the penalty!\u201d and charged the Aretine flank, helping break up the lines and win the day for the Guelphs. Instead of coming to the rescue, the Aretine reserve fled. Aretine casualties were high. Ploughing the Campaldino plain used to turn up human remains and bones as recently as eighty years ago.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parchiletterari.com/en_dante.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211161022/http://www.parchiletterari.com/en_dante.php |archivedate=2005-02-11 }}.</ref>\n\n==Result of the battle==\nThe Battle of Campaldino secured Guelph dominance in [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], though internecine fighting among the Whites and Blacks among the Florentine Guelphs resulted in civic disturbances and the exile of many, including notable medieval Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] (a member of the Whites, the faction more opposed to papal power).\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book\n|last1= DeVries\n|first1= Kelly\n|authorlink1= Kelly DeVries\n|last2= Capponi\n|first2= Niccol\u00f2\n|editor=Marcus Cowper\n|ref=harv\n|title= Campaldino 1289.

Though he probably possessed some combat experience and proved to be a competent commander, Amerigo's relative lack of military skill, youth, and the fact that he did not speak Tuscan Italian meant that his command of the army was mostly nominal.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=18}} As a result, the ''de facto'' leader of the army was a [[Carcassonne]] knight in Amerigo's retinue, [[Guillaume da Durfort]], a highly experienced veteran of several wars.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=18, 19}} Under these two, several Italian Guelphs served as sub-commanders, with the most notable being [[Corso Donati]], [[Vieri de' Cerchi]],{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=19, 54}} and the [[Barone de Mangiadori]].{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=54, 56, 57}}\n\n===Ghibelline army ===\nThe Ghibelline army was of similar size, but differed drastically in its composition from the Guelph force.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=21}} Unlike their opponents, the Ghibellines relied less on ''ad hoc'' city militias and were instead mostly composed of feudal lords and their retinues, who were generally much better trained and more experienced than their opponents. The Ghibelline cavalry and infantry were thus of higher quality than their opponents, with Villani describing them as \"the flower of the Ghibellines of Tuscany, of [[Marche|the March]], and of the [[Urbino|Duchy]], and of [[Romagna]]\" who were \"practised in weapons and in war\".{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=29, 30}} The Ghibelline infantry consisted of fewer spearmen, pavisiers, and crossbowmen than its Guelph counterparts; instead, it relied on offensive close-quarters combat with swords and [[buckler]]s.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=31}} Despite this, many Ghibelline fiefs were rather poor, and both their cavalry and infantry were probably less well equipped than the Guelphs.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=30, 31}}\n\nThe Ghibelline army had three main commanders: First, Guglielmo Ubertini who had served for forty years as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro|bishop of Arezzo]] by the time of the battle. \"A man of the sword as much as of the pen\", Ubertini had proven to be a capable, ruthless, and brave military commander during several conflicts before 1289, though his strategic acumen was impeded by his interest in defending the possessions of his family at any cost. This greatly influenced his decision to seek battle at Campaldino, despite having been advised against it.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|pp=19, 20}} The second most important Ghibelline commander was Guido Novello Guidi, the Count of Poppi, a veteran of several campaigns, and long-time leader of the Ghibelline cause in Tuscany. A shrewd and opportunistic politician and military leader, he was one of the few Ghibelline commanders to survive the Battle of Campaldino. Finally, there was Buonconte di Montefeltro, an accomplished strategist and tactician who had led the Ghibellines to a \"brilliant\" victory at Pieve al Toppo in 1288. Montefeltro was one of those who argued against seeking battle at Campaldino, but nevertheless drew up a good battle-plan when forced to do so.{{sfnp|DeVries|Capponi|2018|p=20}}\n\n==The battle==\n===Deployment===\nThe Florentines deployed an advance guard of cavalry, behind which, in the centre of their line stood the bulk of their cavalry. On each wing they placed their infantry, slightly forward so the line was crescent shaped. Behind this force, they drew up their baggage and, behind that, a reserve of infantry and cavalry. The Aretines drew up in four lines; the first, second, and fourth of cavalry, the third of infantry.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mercenaries and their Masters |last=Mallett |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1974|publisher=Bodley Head |location=London |isbn=0-370-10502-8 |page= |pages=21\u20133 |url= |accessdate=}}\n </ref>\n\n===The course of the battle===\nThe Aretines attacked with their first three lines, scattering the Florentine advanced guard and pushing back the main body towards the wagons.

[[Andrew Breeze]] writes:\n\n:\"Last of all, what can we conclude about Camlan itself? Can we say anything at all on its location, significance, and even whether it happened or not? Here we may recall the views expressed by [[Oliver Padel|[O. J.] Padel]], [[Ken Dark|[K.] Dark]], [[David Dumville|Dumville]], and [N.] Higham. All are skeptics, variously declaring that the ''Annales Cambriae'' entry for Camlan can be taken seriously only by the 'no smoke without fire' school of thinking (OJP), that it provides 'no evidence whatsoever for a prototypical Arthur' (KD), and that as a record it is 'unverifiable' if not 'entirely unhistorical' (NH). The status of the entry for 537 is therefore now clear. On the one hand it is presented as sober fact and appears in the context of persons known to history ([[List of saints of Ireland|Irish saints]], [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]], [[Gildas]]). On the other, we cannot be certain that it is old; and the circumstance that, by the tenth century, Arthur had long been the creature of fable must subvert its authority. The historical Arthur thus becomes little more than a wisp of air. Unless unexpected evidence turns up, the only honest answer we can give here is that of [[Kenneth H.

[[Andrew Breeze]] writes:\n\n:\"Last of all, what can we conclude about Camlan itself? Can we say anything at all on its location, significance, and even whether it happened or not? Here we may recall the views expressed by [[Oliver Padel|[O. J.] Padel]], [[Ken Dark|[K.] Dark]], [[David Dumville|Dumville]], and [N.] Higham. All are skeptics, variously declaring that the ''Annales Cambriae'' entry for Camlan can be taken seriously only by the 'no smoke without fire' school of thinking (OJP), that it provides 'no evidence whatsoever for a prototypical Arthur' (KD), and that as a record it is 'unverifiable' if not 'entirely unhistorical' (NH). The status of the entry for 537 is therefore now clear. On the one hand it is presented as sober fact and appears in the context of persons known to history ([[List of saints of Ireland|Irish saints]], [[Maelgwn Gwynedd]], [[Gildas]]). On the other, we cannot be certain that it is old; and the circumstance that, by the tenth century, Arthur had long been the creature of fable must subvert its authority. The historical Arthur thus becomes little more than a wisp of air. Unless unexpected evidence turns up, the only honest answer we can give here is that of [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]], that 'We do not know, but he may well have existed.'\"<ref name=\"Breeze05\"/>\n\n==Legendary versions==\n\n===Medieval Welsh tradition===\nCamlann is mentioned in the circa 9th/10th-century ''[[Englynion y Beddau]]'' (\"Stanzas of the Graves\", Stanza 12) from the ''[[Black Book of Carmarthen]]'' as the site of the grave of Osfran's (unnamed) son.<ref name=Bartrum109>Bartrum, Peter C., ''A Welsh classical dictionary : people in history and legend up to about A.D. 1000'', The National library of Wales, 1993, pp. 109-111.</ref><ref>Bromwich and Evans, pp. 8, 85.</ref> The Welsh prose text ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', dated to the 11th or 12th century, mentions the battle twice in connection to heroes who fought there.

Arthur returns and his army faces Modredus' at Camblana (the [[River Camel]] in Cornwall).

He leaves Mordred in charge of Britain when he departs, only for Mordred to betray him and seize the throne. Arthur brings his army back to Britain where they meet Mordred at [[Salisbury Plain]] in south central England (Camlann is not mentioned). The fighting begins by an accident of fate, when a startled knight draws his sword to kill an adder during the standoff negotiations between Mordred and Arthur (represented by [[Sir Lucan|Lucan]] and [[Bedivere]] in ''Le Morte d' Arthur'').
