The Challenge runs annually, roughly from January to June.\n\nIn April 2013, Google announced plans to add enhanced campaigns for AdWords to aid with campaign management catered to multiple-device users. The enhanced campaigns aimed to include advanced reports about users.

It will temporarily ban ads for face masks, which lawmakers and health officials have said aren't all that effective in preventing the spread of the disease and are best left to be worn by medical workers. According to Google's spokesperson, \"In the past few weeks, we've seen opportunistic advertisers try to run an unprecedented number of these ads on our platforms. We have a dedicated task force working to combat this issue and have removed millions of ads in the past week alone. We're monitoring the situation closely and continue to make real-time adjustments to protect our users.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/face-masks-ads-being-served-by-google-after-ban-2020-3|title=Google says it has removed 'millions of ads in the past week' relating to coronavirus, but users are still seeing ads for products like face masks|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== How it works ==\nGoogle Ads' system is based partly on [[HTTP cookie|cookies]] and partly on [[Keyword advertising|keywords]] determined by advertisers. Google uses these characteristics to place advertising copy on pages where they think it might be relevant. Advertisers pay when users divert their browsing to click on the advertising copy. Partner websites receive a portion of the generated income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://adwords.google.com/home/how-it-works/#?modal_active=none|title=Display Ads, Video Ads, Search Ads & App Ads - Google AdWords \u2013 Google|website=adwords.google.com|access-date=January 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Google Ads program includes local, national, and international distribution. Google's text advertisements are short, consisting of three headlines with a maximum of 30 characters each, 2 descriptions with a maximum of 90 characters, and a display two URLs of 15 characters each.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704389|title=About text ads - Google Ads Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> These are called AdWords expanded text Ads. These mimic what the average search result looks like on Google. Image ads can be one of the several different standardized sizes as designated by the [[Interactive Advertising Bureau]] (IAB). In May 2016, Google announced its reformatting of ads to help consumers and advertisers succeed in a mobile-first world. The new format, called Expanded Text Ads, allows 23% more text. This new format is available on both the Google Search Network and the Google Display network. It features two headlines with 30 characters each, replacing the standard of a single headline with 30 characters. The display URL has been replaced with two 15 character paths, not including the root domain.\n\n==Features and services==\n===Keyword Planner===\n''Keyword Planner'' is a tool within Google Ads that provides data around the search queries that users have submitted in the Google search engine, and provides other data resources for planning a Google Ads specific advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larry|first1=Kim|title=How to Use The Keyword Planner \u2014 The New Keyword Tool From Google AdWords|url=http://searchengineland.com/how-to-use-the-keyword-planner-the-new-keyword-tool-from-google-adwords-157123|website=Search Engine Land|publisher=Search Engine Land|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=May 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nKeyword Planner<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.discosloth.com/beginners-guide-to-ppc/keyword-research-for-ppc.html#3.3|title = Chapter 3: Keyword Research & Analysis: Google Keyword Planner|access-date = January 16, 2019|website = Guide To Google Ads Keyword Research}}</ref> helps to build new Search Network campaigns or expand existing campaigns, providing keywords and ad group ideas, search volume trends (average monthly searches), historical statistics, keywords trend, competitions, and bidding.\n\n===AdWords Express===\n''AdWords Express'' is a feature aimed at small businesses that attempts to reduce the difficulty of managing ad campaigns by automatically managing keywords and ad placement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ads.google.com/home/|title=Google Ads - Get More Customers With Easy Online Advertising|website=ads.google.com}}</ref> AdWords Express was previously known as Google Boost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-relaunches-boost-as-adwords-express-87089|title=Google relaunches Boost as AdWords Express|date=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAdWords Express also supports small businesses that do not have a website by allowing them to direct customers to their Google Place page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/ads/compare-adwords.html|title=Compare AdWords}}</ref>\n\n===Google Ads Editor===\n''Google Ads Editor'' allows users to make bulk changes to ads and edit ads offline.

To become AdWords certified professional, clients need to pass the Google Ads Fundamentals exam and one of the other Advanced AdWords exams such as [[Search advertising|Search Advertising]], [[Display advertising|Display Advertising]], [[Video advertising|Video Advertising]], Shopping Advertising, [[Google Analytics]], and [[Mobile advertising|Mobile Advertising]].

Using the AdWords control panel, advertisers can enter keywords, domain names, topics, and [[demographic targeting]] preferences. Based on this, Google places ads on relevant sites within the content network. If domain names are targeted, Google also provides a list of related sites for placement. Advertisers bid on a [[Cost Per Impression|cost-per-impression]] (CPI/CPM) or [[Cost Per Click|cost-per-click]] (CPC) basis for site targeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=113233 |title=How do CPC and CPM ads compete with each other? - AdWords Help |accessdate=February 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214161533/https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=113233 |archive-date=December 14, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith placement targeting, it is possible for an ad to take up an entire ad block instead of splitting the ad into two to four ads. This leads to higher ad visibility for the advertiser.\n\nThe minimum cost-per-thousand impressions bid for placement-targeted campaigns is 25 cents. There is no minimum CPC bid.\n\n===Remarketing===\n''Remarketing'' is an Google Ads feature that allows marketers to show advertisements to users that have previously visited their website. This feature also allows marketers to create different audience lists based on the behaviors of website visitors in order to serve relevant ads to these segmented audiences. Remarketing Lists for Search (RLSA) via [[Google Analytics]] became available in Google Ads in early June 2015, allowing for the use of standard GA remarketing lists to plan traditional text search ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=About remarketing lists for search ads - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2701222?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA more advanced subtype of remarketing is dynamic remarketing through which advertisers can show past visitors the specific products or services they viewed to further customize the ad experience. This subtype is especially used by [[e-commerce]] websites that foster a diverse range of products and services and need to have their remarketing messages relevant to users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6099158?hl=en|title=About dynamic remarketing for retail - Google Merchant Center Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile remarketing is a mainstream practice, it remains to be perceived as an intrusive one to many users as they might feel annoyingly stalked all over the internet. So, it is recommended for Google Ads advertisers to dive deep into optimization practices such as frequency capping so that their remarketing efforts won't backfire and build customer dissatisfaction and distress instead of brand awareness and sales.\n\n===Smart Shopping Campaign===\nGoogle Ads Introduced ' 'Smart Shopping' ' Ads by early 2018. This is sub campaign type of shopping campaign, this combines Standard Shopping and Display remarketing features and uses only in Automated bid strategy to promote products listed in Google Merchant Center. Conversion value needs to be passed through website tags to Google Ads in order to use this campaign type.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=About Smart Shopping Campaigns - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7674739?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis campaign works with Google Machine Learning and serves responsive ad in Google's Display Partner Websites, Google Network to drive the ROAS percent in the Campaign settings.\n\nYou need to follow certain best practices<ref name=\"auto\"/> in Feed file to deliver good results. This campaign type would take priority over standard Shopping and Dynamic Remarketing campaigns.\n\n===Ad extensions===\nAd extensions allow advertisers to show extra information with their ads, such as a business address, phone number, or web page links. Ad extensions are created to improve ad visibility and attract clicks. They appear with the Search Network, above search results, and at time on the Display Network.\n\nGoogle Ads shows extensions when it calculates that the extensions will improve the advertiser's campaign performance, or when an ad is ranked high enough for it to appear.\n\n====Manual extensions====\n* App extensions - Allow advertisers to provide a link below the ad text directing users to a mobile or tablet app.\n* Call extensions - Allow advertisers to include a clickable phone number in their ads.\n* Location extensions - Allow advertisers to show their business address, phone number, and map marker.\n* Affiliate Location extensions - Allows advertisers to show business information about retail chain stores that sell their products.\n* Review extensions - Allow advertisers to showcase positive, third-party reviews from reputable sources.\n* Sitelink extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional links below their ads.\n* Callout extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional descriptive text.\n* Structured Snippet extensions - Allow advertisers to add up to two predefined headers (product or service) like brands or degrees.\n* Price extensions - Allow advertisers to display prices for products or services.\n* Message extensions - Allows the ability to connect with advertisers via SMS apps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/182883/20161021/new-google-click-to-message-ads-extension-connects-consumers-to-companies-over-sms.htm|title=New Google Click-To-Message Ads Extension Connects Consumers To Companies Over SMS|last=Times|first=Tech|date=October 21, 2016|newspaper=Tech Times|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* Promotion extensions - Allow advertisers to highlight sales and promotions that a business has to offer.\n*Lead Form extensions - Allow advertisers to capture qualified leads directly in the SERP.\n\n====Automated Extensions====\nGoogle Ads creates and displays automated extensions when the system predicts they will improve performance. Automated extensions include:\n\n* Consumer Ratings\n* Seller Ratings\n* Previous Visits\n* Dynamic Sitelink Extensions\n* Dynamic Structured Snippets\n* Dynamic Image Extensions\n\n=== Google Click-to-Call ===\n''Google Click-to-Call'' was a service provided by Google which allowed users to call [[advertising|advertisers]] straight from Google search results pages. Users entered their phone numbers and Google would connect the call to the advertiser. Google paid for the calling charges. The service was discontinued in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/07/google-discontinues-click-to-call-and.html|title=Google Discontinues Click-to-Call and Related Links|last=Chitu|first=Alex|date=July 20, 2007|publisher=Googlesystem.blogspot.com|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> For some time, similar click-to-call functionality was available for results in [[Google Maps]]. In the Froyo release of Google's Android operating system, certain advertisements included a very similar functionality. In iOS, phone numbers are automatically recognized as such. Web developers can also provide direct links to the Phone application, providing similar functionality.\n\nGoogle now offers a mobile click-to-call function which allows searchers to call a business directly rather than going to their website.\n\n=== Google AdWords Customer Match ===\nDue to the influence of brand messaging on consumer purchasing habits, Google expanded AdWords to include a Customer Match service. Customer Match allows advertisers to show ads to customers based on data they share with Google, as well as allowing advertisers to bid and create ads tailored to customers.\n\n=== Google Ad Grants ===\n\nGoogle Ad Grants provide US$10,000 per month to eligible nonprofit organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/grants/|title=Grants for Nonprofit Organizations {{!}} Google Ad Grants \u2013 Google|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> The NGO can either use AdWords express or their Google Ads account to advertise their cause on the Google Search platform.\n\n'''Google Universal App Campaigns (UAC)'''\n\nGoogle launched a new style of campaign aimed at app developers looking to advertise their app on Google's vast ad network. On this campaign type advertisers don't get to pick who sees their ad and what their ad looks like. Rather the options are to chooses some text, images, a destination and a target bid and Google will do the rest for you. Using machine learning Google will try and figure out the best audiences for you using the budget set.\n\n== Technology ==\nThe AdWords system was initially implemented on top of the [[MySQL]] database engine. After the system had been launched, management decided to use [[Oracle database|Oracle]] instead. The system became much slower, and eventually, it was reverted to MySQL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|title=eldapo: Let's get a real database|last=Lembo|first=Phil|date=May 30, 2007|publisher=Eldapo.blogspot.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305152003/http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|archivedate=March 5, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Eventually, Google developed a custom distributed [[Relational database management system]] (RDBMS) known as Google F1 specifically for the needs of the Ad business, which requires strong consistency, high scalability across data centers, and powerful SQL queries.\n\nThe interface has also been revamped to offer better workflow with additional new features, such as Spreadsheet Editing, Search Query Reports, and better [[Conversion marketing|conversion]] metrics.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAll ads on Google Ads are eligible to be shown on Google's search engine. Advertisers also have the option of enabling their ads to show on Google's partner networks. This \"search network\" includes [[AOL|AOL search]], [[Ask.com]], and [[Netscape]]. Ads served on partner networks do not affect ad quality score.\n\nThe Google Display Network (GDN), formerly referred to as the \"content network\", shows AdWords ads on sites that are not search engines. These GDN sites serve to publishers on [[AdSense]] and [[DoubleClick]], the other side of the Google advertising model. AdSense is used by website owners who wish to make money by displaying ads on their websites. Click-through rates on the display network are typically much lower than those on the search network and quality score for Display Network is calculated separately from Search network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?answer=140351|title=Quality Score: Definition - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\nFurther, Google automatically determines the subject of pages and displays relevant ads based on the advertisers' keyword lists. AdSense publishers may select channels to help direct Google's ad placements on pages to increase the performance of their ad units. There are many different types of ads that run across Google's network including text ads, image or banner ads, mobile text ads, and in-page video ads. In February 2016, Google began removing right-hand side ads from AdWords on a desktop in favor of only showing text ads above and below organic search results. Product Listing Ads and the Google Knowledge Graph were unaffected, and can still appear on the right-hand side.\n\n==Account management==\n[[File:Google Headquarters in Ireland Building Front Entrance.jpg|thumb|Google's headquarters in Ireland where all EU Google Ads account management takes place.]]\nTo help clients with the complexity of building and managing AdWords accounts, [[search engine marketing]] agencies and consultants offer account management services. This allowed organizations without advertising expertise to reach a global online audience. To help regulate Best Practices for AdWords Management, Google implemented the Google Partner Program and the Google Individual Qualification Program, both of which require individuals and agencies to meet benchmarks and pass exams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3125774?hl=en|title=About Google Partners - Google Partners Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref> Google also has its own in-house team of account managers who are assigned to clients to help optimize campaigns, increase returns and keep customers engaged in the platform. Smaller accounts will be assigned to a pool of account managers, whereas larger spending Google Ads users are given a dedicated account manager.\n\nGoogle also provides an offline account management software, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170322133444/https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/adwords-editor/ AdWords Editor].\n\nThe My Client Center feature is available to Google Professionals, regardless if they have passed the exam or budget parameters yet. With this feature, a Google professional has access to a dashboard summary of several accounts and can move between those accounts without logging into each account.\n\nThe [[Google Keyword Planner|Google AdWords Keyword Planner]], formerly the Keyword Tool, is a free AdWords tool which gives estimated traffic-per-month for the mentioned keywords. It provides a list of related keywords expected to be equally successful for a specific website or keyword.\n\nThe Google Display Planner is an AdWords tool to identify display network keywords, placements, and topics.

As a result, the amount that an organization needs to spend varies based on industry and the keywords on which they bid. Whenever a user conducts a search on Google, AdWords runs an auction to determine which search ads are displayed on the search results page as well as the ad's position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1704424?hl=en%7Ctitle=How|title=How costs are calculated in AdWords - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Factors===\n\nThere are four main factors that affect the cost and bidding factors of a Google AdWords campaign.\n\n* Your Bid - The maximum amount you are willing to pay for a click to your ad.\n*Keywords - Keywords that you target have great impact on the cost as well.  \n* The Quality of Your Ads - The relevancy and usefulness of your ad in contrast to the website it links to.\n* Extensions & Other Ad Formats - The relevance of your ad extensions or call outs and how frequently they are clicked.\n\n==Legal context==\nAdWords has generated lawsuits in the area of [[trademark law]] (see ''[[Google, Inc. v. Am. Blind & Wallpaper Factory]]'' and ''[[Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.]]''), fraud (see ''[[Goddard v. Google, Inc.]]''), and [[click fraud]]. In 2006, Google settled a click fraud lawsuit for US$90 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11734026|title=Google settles advertising suit for $90 million|publisher=[[NBC News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=March 8, 2006}}</ref> March 2010, Google was involved with a trademark infringement case involving three French companies that own Louis Vuitton trademarks. The lawsuit concerned if Google was responsible if the advertisers purchasing keywords violate trademark infringement. Ultimately, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Google AdWords were \u201cnot a breach of EU trade mark law, but that the content of some advertisements that are linked by Google keywords may well be in breach depending upon the particular facts of the case.\u201d <ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.mondaq.com|title= European Union: Google Adwords And Online Advertising: Trade Mark Infringement?

Although the Australian Sex Party amended its website to display tax deductibility information, Google continued to ban the ads. The ads were reinstated on election eve after it was reported in the media that the Australian Sex Party was considering suing Google. On September 13, 2012, the Australian Sex Party lodged formal complaints against Google with the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] and the Australian competition watchdog, accusing Google of \"unlawful interference in the conduct of a state election in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] with corrupt intent\" in violation of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/no-sex-party-please-were-google-20120913-25tn8.html No Sex Party please, we're Google] [[Sydney Morning Herald]] September 13, 2012</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in ''[[Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc.]]'' that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit [[trademark infringement]] when it purchased AdWords and other search advertisements using competitor [[1-800 Contacts]]' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging that its search advertising trademark enforcement practices have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and is scheduled to appear before an FTC [[administrative law judge]] in April 2017.<ref>David O.

Prior to this, paid advertisements could feature different landing page URLs to that of what was being displayed on the search network. Google explained that this policy change stems from both user and advertiser feedback. The concern prompting the restriction change is believed to be the premise on which users clicked advertisements.

The Challenge runs annually, roughly from January to June.\n\nIn April 2013, Google announced plans to add enhanced campaigns for AdWords to aid with campaign management catered to multiple-device users. The enhanced campaigns aimed to include advanced reports about users.

It will temporarily ban ads for face masks, which lawmakers and health officials have said aren't all that effective in preventing the spread of the disease and are best left to be worn by medical workers. According to Google's spokesperson, \"In the past few weeks, we've seen opportunistic advertisers try to run an unprecedented number of these ads on our platforms.

These mimic what the average search result looks like on Google. Image ads can be one of the several different standardized sizes as designated by the [[Interactive Advertising Bureau]] (IAB). In May 2016, Google announced its reformatting of ads to help consumers and advertisers succeed in a mobile-first world. The new format, called Expanded Text Ads, allows 23% more text. This new format is available on both the Google Search Network and the Google Display network. It features two headlines with 30 characters each, replacing the standard of a single headline with 30 characters. The display URL has been replaced with two 15 character paths, not including the root domain.\n\n==Features and services==\n===Keyword Planner===\n''Keyword Planner'' is a tool within Google Ads that provides data around the search queries that users have submitted in the Google search engine, and provides other data resources for planning a Google Ads specific advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larry|first1=Kim|title=How to Use The Keyword Planner \u2014 The New Keyword Tool From Google AdWords|url=http://searchengineland.com/how-to-use-the-keyword-planner-the-new-keyword-tool-from-google-adwords-157123|website=Search Engine Land|publisher=Search Engine Land|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=May 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nKeyword Planner<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.discosloth.com/beginners-guide-to-ppc/keyword-research-for-ppc.html#3.3|title = Chapter 3: Keyword Research & Analysis: Google Keyword Planner|access-date = January 16, 2019|website = Guide To Google Ads Keyword Research}}</ref> helps to build new Search Network campaigns or expand existing campaigns, providing keywords and ad group ideas, search volume trends (average monthly searches), historical statistics, keywords trend, competitions, and bidding.\n\n===AdWords Express===\n''AdWords Express'' is a feature aimed at small businesses that attempts to reduce the difficulty of managing ad campaigns by automatically managing keywords and ad placement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ads.google.com/home/|title=Google Ads - Get More Customers With Easy Online Advertising|website=ads.google.com}}</ref> AdWords Express was previously known as Google Boost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-relaunches-boost-as-adwords-express-87089|title=Google relaunches Boost as AdWords Express|date=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAdWords Express also supports small businesses that do not have a website by allowing them to direct customers to their Google Place page.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/ads/compare-adwords.html|title=Compare AdWords}}</ref>\n\n===Google Ads Editor===\n''Google Ads Editor'' allows users to make bulk changes to ads and edit ads offline.

This feature enables advertisers to exclude specified IP address ranges if they do not want their ads to appear there. Advertisers can exclude up to 500 IP address ranges per campaign.\n\n===Google Partners===\n''Google Partners'', originally known as Google AdWords Certification Program or Google AdWords Certification, is a Google AdWords partner certification program. To become AdWords certified professional, clients need to pass the Google Ads Fundamentals exam and one of the other Advanced AdWords exams such as [[Search advertising|Search Advertising]], [[Display advertising|Display Advertising]], [[Video advertising|Video Advertising]], Shopping Advertising, [[Google Analytics]], and [[Mobile advertising|Mobile Advertising]]. From January 16, 2018, certification exams moved from Google Partners to Google Academy for Ads.<ref>[https://www.en.advertisercommunity.com/t5/Academy-for-Ads/Academy-for-Ads-Your-New-Home-for-Ads-Education/ba-p/1617169# Academy for Ads- Your New Home for Ads Education], SpencerC, AdWords Communit, January 18, 2018</ref>\n\nIt replaced ''Google Advertising Professionals'' in April 2010, with updates ranging from amended criteria for entries and changes to the exam requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Google launches additional tools for AdWords clients |url=http://archive.webpronews.com/2004/1112.html |publisher=Web Pro News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531035103/http://archive.webpronews.com/2004/1112.html |archivedate=May 31, 2013 }}</ref> The program continues to certify [[consultant]]s to help the increasing number of Google AdWords clients with AdWords campaigns.

Using the AdWords control panel, advertisers can enter keywords, domain names, topics, and [[demographic targeting]] preferences. Based on this, Google places ads on relevant sites within the content network. If domain names are targeted, Google also provides a list of related sites for placement. Advertisers bid on a [[Cost Per Impression|cost-per-impression]] (CPI/CPM) or [[Cost Per Click|cost-per-click]] (CPC) basis for site targeting.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=113233 |title=How do CPC and CPM ads compete with each other? - AdWords Help |accessdate=February 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214161533/https://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=113233 |archive-date=December 14, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith placement targeting, it is possible for an ad to take up an entire ad block instead of splitting the ad into two to four ads. This leads to higher ad visibility for the advertiser.\n\nThe minimum cost-per-thousand impressions bid for placement-targeted campaigns is 25 cents. There is no minimum CPC bid.\n\n===Remarketing===\n''Remarketing'' is an Google Ads feature that allows marketers to show advertisements to users that have previously visited their website. This feature also allows marketers to create different audience lists based on the behaviors of website visitors in order to serve relevant ads to these segmented audiences. Remarketing Lists for Search (RLSA) via [[Google Analytics]] became available in Google Ads in early June 2015, allowing for the use of standard GA remarketing lists to plan traditional text search ads.<ref>{{cite web|title=About remarketing lists for search ads - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2701222?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA more advanced subtype of remarketing is dynamic remarketing through which advertisers can show past visitors the specific products or services they viewed to further customize the ad experience. This subtype is especially used by [[e-commerce]] websites that foster a diverse range of products and services and need to have their remarketing messages relevant to users.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6099158?hl=en|title=About dynamic remarketing for retail - Google Merchant Center Help|website=support.google.com|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile remarketing is a mainstream practice, it remains to be perceived as an intrusive one to many users as they might feel annoyingly stalked all over the internet. So, it is recommended for Google Ads advertisers to dive deep into optimization practices such as frequency capping so that their remarketing efforts won't backfire and build customer dissatisfaction and distress instead of brand awareness and sales.\n\n===Smart Shopping Campaign===\nGoogle Ads Introduced ' 'Smart Shopping' ' Ads by early 2018. This is sub campaign type of shopping campaign, this combines Standard Shopping and Display remarketing features and uses only in Automated bid strategy to promote products listed in Google Merchant Center. Conversion value needs to be passed through website tags to Google Ads in order to use this campaign type.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|title=About Smart Shopping Campaigns - Google Ads Help|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7674739?hl=en-AU|accessdate=November 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThis campaign works with Google Machine Learning and serves responsive ad in Google's Display Partner Websites, Google Network to drive the ROAS percent in the Campaign settings.\n\nYou need to follow certain best practices<ref name=\"auto\"/> in Feed file to deliver good results. This campaign type would take priority over standard Shopping and Dynamic Remarketing campaigns.\n\n===Ad extensions===\nAd extensions allow advertisers to show extra information with their ads, such as a business address, phone number, or web page links. Ad extensions are created to improve ad visibility and attract clicks. They appear with the Search Network, above search results, and at time on the Display Network.\n\nGoogle Ads shows extensions when it calculates that the extensions will improve the advertiser's campaign performance, or when an ad is ranked high enough for it to appear.\n\n====Manual extensions====\n* App extensions - Allow advertisers to provide a link below the ad text directing users to a mobile or tablet app.\n* Call extensions - Allow advertisers to include a clickable phone number in their ads.\n* Location extensions - Allow advertisers to show their business address, phone number, and map marker.\n* Affiliate Location extensions - Allows advertisers to show business information about retail chain stores that sell their products.\n* Review extensions - Allow advertisers to showcase positive, third-party reviews from reputable sources.\n* Sitelink extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional links below their ads.\n* Callout extensions - Allow advertisers to add additional descriptive text.\n* Structured Snippet extensions - Allow advertisers to add up to two predefined headers (product or service) like brands or degrees.\n* Price extensions - Allow advertisers to display prices for products or services.\n* Message extensions - Allows the ability to connect with advertisers via SMS apps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/182883/20161021/new-google-click-to-message-ads-extension-connects-consumers-to-companies-over-sms.htm|title=New Google Click-To-Message Ads Extension Connects Consumers To Companies Over SMS|last=Times|first=Tech|date=October 21, 2016|newspaper=Tech Times|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n* Promotion extensions - Allow advertisers to highlight sales and promotions that a business has to offer.\n*Lead Form extensions - Allow advertisers to capture qualified leads directly in the SERP.\n\n====Automated Extensions====\nGoogle Ads creates and displays automated extensions when the system predicts they will improve performance. Automated extensions include:\n\n* Consumer Ratings\n* Seller Ratings\n* Previous Visits\n* Dynamic Sitelink Extensions\n* Dynamic Structured Snippets\n* Dynamic Image Extensions\n\n=== Google Click-to-Call ===\n''Google Click-to-Call'' was a service provided by Google which allowed users to call [[advertising|advertisers]] straight from Google search results pages. Users entered their phone numbers and Google would connect the call to the advertiser. Google paid for the calling charges. The service was discontinued in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/07/google-discontinues-click-to-call-and.html|title=Google Discontinues Click-to-Call and Related Links|last=Chitu|first=Alex|date=July 20, 2007|publisher=Googlesystem.blogspot.com|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> For some time, similar click-to-call functionality was available for results in [[Google Maps]]. In the Froyo release of Google's Android operating system, certain advertisements included a very similar functionality. In iOS, phone numbers are automatically recognized as such. Web developers can also provide direct links to the Phone application, providing similar functionality.\n\nGoogle now offers a mobile click-to-call function which allows searchers to call a business directly rather than going to their website.\n\n=== Google AdWords Customer Match ===\nDue to the influence of brand messaging on consumer purchasing habits, Google expanded AdWords to include a Customer Match service. Customer Match allows advertisers to show ads to customers based on data they share with Google, as well as allowing advertisers to bid and create ads tailored to customers.\n\n=== Google Ad Grants ===\n\nGoogle Ad Grants provide US$10,000 per month to eligible nonprofit organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/grants/|title=Grants for Nonprofit Organizations {{!}} Google Ad Grants \u2013 Google|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref> The NGO can either use AdWords express or their Google Ads account to advertise their cause on the Google Search platform.\n\n'''Google Universal App Campaigns (UAC)'''\n\nGoogle launched a new style of campaign aimed at app developers looking to advertise their app on Google's vast ad network. On this campaign type advertisers don't get to pick who sees their ad and what their ad looks like. Rather the options are to chooses some text, images, a destination and a target bid and Google will do the rest for you. Using machine learning Google will try and figure out the best audiences for you using the budget set.\n\n== Technology ==\nThe AdWords system was initially implemented on top of the [[MySQL]] database engine. After the system had been launched, management decided to use [[Oracle database|Oracle]] instead. The system became much slower, and eventually, it was reverted to MySQL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|title=eldapo: Let's get a real database|last=Lembo|first=Phil|date=May 30, 2007|publisher=Eldapo.blogspot.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305152003/http://eldapo.blogspot.com/2007/05/lets-get-real-database.html|archivedate=March 5, 2012|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref> Eventually, Google developed a custom distributed [[Relational database management system]] (RDBMS) known as Google F1 specifically for the needs of the Ad business, which requires strong consistency, high scalability across data centers, and powerful SQL queries.\n\nThe interface has also been revamped to offer better workflow with additional new features, such as Spreadsheet Editing, Search Query Reports, and better [[Conversion marketing|conversion]] metrics.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAll ads on Google Ads are eligible to be shown on Google's search engine. Advertisers also have the option of enabling their ads to show on Google's partner networks. This \"search network\" includes [[AOL|AOL search]], [[Ask.com]], and [[Netscape]]. Ads served on partner networks do not affect ad quality score.\n\nThe Google Display Network (GDN), formerly referred to as the \"content network\", shows AdWords ads on sites that are not search engines. These GDN sites serve to publishers on [[AdSense]] and [[DoubleClick]], the other side of the Google advertising model. AdSense is used by website owners who wish to make money by displaying ads on their websites. Click-through rates on the display network are typically much lower than those on the search network and quality score for Display Network is calculated separately from Search network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?answer=140351|title=Quality Score: Definition - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\nFurther, Google automatically determines the subject of pages and displays relevant ads based on the advertisers' keyword lists. AdSense publishers may select channels to help direct Google's ad placements on pages to increase the performance of their ad units. There are many different types of ads that run across Google's network including text ads, image or banner ads, mobile text ads, and in-page video ads. In February 2016, Google began removing right-hand side ads from AdWords on a desktop in favor of only showing text ads above and below organic search results. Product Listing Ads and the Google Knowledge Graph were unaffected, and can still appear on the right-hand side.\n\n==Account management==\n[[File:Google Headquarters in Ireland Building Front Entrance.jpg|thumb|Google's headquarters in Ireland where all EU Google Ads account management takes place.]]\nTo help clients with the complexity of building and managing AdWords accounts, [[search engine marketing]] agencies and consultants offer account management services. This allowed organizations without advertising expertise to reach a global online audience. To help regulate Best Practices for AdWords Management, Google implemented the Google Partner Program and the Google Individual Qualification Program, both of which require individuals and agencies to meet benchmarks and pass exams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3125774?hl=en|title=About Google Partners - Google Partners Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref> Google also has its own in-house team of account managers who are assigned to clients to help optimize campaigns, increase returns and keep customers engaged in the platform. Smaller accounts will be assigned to a pool of account managers, whereas larger spending Google Ads users are given a dedicated account manager.\n\nGoogle also provides an offline account management software, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170322133444/https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/adwords-editor/ AdWords Editor].\n\nThe My Client Center feature is available to Google Professionals, regardless if they have passed the exam or budget parameters yet. With this feature, a Google professional has access to a dashboard summary of several accounts and can move between those accounts without logging into each account.\n\nThe [[Google Keyword Planner|Google AdWords Keyword Planner]], formerly the Keyword Tool, is a free AdWords tool which gives estimated traffic-per-month for the mentioned keywords. It provides a list of related keywords expected to be equally successful for a specific website or keyword.\n\nThe Google Display Planner is an AdWords tool to identify display network keywords, placements, and topics. It helps in expanding the reach of display campaigns while targeting relevant users for a business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/3056153?hl=en|title=Display Planner: Definition - Google Ads Help|website=support.google.com}}</ref>\n\n==Costs calculation methodology==\n\nThe cost of a Google AdWords campaign depends on a variety of factors which include bidding strategies and organization goals. As a result, the amount that an organization needs to spend varies based on industry and the keywords on which they bid. Whenever a user conducts a search on Google, AdWords runs an auction to determine which search ads are displayed on the search results page as well as the ad's position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1704424?hl=en%7Ctitle=How|title=How costs are calculated in AdWords - AdWords Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Factors===\n\nThere are four main factors that affect the cost and bidding factors of a Google AdWords campaign.\n\n* Your Bid - The maximum amount you are willing to pay for a click to your ad.\n*Keywords - Keywords that you target have great impact on the cost as well.  \n* The Quality of Your Ads - The relevancy and usefulness of your ad in contrast to the website it links to.\n* Extensions & Other Ad Formats - The relevance of your ad extensions or call outs and how frequently they are clicked.\n\n==Legal context==\nAdWords has generated lawsuits in the area of [[trademark law]] (see ''[[Google, Inc. v.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated.\"</ref> The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.<ref name=Smith7 /><ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Th\u00e9ophraste Renaudot]]: \"History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true.\"</ref><ref name=Pettegree3>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. \"Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market\u2014and by the sixteenth century it was a real market\u2014was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information.\"</ref> Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.<ref name=Park675>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 675\u2013676. \"News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences.\"</ref> News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past\u2014or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some \"peg\", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.<ref name=Park675 /><ref>Schudson, \"When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History\"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff & Schudson; pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.<ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Hence the famous dictum that \"Dog Bites Man\" is not news, but \"Man Bites Dog\" is.<ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 678.</ref>\n\nAnother corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. \"It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"news\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\"</ref> Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. \"The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\"</ref><ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. \"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\"</ref><ref name=MacGregor>Phil MacGregor, \"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nMost purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted.

News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests.

The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\"</ref> The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence of sponsorship==\nIt has been acknowledged that [[sponsorship]] has historically influenced various news stories.<ref name=marketrevealed>https://www.marketingweek.com/brands-set-to-stay-classy-with-anchorman-2/</ref><ref name=theweekreports>https://theweek.com/articles/453933/how-nonstop-marketing-killed-buzz-anchorman-2</ref><ref name=startribunereports>http://www.startribune.com/don-shelby-an-anchorman-s-take-on-anchorman-2/236808001/</ref> This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film [[Anchorman 2]].<ref name=marketrevealed /><ref name=theweekreports /><ref name=startribunereports /> One example in recent time is  the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets.<ref name=facebookbust>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/</ref><ref name=nbcreports /> Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \"stole the news business\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \"ghostwriters.\"<ref name=facebookbust /> In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.<ref name=nbcreports>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-300-million-investment-local-news-n958726</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-investing-300-million-to-bolster-local-news/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Toronto School of communication theory]] [http://wikiglobals.com wikiglobals]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Allan, Stuart, ''News Culture''.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref> Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 120.</ref> These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''\u2014\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\"\u2014and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 121.</ref> In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 124.</ref> Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.<ref>Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. \"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'.

A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias.

Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting.

[\u2026] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people.\"</ref> As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.<ref name=SilverblattZlobin28>Silverblatt & Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28\u201331. \"A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence\u2014regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels.\"</ref>\n\n===Public sphere===\nThis collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].<ref name=Starr24 /><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 677.</ref> In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.<ref name=\"Allen47\"/>\n\nThis idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.<ref>Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140\u2013144.</ref> According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179\u2013185.</ref> In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===News events===\nAs the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.<ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211\u2013213.</ref><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 685\u2013686. \"In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events\u2014at least as listener if not as spectator\u2014as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world.\"</ref>\n\nOne type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1\u201314.</ref> These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25\u201353.</ref> Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.</ref> Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = \"The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born\"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57\u201361.</ref> Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to \"rally\" behind its current leadership.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73\u201376.</ref> The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a \"crisis\", and influenced a presidential election.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73\u201377.</ref>\n\nSouth Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.<ref>Danie Du Plessis, \"What's News in South Africa?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. \"Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response.\"</ref> In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, \"What's News in the United States?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.</ref> In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families\u2014such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty]].<ref>Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, \"What's News in Jordan?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.</ref>\n\nNews coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.<ref>Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, \"Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory\"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A. Schuster, et al., \"A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks\", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.</ref> Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Terr |display-authors=etal  | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536\u201344}}</ref> Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.<ref>Gavin Rees, \"The Trauma Factor\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\nResearch also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 647\u2013668 | year= 1997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1997.tb00758.x }}</ref>\n\n===Influence===\nThe content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1\u201310.</ref> In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. \"Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\"</ref> The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence of sponsorship==\nIt has been acknowledged that [[sponsorship]] has historically influenced various news stories.<ref name=marketrevealed>https://www.marketingweek.com/brands-set-to-stay-classy-with-anchorman-2/</ref><ref name=theweekreports>https://theweek.com/articles/453933/how-nonstop-marketing-killed-buzz-anchorman-2</ref><ref name=startribunereports>http://www.startribune.com/don-shelby-an-anchorman-s-take-on-anchorman-2/236808001/</ref> This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film [[Anchorman 2]].<ref name=marketrevealed /><ref name=theweekreports /><ref name=startribunereports /> One example in recent time is  the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets.<ref name=facebookbust>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/</ref><ref name=nbcreports /> Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \"stole the news business\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \"ghostwriters.\"<ref name=facebookbust /> In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.<ref name=nbcreports>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-300-million-investment-local-news-n958726</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-investing-300-million-to-bolster-local-news/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Toronto School of communication theory]] [http://wikiglobals.com wikiglobals]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Allan, Stuart, ''News Culture''.

He served two terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]].  In 1863, he was convicted at an Army court martial of opposing the war, and exiled to the Confederacy.  He ran for governor of Ohio in 1863 from exile in Canada, but was defeated.\n\n==Early life==\nClement Laird Vallandigham was born July 29, 1820, in New Lisbon, Ohio (now [[Lisbon, Ohio]]), to Clement and Rebecca Laird Vallandigham.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=7-10}} His father, a [[Presbyterian]] minister, educated his son at home.<ref name=ohc>[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Clement_Vallandigham \"Clement Vallandigham\", Ohio History Central]</ref>\n\nIn 1841, Vallandigham had a dispute with the college president at [[Washington & Jefferson College|Jefferson College]] in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]]. He was honorably dismissed, but he never received a degree.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=24, 31}}\n\n[[Edwin M. Stanton]], the future Secretary of War under President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], was Vallandigham's close friend before the Civil War. Stanton lent Vallandigham $500 for a law course and to begin his own practice.<ref>Flower, Frank Abail. ''Edwin McMasters Stanton, the Autocrat of Rebellion, Emancipation and Reconstruction''. p. 252 fn, [[Boston]], MA: George M. Smith & Co., 1905.</ref> Both Vallandigham and Stanton were Democrats, but they held opposing views on [[slavery in the United States|slavery]].  Stanton was an [[abolitionism#United_States|abolitionist]] - Vallandigham an anti-abolitionist.\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Ohio legislature===\nShortly after beginning to practice law in [[Dayton, Ohio]], Vallandigham entered politics. He was elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] to the Ohio legislature in 1845 and 1846, and served as editor of a weekly newspaper, the ''Dayton Empire'', from 1847 until 1849.\n\nWhile in the Ohio state legislature, Vallandigham voted against the repeal of the \"Black Laws\" (laws against the [[civil rights]] of African-Americans), but he did want the question put to a [[referendum]] by the voters.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=53}} In 1851, Vallandigham sought the Democratic nomination to be Ohio's lieutenant governor, but the party declined to nominate him.<ref name=ohc/>\n\n===House of Representatives===\nVallandigham ran for Congress in 1856, but he was narrowly defeated. He appealed to the Committee of Elections of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], claiming that illegal votes had been cast. The House eventually agreed, and Vallandigham was seated on the next to last day of the term. The delay was due to \"the division which had arisen in the Democratic party upon the [[Lecompton]] question.\"{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=100}} He was reelected by a small margin in 1858.\n\nIn October 1859, radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raided Harper's Ferry, Virginia]], seizing the United States Army Arsenal. Vallandigham was member of a group of government officials who interrogated the captured Brown as to his aims, which Brown stated were an attempt to set off a rebellion of slaves to secure their freedom.<ref>Vallandigham, Clement Laird, ''Speeches, Arguments, Addresses and Letters of Clement L. Vallandigham'', pp. 201-205, New York: J. Walter and Co., 1864.</ref>\n\nVallandigham was always a vigorous supporter of constitutional [[states' rights]].<ref name=nps>[http://www.nps.gov/resources/person.htm?id=111 \"Clement L. Vallandigham\", National Park Service]</ref> He believed the federal government had no power to regulate any legal institution, which slavery at the time was. He also believed the states had an implied right to [[secede]] and that, legally, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] could not militarily be conquered. Vallandigham was a believer in low [[tariff]]s and that slavery was a matter for each state to decide. During the ensuing war, he would become one of [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s most outspoken critics.<ref name=ohc/><ref name=house>[http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/36315?ret=True \"Representative Clement Vallandigham of Ohio\", Historical Highlights, US House of Representatives]</ref>\n\nHe was re-elected to the House in 1860. During the 1860 presidential campaign, he supported [[Stephen A. Douglas]], although he disagreed with Douglas's position on \"squatter sovereignty\", which was used by detractors to describe [[popular sovereignty]].{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=137}} \n\nOn February 20, 1861, Vallandigham delivered a speech titled \"The Great American Revolution\" to the House of Representatives. He accused the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of being \"belligerent\" and advocated a \"choice of peaceable disunion upon the one hand, or Union through adjustment and conciliation upon the other.\" Vallandigham supported the [[Crittenden Compromise]], which was a last minute effort to avert the Civil War. He blamed [[sectionalism]] and anti-slavery sentiment for the secession crisis. Vallandigham proposed a series of amendments to the Constitution. The United States would be divided into four sections: North, South, West, and Pacific. The four sections would each have the power in the Senate to veto legislation. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] would be modified, with the term of President and Vice-President increased to six years and limited to one term unless two-thirds of the electors agreed. Secession by a state could only be agreed to if the legislatures of the sections approved it. Moving between the sections was a guaranteed right.<ref>Vallandigham, Clement Laird. \"The Great American Revolution of 1861\", ''The Congressional Globe: Containing the Debates and Proceedings of the Thirty-sixth Congress: Also of the Special Session of the Senate'', edited by John C. Rives, 235-243. Washington, DC: Congressional Globe Office, 1861.</ref>\n\nVallandigham strongly opposed every military bill, leading his opponents to charge that he wanted the Confederacy to win the war. He became the acknowledged leader of the anti-war [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]], and in an address on May 8, 1862, he coined their slogan: \"To maintain the Constitution as it is, and to restore the Union as it was.\" It was endorsed by fifteen Democratic congressmen.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=205-207}}\n\nVallandigham lost his bid for a third full term in 1862 by a relatively large vote, which loss meant he would be out of office early in 1863.  However, his loss was at least partially due to [[redistricting]] his Congressional district.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=215-217}} Despite this loss, some still considered him to be a future presidential candidate.<ref>Kirkland, Edward Chase. ''The Peacemakers of 1864'', p. 35, New York, NY: [[The MacMillan Company]], 1927.</ref>\n\nAs a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] Representative, Vallandigham delivered a speech in the House on January 14, 1863, entitled \"The Constitution-Peace-Reunion\". In it, he stated his opposition to [[abolitionism]] from the \"beginning\". He denounced Lincoln's violations of [[civil liberties]], \"which have made this country one of the worst [[despotism]]s on earth\". Vallandigham openly criticized Lincoln's preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]], charging that \"war for the Union was abandoned; war for the Negro openly begun.\" He also condemned financial interests that were profiting from the war. \"And let not [[Wall street]], or any other great interest, mercantile, manufacturing, or commercial, imagine that it shall have power enough or wealth enough to stand in the way of reunion through peace.\" Vallandigham added, \"Defeat, debt, taxation, sepulchers, these are your trophies.\" Vallandigham's speech included a proposal to end the military conflict. He advocated an [[armistice]] and the demobilization of the military forces of both the Union and Confederacy.<ref>Vallandigham, Clement Laird. \"The Constitution - Peace - Reunion\".

Burnside]] issued [[General Order Number 38]], warning that the \"habit of declaring sympathies for the enemy\" would not be tolerated in the Military District of Ohio, Vallandigham gave a major speech on May 1, 1863. He charged that the war was no longer being fought to save the Union, but it had become an attempt to free the slaves by sacrificing the liberty of white Americans to \"King Lincoln\".<ref>Vallandigham, Clement Laird, ''The Trial Hon.

Boston and New York: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], 1911.</ref>\n\nThe authority for Burnside's order came from a proclamation of September 24, 1862, in which President Lincoln suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and made discouraging enlistments, drafts, or any other \"disloyal\" practices subject to [[martial law]] and trial by military commissions.<ref>Lincoln, Abraham. ''Abraham Lincoln Complete Works''. Edited by [[John G. Nicolay]] and [[John Hay]]. Vol. II. p. 239, New York, NY: [[The Century Co.]], 1920.</ref>\n\n===Arrest and military trial===\n[[File:CLVallandigham-arrest.jpg|thumb|Vallandigham's arrest, 1863]]\nOn May 5, 1863, Vallandigham was arrested as a violator of [[General Order Number 38]]. His enraged supporters burned the offices of the ''[[Dayton Journal]]'', the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] rival to the ''Empire''. Vallandigham was tried by a military court on May 6 and 7. Vallandigham's speech at [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]], was cited as the source of the arrest. He was charged by the Military Commission with \"Publicly expressing, in violation of General Orders No. 38, from Head-quarters Department of the Ohio, sympathy for those in arms against the Government of the United States, and declaring disloyal sentiments and opinions, with the object and purpose of weakening the power of the Government in its efforts to suppress an unlawful rebellion.\"{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), p. 11}}\n\nThe specifications of the charge against Vallandigham were:\n\nDeclaring the present war \"a wicked, cruel, and unnecessary war\"; \"a war not being waged for the preservation of the Union\"; \"a war for the purpose of crushing out liberty and erecting a despotism\"; \"a war for the freedom of the blacks and the enslavement of the whites\"; stating \"that if the Administration had so wished, the war could have been honorably terminated months ago\"; that \"peace might have been honorably obtained by listening to the proposed intermediation of [[France]]\"; that \"propositions by which the Northern States could be won back, and the South guaranteed their rights under the Constitution, had been rejected the day before the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|late battle of Fredericksburg]], by Lincoln and his minions\", meaning thereby the President of the United States, and those under him in authority; charging \"that the Government of the United States was about to appoint military marshals in every district, to restrain the people of their liberties, to deprive them of their rights and privileges\"; characterizing General Orders No. 38, from Headquarters Department of the Ohio, as \"a base usurpation of arbitrary authority\", inviting his hearers to resist the same, by saying, \"the sooner the people inform the minions of usurped power that they will not submit to such restrictions upon their liberties, the better\"; declaring \"that he was at all times, and upon all occasions, resolved to do what he could to defeat the attempts now being made to build up a [[monarchy]] upon the ruins of our free government\"; asserting \"that he firmly believed, as he said six months ago, that the men in power are attempting to establish a despotism in this country, more cruel and more oppressive than ever existed before.\"\n\nAll of which opinions and sentiments he well knew did aid, comfort, and encourage those in arms against the Government, and could but induce in his hearers a distrust of their own Government, sympathy for those in arms against it, and a disposition to resist the laws of the land.{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), pp. 11-12}}\n\nThe peace proposal of France was true; Vallandigham had been requested by [[Horace Greeley]] to assist in the peace plan.<ref>Porter, George Henry. ''Ohio Politics During the Civil War Period''. p. 148, fn 1, New York, NY, 1911.</ref>\n\nCaptain James Madison Cutts served as the judge advocate in the military trial, and he was responsible for authoring the charges against Vallandigham.<ref>Joshua E. Kastenberg, Law in War, Law as War: Brigadier General Joseph Holt and the Judge Advocate General\u2019s Department in the Civil War and Early Reconstruction, 1861-1865 (Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2011), 106</ref>  During the trial, testimony was given by Union army officers who attended the speech in civilian clothes, that Vallandigham called the president \"King Lincoln\".{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), p. 23}} He was sentenced to confinement in a military prison \"during the continuance of the war\" at [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]] in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), p. 33}}.  Vallandingham only called one witness in his defense, Congressman Samuel S. Cox.  According to University of New Mexico School of Law Professor Joshua E. Kastenberg, because Cox was a well-known anti-war Democrat, his presence at the military court likely harmed Vallandigam's attempts at arguing his innocence.<ref>Id</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 1863, an application for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was filed in federal court for Vallandigham by former Ohio Senator [[George E. Pugh]].{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), p. 40}} Judge [[Humphrey H. Leavitt]] of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio upheld Vallandigham's arrest and military trial as a valid exercise of the President's [[war powers]].{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), pp. 259-272}} Congress had passed an act authorizing the president to suspend ''habeas corpus'' on March 3, 1863.<ref>Pittman, Benn, ''The Trials for Treason at Indianapolis, Disclosing the Plans for Establishing a North-Western Confederacy''. p. 253, Cincinnati, OH: Moore, Wilstach & Baldwin, 1865.</ref>\n\nControversy and protests ensued. On May 16, 1863, there was a meeting at [[Albany, New York]], to protest the arrest of Vallandigham. A letter from Governor [[Horatio Seymour]] of New York was read to the crowd. Seymour charged that \"military despotism\" had been established. Resolutions by the Hon. John V. L. Pruyin were adopted.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=288-293}} The resolutions were sent to President Lincoln by [[Erastus Corning]]. In response to a public letter issued at the meeting of angry Democrats in Albany, Lincoln's \"Letter to Erastus Corning et al.\" of June 12, 1863, explains his justification for supporting the court-martial's conviction.\n\nIn February 1864, the Supreme Court ruled that it had no power to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus'' to a military commission (''[[Ex parte Vallandigham]]'', 1 Wallace, 243).\n\n===Expulsion===\n[[File:1864 US election poster.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] poster for Pennsylvania warning of disaster if McClellan wins.]]\n\nLincoln, who considered Vallandigham a \"wily agitator\", was wary of making him a martyr to the Copperhead cause and on May 19, 1863, ordered him sent through the enemy lines to the Confederacy.<ref name=nps/>{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=34}} When he was within Confederate lines, Vallandigham said: \"I am a citizen of Ohio, and of the United States. I am here within your lines by force, and against my will. I therefore surrender myself to you as a prisoner of war.\"{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=300}}\n\nOn May 30, 1863, a meeting was held at Military Park in [[Newark, New Jersey]], where a letter was read from New Jersey Governor [[Joel Parker (politician)|Joel Parker]]. Parker's letter condemned the arrest, trial and deportation of Vallandigham, saying they \"were arbitrary and illegal acts. The whole proceeding was wrong in principle and dangerous in its tendency.\" However, the meeting was sparsely attended.<ref>\"Vallandigham Meeting in Newark.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 31, 1863.</ref> The ''[[New York World]]'' reported on the meeting in Albany. Burnside suppressed publication of the ''World''.{{sfn|Porter, p. 167}} On June 1, 1863, another protest meeting was held in [[Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=293-295}}\n\nOn June 2, 1863, Vallandigham was sent to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], by [[Jefferson Davis|President Davis]] and was briefly put under guard as an \"alien enemy\".<ref>Long, E.B., and Long, Barbara. ''The Civil War Day by Day'' (New York, NY: [[Da Capo Press]], Inc., 1971)</ref>\n\nPresident Lincoln wrote the \"[[Birchard Letter]]\" of June 29, 1863, to several Ohio congressmen, offering to revoke Vallandigham's deportation order if they would agree to support certain policies of the Administration.\n\nVallandigham travelled to [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he met with [[Robert Ould]], a former classmate. He advised Ould that the Confederate army should not invade [[Pennsylvania]], since it would unite the North against the Copperheads in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].<ref>Jones, John Beauchamp, ''A Rebel War Clerks Diary at the Confederate States Capital'', Volume I, p. 357-8.</ref> However, a letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave a different version, saying that Vallandigham encouraged the invasion.<ref>Reinish, Henery. \"Vallandigham and the Invasion of Lee\".

He talked to Thompson about plans for forming a Northwestern Confederacy, consisting of the states of Ohio, [[Kentucky]], [[Indiana]], and [[Illinois]], by overthrowing their governments. He requested money for weapons from the Confederates. Vallandigham refused to handle the money himself, and it was given to his associate James A. Barrett.

On June 24, 1864, Lincoln drafted a letter to Governor Brough and General Heintzelman stating \"watch Vallandigham and others closely\" and arrest them if needed.

It was against the \"[[Enforcement Act of 1871 (third act)|Ku-Klux Bill]]\" (Item 17).{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=438-444}} \"New Departure\" was endorsed by [[Salmon P.

He was representing a defendant, Thomas McGehean,{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=516}} in a murder case for killing a man in a barroom brawl in [[Hamilton, Ohio]]. Vallandigham attempted to prove the victim, Tom Myers, had in fact accidentally shot himself while drawing his pistol from a pocket while rising from a kneeling position. As Vallandigham conferred with fellow defense attorneys in his hotel room at the Lebanon House, later the [[Golden Lamb Inn]], he showed them how he would demonstrate this to the jury. Selecting a pistol he believed to be unloaded, he put it in his pocket and enacted the events as they might have happened, snagging the loaded gun on his clothing and unintentionally causing it to discharge into his belly. Although he was fatally wounded, Vallandigham's demonstration proved his point, and the defendant, Thomas McGehean, was acquitted and released from custody (only to be shot to death four years later in his saloon).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Biographical and historical sketches: a narrative of Hamilton and its residents from 1792 ...|last=Cone|first=Stephen Decatur|publisher=Republican Publishing Company|year=1901|isbn=|location=Hamilton, Ohio|pages=144}}</ref> Surgeons probed for the pistol ball, thought to have lodged in the vicinity of Vallandigham's [[bladder]], but were unable to locate it, and Vallandigham died the next day of [[peritonitis]].

Vallandigham wins the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]], and the electorate turns sharply against the Republicans, held responsible for the disaster. Vallandigham's Presidency is haunted by economic crisis and high inflation, due to the reparations imposed by the victorious Confederacy. The US would be permanently crippled by the post-war crisis and left a backward country, and future generations would hold Vallandigham partially responsible.\n\nIn [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s 1991 alternate history novel ''[[The Difference Engine]]'', Vallandigham is mentioned in a brief vignette taking place in 1870.  In the vignette, he is \"the ex President of the American Union,\" and becomes intoxicated at a party in London and creates an embarrassing scene.\n\nIn [[Harry Turtledove]]'s 1992 alternate history novel ''[[The Guns of the South]]'', Vallandigham was Democratic candidate [[Horatio Seymour]]'s running mate in the 1864 presidential election.

He ran for governor of Ohio in 1863 from exile in Canada, but was defeated.\n\n==Early life==\nClement Laird Vallandigham was born July 29, 1820, in New Lisbon, Ohio (now [[Lisbon, Ohio]]), to Clement and Rebecca Laird Vallandigham.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=7-10}} His father, a [[Presbyterian]] minister, educated his son at home.<ref name=ohc>[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Clement_Vallandigham \"Clement Vallandigham\", Ohio History Central]</ref>\n\nIn 1841, Vallandigham had a dispute with the college president at [[Washington & Jefferson College|Jefferson College]] in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]]. He was honorably dismissed, but he never received a degree.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=24, 31}}\n\n[[Edwin M.

He was elected as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] to the Ohio legislature in 1845 and 1846, and served as editor of a weekly newspaper, the ''Dayton Empire'', from 1847 until 1849.\n\nWhile in the Ohio state legislature, Vallandigham voted against the repeal of the \"Black Laws\" (laws against the [[civil rights]] of African-Americans), but he did want the question put to a [[referendum]] by the voters.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=53}} In 1851, Vallandigham sought the Democratic nomination to be Ohio's lieutenant governor, but the party declined to nominate him.<ref name=ohc/>\n\n===House of Representatives===\nVallandigham ran for Congress in 1856, but he was narrowly defeated. He appealed to the Committee of Elections of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], claiming that illegal votes had been cast. The House eventually agreed, and Vallandigham was seated on the next to last day of the term. The delay was due to \"the division which had arisen in the Democratic party upon the [[Lecompton]] question.\"{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=100}} He was reelected by a small margin in 1858.\n\nIn October 1859, radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raided Harper's Ferry, Virginia]], seizing the United States Army Arsenal.

He accused the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] of being \"belligerent\" and advocated a \"choice of peaceable disunion upon the one hand, or Union through adjustment and conciliation upon the other.\" Vallandigham supported the [[Crittenden Compromise]], which was a last minute effort to avert the Civil War. He blamed [[sectionalism]] and anti-slavery sentiment for the secession crisis. Vallandigham proposed a series of amendments to the Constitution. The United States would be divided into four sections: North, South, West, and Pacific. The four sections would each have the power in the Senate to veto legislation. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] would be modified, with the term of President and Vice-President increased to six years and limited to one term unless two-thirds of the electors agreed. Secession by a state could only be agreed to if the legislatures of the sections approved it. Moving between the sections was a guaranteed right.<ref>Vallandigham, Clement Laird. \"The Great American Revolution of 1861\", ''The Congressional Globe: Containing the Debates and Proceedings of the Thirty-sixth Congress: Also of the Special Session of the Senate'', edited by John C.

He became the acknowledged leader of the anti-war [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]], and in an address on May 8, 1862, he coined their slogan: \"To maintain the Constitution as it is, and to restore the Union as it was.\" It was endorsed by fifteen Democratic congressmen.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=205-207}}\n\nVallandigham lost his bid for a third full term in 1862 by a relatively large vote, which loss meant he would be out of office early in 1863.

''The Peacemakers of 1864'', p. 35, New York, NY: [[The MacMillan Company]], 1927.</ref>\n\nAs a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] Representative, Vallandigham delivered a speech in the House on January 14, 1863, entitled \"The Constitution-Peace-Reunion\". In it, he stated his opposition to [[abolitionism]] from the \"beginning\". He denounced Lincoln's violations of [[civil liberties]], \"which have made this country one of the worst [[despotism]]s on earth\". Vallandigham openly criticized Lincoln's preliminary [[Emancipation Proclamation]], charging that \"war for the Union was abandoned; war for the Negro openly begun.\" He also condemned financial interests that were profiting from the war. \"And let not [[Wall street]], or any other great interest, mercantile, manufacturing, or commercial, imagine that it shall have power enough or wealth enough to stand in the way of reunion through peace.\" Vallandigham added, \"Defeat, debt, taxation, sepulchers, these are your trophies.\" Vallandigham's speech included a proposal to end the military conflict.

Vallandigham was tried by a military court on May 6 and 7. Vallandigham's speech at [[Mount Vernon, Ohio]], was cited as the source of the arrest. He was charged by the Military Commission with \"Publicly expressing, in violation of General Orders No. 38, from Head-quarters Department of the Ohio, sympathy for those in arms against the Government of the United States, and declaring disloyal sentiments and opinions, with the object and purpose of weakening the power of the Government in its efforts to suppress an unlawful rebellion.\"{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), p. 11}}\n\nThe specifications of the charge against Vallandigham were:\n\nDeclaring the present war \"a wicked, cruel, and unnecessary war\"; \"a war not being waged for the preservation of the Union\"; \"a war for the purpose of crushing out liberty and erecting a despotism\"; \"a war for the freedom of the blacks and the enslavement of the whites\"; stating \"that if the Administration had so wished, the war could have been honorably terminated months ago\"; that \"peace might have been honorably obtained by listening to the proposed intermediation of [[France]]\"; that \"propositions by which the Northern States could be won back, and the South guaranteed their rights under the Constitution, had been rejected the day before the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|late battle of Fredericksburg]], by Lincoln and his minions\", meaning thereby the President of the United States, and those under him in authority; charging \"that the Government of the United States was about to appoint military marshals in every district, to restrain the people of their liberties, to deprive them of their rights and privileges\"; characterizing General Orders No. 38, from Headquarters Department of the Ohio, as \"a base usurpation of arbitrary authority\", inviting his hearers to resist the same, by saying, \"the sooner the people inform the minions of usurped power that they will not submit to such restrictions upon their liberties, the better\"; declaring \"that he was at all times, and upon all occasions, resolved to do what he could to defeat the attempts now being made to build up a [[monarchy]] upon the ruins of our free government\"; asserting \"that he firmly believed, as he said six months ago, that the men in power are attempting to establish a despotism in this country, more cruel and more oppressive than ever existed before.\"\n\nAll of which opinions and sentiments he well knew did aid, comfort, and encourage those in arms against the Government, and could but induce in his hearers a distrust of their own Government, sympathy for those in arms against it, and a disposition to resist the laws of the land.{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), pp. 11-12}}\n\nThe peace proposal of France was true; Vallandigham had been requested by [[Horace Greeley]] to assist in the peace plan.<ref>Porter, George Henry.

Vallandingham only called one witness in his defense, Congressman Samuel S. Cox.  According to University of New Mexico School of Law Professor Joshua E. Kastenberg, because Cox was a well-known anti-war Democrat, his presence at the military court likely harmed Vallandigam's attempts at arguing his innocence.<ref>Id</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 1863, an application for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was filed in federal court for Vallandigham by former Ohio Senator [[George E. Pugh]].{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), p. 40}} Judge [[Humphrey H. Leavitt]] of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio upheld Vallandigham's arrest and military trial as a valid exercise of the President's [[war powers]].{{sfn|Vallandigham (Trial), pp. 259-272}} Congress had passed an act authorizing the president to suspend ''habeas corpus'' on March 3, 1863.<ref>Pittman, Benn, ''The Trials for Treason at Indianapolis, Disclosing the Plans for Establishing a North-Western Confederacy''. p. 253, Cincinnati, OH: Moore, Wilstach & Baldwin, 1865.</ref>\n\nControversy and protests ensued. On May 16, 1863, there was a meeting at [[Albany, New York]], to protest the arrest of Vallandigham. A letter from Governor [[Horatio Seymour]] of New York was read to the crowd. Seymour charged that \"military despotism\" had been established. Resolutions by the Hon. John V. L. Pruyin were adopted.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=288-293}} The resolutions were sent to President Lincoln by [[Erastus Corning]]. In response to a public letter issued at the meeting of angry Democrats in Albany, Lincoln's \"Letter to Erastus Corning et al.\" of June 12, 1863, explains his justification for supporting the court-martial's conviction.\n\nIn February 1864, the Supreme Court ruled that it had no power to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus'' to a military commission (''[[Ex parte Vallandigham]]'', 1 Wallace, 243).\n\n===Expulsion===\n[[File:1864 US election poster.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]] poster for Pennsylvania warning of disaster if McClellan wins.]]\n\nLincoln, who considered Vallandigham a \"wily agitator\", was wary of making him a martyr to the Copperhead cause and on May 19, 1863, ordered him sent through the enemy lines to the Confederacy.<ref name=nps/>{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=34}} When he was within Confederate lines, Vallandigham said: \"I am a citizen of Ohio, and of the United States.

Parker's letter condemned the arrest, trial and deportation of Vallandigham, saying they \"were arbitrary and illegal acts. The whole proceeding was wrong in principle and dangerous in its tendency.\" However, the meeting was sparsely attended.<ref>\"Vallandigham Meeting in Newark.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

''The Civil War Day by Day'' (New York, NY: [[Da Capo Press]], Inc., 1971)</ref>\n\nPresident Lincoln wrote the \"[[Birchard Letter]]\" of June 29, 1863, to several Ohio congressmen, offering to revoke Vallandigham's deportation order if they would agree to support certain policies of the Administration.\n\nVallandigham travelled to [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he met with [[Robert Ould]], a former classmate. He advised Ould that the Confederate army should not invade [[Pennsylvania]], since it would unite the North against the Copperheads in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1864|1864 presidential election]].<ref>Jones, John Beauchamp, ''A Rebel War Clerks Diary at the Confederate States Capital'', Volume I, p. 357-8.</ref> However, a letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave a different version, saying that Vallandigham encouraged the invasion.<ref>Reinish, Henery. \"Vallandigham and the Invasion of Lee\".

He talked to Thompson about plans for forming a Northwestern Confederacy, consisting of the states of Ohio, [[Kentucky]], [[Indiana]], and [[Illinois]], by overthrowing their governments. He requested money for weapons from the Confederates. Vallandigham refused to handle the money himself, and it was given to his associate James A. Barrett. Part of the Confederate plan was to liberate Confederate prisoners of war.<ref>Castleman, John Breckenridge. ''Active Service''. pp. 145-146, [[Louisville, KY]]: Courier-Journal Job Printing, 1917.</ref> The intended revolt never materialized.\n\nVallandigham returned to the United States \"under heavy disguise\" and publicly appeared at an Ohio convention on June 15, 1864.{{sfn|Porter, p. 195}} President Lincoln was informed of his return. On June 24, 1864, Lincoln drafted a letter to Governor Brough and General Heintzelman stating \"watch Vallandigham and others closely\" and arrest them if needed. However, he did not send the letter, and it appears he decided to do nothing about Vallandigham's return.{{sfn|Nicolay, p. 535}} In late August, Vallandigham openly attended the [[1864 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]].

McClellan]] made peace conditional on the Confederacy being ready for peace and ready to rejoin the Union.{{sfn|NDC, p. 60}} McClellan's stance conflicted with the Democratic Party Platform of 1864 which stated that \"immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate convention of the States, or other peaceable means, to the end that, at the earliest practicable moment, peace may be restored on the basis of the Federal union of the States.\"<ref>[http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1489 \"The 1864 Democratic Party Platform\", Teaching American History]</ref> Vallandigham supported his party's nomination of McClellan for the presidency but was \"highly indignant\" when McClellan repudiated the party platform in his letter of acceptance of the nomination.{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=367}} For a time, Vallandigham withdrew from campaigning for McClellan.{{sfn|Porter, p. 197}}  The contradiction between the party platform and McClellan's views weakened Democratic efforts to win voters over.\n\nThe [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] became the Order of American Knights and then evolved into the Sons of Liberty. In late September 1864, the trial of six members of the Knights of the Golden Circle, Harrison H. Dodd, William A. Bowles, Andrew Humphreys, Horace Heffren, and [[Lambdin P. Milligan]] began in [[Indianapolis]] before a military commission. George E. Pugh testified at the trial as a government witness.{{sfn|Pittman, pp. 37-38}} Testimony was given that confirmed that Vallandigham was \"Supreme Commander\"{{sfn|Pittman, p. 24}} and James A.

''The New York Times''. August 14, 1867.</ref> However, his views later changed with the [[New Departure (Democrats)|New Departure]] policy.\n\nVallandigham returned to Ohio, lost his campaigns for the Senate against Judge [[Allen G. Thurman]]{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=422}} and the House of Representatives against [[Robert C. Schenck]]{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=430}} on an anti-[[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] platform, and then resumed his law practice.\n\nIn 1871, Vallandigham won the Ohio Democrats over to the \"New Departure\" policy that would essentially neglect to mention the Civil War, \"thus burying out of sight all that is of the dead past, namely, the right of secession, slavery, inequality before the law, and political inequality; and further, now that reconstruction is complete, and representation within the Union restored\", but also affirmed \"the Democratic party pledges itself to the full, faithful, and absolute execution and enforcement of the Constitution as it now is, so as to secure equal rights to all persons under it, without distinction of race, color, or condition.\" It also called for [[civil service]] reform and a [[progressive income tax]] (Items 10 & 12). It was against the \"[[Enforcement Act of 1871 (third act)|Ku-Klux Bill]]\" (Item 17).{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=438-444}} \"New Departure\" was endorsed by [[Salmon P. Chase]], a former Lincoln cabinet member and [[Chief Justice of the United States]].{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=446}}\n\n==Death==\nVallandigham died in 1871 in [[Lebanon, Ohio]], at the age of 50, after accidentally shooting himself in the abdomen with a pistol. He was representing a defendant, Thomas McGehean,{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=516}} in a murder case for killing a man in a barroom brawl in [[Hamilton, Ohio]]. Vallandigham attempted to prove the victim, Tom Myers, had in fact accidentally shot himself while drawing his pistol from a pocket while rising from a kneeling position. As Vallandigham conferred with fellow defense attorneys in his hotel room at the Lebanon House, later the [[Golden Lamb Inn]], he showed them how he would demonstrate this to the jury. Selecting a pistol he believed to be unloaded, he put it in his pocket and enacted the events as they might have happened, snagging the loaded gun on his clothing and unintentionally causing it to discharge into his belly. Although he was fatally wounded, Vallandigham's demonstration proved his point, and the defendant, Thomas McGehean, was acquitted and released from custody (only to be shot to death four years later in his saloon).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Biographical and historical sketches: a narrative of Hamilton and its residents from 1792 ...|last=Cone|first=Stephen Decatur|publisher=Republican Publishing Company|year=1901|isbn=|location=Hamilton, Ohio|pages=144}}</ref> Surgeons probed for the pistol ball, thought to have lodged in the vicinity of Vallandigham's [[bladder]], but were unable to locate it, and Vallandigham died the next day of [[peritonitis]]. His last words expressed his faith in \"that good old [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] doctrine of [[predestination]]\".{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=529}} Survived by his wife, Louisa Anna (McMahon) Vallandigham, and his son Charles Vallandigham, he was buried in [[Woodland Cemetery and Arboretum|Woodland Cemetery]] in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nVallandigham was eulogized by [[James W. Wall]], a former senator from New Jersey, who mentioned recently meeting with him about \"New Departure\".{{sfn|Vallandigham|1872|p=567-573}} Wall had been imprisoned during the Civil War by Union authorities.\n\n[[John A. McMahon]], Vallandigham's nephew, was also a U.S. representative from Ohio.\n\n==Legacy==\nVallandigham's deportation to the Confederacy prompted [[Edward Everett Hale]] to write \"[[The Man Without a Country]]\".<ref>[http://www.whatsoproudlywehail.org/curr/session-1/ \"The Man Without a Country\" Study Guide] at What So Proudly We Hail Curriculum.

Vallandigham wins the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]], and the electorate turns sharply against the Republicans, held responsible for the disaster. Vallandigham's Presidency is haunted by economic crisis and high inflation, due to the reparations imposed by the victorious Confederacy. The US would be permanently crippled by the post-war crisis and left a backward country, and future generations would hold Vallandigham partially responsible.\n\nIn [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s 1991 alternate history novel [[The Difference Engine]], Vallandigham is mentioned in a brief vignette taking place in 1870.  In the vignette, he is \"the ex President of the American Union,\" and becomes intoxicated at a party in London and creates an embarrassing scene.\n\nIn [[Harry Turtledove]]'s 1992 alternate history novel ''[[The Guns of the South]]'', Vallandigham was Democratic candidate [[Horatio Seymour]]'s running mate in the 1864 presidential election. The ticket defeated Republican incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hannibal Hamlin]] by a narrow margin.\n\n{{Portal|Biography|American Civil War}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{commons category}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/moa-cgi?notisid=ABP2287-0038-20 Nicolay, John, and Hay, John. \"Abraham Lincoln: A History.
