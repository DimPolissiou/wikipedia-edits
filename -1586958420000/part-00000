''Yibum'' = levirate marriage) when they had no offspring. The problem, however, that arises here is that a man whose daughter was married to his brother, had his brother died childless, he (the living brother who is the father of his brother's wife) could not consummate a marriage with his own daughter, a thing prohibited in Jewish law, and therefore even the co-wives of his brother assume the same prohibition and are forbidden for him to marry.</ref> (b) that Jews living in the regions of [[Ammon]] and [[Moab]] separate from their produce the [[Poor tithe|poor man's tithe]] during the [[Sabbatical year (Bible)|Sabbatical year]]; (c) that they accept of proselytes from the peoples of [[Tadmor]] (Palmyra) and from the people of [[Kardu|\u1e32ardu]].\n\n== Liturgical commemoration ==\nOn the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]], Haggai is commemorated as a [[saint]] and prophet. His [[feast day]] is 16 December (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 16 December currently falls on 29 December of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]).

After the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] took over control of the [[Cape Colony]] the second colonial governor, [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lord Charles Henry Somerset]] {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]]}}, gave permission for the funds reserved by de Mist to be used to establish the South African College in 1814.\n\nThe founding committee met in the [[Groote Kerk, Cape Town|Groote Kerk]] to discuss funding and accommodation for the school and on 1 October 1829, the inauguration of the South African College was held and classes began. The original location of the school was in the ''Weeshuis'' on Long Street and moved to what is now known as the ''Egyptian Building'' in the Gardens district of Cape Town in 1841.\n\nIt was decided in 1874 that the younger students should be separated from their older counterparts. The South African College was separated into the ''College'' which became the [[University of Cape Town]] and the ''College School''.<ref>{{cite book|title=\tStandard encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, Volume 10|publisher=NASOU|year=1976|page=96}}</ref>\n\nThe College School moved to its own building on Orange Street, separate from the College, in 1896. For the next few decades, the school grew and the building became too small for the number of students attending.\n\nIn 1959 the school moved to its current home in the Montebello Estate in Newlands,<ref>{{cite book|title=Cape Town, city of good hope|last=Honikman|first=A.

Timmins|year=1966|page=63}}</ref> former home of the mining magnate [[Max Michaelis|Sir Max Michaelis]], after a decade-long negotiation with the Cape Administration.\n\nIn 2012, the school grounds were used to film Spud 2: The Madness Continues. \n\n{{Coord|33|58|13.45|S|18|27|36.38|E|display=title}}\n\n==School buildings==\nThe current school buildings are situated along Dean Street and Newlands Avenue in Cape Town.\n\nThe Junior School is located along Dean Street and is equipped with numerous fields for sporting activities, of which some are shared with the High School. The Junior School has a full length swimming pool with a smaller children's pool for the younger students. A number of [[tennis]] courts are also available to the students. The Junior School has a new Media Centre which hosts computer facilities, a new library and classrooms. The music department also has its own [[auditorium]] for cultural events and is also used for events with smaller audiences. The Junior School's [[boarding house]] is named after ''J E De Villiers''.\n\nThe High School is closest to Newlands Avenue which also hosts a number of sport fields for the various sports which the school offers throughout the year. The swimming pool is mainly used for [[Water Polo]] and is also heated to facilitate training and usage in winter. The High School also recently had a new Media Centre constructed with air-conditioned computer labs and library. The school hall is named after one of its most famous students, [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894-1948)|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr]]. The boarding houses for the High School are the ''Michaelis House'' (for the junior students) and ''Rosedale House'' (for the senior students).\n\n== High School Sport ==\nSACS offers a wide variety of summer and winter sports for boys to partake in during the year. Boys are made to partake in at least one main summer and winter sport and may also partake in other secondar sports, provided they are involved in a main sport first.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*'''Main summer sports'''\n** [[Cricket]]\n** Swimming\n** [[Water polo|Waterpolo]]\n** [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]\n** [[Tennis]]\n** [[Basketball]]\n** [[Sport of athletics|Athletics]]\n*'''Secondary summer sports'''\n** [[Sailing (sport)|Sailing]]\n**[[Road cycling]]\n*'''Main winter sports'''\n** [[Rugby union]]\n** [[Rugby union|Hocke]] [[Field hockey|y]]\n** [[Cross country running|Cross-country]]\n** [[Squash (sport)|Squash]]\n** [[Mountain biking]]\n*'''Secondary winter sports'''\n** [[Bodyboarding]]\n** [[Golf]]\n** [[Surfing]]\n** [[Shooting sport|Shooting]] (Currently Inactive)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== High school clubs and societies  ==\nCulture plays a large role in the SACS High School community. Many clubs, societies and bands are situated within the high school and are largely run and coordinated by the boys, with each club or society being supervised by a teacher. As of 2016, there were active clubs, societies and bands operating within SACS.

Prior to this, the pupils wore what they could afford while still being presentable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.capeargus.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=342&fArticleId=2516444|title=School uniforms \u2013 what purpose do they serve?|date=11 May 2005|first=Fouzia|last=van der Fort}}</ref>\n\nToday the High School uniform consists of a summer and winter uniform. During summer, boys wear khaki shorts with long khaki socks and brown shoes. In winter the basic uniform consists of long charcoal pants, black socks and black shoes. Both the summer and winter uniforms are accompanied by the SACS navy-blue blazer, white school shirt and school tie. Both these uniforms can be worn at any time during the school year, except for certain formal school functions where a certain uniform is required.\n\nThe Junior School uniform consists of a white shirt, charcoal shorts, a SACS Junior belt, charcoal socks with thin light and dark blue stripes at the top, black shoes and the Junior School tie, which is similar to the High School tie, apart from one minor difference. The Junior School uniform includes the same blazer as the High School, with the exception of the Junior School not modifying blazers for Blues (colours) awards, as is practised by the high school.\n\n==Rhodes Scholarship==\nWhen [[Cecil John Rhodes]] died in 1902, he specifically named the South African College in his will as one of four schools in the [[Cape Colony]] where the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] would be awarded on an annual basis for a former student to study at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodestrust.org.za/about.html|title=Rhodes Scholarships in Southern Africa|date=3 January 2009|first=Tim|last=Nuttall}}</ref>\n\n==Old Boys' Union==\n===Old Boys===\n[[File:The leader and his deputy, jan smuts on the right and jan hofmeyr on the left.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and former Prime Minister of South Africa, [[Jan Smuts]]]]\n*Dr. [[Abdullah Abdurahman]] \u2013 Medical Doctor, Cape Muslim leader & founder of the anti-apartheid movement, African People's Organisation and human rights campaigner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/dr-abdullah-abdurahman|title=Dr. Abdullah Abdurahman|last=sahoboss|date=17 February 2011|website=South African History Online}}</ref>\n*Captain [[Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC and bar]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]]\n*[[Kyle Brown (rugby union)|Kyle Brown]] \u2013 [[South Africa national rugby sevens team|South Africa Sevens]] captain 2008\u2013present and [[Olympic Games]] medalist Rio 2016.\n*[[Abraham Fischer]] \u2013 Sole Prime Minister of the Orange River Colony in South Africa<ref>Clingman, Stephen (1998).

After the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] took over control of the [[Cape Colony]] the second colonial governor, [[Lord Charles Somerset|Lord Charles Henry Somerset]] {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]]}}, gave permission for the funds reserved by de Mist to be used to establish the South African College in 1814.\n\nThe founding committee met in the [[Groote Kerk, Cape Town|Groote Kerk]] to discuss funding and accommodation for the school and on 1 October 1829, the inauguration of the South African College was held and classes began. The original location of the school was in the ''Weeshuis'' on Long Street and moved to what is now known as the ''Egyptian Building'' in the Gardens district of Cape Town in 1841.\n\nIt was decided in 1874 that the younger students should be separated from their older counterparts. The South African College was separated into the ''College'' which became the [[University of Cape Town]] and the ''College School''.<ref>{{cite book|title=\tStandard encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, Volume 10|publisher=NASOU|year=1976|page=96}}</ref>\n\nThe College School moved to its own building on Orange Street, separate from the College, in 1896. For the next few decades, the school grew and the building became too small for the number of students attending.\n\nIn 1959 the school moved to its current home in the Montebello Estate in Newlands,<ref>{{cite book|title=Cape Town, city of good hope|last=Honikman|first=A. H.|publisher=H. B. Timmins|year=1966|page=63}}</ref> former home of the mining magnate [[Max Michaelis|Sir Max Michaelis]], after a decade-long negotiation with the Cape Administration.\n\nIn 2012, the school grounds were used to film Spud 2: The Madness Continues. \n\n{{Coord|33|58|13.45|S|18|27|36.38|E|display=title}}\n\n==School buildings==\nThe current school buildings are situated along Dean Street and Newlands Avenue in Cape Town.\n\nThe Junior School is located along Dean Street and is equipped with numerous fields for sporting activities, of which some are shared with the High School. The Junior School has a full length swimming pool with a smaller children's pool for the younger students. A number of [[tennis]] courts are also available to the students. The Junior School has a new Media Centre which hosts computer facilities, a new library and classrooms. The music department also has its own [[auditorium]] for cultural events and is also used for events with smaller audiences. The Junior School's [[boarding house]] is named after ''J E De Villiers''.\n\nThe High School is closest to Newlands Avenue which also hosts a number of sport fields for the various sports which the school offers throughout the year. The swimming pool is mainly used for [[Water Polo]] and is also heated to facilitate training and usage in winter. The High School also recently had a new Media Centre constructed with air-conditioned computer labs and library. The school hall is named after one of its most famous students, [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (1894-1948)|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr]]. The boarding houses for the High School are the ''Michaelis House'' (for the junior students) and ''Rosedale House'' (for the senior students).\n\n== High School Sport ==\nSACS offers a wide variety of summer and winter sports for boys to partake in during the year. Boys are made to partake in at least one main summer and winter sport and may also partake in other secondar sports, provided they are involved in a main sport first.\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*'''Main summer sports'''\n** [[Cricket]]\n** Swimming\n** [[Water polo|Waterpolo]]\n** [[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]\n** [[Tennis]]\n** [[Basketball]]\n** [[Sport of athletics|Athletics]]\n*'''Secondary summer sports'''\n** [[Sailing (sport)|Sailing]]\n**[[Road cycling]]\n*'''Main winter sports'''\n** [[Rugby union]]\n** [[Rugby union|Hocke]] [[Field hockey|y]]\n** [[Cross country running|Cross-country]]\n** [[Squash (sport)|Squash]]\n** [[Mountain biking]]\n*'''Secondary winter sports'''\n** [[Bodyboarding]]\n** [[Golf]]\n** [[Surfing]]\n** [[Shooting sport|Shooting]] (Currently Inactive)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== High school clubs and societies  ==\nCulture plays a large role in the SACS High School community. Many clubs, societies and bands are situated within the high school and are largely run and coordinated by the boys, with each club or society being supervised by a teacher. As of 2016, there were active clubs, societies and bands operating within SACS. These are the: \n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* History Society\n* Marimba Band\n* Debating Society\n* SACS Choir\n* SACS Big Band\n* SACS Junior Jazz Band\n* SACS Concert and Marching bands\n* SACS Clarinet Ensemble \n* SACS Flute Ensemble \n* SACS Brass Ensemble \n* SACS Saxophone Ensemble \n* Muslim Students' Association\n* Christian Union\n* Science Club\n* RCL\n* Interact Club\n* Photography Society\n* First Aid Society\n* Multimedia Society\n* Film Society\n* Chess Club\n* Waterpolo Table Officials\n* Afrikaans Society \n* Mountain Club\n* French Club\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Uniform==\nThe traditional school colour of navy blue was determined in the 1880s when SACS pupils purchased the only pattern available of alternating white, light- and dark-blue horizontal stripes from ''Porter Hodgson's Outfitters'' in Cape Town. Prior to this, the pupils wore what they could afford while still being presentable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.capeargus.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=342&fArticleId=2516444|title=School uniforms \u2013 what purpose do they serve?|date=11 May 2005|first=Fouzia|last=van der Fort}}</ref>\n\nToday the High School uniform consists of a summer and winter uniform. During summer, boys wear khaki shorts with long khaki socks and brown shoes. In winter the basic uniform consists of long charcoal pants, black socks and black shoes. Both the summer and winter uniforms are accompanied by the SACS navy-blue blazer, white school shirt and school tie. Both these uniforms can be worn at any time during the school year, except for certain formal school functions where a certain uniform is required.\n\nThe Junior School uniform consists of a white shirt, charcoal shorts, a SACS Junior belt, charcoal socks with thin light and dark blue stripes at the top, black shoes and the Junior School tie, which is similar to the High School tie, apart from one minor difference. The Junior School uniform includes the same blazer as the High School, with the exception of the Junior School not modifying blazers for Blues (colours) awards, as is practised by the high school.\n\n==Rhodes Scholarship==\nWhen [[Cecil John Rhodes]] died in 1902, he specifically named the South African College in his will as one of four schools in the [[Cape Colony]] where the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] would be awarded on an annual basis for a former student to study at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodestrust.org.za/about.html|title=Rhodes Scholarships in Southern Africa|date=3 January 2009|first=Tim|last=Nuttall}}</ref>\n\n==Old Boys' Union==\n===Old Boys===\n[[File:The leader and his deputy, jan smuts on the right and jan hofmeyr on the left.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and former Prime Minister of South Africa, [[Jan Smuts]]]]\n*Dr. [[Abdullah Abdurahman]] \u2013 Medical Doctor, Cape Muslim leader & founder of the anti-apartheid movement, African People's Organisation and human rights campaigner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/dr-abdullah-abdurahman|title=Dr. Abdullah Abdurahman|last=sahoboss|date=17 February 2011|website=South African History Online}}</ref>\n*Captain [[Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC and bar]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]]\n*[[Kyle Brown (rugby union)|Kyle Brown]] \u2013 [[South Africa national rugby sevens team|South Africa Sevens]] captain 2008\u2013present and [[Olympic Games]] medalist Rio 2016.\n*[[Abraham Fischer]] \u2013 Sole Prime Minister of the Orange River Colony in South Africa<ref>Clingman, Stephen (1998).

The name is an abbreviation for ''Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States.''\n\nThe tool serves in the field of [[metagenomic]] analysis where it allows inference of the functional profile of a [[microbial]]\ncommunity based on [[marker gene]] survey along one or more samples. In essence, PICRUSt takes a user supplied [[operational taxonomic unit]] table (typically referred to as an OTU table), representing the marker gene sequences (most commonly a [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[Cluster analysis|cluster]]) accompanied with its relative abundance in each of the samples. The output of PICRUSt is a sample by functional-gene-count matrix, telling the count of each functional-gene in each of the samples surveyed. The ability of PICRUSt to estimate the functional-gene profile for a given sample relies on a set of known sequenced [[genomes]].  This could also be thought of as an automated alternative to manually researching the gene families likely to be present in organisms whose sequences are found in a [[16S ribosomal RNA]] [[amplicon library]]. The below description corresponds to the original version of PICRUSt, but a major update to this tool is currently being developed<ref name=\"Douglas et al., 2020\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/672295 | title=PICRUSt2: An improved and customizable approach for metagenome inference | journal=bioRxiv | year=2020 | last1=Douglas | first1=Gavin | last2=Maffei | first2=Vince | last3=Zaneveld | first3=Jesse | last4=Yurgel | first4=Svetlana | last5=Brown | first5=James | last6=Taylor | first6=Christopher | last7=Huttenhower | first7=Curtis | last8=Langille | first8=Morgan}}</ref>.\n\n==Genome prediction algorithm==\n\nIn an initial preprocessing phase, PICRUSt constructs [[confidence intervals]] and point predictions for the number of copies of each gene family in each bacterial and archaeal strain in a reference tree, using organisms with sequenced genomes as a reference. More specifically, for each gene family, PICRUSt maps known gene copy numbers (from complete sequenced genomes) onto a reference tree of life.  These gene family [[copy numbers]] are treated as [[continuous traits]], and an [[evolutionary model]] constructed under the assumption of [[Brownian Motion]]. These evolutionary models can be constructed with either [[Maximum Likelihood]], [[Relaxed Maximum Likelihood]] or [[Wagner Parsimony]]  This evolutionary model is then used to predict both a point estimate and a confidence interval for the copy number of microorganisms without sequenced genomes.  This 'genome prediction' step produces a large table of bacterial types (specifically [[operational taxonomic unit]] or OTUs) vs. gene family copy numbers. This table is distributed to end users. It is important to note that this prediction method is not the same as a nearest neighbor approach (i.e. just looking up the nearest sequenced genome), and was shown to give a small but significant improvement in accuracy over that strategy.  However, [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]] prediction is available as an option in PICRUSt.\n\nNotably, while this functionality is typically used for prediction of gene copy numbers in bacteria, it could, in principle, be used for prediction of any other [[continuous trait]] given trait data for diverse organisms and a reference [[phylogeny]].\n\nLangille et al<ref name=\"LangilleZaneveld2013\" /> tested the accuracy of this genome prediction step using leave-one-out cross validation on the input set of sequenced genomes.  Additional tests examined sensitivity to errors in [[phylogenetic inference]], [[lack of genomic data]], and the accuracy of the [[confidence intervals]] on gene content.\n\nA similar step predicts the copy number of [[16S rRNA]] genes.\n\n==Metagenome prediction algorithm==\n\nWhen applying PICRUSt to a [[16S rRNA]] gene library, PICRUSt matches reference [[operational taxonomic unit]]s against the tables, and retrieves a predicted 16S rRNA copy number and gene copy number for each gene family.  The abundance of each OTU is divided by its predicted copy number (if a bacterium has multiple 16S copies, its apparent abundance in 16S rRNA data will be inflated), and then multiplied by the copy number of the gene family.  This gives a prediction for the contribution of each OTU to the overall gene content of the sample (the [[metagenome]]). Finally, these individual contributions are summed together to produce an estimate of the genes present in the [[metagenome]].\n\nLangille et al., 2013<ref name=\"LangilleZaneveld2013\" /> tested the accuracy of this genome prediction step by using previously reported datasets in which the same biological sample was subjected to [[16S rRNA gene]] amplification and [[shotgun metagenomics]].  In these cases, the shotgun metagenomic results were taken as a representation of the 'true' community, and the 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries fed into PICRUSt to attempt to predict those data. Test datasets included [[human microbiome]] samples from the [[Human Microbiome Project]], soil samples, diverse mammalian samples, and samples from the [[Guerrero Negro]] [[microbial mats]]\n\n==The Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index==\n\nBecause PICRUSt, and [[evolutionary comparative genomics]] in general, depends on sequenced genomes, biological samples from well-studied environments (many sequenced genomes) will be better predicted than poorly studied environments.  In order to assess how many genomes are available, PICRUSt optionally allows users to calculate a Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index (NSTI) for their samples.  This index reflects the average [[phylogenetic distance]] between each [[16S rRNA]] gene sequence in their sample, and a [[16S rRNA]] gene sequence from a fully [[sequenced genome]]. In general, the lower the NSTI score, the more accurate PICRUSt's predictions are expected to be. For example,<ref name=\"LangilleZaneveld2013\" /> showed that PICRUSt was much more accurate on diverse soil samples and samples from the [[Human Microbiome Project]] than on microbial mat samples from  [[Guerrero Negro]], which contained many bacteria without any sequenced relatives.\n\n==Related tools==\n\nOkuda et al., 2012<ref name=\"Okuda et al 2012\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms2203 |title=Okuda et al., 2012 | volume=3 | journal=Nature Communications |page=1203|year=2012 |last1=Okuda |first1=Shujiro |last2=Tsuchiya |first2=Yuki |last3=Kiriyama |first3=Chiho |last4=Itoh |first4=Masumi |last5=Morisaki |first5=Hisao |doi-access=free }}</ref> published a similar method that used a bounded k-Nearest Neighbor approach to predict virtual metagenomes.

The name is an abbreviation for ''Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States.''\n\nThe tool serves in the field of [[metagenomic]] analysis where it allows inference of the functional profile of a [[microbial]]\ncommunity based on [[marker gene]] survey along one or more samples. In essence, PICRUSt takes a user supplied [[operational taxonomic unit]] table (typically referred to as an OTU table), representing the marker gene sequences (most commonly a [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[Cluster analysis|cluster]]) accompanied with its relative abundance in each of the samples. The output of PICRUSt is a sample by functional-gene-count matrix, telling the count of each functional-gene in each of the samples surveyed. The ability of PICRUSt to estimate the functional-gene profile for a given sample relies on a set of known sequenced [[genomes]].  This could also be thought of as an automated alternative to manually researching the gene families likely to be present in organisms whose sequences are found in a [[16S ribosomal RNA]] [[amplicon library]]. The below description corresponds to the original version of PICRUSt, but a major update to this tool is currently being developed<ref name=\"Douglas et al., 2020\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/672295 | title=PICRUSt2: An improved and customizable approach for metagenome inference | journal=bioRxiv | year=2020 | last1=Douglas | first1=Gavin | last2=Maffei | first2=Vince | last3=Zaneveld | first3=Jesse | last4=Yurgel | first4=Svetlana | last5=Brown | first5=James | last6=Taylor | first6=Christopher | last7=Huttenhower | first7=Curtis | last8=Langille | first8=Morgan}}</ref>.\n\n==Genome prediction algorithm==\n\nIn an initial preprocessing phase, PICRUSt constructs [[confidence intervals]] and point predictions for the number of copies of each gene family in each bacterial and archaeal strain in a reference tree, using organisms with sequenced genomes as a reference. More specifically, for each gene family, PICRUSt maps known gene copy numbers (from complete sequenced genomes) onto a reference tree of life.  These gene family [[copy numbers]] are treated as [[continuous traits]], and an [[evolutionary model]] constructed under the assumption of [[Brownian Motion]]. These evolutionary models can be constructed with either [[Maximum Likelihood]], [[Relaxed Maximum Likelihood]] or [[Wagner Parsimony]]  This evolutionary model is then used to predict both a point estimate and a confidence interval for the copy number of microorganisms without sequenced genomes.  This 'genome prediction' step produces a large table of bacterial types (specifically [[operational taxonomic unit]] or OTUs) vs. gene family copy numbers. This table is distributed to end users.

Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.\n\nCloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps<ref>{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author=Peter J. Russel |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/igeneticsmolecul0000russ }}</ref>\n# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA\n# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence\n# [[transfection]] \u2013 inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells\n# screening/selection \u2013 selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA\n\nAlthough these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected; these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.\n\nInitially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].\n\n== Cell cloning{{Anchor|Cellular cloning}}==\n\n===Cloning unicellular organisms===\n[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]\nCloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.\n\nA useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).<ref name=\"CloningRings\">{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63\u201366|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}</ref> In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.\n\n=== Cloning stem cells ===\n{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}\n[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], popularly known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called \"research cloning\" or \"therapeutic cloning\". The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called \"reproductive cloning\"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\nTherapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's.

This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.<ref name=\"Latham\">{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K.

The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.<ref name=Latham /> The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.<ref name=Latham /> This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.<ref name=Latham /> This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.<ref name=Latham />\n\nSCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.<ref name=Latham /> However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64\u20136 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |bibcode=1996Natur.380...64C }}</ref> As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive.

Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects.

This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.<ref name=HumanGenomeInfo>{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}</ref> If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.\n\nArtificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=2018-01-26}}</ref>\n\nTwo commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]].

Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.\n\nCloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps<ref>{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author=Peter J. Russel |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/igeneticsmolecul0000russ }}</ref>\n# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA\n# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence\n# [[transfection]] \u2013 inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells\n# screening/selection \u2013 selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA\n\nAlthough these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected; these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.\n\nInitially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].\n\n== Cell cloning{{Anchor|Cellular cloning}}==\n\n===Cloning unicellular organisms===\n[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]\nCloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.\n\nA useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).<ref name=\"CloningRings\">{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63\u201366|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}</ref> In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.\n\n=== Cloning stem cells ===\n{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}\n[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], popularly known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called \"research cloning\" or \"therapeutic cloning\". The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called \"reproductive cloning\"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\nTherapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.<ref name=\"Halim\">{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=31 October 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}</ref> In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient.<ref name=Halim /> The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.<ref name=\"Plus\">{{cite web |last=Plus |first=M. |year=2011 |title= Fetal development |accessdate=31 October 2011 |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov }}</ref>\n\nThe reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.<ref name=\"Latham\">{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K.

The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.<ref name=Latham /> The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.<ref name=Latham /> This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.<ref name=Latham /> This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.<ref name=Latham />\n\nSCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.<ref name=Latham /> However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64\u20136 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |bibcode=1996Natur.380...64C }}</ref> As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive.

The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.\n\n== Organism cloning ==\n{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}\n'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.\n\n=== Horticultural ===\n[[File:Vine shoots.JPG|thumb|Propagating plants from [[cuttings (plants)|cuttings]], such as grape vines, is an ancient form of cloning]]\n{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}\nThe term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]].

Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.\n\nArtificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]].

The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=2018-01-26}}</ref>\n\nTwo commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]].

While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well.

{"title_page": "Statue of Marduk", "text_new": "[[File:Marduk_and_pet.jpg|thumb|The Statue of Marduk depicted as being mounted on [[Marduk]]'s dragon [[Mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u]] and standing victorious in the primordial water of [[Tiamat]]. From a [[cylinder seal]] of the 9th century BC Babylonian king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]].{{Sfn|Schaudig|2008|p=559}}]]The '''Statue of [[Marduk]]''', also known as the '''Statue of [[Bel (mythology)|B\u00eal]]{{Sfn|Cole|Machinist|1998|p=11\u201313}}''' (''B\u00eal'', meaning \"lord\", being a common designation for Marduk), was the physical representation of the god Marduk, the patron deity of the ancient city of [[Babylon]], traditionally housed in the city's main temple, the [[Esagila]]. There were seven statues of Marduk in Babylon, but ''the'' Statue of Marduk generally refers to the god's main statue, placed prominently in the Esagila and used in the city's rituals. This statue was nicknamed the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' and was made of a type of wood called ''m\u0113su'' and covered with gold and silver.\n\nSimilar to statues of deities in other cities in Mesopotamia, the Babylonians conflated this statue with their actual god, believing that Marduk himself resided in their city through the statue. As such, the statue held enormous religious significance. It was used during the Babylonian [[Akitu|New Year's festival]] and the [[kings of Babylon]] incorporated it into their coronation rituals, receiving the crown \"from the hands\" of Marduk.\n\nBecause of the enormous significance of the statue, it was sometimes used as a means of [[psychological warfare]] by Babylon's enemies. Enemy powers such as the [[Hittites]], the [[Assyria]]ns and the [[Elamites]] stole the statue during sacks of the city, which caused religious and political turmoil, as Babylon's traditional rituals could then not be completed. Coincidentally, all the major foreign kings known to have stolen the statue ended up later being killed by their own family members, something the Babylonians hailed as divine punishment. Returns of the statue, either through the enemies giving it back or through a Babylonian king campaigning and successfully retrieving it, were occasions for great celebrations.\n\nThe final references to the statue being in Babylon are from the period of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian]] rule over the city, and its final fate is uncertain. The statue might have been removed and possibly destroyed by the Achaemenid king [[Xerxes I]] after a revolt in 482\u2013481 BC, but historical sources used for this assumption could be referring to a completely different statue. References to the statue from as late as the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian period]] shows a continued knowledge of its role and significance, though it is unknown if the statue still existed at that point.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Marduk}}\n[[File:Tiamat.JPG|left|thumb|8th century BC [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] [[cylinder seal]]. What exactly the seal depicts is disputed but several sources identify it as a depiction of [[Marduk]] (center) slaying [[Tiamat]] (personified as a great snake).{{Sfn|Willis|2012|p=62}}{{Sfn|Bromily|1988|p=93}}]]\n[[Marduk]] was the patron deity of the city [[Babylon]], having held this position since the reign of [[Hammurabi]] (18th century BC) in [[First Babylonian dynasty|Babylon's first dynasty]]. Although Babylonian worship of Marduk never meant the denial of the existence of the other gods in the [[Mesopotamian pantheon]], it has sometimes been compared to [[monotheism]].{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} The history of worship of Marduk is intimately tied to the history of Babylon itself and as Babylon's power increased, so did the position of Marduk relative to that of other Mesopotamian gods. By the end of the second millennium BC, Marduk was sometimes just referred to as ''B\u00eal'', meaning \"lord\".{{Sfn|Leick|2009|p=348}}\n\nIn [[Mesopotamian mythology]], Marduk was a [[Creator deity|creator god]]. Going by the ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'', the Babylonian creation myth, Marduk was the son of [[Enki]], the Mesopotamian god of wisdom, and rose to prominence during a great battle between the gods. The myth tells how the universe originated as a chaotic realm of water in which there originally were two primordial deities, [[Tiamat]] (salt water, female) and [[Abzu]] (sweet water, male). These two gods gave birth to other deities. These deities (including gods such as Enki) had little to do in these early stages of existence and as such occupied themselves with various activities.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\nEventually, their children began to annoy the elder gods and Abzu decided to rid himself of them by killing them. Alarmed by this, Tiamat revealed Abzu's plan to Enki, who killed his father before the plot could be enacted. Although Tiamat had revealed the plot to Enki to warn him, the death of Abzu horrified her and she too attempted to kill her children, raising an army together with her new consort [[Kingu]]. Every battle in the war was a victory for Tiamat, until Marduk convinced the other gods to proclaim him as their leader and king. The gods agreed, and Marduk was victorious, capturing and executing Kingu and firing a great arrow at Tiamat, killing her and splitting her in two.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\nWith these chaotic primordial forces defeated, Marduk created the world and ordered the heavens. Marduk is also described as the creator of human beings, which were meant to help the gods in defeating and holding off the forces of chaos and thus maintain order on Earth.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\n== Appearance and other statues ==\nThe Statue of Marduk was the physical representation of Marduk housed in Babylon's main temple, the [[Esagila]].{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Although there were actually seven separate statues of Marduk in Babylon: four in the Esagila and the surrounding temple complex; one in the [[Etemenanki]] (the [[ziggurat]] dedicated to Marduk); and two in temples dedicated to other deities. 'The' statue of Marduk usually refers to Marduk's primary statue, placed prominently in the Esagila and used in the city's rituals.{{Sfn|Dalley|1997|p=163}}\n\nThis principal statue of Marduk was nicknamed the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' and made of a type of wood called ''m\u0113su''.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}} The carved wooden statue would also have been covered in precious metals, such as gold and silver.{{Sfn|Schaudig|2008|p=561}} In addition to this, the statue would have been provided with ritual clothing, at least partly made of gold.{{Sfn|Oppenheim|1949|p=172}} This statue would have occupied the cult room of Marduk in the Esagila, called the ''E-umu\u0161a''. Among the various statues of Marduk, the one called the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' is the only one explicitly mentioned in connection with the city's major rituals (though the statue is rarely named, often being referred to just as \"Marduk\" or \"''B\u00eal''\").{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}} The name ''Asull\u1e2bi'' had centuries prior been associated with [[Asaruludu|a separate deity]] of incantations later conflated with Marduk.{{Sfn|Brisch|2016}}\n\nAnother statue of Marduk, called the ''Asarre'', was made from a stone the Babylonians called ''mar\u1e2bu\u0161u'', possibly [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] or [[steatite]].{{Sfn|George|1997|p=65}}{{Sfn|Steinkeller|2012|p=263}} The ''Asarre'' was located in a chapel dedicated to the god [[Ninurta]] off the north side of the Esagila's central courtyard.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=65}} Though this chapel would have been dedicated to Ninurta, the Marduk statue would have occupied the central point of attention and thus have been the main figure.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}} This might be explained through the god Ninurta becoming seen as simply an aspect of Marduk\u2014an ancient visitor to the temple may not have been surprised to find Marduk in the stead of Ninurta.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=67}} Other statues included one made of a type of wood called ''taskarinnu'' and placed in a chamber dedicated to the Enki (Marduk's father) in the E-kar-zaginna temple, part of the Esagila temple complex but not of the temple itself; an [[alabaster]] statue in the \"temple of E-namtila\"; a statue of [[hematite]] in the \"chapel of Ninurta in the temple E-\u1e2bursag-tilla\"; and a statue of unknown material in \"E-gi\u0161\u1e2bur-ankia, the temple of B\u0113let-Ninua\".{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}}\n\n== Role and importance ==\n[[File:Colossal statue of the god Nabu, 8th century BCE, from Nimrud, Iraq Museum.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a colossal stone statue of the god [[Nabu]] (the son of Marduk) recovered from the city [[Kalhu]], an example of a surviving ancient Mesopotamian statue of a deity. Exhibited at the [[Iraq Museum]].|alt=]]\nThe Babylonians themselves conflated the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' with the actual god Marduk\u2014the god was understood as living in the temple, among the people of his city, and not in the heavens. As such, Marduk was not seen as some distant entity, but a friend and protector who lived nearby. This was no different from other Mesopotamian cities, who similarly conflated their gods with the representations used for them in their temples. During the religiously important 13-day long [[Akitu|New Year's festival]] held annually in the spring at Babylon, the statue was removed from the temple and paraded through Babylon before being placed in a smaller building outside the city walls, where the statue received fresh air and could enjoy a different view from the one it had from inside the temple.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} The statue was traditionally incorporated into the coronation rituals for the [[Babylonian kings]], who received the Babylonian crown \"out of the hands\" of Marduk during the New Year's festival, symbolizing them being bestowed with kingship by the patron deity of the city.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1989|p=|pp=185\u2013186}}''''' The rule of the Babylonian king and his role as Marduk's vassal on Earth was also reaffirmed annually during the New Year's festival, when the king entered the Esagila alone on the fifth day and met with the chief priest. During the ensuing ritual, the chief priest removed the royal regalia from the king, slapped him across the face and made him kneel before Marduk's statue. The king then told the statue that he had not oppressed his people and that he had maintained order throughout the year, whereafter the chief priest replied (on behalf of Marduk) that the king would continue to enjoy divine support for his rule and the regalia were returned.'''''{{Sfn|Laing|Frost|p=|2017}}''''' The standard full \"negative confession\" of the king was the following:\n\n{{quote|quote=[I have not] sinned, lord of the lands, I have not neglected your divinity,<br>[I have not] ruined Babylon, I have not ordered its dissolution,<br>[I have not] made the Esagila tremble, I have not forgotten its rites,<br>[I have not] struck the cheek of any privileged subject, I have [not] brought about their humiliation,<br>[I have been taking ca]re of Babylon, I have not destroyed its outer walls!{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=51}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nBecause the significance the statue held to the city, enemies of Babylon often used the statue as a means of [[psychological warfare]]. When foreign powers conquered or plundered Babylon, the statue was often stolen from the city (a common way of weakening the power of defeated cities in ancient Mesopotamia). Such events caused great distress for the Babylonians, as the removal of the statue signified the actual departure of the real deity, their friend and protector. If the statue was absent, the New Year's festival could not be celebrated and made other religious activities and rituals difficult to perform.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} The Babylonians believed that the statue's departures from the city were somewhat self-imposed, with the statue itself deciding to make the journey and foreign theft of it simply being a means to achieve that.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=30}} Though the statue's absence from Babylon meant confusion and hardship, the Babylonians believed that foreign lands benefited from having the statue and that it brought prosperity wherever it went.{{Sfn|Clifford|2003|p=11}} The practice of taking the cult statues from enemies was viewed as capturing the enemy's source of divine power and suppressing that power.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=30}}\n\nStatues of deities were sometimes destroyed by enemy powers, as was once the case for the statue of the sun god [[Shamash]] in that deity's patron city, [[Sippar]]. The statue of Shamash was destroyed by the [[Suteans]] during the reign of Babylonian king [[Simbar-shipak]] ({{Circa|}} 1026\u20131009 BC).{{Sfn|Dick|1999|p=58}} As the statues held enormous religious significance, the statue of Shamash could not be replaced until almost two centuries later, under King [[Nabu-apla-iddina]] ({{Circa|}} 887\u2013855 BC) when a replica of the original was \"divinely revealed\" and the king ordered the new statue to be ritually dedicated. In the meantime, Sippar had prayed to its god using a sun-disc as a substitute for the statue.{{Sfn|Dick|1999|p=60}} Though they were conflated into one, gods in Mesopotamia were believed to be able to \"abandon\" their statues. In an 8th-century BC religious text, the poor state of Marduk's statue inspires the god [[Erra (god)|Erra]] to suggest that Marduk depart from the statue and that Erra could rule in his stead until the Babylonians had finished restoring the statue.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=30}} Gods could exist in heaven and on Earth simultaneously, and their presence on Earth could be in multiple places at the same time: for instance the Shamash and the goddess [[Ishtar]] (a goddess of sex, war, justice and political power associated with the planet [[Venus]]) were manifested in cult images in many different cities and were also still seen as being present in their respective heavenly bodies.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=31}} As such, though statues and other cult images could be harmed, this did not mean that actual damage was being done to the gods themselves.{{Sfn|Schaudig|2008|p=562}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Journeys of Marduk ===\n{{Sidebar timeline|title={{center|Journeys of Marduk}}|members5=Sippar is sacked by [[Elamites|Elamite]] king [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], the statue is carried to [[Elam]].|years9=484\u2013481 BC|members8=The statue is returned to the city with [[Shamash-shum-ukin]]'s coronation as King of Babylon.|years8=668 BC|members7=[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] king [[Sennacherib]] sacks Babylon, the statue is carried to [[Issete]] in [[Assyria]].|years7=689 BC|members6=[[Nebuchadnezzar I]] rules as King of Babylon, he defeats the Elamites and returns the statue to the city.|years6=1125\u20131104 BC|years5={{circa}}1150 BC|years1={{circa}}1595 BC|members4=The statue returns to Babylon and is later moved to [[Sippar]].|years4=?|members3=Babylon is sacked by Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]], the statue is carried to [[Assur]].|years3=1225 BC|members2=The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[\u0160uppiluliuma I]] possibly returns the statue as a gesture of goodwill.|years2={{circa}}1344 BC|members1=The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili I]] sacks Babylon, the statue is carried to [[Hattusa]].|members9=Babylon revolts against [[Achaemenid]] king [[Xerxes I]] and is harshly reprimanded.

What exactly happened thereafter is unclear, but the statue returned to Babylon at some point and was later, for unknown reasons, moved to the nearby city [[Sippar]]. Sippar was sacked {{Circa|}}1150 BC by the [[Elamites]] under their king, [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], who stole the statue, carrying it to his homeland [[Elam]]. The statue was successfully seized and returned to Babylon after the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] ({{Reign}}{{Circa|}}1125\u20131104 BC) campaigned against the Elamites.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}{{Sfn|Leick|2009|p=349}} Nebuchadnezzar's successful return of the statue to the city was a monumentous event and several literary works were created to commemorate it, possibly including an early version of the ''En\u00fbma Eli\u0161''.{{Sfn|Leick|2009|p=351}}\n\nThe [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] conquered Babylon under their king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] in October 729 BC, with its monarchs proclaiming themselves as kings of Babylon in addition to already being [[kings of Assyria]].'''{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1926|p=282}}''' As vengeance after a series of revolts, the Neo-Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] plundered and destroyed Babylon in 689 BC. Sennacherib had been seen as somewhat heretical by the Babylonians, as he hadn't gone through with the traditional coronation ritual (with the statue) when he had proclaimed himself as Babylon's king.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Following the destruction of the city, Sennacherib stole the statue and it was kept at the town of [[Issete]] in the northeastern parts of Assyria.'''{{Sfn|Cole|Machinist|1998|p=11\u201313}}''' When Sennacherib was murdered by his sons [[Arda-Mulissu]] and [[Sharezer]] in 681 BC, the Babylonians saw it as Marduk's divine retribution.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Sennacherib's successor as Assyrian king, [[Esarhaddon]], rebuilt Babylon in the 670s BC, restoring the Esagila. Under Esarhaddon's guidance, a pedestal in gold (meant to be the place of the statue) was created in the Esagila.'''{{Sfn|Cole|Machinist|1998|p=11\u201313}}''' The statue was finally returned to the city during the coronation of Esarhaddon's successor as Babylonian king, [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], in the spring of 668 BC.'''{{Sfn|Johns|1913|p=124}}''' It is possible that Sennacherib actually destroyed the original statue and the statue returned to Babylon in 668 BC was a replica; some of Sennacherib's inscriptions allude to smashing the statues of the gods in Babylon while others explicitly state that the Marduk statue was carried to Assyria.{{Sfn|Dick|1999|p=63}}\n\nAssyrian control of Babylon was ended with the successful revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC, which established the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]].{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}} Nabopolassar's son and heir, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] ({{Reign}}605\u2013562 BC) widened the streets of Babylon so that the parade of the statue through the city at the New Year's festival would be made easier. The Neo-Babylonian Empire was ended with the conquest of Babylon by [[Cyrus the Great]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 539 BC. Cyrus showed respect for the city and the statue and his own inscriptions surrounding his conquest of the city explicitly state that Marduk was on his side in the war.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\nThough the statue was often used as a means of physological warfare by removing it from the city, powerful foreign rulers who did so had a tendency to end up dead at the hands of their own family members. Mursili I, Shutruk-Nakhunte, Tukulti-Ninurta I, Sennacherib and the later [[Xerxes I]] all ended up killed by members of their own families.'''{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=95}}''' Such deaths, as can be seen in the Babylonian reaction to Sennacherib's murder in particular, were hailed by the Babylonians as divine punishment.'''{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}}'''\n\n=== Fate ===\nDuring the reign of the Achaemenid king Xerxes I, Babylon revolted at least twice against Persian rule. The first revolt broke out in June or July of 484 BC and was led by a rebel of the name [[Bel-shimanni]]. Bel-shimmani's revolt was short-lived, Babylonian documents written during his reign only account for a period of two weeks. Two years later, Babylon produced another rebel leader, [[Shamash-eriba]]. Beginning in the summer of 482 BC, Shamash-eriba seized Babylon itself and other nearby cities, such as [[Borsippa]] and [[Dilbat]], and was only defeated in March 481 BC after a lengthy siege of Babylon.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' Prior to these revolts, Babylon had occupied a special position within the Achaemenid Empire, the Achaemenid kings had been titled as ''King of Babylon and King of the Lands'', perceiving Babylonia as a somewhat separate entity within their empire, united with their own kingdom in a [[personal union]]. Xerxes dropped ''King of Babylon'' from his titulature and divided the previously large Babylonian satrapy (accounting for most of the Neo-Babylonian Empire's territory) into smaller sub-units.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1989|p=|pp=185\u2013186}}'''''\n\nUsing texts written by classical authors, it is often assumed that Xerxes enacted a brutal vengeance on Babylon following the two revolts. According to ancient writers, Xerxes destroyed Babylon's fortifications and damaged the temples in the city.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' The Esagila was allegedly exposed to great damage and Xerxes allegedly carried the statue of Marduk away from the city,'''''{{Sfn|Sancisi-Weerdenburg|2002|p=579}}''''' possibly bringing it to Iran and melting it down (classical authors held that the statue was entirely made of gold, which would have made melting it down possible).'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' Historian [[Am\u00e9lie Kuhrt]] considers it unlikely that Xerxes destroyed the temples, but believes that the story of him doing so may derive from an anti-Persian sentiment among the Babylonians.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=39}}''''' The story of Xerxes melting the statue comes chiefly from the ancient Greek writer [[Herodotus]], who isn't otherwise considered entirely reliable and has been noted as being very anti-Persian. His account of the statue's destruction might be anti-Persian propaganda.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Furthermore, it is doubtful if the statue was removed from Babylon at all'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' and some have even suggested that Xerxes did remove a statue from the city, but that this was the golden statue of a man rather than the statue of the god Marduk.'''''{{Sfn|Waerzeggers|Seire|2018|p=3}}{{Sfn|Briant|2002|p=544}}''''' Though mentions of it are lacking considerably compared to earlier periods, contemporary documents suggest that the Babylonian New Year's Festival continued in some form during the Persian period.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=40}}''''' Because the change in rulership from the Babylonians themselves to the Persians and due to the replacement of the city's elite families by Xerxes following its revolt, it is possible that the festival's traditional rituals and events had changed considerably.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=41}}'''''\n\nAlthough contemporary evidence for Xerxes's retribution against Babylon is missing,'''''{{Sfn|Waerzeggers|2004|p=150}}''''' that there was damage done by him to temples in the city is mentioned by later authors as well. For instance, both the Roman historian [[Arrian]] and the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] describe how [[Alexander the Great]] restored some temples in the city which had been destroyed or damaged by Xerxes.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' No mention of the statue is made by these authors, possibly indicating that it was no longer in the Esagila by Alexander's time.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Although there are later references to rulers giving gifts to Marduk in the Esagila, such as the [[Characene]]an ruler [[Hyspaosines]] in 127 BC, it is unclear if these refer to the statue.'''''{{Sfn|Spek|2001|p=|pp=452\u2013453}}''''' There are no known sources that mention the New Year's Festival as a contemporary event from the time of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and onwards.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=59}}''''' Though it might no longer have existed, the statue was a known historical object as late as the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian period]], from which a ritual text describes its role in the New Year's festival, including how the ''En\u00fbma Eli\u0161'' was recited in front of it and how the ancient kings of Babylon were supposed to be ritually slapped during the festival.{{Sfn|Brisch|2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Lost history]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n* {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&dq=%22golden+statue%22+marduk|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|last=Briant|first=Pierre|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2002|isbn=978-1575060316|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFBriant2002}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Brinkman|first=J.

From a [[cylinder seal]] of the 9th century BC Babylonian king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]].{{Sfn|Schaudig|2008|p=559}}]]The '''Statue of [[Marduk]]''', also known as the '''Statue of [[Bel (mythology)|B\u00eal]]{{Sfn|Cole|Machinist|1998|p=11\u201313}}''' (''B\u00eal'', meaning \"lord\", being a common designation for Marduk), was the physical representation of the god Marduk, the patron deity of the ancient city of [[Babylon]], traditionally housed in the city's main temple, the [[Esagila]]. There were seven statues of Marduk in Babylon, but ''the'' Statue of Marduk generally refers to the god's main statue, placed prominently in the Esagila and used in the city's rituals. This statue was nicknamed the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' and was made of a type of wood called ''m\u0113su'' and covered with gold and silver.\n\nSimilar to statues of deities in other cities in Mesopotamia, the Babylonians conflated this statue with their actual god, believing that Marduk himself resided in their city through the statue. As such, the statue held enormous religious significance. It was used during the Babylonian [[Akitu|New Year's festival]] and the [[kings of Babylon]] incorporated it into their coronation rituals, receiving the crown \"from the hands\" of Marduk.\n\nBecause of the enormous significance of the statue, it was sometimes used as a means of [[psychological warfare]] by Babylon's enemies. Enemy powers such as the [[Hittites]], the [[Assyria]]ns and the [[Elamites]] stole the statue during sacks of the city, which caused religious and political turmoil as Babylon's traditional rituals could then not be completed. Coincidentally, all the major foreign kings known to have stolen the statue ended up later being killed by their own family members, something the Babylonians hailed as divine punishment. Returns of the statue, either through the enemies giving it back or through a Babylonian king campaigning and successfully retrieving it, were occasions for great celebrations.\n\nThe final references to the statue being in Babylon are from the period of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian]] rule over the city and its final fate is uncertain. The statue might have been removed and possibly destroyed by the Achaemenid king [[Xerxes I]] after a revolt in 482\u2013481 BC, but historical sources used for this assumption could be referring to a completely different statue. References to the statue from as late as the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian period]] shows a continued knowledge of its role and significance, though it is unknown if the statue still existed at that point.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|Marduk}}\n[[File:Tiamat.JPG|left|thumb|8th century BC [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] [[cylinder seal]]. What exactly the seal depicts is disputed but several sources identify it as a depiction of [[Marduk]] (center) slaying [[Tiamat]] (personified as a great snake).{{Sfn|Willis|2012|p=62}}{{Sfn|Bromily|1988|p=93}}]]\n[[Marduk]] was the patron deity of the city [[Babylon]], having held this position since the reign of [[Hammurabi]] (18th century BC) in [[First Babylonian dynasty|Babylon's first dynasty]]. Although Babylonian worship of Marduk never meant the denial of the existence of the other gods in the [[Mesopotamian pantheon]], it has sometimes been compared to [[monotheism]].{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} The history of worship of Marduk is intimately tied to the history of Babylon itself and as Babylon's power increased, so did the position of Marduk relative to that of other Mesopotamian gods. By the end of the second millennium BC, Marduk was sometimes just referred to as ''B\u00eal'', meaning \"lord\".{{Sfn|Leick|2009|p=348}}\n\nIn [[Mesopotamian mythology]], Marduk was a [[Creator deity|creator god]]. Going by the ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'', the Babylonian creation myth, Marduk was the son of [[Enki]], the Mesopotamian god of wisdom, and rose to prominence during a great battle between the gods. The myth tells how the universe originated as a chaotic realm of water, in which there originally were two primordial deities; [[Tiamat]] (salt water, female) and [[Abzu]] (sweet water, male). These two gods gave birth to other deities. These deities (including gods such as Enki) had little to do in these early stages of existence and as such occupied themselves with various activities.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\nEventually, their children began to annoy the elder gods and Abzu decided to rid himself of them by killing them. Alarmed by this, Tiamat revealed Abzu's plan to Enki, who killed his father before the plot could be enacted. Although Tiamat had revealed the plot to Enki to warn him, the death of Abzu horrified her and she too attempted to kill her children, raising an army together with her new consort [[Kingu]]. Every battle in the war was a victory for Tiamat until Marduk convinced the other gods to proclaim him as their leader and king. The gods agreed, and Marduk was victorious, capturing and executing Kingu and firing a great arrow at Tiamat, killing her and splitting her in two.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\nWith these chaotic primordial forces defeated, Marduk created the world and ordered the heavens. Marduk is also described as the creator of human beings, which were meant to help the gods in defeating and holding off the forces of chaos and thus maintain order on Earth.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\n== Appearance and other statues ==\nThe Statue of Marduk was the physical representation of Marduk housed in Babylon's main temple, the [[Esagila]].{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Although there were actually seven separate statues of Marduk in Babylon; four in the Esagila and the surrounding temple complex, one in the [[Etemenanki]] (the [[ziggurat]] dedicated to Marduk) and two in temples dedicated to other deities, ''the'' statue of Marduk usually refers to Marduk's primary statue, placed prominently in the Esagila and used in the city's rituals.{{Sfn|Dalley|1997|p=163}}\n\nThis principal statue of Marduk was nicknamed the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' and made of a type of wood called ''m\u0113su''.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}} The carved wooden statue would also have been covered in precious metals, such as gold and silver.{{Sfn|Schaudig|2008|p=561}} In addition to this, the statue would have been provided with ritual clothing, at least partly made of gold.{{Sfn|Oppenheim|1949|p=172}} This statue would have occupied the cult room of Marduk in the Esagila, called the ''E-umu\u0161a''. Among the various statues of Marduk, the one called the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' is the only one explicitly mentioned in connection with the city's major rituals (though the statue is rarely named, often being referred to just as \"Marduk\" or \"''B\u00eal''\").{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}} The name ''Asull\u1e2bi'' had centuries prior been associated with [[Asaruludu|a separate deity]] of incantations later conflated with Marduk.{{Sfn|Brisch|2016}}\n\nAnother statue of Marduk, called the ''Asarre'', was made from a stone the Babylonians called ''mar\u1e2bu\u0161u'', possibly [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] or [[steatite]].{{Sfn|George|1997|p=65}}{{Sfn|Steinkeller|2012|p=263}} The ''Asarre'' was located in a chapel dedicated to the god [[Ninurta]] off the north side of the Esagila's central courtyard.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=65}} Though this chapel would have been dedicated to Ninurta, the Marduk statue would have occupied the central point of attention and thus have been the main figure.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}} This might be explained through the god Ninurta becoming seen as simply an aspect of Marduk; an ancient visitor to the temple may not have been surprised to find Marduk in the stead of Ninurta.{{Sfn|George|1997|p=67}} Other statues included one made of a type of wood called ''taskarinnu'' and placed in a chamber dedicated to the Enki (Marduk's father) in the E-kar-zaginna temple, part of the Esagila temple complex but not of the temple itself, an [[alabaster]] statue in the \"temple of E-namtila\", a statue of [[hematite]] in the \"chapel of Ninurta in the temple E-\u1e2bursag-tilla\" and a statue of unknown material in \"E-gi\u0161\u1e2bur-ankia, the temple of B\u0113let-Ninua\".{{Sfn|George|1997|p=66}}\n\n== Role and importance ==\n[[File:Colossal statue of the god Nabu, 8th century BCE, from Nimrud, Iraq Museum.jpg|thumb|Closeup of a colossal stone statue of the god [[Nabu]] (the son of Marduk) recovered from the city [[Kalhu]], an example of a surviving ancient Mesopotamian statue of a deity. Exhibited at the [[Iraq Museum]].|alt=]]\nThe Babylonians themselves conflated the ''Asull\u1e2bi'' with the actual god Marduk \u2013 the god was understood as living in the temple, among the people of his city, and not in the heavens. As such, Marduk was not seen as some distant entity, but a friend and protector who lived nearby. This was no different from other Mesopotamian cities, who similarly conflated their gods with the representations used for them in their temples. During the religiously important 13-day long [[Akitu|New Year's festival]] held annually in the spring at Babylon, the statue was removed from the temple and paraded through Babylon before being placed in a smaller building outside the city walls, where the statue received fresh air and could enjoy a different view from the one it had from inside the temple.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} The statue was traditionally incorporated into the coronation rituals for the [[Babylonian kings]], who received the Babylonian crown \"out of the hands\" of Marduk during the New Year's festival, symbolizing them being bestowed with kingship by the patron deity of the city.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1989|p=|pp=185\u2013186}}''''' The rule of the Babylonian king and his role as Marduk's vassal on Earth was also reaffirmed annually during the New Year's festival, when the king entered the Esagila alone on the fifth day and met with the chief priest. During the ensuing ritual, the chief priest removed the royal regalia from the king, slapped him across the face and made him kneel before Marduk's statue. The king then told the statue that he had not oppressed his people and that he had maintained order throughout the year, whereafter the chief priest replied (on behalf of Marduk) that the king would continue to enjoy divine support for his rule and the regalia were returned.'''''{{Sfn|Laing|Frost|p=|2017}}''''' The standard full \"negative confession\" of the king was the following:\n\n{{quote|quote=[I have not] sinned, lord of the lands, I have not neglected your divinity,<br>[I have not] ruined Babylon, I have not ordered its dissolution,<br>[I have not] made the Esagila tremble, I have not forgotten its rites,<br>[I have not] struck the cheek of any privileged subject, I have [not] brought about their humiliation,<br>[I have been taking ca]re of Babylon, I have not destroyed its outer walls!{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=51}}|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nBecause the significance the statue held to the city, enemies of Babylon often used the statue as a means of [[psychological warfare]]. When foreign powers conquered or plundered Babylon, the statue was often stolen from the city (a common way of weakening the power of defeated cities in ancient Mesopotamia). Such events caused great distress for the Babylonians as the removal of the statue signified the actual departure of the real deity, their friend and protector. If the statue was absent, the New Year's festival could not be celebrated and made other religious activities and rituals difficult to perform.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} The Babylonians believed that the statue's departures from the city were somewhat self-imposed, with the statue itself deciding to make the journey and foreign theft of it simply being a means to achieve that.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=30}} Though the statue's absence from Babylon meant confusion and hardship, the Babylonians believed that foreign lands benefited from having the statue and that it brought prosperity wherever it went.{{Sfn|Clifford|2003|p=11}} The practice of taking the cult statues from enemies was viewed as capturing the enemy's source of divine power and suppressing that power.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=30}}\n\nStatues of deities were sometimes destroyed by enemy powers, as was once the case for the statue of the sun god [[Shamash]] in that deity's patron city, [[Sippar]]. The statue of Shamash was destroyed by the [[Suteans]] during the reign of Babylonian king [[Simbar-shipak]] ({{Circa|}} 1026\u20131009 BC).{{Sfn|Dick|1999|p=58}} As the statues held enormous religious significance, the statue of Shamash could not be replaced until almost two centuries later, under King [[Nabu-apla-iddina]] ({{Circa|}} 887\u2013855 BC) when a replica of the original was \"divinely revealed\" and the king ordered the new statue to be ritually dedicated. In the meantime, Sippar had prayed to its god using a sun-disc as a substitute for the statue.{{Sfn|Dick|1999|p=60}} Though they were conflated into one, gods in Mesopotamia were believed to be able to \"abandon\" their statues. In an 8th-century BC religious text, the poor state of Marduk's statue inspires the god [[Erra (god)|Erra]] to suggest that Marduk depart from the statue and that Erra could rule in his stead until the Babylonians had finished restoring the statue.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=30}} Gods could exist in heaven and on Earth simultaneously and their presence on Earth could be in multiple places at the same time; for instance the Shamash and the goddess [[Ishtar]] (a goddess of sex, war, justice and political power associated with the planet [[Venus]]) were manifested in cult images in many different cities and were also still seen as being present in their respective heavenly bodies.{{Sfn|Herring|2013|p=31}} As such, though statues and other cult images could be harmed, this did not mean that actual damage was being done to the gods themselves.{{Sfn|Schaudig|2008|p=562}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Journeys of Marduk ===\n{{Sidebar timeline|title={{center|Journeys of Marduk}}|members5=Sippar is sacked by [[Elamites|Elamite]] king [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], the statue is carried to [[Elam]].|years9=484\u2013481 BC|members8=The statue is returned to the city with [[Shamash-shum-ukin]]'s coronation as King of Babylon.|years8=668 BC|members7=[[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] king [[Sennacherib]] sacks Babylon, the statue is carried to [[Issete]] in [[Assyria]].|years7=689 BC|members6=[[Nebuchadnezzar I]] rules as King of Babylon, he defeats the Elamites and returns the statue to the city.|years6=1125\u20131104 BC|years5={{circa}} 1150 BC|years1={{circa}} 1595 BC|members4=The statue returns to Babylon and is later moved to [[Sippar]].|years4=?|members3=Babylon is sacked by Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]], the statue is carried to [[Assur]].|years3=1225 BC|members2=The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[\u0160uppiluliuma I]] possibly returns the statue as a gesture of goodwill.|years2={{circa}} 1344 BC|members1=The [[Hittites|Hittite]] king [[Mursili I]] sacks Babylon, the statue is carried to [[Hattusa]].|members9=Babylon revolts against [[Achaemenid]] king [[Xerxes I]] and is harshly reprimanded.

What exactly happened thereafter is unclear, but the statue returned to Babylon at some point and was later, for unknown reasons, moved to the nearby city [[Sippar]]. Sippar was sacked {{Circa|}} 1150 BC by the [[Elamites]] under their king, [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], who stole the statue, carrying it to his homeland [[Elam]]. The statue was successfully seized and returned to Babylon after the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] ({{Reign}}{{Circa|}} 1125\u20131104 BC) campaigned against the Elamites.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}{{Sfn|Leick|2009|p=349}} Nebuchadnezzar's successful return of the statue to the city was a monumentous event and several literary works were created to commemorate it, possibly including an early version of the ''En\u00fbma Eli\u0161''.{{Sfn|Leick|2009|p=351}}\n\nThe [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] conquered Babylon under their king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] in October 729 BC, with its monarchs proclaiming themselves as kings of Babylon in addition to already being [[kings of Assyria]].'''{{Sfn|Luckenbill|1926|p=282}}''' As vengeance after a series of revolts, the Neo-Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] plundered and destroyed Babylon in 689 BC. Sennacherib had been seen as somewhat heretical by the Babylonians as he hadn't gone through with the traditional coronation ritual (with the statue) when he had proclaimed himself as Babylon's king.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Following the destruction of the city, Sennacherib stole the statue and it was kept at the town of [[Issete]] in the northeastern parts of Assyria.'''{{Sfn|Cole|Machinist|1998|p=11\u201313}}''' When Sennacherib was murdered by his sons [[Arda-Mulissu]] and [[Sharezer]] in 681 BC, the Babylonians saw it as Marduk's divine retribution.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Sennacherib's successor as Assyrian king, [[Esarhaddon]], rebuilt Babylon in the 670s BC, restoring the Esagila. Under Esarhaddon's guidance, a pedestal in gold (meant to be the place of the statue) was created in the Esagila.'''{{Sfn|Cole|Machinist|1998|p=11\u201313}}''' The statue was finally returned to the city during the coronation of Esarhaddon's successor as Babylonian king, [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], in the spring of 668 BC.'''{{Sfn|Johns|1913|p=124}}''' It is possible that Sennacherib actually destroyed the original statue and the statue returned to Babylon in 668 BC was a replica; some of Sennacherib's inscriptions allude to smashing the statues of the gods in Babylon while others explicitly state that the Marduk statue was carried to Assyria.{{Sfn|Dick|1999|p=63}}\n\nAssyrian control of Babylon was ended with the successful revolt of [[Nabopolassar]] in 626 BC, which established the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]].{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=16}} Nabopolassar's son and heir, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] ({{Reign}}605\u2013562 BC) widened the streets of Babylon so that the parade of the statue through the city at the New Year's festival would be made easier. The Neo-Babylonian Empire was ended with the conquest of Babylon by [[Cyrus the Great]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 539 BC. Cyrus showed respect for the city and the statue and his own inscriptions surrounding his conquest of the city explicitly state that Marduk was on his side in the war.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}}\n\nThough the statue was often used as a means of physological warfare by removing it from the city, powerful foreign rulers who did so had a tendency to end up dead at the hands of their own family members. Mursili I, Shutruk-Nakhunte, Tukulti-Ninurta I, Sennacherib and the later [[Xerxes I]] all ended up killed by members of their own families.'''{{Sfn|Brinkman|1973|p=95}}''' Such deaths, as can be seen in the Babylonian reaction to Sennacherib's murder in particular, were hailed by the Babylonians as divine punishment.'''{{Sfn|Parpola|1980|p=}}'''\n\n=== Fate ===\nDuring the reign of the Achaemenid king Xerxes I, Babylon revolted at least twice against Persian rule. The first revolt broke out in June or July of 484 BC and was led by a rebel of the name [[Bel-shimanni]]. Bel-shimmani's revolt was short-lived, Babylonian documents written during his reign only account for a period of two weeks. Two years later, Babylon produced another rebel leader, [[Shamash-eriba]]. Beginning in the summer of 482 BC, Shamash-eriba seized Babylon itself and other nearby cities, such as [[Borsippa]] and [[Dilbat]], and was only defeated in March 481 BC after a lengthy siege of Babylon.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' Prior to these revolts, Babylon had occupied a special position within the Achaemenid Empire, the Achaemenid kings had been titled as ''King of Babylon and King of the Lands'', perceiving Babylonia as a somewhat separate entity within their empire, united with their own kingdom in a [[personal union]]. Xerxes dropped ''King of Babylon'' from his titulature and divided the previously large Babylonian satrapy (accounting for most of the Neo-Babylonian Empire's territory) into smaller sub-units.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1989|p=|pp=185\u2013186}}'''''\n\nUsing texts written by classical authors, it is often assumed that Xerxes enacted a brutal vengeance on Babylon following the two revolts. According to ancient writers, Xerxes destroyed Babylon's fortifications and damaged the temples in the city.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' The Esagila was allegedly exposed to great damage and Xerxes allegedly carried the statue of Marduk away from the city,'''''{{Sfn|Sancisi-Weerdenburg|2002|p=579}}''''' possibly bringing it to Iran and melting it down (classical authors held that the statue was entirely made of gold, which would have made melting it down possible).'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' Historian [[Am\u00e9lie Kuhrt]] considers it unlikely that Xerxes destroyed the temples, but believes that the story of him doing so may derive from an anti-Persian sentiment among the Babylonians.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=39}}''''' The story of Xerxes melting the statue comes chiefly from the ancient Greek writer [[Herodotus]], who isn't otherwise considered entirely reliable and has been noted as being very anti-Persian. His account of the statue's destruction might be anti-Persian propaganda.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Furthermore, it is doubtful if the statue was removed from Babylon at all'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' and some have even suggested that Xerxes did remove a statue from the city, but that this was the golden statue of a man rather than the statue of the god Marduk.'''''{{Sfn|Waerzeggers|Seire|2018|p=3}}{{Sfn|Briant|2002|p=544}}''''' Though mentions of it are lacking considerably compared to earlier periods, contemporary documents suggest that the Babylonian New Year's Festival continued in some form during the Persian period.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=40}}''''' Because the change in rulership from the Babylonians themselves to the Persians and due to the replacement of the city's elite families by Xerxes following its revolt, it is possible that the festival's traditional rituals and events had changed considerably.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=41}}'''''\n\nAlthough contemporary evidence for Xerxes's retribution against Babylon is missing,'''''{{Sfn|Waerzeggers|2004|p=150}}''''' that there was damage done by him to temples in the city is mentioned by later authors as well. For instance, both the Roman historian [[Arrian]] and the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] describe how [[Alexander the Great]] restored some temples in the city which had been destroyed or damaged by Xerxes.'''''{{Sfn|Dandamaev|1993|p=41}}''''' No mention of the statue is made by these authors, possibly indicating that it was no longer in the Esagila by Alexander's time.{{Sfn|Mark|2016|p=}} Although there are later references to rulers giving gifts to Marduk in the Esagila, such as the [[Characene]]an ruler [[Hyspaosines]] in 127 BC, it is unclear if these refer to the statue.'''''{{Sfn|Spek|2001|p=|pp=452\u2013453}}''''' There are no known sources that mention the New Year's Festival as a contemporary event from the time of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and onwards.'''''{{Sfn|Deloucas|2016|p=59}}''''' Though it might no longer have existed, the statue was a known historical object as late as the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian period]], from which a ritual text describes its role in the New Year's festival, including how the ''En\u00fbma Eli\u0161'' was recited in front of it and how the ancient kings of Babylon were supposed to be ritually slapped during the festival.{{Sfn|Brisch|2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Lost history]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n* {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lxQ9W6F1oSYC&dq=%22golden+statue%22+marduk|title=From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire|last=Briant|first=Pierre|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2002|isbn=978-1575060316|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFBriant2002}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Brinkman|first=J.

Rich received the West Side Story arrangement of [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s melodies from the famed [[Musical theater|musical]] in the mid-1960s and found it challenging. It consists of many difficult sections which feature 4/4 and 6/8 time signatures; it took almost a month of constant rehearsals to perfect. It later became a staple in all his performances, clocking in at various lengths from seven to fifteen minutes.

He used the [[matched grip]] when playing [[floor tom]]s around the drum set while performing cross-stickings (crossing arm over arm), which was one of his party tricks, often leading to loud cheers from the audience. Another technique he used to impress was the stick-trick, a fast roll performed by slapping two drumsticks together in a circular motion using \"taps\" or single-stroke stickings. He often used contrasting techniques to keep long drum solos from getting mundane. Aside from his energetic, explosive displays, he would go into quieter passages. One passage he would use in most solos started with a simple single-stroke roll on the [[snare drum]] picking up speed and power, then slowly moving his sticks closer to the rim as he got quieter, and eventually playing on the rim itself while still maintaining speed. Then he would reverse the effect and slowly move towards the center of the snare while increasing power. Though well known as a powerful drummer, he did use [[Brush (music)|brushes]]. On the album ''[[The Lionel Hampton Art Tatum Buddy Rich Trio]]'' (1955) he played with brushes almost exclusively.\n\nIn 1942, Rich and [[Henry Adler]] wrote ''Buddy Rich's Modern Interpretation of Snare Drum Rudiments'', which is regarded as one of the more popular snare [[drum rudiment]] books.<ref name=\"legendary\">{{cite web |title=Henry Adler: Legendary Drum Teacher |url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2011/02/henry-adler/ |website=Modern Drummer Magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=4 February 2011}}</ref> Adler met Rich through a former student. Adler said, \"The kid told me he played better than Krupa. Buddy was only in his teens at the time and his friend was my first pupil. Buddy played and I watched his hands. Well, he knocked me right out. He did everything I wanted to do, and he did it with such ease. When I met his folks, I asked them who his teacher was. 'He never studied', they told me. That made me feel very good. I realized that it was something physical, not only mental, that you had to have.\"<ref name=\"Dinella\">{{cite web |last1=Dinella |first1=Jim |title=The World of Henry Adler |url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/march-1985-the-world-of-henry-adler/ |website=Modern Drummer Magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=March 1985 }}</ref> Adler denied the rumor that he taught Rich how to play. \"Sure, he studied with me, but he didn't come to me to learn how to hold the drumsticks. I set out to teach Buddy to read. He'd take six lessons, go on the road for six weeks and come back. He didn't practice. He couldn't, because wherever the guy went, he was followed around by admiring drummers. He didn't have time to practice...Tommy Dorsey wanted Buddy to write a book and he told him to get in touch with me. I did the book and Tommy wrote the foreword. Technically, I was Buddy's teacher, but I came along after he had already acquired his technique.\"<ref name=\"Dinella\" />\n\nWhen asked if Rich could read music, [[Bobby Shew]], lead trumpeter in Rich's mid-1960s big band replied, \"No. He'd always have a drummer there during rehearsals to read and play the parts initially on new arrangements. Buddy would just sit in the empty audience seats in the afternoon and listen to the band...He'd only have to listen to a chart once and he'd have it memorized. We'd run through it and he'd know exactly how it went, how many measures it ran and what he'd have to do to drive it.\"<ref name=\"Myers\">{{cite web |last1=Myers |first1=Marc |title=Bobby Shew on Buddy Rich (Part 2) - JazzWax |url=https://www.jazzwax.com/2010/02/bobby-shew-on-budy-rich-part-2.html |website=Jazzwax.com |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' interview, Buddy had this to say about practicing: \"I don't put much emphasis on practice anyhow. I think it's a fallacy to believe that the more you practice, the better you become. You can only get better by playing. You can sit in a basement with a set of drums and practice rudiments all day long, but if you don't play with a band, you won't learn style, technique, and taste, and you won't learn how to play for a band and with a band. It's like getting a job, any kind of job, it's an opportunity to develop. And practice, besides that, is boring. I know teachers who tell their students to practice three, four, six hours a day. If you can't get what you want after an hour of practice, you're not going to get it in four days.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the same article, Rich also discourages playing drums with one's bare hands. When asked if he could do such a thing, he replied, 'Yes, but why destroy your hands? I could think of a hundred ways to use my hands rather than to break them on the rim of a drum.'\"{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRich's technique, including speed, smooth execution and precision, is one of the most coveted in drumming and has become a common standard.

The \"West Side Story Medley\", arranged by Bill Reddie, is a complex big-band arrangement which highlights Rich's ability to blend the rhythm of his drumming into his band's playing of the musical chart. Rich received the West Side Story arrangement of [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s melodies from the famed [[Musical theater|musical]] in the mid-1960s and found it challenging. It consists of many difficult sections which feature 4/4 and 6/8 time signatures; it took almost a month of constant rehearsals to perfect. It later became a staple in all his performances, clocking in at various lengths from seven to fifteen minutes.

He used the [[matched grip]] when playing [[floor tom]]s around the drum set while performing cross-stickings (crossing arm over arm), which was one of his party tricks, often leading to loud cheers from the audience. Another technique he used to impress was the stick-trick, a fast roll performed by slapping two drumsticks together in a circular motion using \"taps\" or single-stroke stickings. He often used contrasting techniques to keep long drum solos from getting mundane. Aside from his energetic, explosive displays, he would go into quieter passages. One passage he would use in most solos started with a simple single-stroke roll on the [[snare drum]] picking up speed and power, then slowly moving his sticks closer to the rim as he got quieter, and eventually playing on the rim itself while still maintaining speed. Then he would reverse the effect and slowly move towards the center of the snare while increasing power. Though well known as a powerful drummer, he did use [[Brush (music)|brushes]]. On the album ''[[The Lionel Hampton Art Tatum Buddy Rich Trio]]'' (1955) he played with brushes almost exclusively.\n\nIn 1942, Rich and [[Henry Adler]] wrote ''Buddy Rich's Modern Interpretation of Snare Drum Rudiments'', which is regarded as one of the more popular snare [[drum rudiment]] books.<ref name=\"legendary\">{{cite web |title=Henry Adler: Legendary Drum Teacher |url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2011/02/henry-adler/ |website=Modern Drummer Magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=4 February 2011}}</ref> Adler met Rich through a former student. Adler said, \"The kid told me he played better than Krupa. Buddy was only in his teens at the time and his friend was my first pupil. Buddy played and I watched his hands. Well, he knocked me right out. He did everything I wanted to do, and he did it with such ease. When I met his folks, I asked them who his teacher was. 'He never studied', they told me. That made me feel very good. I realized that it was something physical, not only mental, that you had to have.\"<ref name=\"Dinella\">{{cite web |last1=Dinella |first1=Jim |title=The World of Henry Adler |url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/march-1985-the-world-of-henry-adler/ |website=Modern Drummer Magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=March 1985 }}</ref> Adler denied the rumor that he taught Rich how to play. \"Sure, he studied with me, but he didn't come to me to learn how to hold the drumsticks. I set out to teach Buddy to read. He'd take six lessons, go on the road for six weeks and come back. He didn't practice. He couldn't, because wherever the guy went, he was followed around by admiring drummers. He didn't have time to practice...Tommy Dorsey wanted Buddy to write a book and he told him to get in touch with me. I did the book and Tommy wrote the foreword. Technically, I was Buddy's teacher, but I came along after he had already acquired his technique.\"<ref name=\"Dinella\" />\n\nWhen asked if Rich could read music, [[Bobby Shew]], lead trumpeter in Rich's mid-1960s big band replied, \"No. He'd always have a drummer there during rehearsals to read and play the parts initially on new arrangements. Buddy would just sit in the empty audience seats in the afternoon and listen to the band...He'd only have to listen to a chart once and he'd have it memorized. We'd run through it and he'd know exactly how it went, how many measures it ran and what he'd have to do to drive it.\"<ref name=\"Myers\">{{cite web |last1=Myers |first1=Marc |title=Bobby Shew on Buddy Rich (Part 2) - JazzWax |url=https://www.jazzwax.com/2010/02/bobby-shew-on-budy-rich-part-2.html |website=Jazzwax.com |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a ''[[Modern Drummer]]'' interview, Buddy had this to say about practicing: \"I don't put much emphasis on practice anyhow. I think it's a fallacy to believe that the more you practice, the better you become. You can only get better by playing. You can sit in a basement with a set of drums and practice rudiments all day long, but if you don't play with a band, you won't learn style, technique, and taste, and you won't learn how to play for a band and with a band. It's like getting a job, any kind of job, it's an opportunity to develop. And practice, besides that, is boring. I know teachers who tell their students to practice three, four, six hours a day. If you can't get what you want after an hour of practice, you're not going to get it in four days.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the same article, Rich also discourages playing drums with one's bare hands. When asked if he could do such a thing, he replied, 'Yes, but why destroy your hands? I could think of a hundred ways to use my hands rather than to break them on the rim of a drum.'\"{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Legacy==\nRich's technique, including speed, smooth execution and precision, is one of the most coveted in drumming and has become a common standard.

Shelley's title thus compares the monster's creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], to the mythological character [[Prometheus]], who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire.\n\nIn Shelley's [[Gothic fiction|Gothic story]], Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his [[laboratory]] through an ambiguous method consisting of [[chemistry]] and [[alchemy]]. Shelley describes the monster as {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} and hideously ugly, but sensitive and emotional.  The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein. According to the scholar [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], the monster occupies \"a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Joseph|last1=Carroll|authorlink=Joseph Carroll (scholar)|first2=Jonathan|last2=Gottschall|first3=John A.|last3=Johnson|first4=Daniel J.|last4=Kruger|title=Graphing Jane Austen: The Evolutionary Basis of Literary Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZtiAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT30|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, England|date=2012|isbn=978-1137002402}}</ref>\n\nFrankenstein's monster became iconic in popular culture, and has been featured in various forms of media, including films, television series, [[Merchandising|merchandise]] and video games.

In 1823, Shelley herself attended a performance of [[Richard Brinsley Peake]]'s ''[[Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein|Presumption]]'', the first successful stage adaptation of her novel. \"The play bill amused me extremely, for in the list of [[dramatis personae]] came _________, by Mr T.

For example, in ''[[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein]]'', first published in 2004, the creature is named \"Deucalion\", after the [[Deucalion|character]] from [[Greek Mythology]], who is the son of the titan [[Prometheus]], a reference to the original novel's title.  Another example is the second episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'', which first aired in 2014; Victor Frankenstein briefly considers naming his creation \"Adam\", before deciding instead to let the monster \"pick his own name\". Thumbing through a book of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], the monster chooses \"Proteus\" from ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the ''second'' monster Frankenstein has created, with the first, abandoned creation having been named \"Caliban\", from ''[[The Tempest]]'', by the theatre actor who took him in and later, after leaving the theatre, named himself after the English poet [[John Clare]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Dennis|last=Crow|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/penny-dreadful/236468/penny-dreadful-the-most-faithful-version-of-the-frankenstein-legend|title=Penny Dreadful: The Most Faithful Version of the Frankenstein Legend|work=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=Dennis Publishing|location=London, England|date=October 19, 2016|access-date=July 13, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Shelley's plot==\n[[Image:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Stanton Ogle]] in the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|1910 film version]]]]\n{{main|Frankenstein}}\nAs told by Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in the attic of his boarding house through an ambiguously described [[scientific method]] consisting of [[chemistry]] (from his time as a student at [[University of Ingolstadt]]) and [[alchemy]] (largely based on the writings of [[Paracelsus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Cornelius Agrippa]]). Frankenstein is disgusted by his creation, however, and flees from it in horror. Frightened, and unaware of his own identity, the monster wanders through the wilderness.\n\nHe finds brief solace beside a remote cottage inhabited by a family of [[peasant]]s. Eavesdropping, the creature familiarizes himself with their lives and learns to speak, whereby he becomes eloquent, educated, and well-mannered. The creature eventually introduces himself to the family's [[blindness|blind]] father, who treats him with kindness. When the rest of the family returns, however, they are frightened of him and drive him away. Hopeful but bewildered, the creature rescues a peasant girl from a river but is shot in the shoulder by a man who claims her. The creature finds Frankenstein's journal in the pocket of the jacket he found in the laboratory, and swears revenge on his creator for leaving him alone in a world that hates him.\n\nThe monster kills Victor's younger brother William upon learning of the boy's relation to his hated creator. When Frankenstein retreats to the mountains, the monster approaches him at the summit and asks his creator to build him a female mate. In return, he promises to disappear with his mate and never trouble humankind again; the monster then threatens to destroy everything Frankenstein holds dear should he fail or refuse. Frankenstein agrees and builds a female creature, but, aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters, destroys it. In response, the monster kills Frankenstein's best friend Henry Clerval, and later kills Frankenstein's bride [[Elizabeth Lavenza]] on their wedding night, whereupon Frankenstein's father dies of grief. With nothing left to live for but revenge, Frankenstein dedicates himself to destroying his creation.\n\nSearching for the monster in the [[Arctic Circle]], Frankenstein falls into the freezing water, contracting severe [[pneumonia]]. A ship exploring the region encounters the dying Frankenstein, who relates his story to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. Later, the monster boards the ship; but, upon finding Frankenstein dead, is overcome by grief and pledges to incinerate himself at \"the Northernmost extremity of the globe\". He then departs, never to be seen again.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[Image:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Boris Karloff]] as the classic 1930s film version with an assist from [[make-up artist]] [[Jack Pierce (make-up artist)|Jack Pierce]]]]\n[[File:Frankenstein 1896.jpg|thumb|Frankenstein's monster in an editorial cartoon, 1896]]\nShelley described Frankenstein's monster as an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} creature of hideous contrasts:<blockquote>His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</blockquote>A picture of the creature appeared in the 1831 edition. Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga, shaded, along with the monster's skin, a pale blue. Throughout the 19th century, the monster's image remained variable according to the artist.\n\nThe best-known image of Frankenstein's monster in [[popular culture]] derives from [[Boris Karloff]]'s portrayal in the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]],'' in which he wore makeup applied, and according to a format designed by, [[Jack Pierce (make-up artist)|Jack P. Pierce]] and possibly suggested by director [[James Whale]]. [[Universal Studios]], which released the film, was quick to secure ownership of the copyright for the makeup format. Karloff played the monster in two more Universal films, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''; [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] took over the part from Karloff in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]];'' [[Bela Lugosi]] portrayed the role in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]];'' and [[Glenn Strange]] played the monster in the last three [[Universal Studios]] films to feature the character \u2013 ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]],'' ''[[House of Dracula]],'' and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]].'' But their makeup replicated the iconic look first worn by Karloff. To this day, the image of Karloff's face is owned by his daughter's company, Karloff Enterprises, for which Universal replaced Karloff's features with Glenn Strange's in most of their marketing.\n\nSince Karloff's portrayal, the creature almost always appears as a towering, [[undead]]-like figure, often with a flat-topped angular head and bolts on his neck to serve as electrical connectors or grotesque electrodes. He wears a dark, usually tattered, suit having shortened coat sleeves and thick, heavy boots, causing him to walk with an awkward, stiff-legged gait (as opposed to the novel, in which he is described as much more flexible than a human). The tone of his skin varies (although shades of green or gray are common), and his body appears stitched together at certain parts (such as around the neck and joints). This image has influenced the creation of other fictional characters, such as [[Hulk|the Hulk]].<ref name=\"OyVey\">{{Cite book| last=Weinstein | first=Simcha | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey!: how Jewish history, culture, and values shaped the comic book superhero | publisher=Leviathan Press | year=2006 | location=Baltimore, Maryland | pages=82\u201397 | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1973 TV miniseries ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]],'' a different approach was taken in depicting the monster: [[Michael Sarrazin]] appears as a strikingly handsome man who later degenerates into a grotesque monster due to a flaw in the creation process.\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]],'' the creature is played by [[Robert De Niro]] in a nearer approach to the original source, except this version gives the creature balding grey hair and a body covered in bloody stitches. He is, as in the novel, motivated by pain and loneliness. In this version, Frankenstein gives the monster the brain of his mentor, [[Doctor Waldman]], while his body is made from a man who killed Waldman while resisting a vaccination. The monster retains Waldman's \"trace memories\" that apparently help him quickly learn to speak and read.\n\nIn the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]],'' the monster is shown in a modernized version of the Karloff design. He is {{convert|8|to(-)|9|ft|cm}} tall, has a square bald head, gruesome scars, and pale green skin. The electricity is emphasized with one electrified dome in the back of his head and another over his heart. It also has hydraulic pistons in its legs, essentially rendering the design as a steam-punk cyborg. Although not as eloquent as in the novel, this version of the creature is intelligent and relatively nonviolent.\n\nIn 2004, a TV miniseries adaptation of ''[[Frankenstein (US TV miniseries)|Frankenstein]]'' was made by [[Hallmark Channel|Hallmark]]. [[Luke Goss]] plays The Creature. This adaptation more closely resembles the monster as described in the novel: intelligent and articulate, with flowing, dark hair and watery eyes.\n\nThe 2014 TV series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' also rejects the Karloff design in favor of Shelley's description. This version of the creature has the flowing dark hair described by Shelley, although he departs from her description by having pale grey skin and obvious scars along the right side of his face. In this series, the monster names himself \"[[Caliban]]\", after the character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. In the series, Victor Frankenstein makes a second and third creature, each more indistinguishable from normal human beings.\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:House of Frankenstein (Strange and Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Glenn Strange]] as Frankenstein's monster with [[Boris Karloff]], this time playing another character, in the 1944 film ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'']] \n[[File:Curse of Frankenstein 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Lee]] as the creature in the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer's]] ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957)]]\nAs depicted by Shelley, the monster is a sensitive, emotional creature whose only aim is to share his life with another sentient being like himself. The novel and film versions portrayed him as versed in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]'', and ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.\n\nFrom the beginning, the monster is rejected by everyone he meets. He realizes from the moment of his \"birth\" that even his own creator cannot stand the sight of him; this is obvious when Frankenstein says \"\u2026one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped\u2026\".<ref name=Shelley>{{cite web|last=Shelley|first=Mary Wollstonecraft|authorlink=Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley|title=Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm|date=1818|accessdate=3 November 2012|via=Gutenberg Project}}</ref>{{rp|Ch.5}} Upon seeing his own reflection, he realizes that he too is repulsed by his appearance. His greatest desire is to find love and acceptance; but when that desire is denied, he swears revenge on his creator.\n\nContrary to many film versions, the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his way of speaking. Almost immediately after his creation, he dresses himself; and within 11 months, he can speak and read German and French. By the end of the novel, the creature appears able to speak English fluently as well. The ''Van Helsing'' and ''Penny Dreadful'' interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original, although the latter version is the only one to retain the character's violent reactions to rejection.\n\nIn the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], the monster is depicted as [[Muteness|mute]] and bestial; it is implied that this is because he is accidentally implanted with a criminal's \"abnormal\" brain. In the subsequent sequel, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', the monster learns to speak, albeit in short, stunted sentences. In the second sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', the creature is again rendered inarticulate. Following a brain transplant in the third sequel, ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', the monster speaks with the voice and personality of the brain donor. This was continued after a fashion in the scripting for the fourth sequel, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', but the dialogue was excised before release. The monster was effectively mute in later sequels, though he is heard to refer to [[Count Dracula]] as his \"master\" in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. The monster is often portrayed as being [[Pyrophobia|afraid of fire]].\n\n==The monster as a metaphor==\n[[File:Museo Nazionale del Cinema, Turin (5282830195).jpg|thumb|upright|Frankenstein's monster's bust in the [[National Museum of Cinema]] of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nScholars sometimes look for deeper meaning in Shelley's story, and have analogized the monster to a motherless child; Shelley's own mother died while giving birth to her.<ref name=Milner>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Milner|title=Literature, Culture and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QW9C1Xdzyx4C&pg=PA227|pages=227, 230|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York City|date=2005|isbn=978-0814755648}}</ref> The monster has also been analogized to an oppressed class; Shelley wrote that the monster recognized \"the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.\"<ref name=Milner /> Others see in the monster the tragic results of uncontrolled scientific progress,<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeff|last=Coghill|title=CliffsNotes on Shelley's Frankenstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSHM5oZd8WkC&pg=PA30|page=30|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=2000|isbn=978-0764585937}}</ref> especially as at the time of publishing, [[Galvanism]] had convinced many scientists that raising the dead through use of electrical currents was a scientific possibility.\n\nAnother proposal is that the character of Dr. Frankenstein was based upon a real scientist who had a similar name, and who had been called a modern Prometheus \u2013 [[Benjamin Franklin]].

[[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]''. Shelley's title thus compares the monster's creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], to the mythological character [[Prometheus]], who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire.\n\nIn Shelley's [[Gothic fiction|Gothic story]], Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his [[laboratory]] through an ambiguous method consisting of [[chemistry]] and [[alchemy]]. Shelley describes the monster as {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} and hideously ugly, but sensitive and emotional.  The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein. According to the scholar [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], the monster occupies \"a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Joseph|last1=Carroll|authorlink=Joseph Carroll (scholar)|first2=Jonathan|last2=Gottschall|first3=John A.|last3=Johnson|first4=Daniel J.|last4=Kruger|title=Graphing Jane Austen: The Evolutionary Basis of Literary Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZtiAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT30|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, England|date=2012|isbn=978-1137002402}}</ref>\n\nFrankenstein's monster became iconic in popular culture, and has been featured in various forms of media, including films, television series, [[Merchandising|merchandise]] and video games. His most iconic version is his portrayal by [[Boris Karloff]] in the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]].''\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Frankenstein Cooke 1823.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The actor [[Thomas Cooke (actor)|T.

In 1823, Shelley herself attended a performance of [[Richard Brinsley Peake]]'s ''[[Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein|Presumption]]'', the first successful stage adaptation of her novel. \"The play bill amused me extremely, for in the list of [[dramatis personae]] came _________, by Mr T.

For example, in ''[[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein]]'', first published in 2004, the creature is named \"Deucalion\", after the [[Deucalion|character]] from [[Greek Mythology]], who is the son of the titan [[Prometheus]], a reference to the original novel's title.  Another example is the second episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'', which first aired in 2014; Victor Frankenstein briefly considers naming his creation \"Adam\", before deciding instead to let the monster \"pick his own name\". Thumbing through a book of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], the monster chooses \"Proteus\" from ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the ''second'' monster Frankenstein has created, with the first, abandoned creation having been named \"Caliban\", from ''[[The Tempest]]'', by the theatre actor who took him in and later, after leaving the theatre, named himself after the English poet [[John Clare]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Dennis|last=Crow|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/penny-dreadful/236468/penny-dreadful-the-most-faithful-version-of-the-frankenstein-legend|title=Penny Dreadful: The Most Faithful Version of the Frankenstein Legend|work=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=Dennis Publishing|location=London, England|date=October 19, 2016|access-date=July 13, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Shelley's plot==\n[[Image:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Stanton Ogle]] in the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|1910 film version]]]]\n{{main|Frankenstein}}\nAs told by Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in the attic of his boarding house through an ambiguously described [[scientific method]] consisting of [[chemistry]] (from his time as a student at [[University of Ingolstadt]]) and [[alchemy]] (largely based on the writings of [[Paracelsus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Cornelius Agrippa]]). Frankenstein is disgusted by his creation, however, and flees from it in horror. Frightened, and unaware of his own identity, the monster wanders through the wilderness.\n\nHe finds brief solace beside a remote cottage inhabited by a family of [[peasant]]s. Eavesdropping, the creature familiarizes himself with their lives and learns to speak, whereby he becomes eloquent, educated, and well-mannered. The creature eventually introduces himself to the family's [[blindness|blind]] father, who treats him with kindness. When the rest of the family returns, however, they are frightened of him and drive him away. Hopeful but bewildered, the creature rescues a peasant girl from a river but is shot in the shoulder by a man who claims her. The creature finds Frankenstein's journal in the pocket of the jacket he found in the laboratory, and swears revenge on his creator for leaving him alone in a world that hates him.\n\nThe monster kills Victor's younger brother William upon learning of the boy's relation to his hated creator. When Frankenstein retreats to the mountains, the monster approaches him at the summit and asks his creator to build him a female mate. In return, he promises to disappear with his mate and never trouble humankind again; the monster then threatens to destroy everything Frankenstein holds dear should he fail or refuse. Frankenstein agrees and builds a female creature, but, aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters, destroys it. In response, the monster kills Frankenstein's best friend Henry Clerval, and later kills Frankenstein's bride [[Elizabeth Lavenza]] on their wedding night, whereupon Frankenstein's father dies of grief. With nothing left to live for but revenge, Frankenstein dedicates himself to destroying his creation.\n\nSearching for the monster in the [[Arctic Circle]], Frankenstein falls into the freezing water, contracting severe [[pneumonia]]. A ship exploring the region encounters the dying Frankenstein, who relates his story to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. Later, the monster boards the ship; but, upon finding Frankenstein dead, is overcome by grief and pledges to incinerate himself at \"the Northernmost extremity of the globe\". He then departs, never to be seen again.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[Image:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Boris Karloff]] as the classic 1930s film version with an assist from [[make-up artist]] [[Jack Pierce (make-up artist)|Jack Pierce]]]]\n[[File:Frankenstein 1896.jpg|thumb|Frankenstein's monster in an editorial cartoon, 1896]]\nShelley described Frankenstein's monster as an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} creature of hideous contrasts:<blockquote>His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</blockquote>A picture of the creature appeared in the 1831 edition. Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga, shaded, along with the monster's skin, a pale blue. Throughout the 19th century, the monster's image remained variable according to the artist.\n\nThe best-known image of Frankenstein's monster in [[popular culture]] derives from [[Boris Karloff]]'s portrayal in the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]],'' in which he wore makeup applied, and according to a format designed by, [[Jack Pierce (make-up artist)|Jack P. Pierce]] and possibly suggested by director [[James Whale]]. [[Universal Studios]], which released the film, was quick to secure ownership of the copyright for the makeup format. Karloff played the monster in two more Universal films, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''; [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] took over the part from Karloff in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]];'' [[Bela Lugosi]] portrayed the role in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]];'' and [[Glenn Strange]] played the monster in the last three [[Universal Studios]] films to feature the character \u2013 ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]],'' ''[[House of Dracula]],'' and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]].'' But their makeup replicated the iconic look first worn by Karloff. To this day, the image of Karloff's face is owned by his daughter's company, Karloff Enterprises, for which Universal replaced Karloff's features with Glenn Strange's in most of their marketing.\n\nSince Karloff's portrayal, the creature almost always appears as a towering, [[undead]]-like figure, often with a flat-topped angular head and bolts on his neck to serve as electrical connectors or grotesque electrodes. He wears a dark, usually tattered, suit having shortened coat sleeves and thick, heavy boots, causing him to walk with an awkward, stiff-legged gait (as opposed to the novel, in which he is described as much more flexible than a human). The tone of his skin varies (although shades of green or gray are common), and his body appears stitched together at certain parts (such as around the neck and joints). This image has influenced the creation of other fictional characters, such as [[Hulk|the Hulk]].<ref name=\"OyVey\">{{Cite book| last=Weinstein | first=Simcha | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey!: how Jewish history, culture, and values shaped the comic book superhero | publisher=Leviathan Press | year=2006 | location=Baltimore, Maryland | pages=82\u201397 | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1973 TV miniseries ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]],'' a different approach was taken in depicting the monster: [[Michael Sarrazin]] appears as a strikingly handsome man who later degenerates into a grotesque monster due to a flaw in the creation process.\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]],'' the creature is played by [[Robert De Niro]] in a nearer approach to the original source, except this version gives the creature balding grey hair and a body covered in bloody stitches. He is, as in the novel, motivated by pain and loneliness. In this version, Frankenstein gives the monster the brain of his mentor, [[Doctor Waldman]], while his body is made from a man who killed Waldman while resisting a vaccination. The monster retains Waldman's \"trace memories\" that apparently help him quickly learn to speak and read.\n\nIn the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]],'' the monster is shown in a modernized version of the Karloff design. He is {{convert|8|to(-)|9|ft|cm}} tall, has a square bald head, gruesome scars, and pale green skin. The electricity is emphasized with one electrified dome in the back of his head and another over his heart. It also has hydraulic pistons in its legs, essentially rendering the design as a steam-punk cyborg. Although not as eloquent as in the novel, this version of the creature is intelligent and relatively nonviolent.\n\nIn 2004, a TV miniseries adaptation of ''[[Frankenstein (US TV miniseries)|Frankenstein]]'' was made by [[Hallmark Channel|Hallmark]]. [[Luke Goss]] plays The Creature. This adaptation more closely resembles the monster as described in the novel: intelligent and articulate, with flowing, dark hair and watery eyes.\n\nThe 2014 TV series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' also rejects the Karloff design in favor of Shelley's description. This version of the creature has the flowing dark hair described by Shelley, although he departs from her description by having pale grey skin and obvious scars along the right side of his face. In this series, the monster names himself \"[[Caliban]]\", after the character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. In the series, Victor Frankenstein makes a second and third creature, each more indistinguishable from normal human beings.\n\n==Personality==\n[[File:House of Frankenstein (Strange and Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Glenn Strange]] as Frankenstein's monster with [[Boris Karloff]], this time playing another character, in the 1944 film ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'']] \n[[File:Curse of Frankenstein 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Lee]] as the creature in the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer's]] ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957)]]\nAs depicted by Shelley, the monster is a sensitive, emotional creature whose only aim is to share his life with another sentient being like himself. The novel and film versions portrayed him as versed in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]'', and ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.\n\nFrom the beginning, the monster is rejected by everyone he meets. He realizes from the moment of his \"birth\" that even his own creator cannot stand the sight of him; this is obvious when Frankenstein says \"\u2026one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped\u2026\".<ref name=Shelley>{{cite web|last=Shelley|first=Mary Wollstonecraft|authorlink=Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley|title=Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm|date=1818|accessdate=3 November 2012|via=Gutenberg Project}}</ref>{{rp|Ch.5}} Upon seeing his own reflection, he realizes that he too is repulsed by his appearance. His greatest desire is to find love and acceptance; but when that desire is denied, he swears revenge on his creator.\n\nContrary to many film versions, the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his way of speaking. Almost immediately after his creation, he dresses himself; and within 11 months, he can speak and read German and French. By the end of the novel, the creature appears able to speak English fluently as well. The ''Van Helsing'' and ''Penny Dreadful'' interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original, although the latter version is the only one to retain the character's violent reactions to rejection.\n\nIn the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], the monster is depicted as [[Muteness|mute]] and bestial; it is implied that this is because he is accidentally implanted with a criminal's \"abnormal\" brain. In the subsequent sequel, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', the monster learns to speak, albeit in short, stunted sentences. In the second sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', the creature is again rendered inarticulate. Following a brain transplant in the third sequel, ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', the monster speaks with the voice and personality of the brain donor. This was continued after a fashion in the scripting for the fourth sequel, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', but the dialogue was excised before release. The monster was effectively mute in later sequels, though he is heard to refer to [[Count Dracula]] as his \"master\" in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. The monster is often portrayed as being [[Pyrophobia|afraid of fire]].\n\n==The monster as a metaphor==\n[[File:Museo Nazionale del Cinema, Turin (5282830195).jpg|thumb|upright|Frankenstein's monster's bust in the [[National Museum of Cinema]] of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]\nScholars sometimes look for deeper meaning in Shelley's story, and have analogized the monster to a motherless child; Shelley's own mother died while giving birth to her.<ref name=Milner>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Milner|title=Literature, Culture and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QW9C1Xdzyx4C&pg=PA227|pages=227, 230|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York City|date=2005|isbn=978-0814755648}}</ref> The monster has also been analogized to an oppressed class; Shelley wrote that the monster recognized \"the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty.\"<ref name=Milner /> Others see in the monster the tragic results of uncontrolled scientific progress,<ref>{{cite book|first=Jeff|last=Coghill|title=CliffsNotes on Shelley's Frankenstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSHM5oZd8WkC&pg=PA30|page=30|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=2000|isbn=978-0764585937}}</ref> especially as at the time of publishing, [[Galvanism]] had convinced many scientists that raising the dead through use of electrical currents was a scientific possibility.\n\nAnother proposal is that the character of Dr. Frankenstein was based upon a real scientist who had a similar name, and who had been called a modern Prometheus \u2013 [[Benjamin Franklin]].
