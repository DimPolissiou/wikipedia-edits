[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. Nc3|Nc3]] \nThis fairly uncommon opening may have more names than any other:  it is also called the '''Heinrichsen Opening''', '''Baltic Opening''', '''Van Geet Opening''', '''Sleipnir Opening''', '''Kotr\u010d's Opening''', '''Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Opening''', '''Romanian Opening''', '''Queen's Knight Attack''', '''Queen's Knight Opening''', '''Millard's Opening''', '''Knight on the Left''', and (in German) '''der Linksspringer'''.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n==Origin of names==\nThe names Heinrichsen and Baltic derive from [[Lithuania]]n chess player Arved Heinrichsen (1876&ndash;1900).  The opening was analyzed and played by the [[New York (state)|New York]] master Ted A. Dunst (April 11, 1907 [[New York City]] &ndash; December 18, 1985 [[Lambertville, New Jersey]]), giving the opening its most popular name in the United States.  The Dutch [[International Master]] and [[correspondence chess|correspondence]] [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Dirk Daniel (\"Dick D.\") van Geet (March 1, 1932 \u2013 April 29, 2012) frequently played 1.Nc3, so it is often called the Van Geet Opening in the [[Netherlands]].  The appellation [[Sleipnir]] seems to come from [[Germany]].  Sleipnir is [[Odin]]'s (''Wotan'' in German) magical eight-legged horse, and chess [[knight (chess)|knights]] are horses with up to eight different possible moves each turn. [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] Jan Kotr\u010d (1862\u20131943), editor and publisher of the magazine ''\u010cesk\u00e9 Listy'', said the opening was analyzed by [[England|English]] players. Zvonimir Me\u0161trovi\u0107 (b. October 17, 1944) is a [[Slovenia]]n International Master who often adopts this opening. [[Tim Harding (chess)|Tim Harding]] refers to it as the \"Queen's Knight Attack\" {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=8}}. [[Chess master|National Master]] [[Hugh Myers]] called it \"Millard's Opening\" after Henry Millard (1824\u201391), a blind [[correspondence chess]] player who drew with the opening in a [[List of chess terms#Simultaneous exhibition|simultaneous exhibition]] against [[Joseph Henry Blackburne]]. Blackburne later played the opening himself against [[Josef Noa]] in the London 1883 international chess tournament {{harvcol|Myers|2002|pp=24\u201325}}.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001989 Blackburne\u2013Noa, London 1883]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref> The German [[FIDE Master]] Harald Keilhack in his 2005 book on the opening states that it has also been referred to as the Romanian Defense, and that he prefers the neutral appellation \"Der Linksspringer\" or, in English, \"the Knight on the Left\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=7}}.\n\n==General remarks==\nThe opening move 1.Nc3 develops the [[knight (chess)|knight]] to a good square where it attacks the central e4 and d5 squares.  Although quite playable, 1.Nc3 is rarely seen; it is only the eighth most popular of the 20 possible first moves, behind 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.g3, 1.f4, and 1.b3. As of February 6, 2009, out of the over 500,000 games in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, only 644&mdash;about 1 out of every 780&mdash;begins with 1.Nc3.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\">[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/explorer Opening Explorer]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref>  The third-ranking 1.Nf3 is 66 times as popular.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> Some very strong [[correspondence chess]] players employ 1.Nc3 frequently, and it is occasionally seen over-the-board.\n\nThe reasons for 1.Nc3's lack of popularity are that it does not stop Black from occupying the center (while 1.Nf3 prevents 1...e5, 1.Nc3 does not prevent 1...d5 because the d-pawn is guarded by the queen), and it blocks White's c-pawn from moving, thus making it impossible to play c3 or c4 (which are often desirable moves) without moving the knight first. In addition, after 1...d5, the knight's position is unstable because Black may attack it with ...d4. Although 1.Nc3 develops a piece to a good square (unlike 1.Na3 or 1.Nh3), and does not weaken White's position (unlike, e.g., 1.g4 or 1.f3) or waste time (unlike, e.g., 1. c3), the above-stated drawbacks make it an inferior way of attempting to exploit White's [[First-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. Of the 644 games with 1.Nc3 in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, White won 34.8%, drew 23.9%, and lost 41.3%, for a total winning percentage of only 46.75%.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/><ref>White's overall winning percentage is derived by taking the percentage of games won by White and adding half of the percentage of drawn games, in this case 34.8 plus half of 23.9.</ref> White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%).<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> However, as of October 2018, for the 38,043 games with 1.Nc3 in [[Lichess.org]]'s database, White has a total winning percentage of 57.25% (55% won, 5% drawn, 40% lost), although it is still only the tenth most popular first move for White.\n\n==Possible continuations==\n\n===1...d5===\nThis is one of Black's best replies, occupying the center and underscoring the unsettled position of White's knight. White can prevent 2...d4 by playing 2.d4 himself, but he then obtains a somewhat inflexible position in the [[Queen's Pawn Game]] with his knight blocking the c-pawn {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. Also possible is 2.Nf3 (and if 2...d4, 3.Ne4), a sort of [[Black Knights' Tango]] with an extra move {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=10}}. A third line is 2.e3, which Keilhack calls \"the M\u00fcller game,\" when White hopes for 2...e5 (other moves are also playable, of course) 3.Qh5!?, e.g. 3...Nc6 4.Bb5 Qd6 5.d4 exd4 6.exd4 Nf6 7.Qe5+! Be6?! (Keilhack recommends 7...Kd8!! 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Nf3 Bg4) 8.Bf4 0-0-0 9.Bxc6 Qxc6? 10.Nb5!, when White wins at least a pawn {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=307\u201311}}.\n\nWhite's most common response to 1...d5 is 2.e4. This is the same position as 1.e4 d5 2.Nc3, an obscure branch of the [[Scandinavian Defense#Alternatives to 2.exd5|Scandinavian Defense]]. Black has five plausible responses to 2.e4: 2...e6 and 2...c6 transpose to the [[French Defence|French]] and [[Caro-Kann Defense|Caro\u2013Kann]] Defenses, and 2...Nf6 to a variation of [[Alekhine's Defence]]. The move 2...d4 gives Black a [[List of chess terms#Spatial advantage|spatial advantage]], which White may work to undermine along the lines of [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernism]]. Keilhack writes, \"2...d4 is chosen either by somewhat naive players who are attracted by the fact that Black wins time and space ... or by strong players who are aware of the strategic risks but are striving for a complex battle.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}} He considers the Van Geet Attack, 2...d4 3.Nce2 followed by Ng3, to be \"the core of the 1.Nc3 opening,\" \"a fully independent entity which strives for early knight activity on the kingside,\" usually with Ng3, Nf3, Bc4 or Bb5, 0-0, and d3 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}}. Alternative lines for White include the unusual 3.Nb1!?, with which van Geet once drew [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]], and, after 3.Nce2, playing a sort of [[King's Indian Attack]] with d3, g3, Bg2, f4, Nf3, and 0-0 \u2013 a line Keilhack calls the \"Lizard Attack\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=125}}.\n\nThe fifth alternative, 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4, leads to more open play. After 3.Nxe4, Black has a number of playable moves, including 3...e5, 3...Nc6, 3...Bf5, 3...Nd7, 3...Nf6, and even 3...Qd5!?, when 4.Nc3 transposes to the [[Scandinavian Defense]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=131, 144, 146, 158, 172, 176}}. After 3...e5, White's thematic move is 4.Bc4, when several of Black's plausible moves lead to disaster, e.g. 4...Be7? 5.Qh5! and White wins at least a pawn after 5...g6 6.Qxe5 or 5...Nh6 6.d3; or 4...Nf6? 5.Ng5! Nd5 and now 6.d4!, 6.Qf3!, and 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qf3+ are all possible, with positions similar to the line of the [[Two Knights Defense]] beginning 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5?! {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=133\u201334}}. However, 3...e5 4.Bc4 Nc6! is playable {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=135\u201343}}.\n\nInternational Master Richard Palliser, in his 2006 book ''Beating Unusual Chess Openings'', recommends 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nxe4 Nd7 for Black. He explains, \"Black doesn't attempt to refute White's opening or to gain lots of space (as with 2...d4), but simply settles for sensible development. The position should be compared to both a [[Caro-Kann Defense]] and a French Rubinstein. Black will hope to demonstrate that he has gained from the omission of an early ...c6 or ...e6, while White will generally omit d4, preferring a setup with Bc4 and d3\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=143}}. After 4.Bc4, the natural move 4...Ngf6!? leads to very sharp and unclear play if White responds with 5.Bxf7+!? Kxf7 6.Ng5+ Kg8 7.Ne6 Qe8 8.Nxc7 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=158\u201363}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201346}}. More solid is 4...e6 (\"!\" \u2013 Keilhack) {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=164\u201370}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201348}}.\n\n===1...c5===\n1...c5 is often played by devotees of the [[Sicilian Defence]], into which the game often transposes, either immediately after 2.e4 or at a later point.  Alternatively, White can remain in independent 1.Nc3 lines, at least for the time being, with 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4, which gives Black a large choice of possible responses. One line Palliser recommends for Black is 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 (3.e4 transposes to a Sicilian) cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5!? (seizing the center) 5.Bg5 Nbd7! 6.e4 (more critical than the passive 6.e3?!) dxe4 7.Qe2 e6!? 8.0-0-0 Be7 9.Nxe4 0-0 when \"White doesn't appear to have any advantage\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=154\u201356}}.\n\nIf White chooses to transpose to standard Sicilian lines, the fact that his knight is committed to c3 may be a disadvantage in certain lines. The Closed Sicilian, commonly reached by 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, without an early d4 by White, gives Black few [[chess theory|theoretical difficulties]] {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=346}}. If White instead chooses to play an Open Sicilian with 2.e4 and 3.Nf3 or Nge2, followed by d4, the knight's placement on c3 prevents White from playing the [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] with c4. This makes the [[Sicilian Defence, Accelerated Dragon|Accelerated Dragon Variation]] with 2...Nc6 and 3...g6 particularly attractive {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|p=146}}. Black may also stop White's intended d4 by playing an early ...e5, e.g. 1.Nc3 c5 2.e4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=151\u201355}} or 3.Nge2 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=148\u201351}}.\n\n===1...Nf6===\n[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Larry Kaufman]] recommends 1...Nf6, intending to meet 2.e4 with 2...e5 or 2.d4 with 2...d5 {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|p=484}}. Keilhack writes that \"1...Nf6 is one of the most unpleasant replies for the 1.Nc3 player. Black keeps all options open, he can choose between a central (...d5, possibly followed by ...c5) and an Indian (...g6, ...Bg7) setup. ... Among the many possible [second] moves [for White], none really stands out.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=338}}. The most straightforward moves for White are 2.d4 and 2.e4, but neither promises White a significant advantage. After 2.d4, 2...d5 leads to the [[Richter-Veresov Attack]] (3.Bg5) or another type of [[Queen's Pawn Game]] where White, having blocked his c-pawn, has little chance for advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. After 2.e4, Black can again play 2...d5 with a type of Alekhine's Defense; or 2...d6 3.d4 g6 with a [[Pirc Defense]] or 3...e5 with a [[Philidor's Defense]]. The most solid response to 2.e4 is 2...e5, leading to a [[Vienna Game]] or, after 3.Nf3 Nc6, to a [[Four Knights Game]]\u2014neither of which offers White an appreciable advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=364\u201365}} {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=121}}. Keilhack also analyzes a number of offbeat possibilities, including 2.b3, 2.Nf3, 2.f4 (an unusual form of [[Bird's Opening]] that Keilhack calls the \"Aasum System\"), 2.g3, and even the gambit 2.g4?! Palliser writes that none of the alternatives to 2.e4 \"really convince or should greatly trouble Black over the board\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=142}}.\n\n===1...e5===\nThis natural move is playable, but dangerous if Black does not know what he is doing. One of the main lines is 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4, with poor chances for Black, continued by 3...exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Bg5. Keilhack writes that this variation \"occurs rather often and offers excellent chances for an early knockout\" by White and that \"only two [moves] (5...Bb4 and 5...Bc5) do not immediately ruin Black's game\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=26}}. (See, e.g., the Dunst\u2013Gresser game given below.)\n\n==Transpositions to other openings==\nThe move 1.Nc3 is considered an [[Irregular openings (chess)|irregular opening]], so it is classified under the A00 code in the [[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]] (also see [[List of chess openings]]).  [[Transposition (chess)|Transpositions]] to more common openings are possible, many of which are discussed in the preceding section.  In addition, 1.Nc3 d5 2.e4 reaches a position in the Scandinavian Defense; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.e4 leads to a [[Four Knights Game|Scotch Four Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.e4 Bc5 or 3...g6 gives a [[Three Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 Nc6 2.d4 d5 3.e4, or 2...e5 and now 3.d5 Nce7 4.e4 or 3.dxe5 Nxe5 4.e4, yields a [[Nimzowitsch Defense]]; and 1.Nc3 b6 2.e4 Bb7 3.d4 is an [[Owen's Defense]]. Transposition to a [[Dutch Defense]] is also possible after 1.Nc3 f5 2.d4, but Keilhack considers 2.e4! more dangerous, intending 2...fxe4 3.d3, a reversed [[From's Gambit]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=369\u201370}}. Black alternatives to 2...fxe4 include 2...d6, when 3.d4 transposes to the [[Balogh Defense]]; and 2...e5?!, when 3.Nf3 produces a [[Latvian Gambit]], but 3.exf5!, as in a game between [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Sam Loyd]], may be stronger.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1228240 Steinitz\u2013Loyd, London 1867]</ref>\n\n==Sample games==\n*Here is a quick victory by Dunst himself against nine-time U.S. Women's Champion [[Gisela Gresser]].

[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. Nc3|Nc3]] \nThis fairly uncommon opening may have more names than any other:  it is also called the '''Heinrichsen Opening''', '''Baltic Opening''', '''Van Geet Opening''', '''Sleipnir Opening''', '''Kotr\u010d's Opening''', '''Me\u0161trovi\u0107 Opening''', '''Romanian Opening''', '''Queen's Knight Attack''', '''Queen's Knight Opening''', '''Millard's Opening''', '''Knight on the Left''', and (in German) '''der Linksspringer'''.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}\n\n==Origin of names==\nThe names Heinrichsen and Baltic derive from [[Lithuania]]n chess player Arved Heinrichsen (1876&ndash;1900).  The opening was analyzed and played by the [[New York (state)|New York]] master Ted A. Dunst (April 11, 1907 [[New York City]] &ndash; December 18, 1985 [[Lambertville, New Jersey]]), giving the opening its most popular name in the United States.  The Dutch [[International Master]] and [[correspondence chess|correspondence]] [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Dirk Daniel (\"Dick D.\") van Geet (March 1, 1932 \u2013 April 29, 2012) frequently played 1.Nc3, so it is often called the Van Geet Opening in the [[Netherlands]].  The appellation [[Sleipnir]] seems to come from [[Germany]].  Sleipnir is [[Odin]]'s (''Wotan'' in German) magical eight-legged horse, and chess [[knight (chess)|knights]] are horses with up to eight different possible moves each turn. [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] Jan Kotr\u010d (1862\u20131943), editor and publisher of the magazine ''\u010cesk\u00e9 Listy'', said the opening was analyzed by [[England|English]] players. Zvonimir Me\u0161trovi\u0107 (b. October 17, 1944) is a [[Slovenia]]n International Master who often adopts this opening. [[Tim Harding (chess)|Tim Harding]] refers to it as the \"Queen's Knight Attack\" {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=8}}. [[Chess master|National Master]] [[Hugh Myers]] called it \"Millard's Opening\" after Henry Millard (1824\u201391), a blind [[correspondence chess]] player who drew with the opening in a [[List of chess terms#Simultaneous exhibition|simultaneous exhibition]] against [[Joseph Henry Blackburne]]. Blackburne later played the opening himself against [[Josef Noa]] in the London 1883 international chess tournament {{harvcol|Myers|2002|pp=24\u201325}}.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1001989 Blackburne\u2013Noa, London 1883]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref> The German [[FIDE Master]] Harald Keilhack in his 2005 book on the opening states that it has also been referred to as the Romanian Defense, and that he prefers the neutral appellation \"Der Linksspringer\" or, in English, \"the Knight on the Left\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=7}}.\n\n==General remarks==\nThe opening move 1.Nc3 develops the [[knight (chess)|knight]] to a good square where it attacks the central e4 and d5 squares.  Although quite playable, 1.Nc3 is rarely seen; it is only the eighth most popular of the 20 possible first moves, behind 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.g3, 1.f4, and 1.b3. As of February 6, 2009, out of the over 500,000 games in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, only 644&mdash;about 1 out of every 780&mdash;begins with 1.Nc3.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\">[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/explorer Opening Explorer]. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-02-06.</ref>  The third-ranking 1.Nf3 is 66 times as popular.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> Some very strong [[correspondence chess]] players employ 1.Nc3 frequently, and it is occasionally seen over-the-board.\n\nThe reasons for 1.Nc3's lack of popularity are that it does not stop Black from occupying the center (while 1.Nf3 prevents 1...e5, 1.Nc3 does not prevent 1...d5 because the d-pawn is guarded by the queen), and it blocks White's c-pawn from moving, thus making it impossible to play c3 or c4 (which are often desirable moves) without moving the knight first. In addition, after 1...d5, the knight's position is unstable because Black may attack it with ...d4. Although 1.Nc3 develops a piece to a good square (unlike 1.Na3 or 1.Nh3), and does not weaken White's position (unlike, e.g., 1.g4 or 1.f3) or waste time (unlike, e.g., 1. c3), the above-stated drawbacks make it an inferior way of attempting to exploit White's [[First-move advantage in chess|first-move advantage]]. Of the 644 games with 1.Nc3 in [[ChessGames.com]]'s database, White won 34.8%, drew 23.9%, and lost 41.3%, for a total winning percentage of only 46.75%.<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/><ref>White's overall winning percentage is derived by taking the percentage of games won by White and adding half of the percentage of drawn games, in this case 34.8 plus half of 23.9.</ref> White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%).<ref name=\"Opening Explorermove0\"/> However, as of October 2018, for the 38,043 games with 1.Nc3 in [[Lichess.org]]'s database, White has a total winning percentage of 57.25% (55% won, 5% drawn, 40% lost), although it is still only the tenth most popular first move for White.\n\n==Possible continuations==\n\n===1...d5===\nThis is one of Black's best replies, occupying the center and underscoring the unsettled position of White's knight. White can prevent 2...d4 by playing 2.d4 himself, but he then obtains a somewhat inflexible position in the [[Queen's Pawn Game]] with his knight blocking the c-pawn {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. Also possible is 2.Nf3 (and if 2...d4, 3.Ne4), a sort of [[Black Knights' Tango]] with an extra move {{harvcol|Harding|1974|p=10}}. A third line is 2.e3, which Keilhack calls \"the M\u00fcller game,\" when White hopes for 2...e5 (other moves are also playable, of course) 3.Qh5!?, e.g. 3...Nc6 4.Bb5 Qd6 5.d4 exd4 6.exd4 Nf6 7.Qe5+! Be6?! (Keilhack recommends 7...Kd8!! 8.Bxc6 bxc6 9.Nf3 Bg4) 8.Bf4 0-0-0 9.Bxc6 Qxc6? 10.Nb5!, when White wins at least a pawn {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=307\u201311}}.\n\nWhite's most common response to 1...d5 is 2.e4. This is the same position as 1.e4 d5 2.Nc3, an obscure branch of the [[Scandinavian Defense#Alternatives to 2.exd5|Scandinavian Defense]]. Black has five plausible responses to 2.e4: 2...e6 and 2...c6 transpose to the [[French Defence|French]] and [[Caro-Kann Defense|Caro\u2013Kann]] Defenses, and 2...Nf6 to a variation of [[Alekhine's Defence]]. The move 2...d4 gives Black a [[List of chess terms#Spatial advantage|spatial advantage]], which White may work to undermine along the lines of [[hypermodernism (chess)|hypermodernism]]. Keilhack writes, \"2...d4 is chosen either by somewhat naive players who are attracted by the fact that Black wins time and space ... or by strong players who are aware of the strategic risks but are striving for a complex battle.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}} He considers the Van Geet Attack, 2...d4 3.Nce2 followed by Ng3, to be \"the core of the 1.Nc3 opening,\" \"a fully independent entity which strives for early knight activity on the kingside,\" usually with Ng3, Nf3, Bc4 or Bb5, 0-0, and d3 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=44}}. Alternative lines for White include the unusual 3.Nb1!?, with which van Geet once drew [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]], and, after 3.Nce2, playing a sort of [[King's Indian Attack]] with d3, g3, Bg2, f4, Nf3, and 0-0 \u2013 a line Keilhack calls the \"Lizard Attack\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=125}}.\n\nThe fifth alternative, 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4, leads to more open play. After 3.Nxe4, Black has a number of playable moves, including 3...e5, 3...Nc6, 3...Bf5, 3...Nd7, 3...Nf6, and even 3...Qd5!?, when 4.Nc3 transposes to the [[Scandinavian Defense]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=131, 144, 146, 158, 172, 176}}. After 3...e5, White's thematic move is 4.Bc4, when several of Black's plausible moves lead to disaster, e.g. 4...Be7? 5.Qh5! and White wins at least a pawn after 5...g6 6.Qxe5 or 5...Nh6 6.d3; or 4...Nf6? 5.Ng5! Nd5 and now 6.d4!, 6.Qf3!, and 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qf3+ are all possible, with positions similar to the line of the [[Two Knights Defense]] beginning 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5?! {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=133\u201334}}. However, 3...e5 4.Bc4 Nc6! is playable {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=135\u201343}}.\n\nInternational Master Richard Palliser, in his 2006 book ''Beating Unusual Chess Openings'', recommends 1...d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.Nxe4 Nd7 for Black. He explains, \"Black doesn't attempt to refute White's opening or to gain lots of space (as with 2...d4), but simply settles for sensible development. The position should be compared to both a [[Caro-Kann Defense]] and a French Rubinstein. Black will hope to demonstrate that he has gained from the omission of an early ...c6 or ...e6, while White will generally omit d4, preferring a setup with Bc4 and d3\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=143}}. After 4.Bc4, the natural move 4...Ngf6!? leads to very sharp and unclear play if White responds with 5.Bxf7+!? Kxf7 6.Ng5+ Kg8 7.Ne6 Qe8 8.Nxc7 {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=158\u201363}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201346}}. More solid is 4...e6 (\"!\" \u2013 Keilhack) {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=164\u201370}} {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=144\u201348}}.\n\n===1...c5===\n1...c5 is often played by devotees of the [[Sicilian Defence]], into which the game often transposes, either immediately after 2.e4 or at a later point.  Alternatively, White can remain in independent 1.Nc3 lines, at least for the time being, with 2.Nf3 followed by 3.d4, which gives Black a large choice of possible responses. One line Palliser recommends for Black is 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 (3.e4 transposes to a Sicilian) cxd4 4.Nxd4 d5!? (seizing the center) 5.Bg5 Nbd7! 6.e4 (more critical than the passive 6.e3?!) dxe4 7.Qe2 e6!? 8.0-0-0 Be7 9.Nxe4 0-0 when \"White doesn't appear to have any advantage\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|pp=154\u201356}}.\n\nIf White chooses to transpose to standard Sicilian lines, the fact that his knight is committed to c3 may be a disadvantage in certain lines. The Closed Sicilian, commonly reached by 1.e4 c5 2.Nc3, without an early d4 by White, gives Black few [[chess theory|theoretical difficulties]] {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=346}}. If White instead chooses to play an Open Sicilian with 2.e4 and 3.Nf3 or Nge2, followed by d4, the knight's placement on c3 prevents White from playing the [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] with c4. This makes the [[Sicilian Defence, Accelerated Dragon|Accelerated Dragon Variation]] with 2...Nc6 and 3...g6 particularly attractive {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|p=146}}. Black may also stop White's intended d4 by playing an early ...e5, e.g. 1.Nc3 c5 2.e4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=151\u201355}} or 3.Nge2 e5 {{harvcol|Gallagher|1994|pp=148\u201351}}.\n\n===1...Nf6===\n[[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] [[Larry Kaufman]] recommends 1...Nf6, intending to meet 2.e4 with 2...e5 or 2.d4 with 2...d5 {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|p=484}}. Keilhack writes that \"1...Nf6 is one of the most unpleasant replies for the 1.Nc3 player. Black keeps all options open, he can choose between a central (...d5, possibly followed by ...c5) and an Indian (...g6, ...Bg7) setup. ... Among the many possible [second] moves [for White], none really stands out.\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=338}}. The most straightforward moves for White are 2.d4 and 2.e4, but neither promises White a significant advantage. After 2.d4, 2...d5 leads to the [[Richter-Veresov Attack]] (3.Bg5) or another type of [[Queen's Pawn Game]] where White, having blocked his c-pawn, has little chance for advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=469, 473}}. After 2.e4, Black can again play 2...d5 with a type of Alekhine's Defense; or 2...d6 3.d4 g6 with a [[Pirc Defense]] or 3...e5 with a [[Philidor's Defense]]. The most solid response to 2.e4 is 2...e5, leading to a [[Vienna Game]] or, after 3.Nf3 Nc6, to a [[Four Knights Game]]\u2014neither of which offers White an appreciable advantage {{harvcol|Kaufman|2004|pp=364\u201365}} {{harvcol|de Firmian|2008|p=121}}. Keilhack also analyzes a number of offbeat possibilities, including 2.b3, 2.Nf3, 2.f4 (an unusual form of [[Bird's Opening]] that Keilhack calls the \"Aasum System\"), 2.g3, and even the gambit 2.g4?! Palliser writes that none of the alternatives to 2.e4 \"really convince or should greatly trouble Black over the board\" {{harvcol|Palliser|2006|p=142}}.\n\n===1...e5===\nThis natural move is playable, but dangerous if Black does not know what he is doing. One of the main lines is 1...e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4, with poor chances for Black, continued by 3...exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Bg5. Keilhack writes that this variation \"occurs rather often and offers excellent chances for an early knockout\" by White and that \"only two [moves] (5...Bb4 and 5...Bc5) do not immediately ruin Black's game\" {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|p=26}}. (See, e.g., the Dunst\u2013Gresser game given below.)\n\n==Transpositions to other openings==\nThe move 1.Nc3 is considered an [[Irregular openings (chess)|irregular opening]], so it is classified under the A00 code in the [[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]] (also see [[List of chess openings]]).  [[Transposition (chess)|Transpositions]] to more common openings are possible, many of which are discussed in the preceding section.  In addition, 1.Nc3 d5 2.e4 reaches a position in the Scandinavian Defense; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.e4 leads to a [[Four Knights Game|Scotch Four Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.e4 Bc5 or 3...g6 gives a [[Three Knights Game]]; 1.Nc3 Nc6 2.d4 d5 3.e4, or 2...e5 and now 3.d5 Nce7 4.e4 or 3.dxe5 Nxe5 4.e4, yields a [[Nimzowitsch Defense]]; and 1.Nc3 b6 2.e4 Bb7 3.d4 is an [[Owen's Defense]]. Transposition to a [[Dutch Defense]] is also possible after 1.Nc3 f5 2.d4, but Keilhack considers 2.e4! more dangerous, intending 2...fxe4 3.d3, a reversed [[From's Gambit]] {{harvcol|Keilhack|2005|pp=369\u201370}}. Black alternatives to 2...fxe4 include 2...d6, when 3.d4 transposes to the [[Balogh Defense]]; and 2...e5?!, when 3.Nf3 produces a [[Latvian Gambit]], but 3.exf5!, as in a game between [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Sam Loyd]], may be stronger.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1228240 Steinitz\u2013Loyd, London 1867]</ref>\n\n==Sample games==\n*Here is a quick victory by Dunst himself against nine-time U.S. Women's Champion [[Gisela Gresser]]. It illustrates the problems that White's rapid development can pose if Black is not careful:\n:Dunst\u2013Gresser, New York 1950 <br />'''1. Nc3 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Bg5 d5?'''

Be7 7. Bb5 Bd7 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Nxd5 Bxg5 10. Qe2+ Ne7?''' (Losing at once. 10...Be7 11.0-0-0 is also very awkward. Although it's unpleasant, Black should have tried 10...Kf8.) '''11. Qe5! Bxb5?'''

John is described as wearing clothes of camel's hair, living on [[locust]]s and wild [[honey]]. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\n\nJesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how, as he emerges from the water, the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him 'like a dove'. A voice from heaven then says, \"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.\" ({{bibleref2|Mark|1:11|NRSV}})\n\nLater in the gospel there is an account of John's death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch [[Herod Antipas]], hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying [[Herodias]], the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who 'liked to listen' to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a 'righteous and holy man'.\n\nThe account then describes how Herod's daughter Herodias ([[NRSV]]; other translations refer to the girl as the ''daughter of Herodias'') dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John's disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.({{bibleref2|Mark|6:17\u201329|NRSV}})\n\nThere are a number of difficulties with this passage.

And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nIn those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n;Death of John (Mark 6)\n\nKing Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" But others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And others said, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.\n\nBut an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.\" And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.\" And she went out and said to her mother, \"For what should I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the Baptist.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n\"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\nThen Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\" But Jesus answered him, \"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Matthew 11)\n\nNow when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\nAs they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way before you.'\n\nTruly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n\"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,\n\n\"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;\nwe sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'\n\nFor John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\"\n\n; Death of John (Matthew 14)\n\nAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because John had been saying to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.

His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.\n\nOne day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. But the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, 'to reconcile fathers to their children' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.\"\n\n\"How can I be sure of this?\" Zechariah asked the angel. \"For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.\"\n\n\"I am Gabriel,\" the angel answered, \"who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said, \"he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.\"\n\nSix months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: \"You have been shown great favor \u2013 the Lord is with you.\"\n\nMary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, when the angel spoke again: \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. The child will be great and will be called 'Son of the Most High,' and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n\n\"How can this be?\" Mary asked the angel. \"For I have no husband.\"\n\n\"The Holy Spirit will descend on you,\" answered the angel, \"and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called 'holy,' and 'Son of God.' And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"I am the servant of the Lord,\" exclaimed Mary; \"let it be with me as you have said.\" Then the angel left her.\n\nSoon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; and there she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried aloud: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child! But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.\"\n\nAnd Mary said:\n\n\"My soul exalts the Lord,\nmy spirit delights in God my Savior;\nfor he has remembered his humble servant girl;\nAnd from this hour all ages will count me happy!\n\nGreat things has the Almighty done for me;\nAnd holy is his name.\nFrom age to age his mercy rests\nOn those who honor him.\n\nMighty are the deeds of his arm;\nHe scatters the proud with their own devices,\nhe casts down princes from their thrones,\nand the humble he uplifts,\nthe hungry he loads with gifts,\nand the rich he sends empty away.\n\nHe has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,\nEver mindful of his mercy\n(As he promised to our forefathers)\nFor Abraham and his race for ever.\"\n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him 'Zechariah' after his father, when his mother spoke up: \"No, he is to be called John.\"\n\n\"You have no relation of that name!\" they exclaimed; and they made signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words \u2013 'His name is John.' Everyone was surprised; and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about; and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another \u2013 \"What can this child be destined to become?\" For the Power of the Lord was with him.\n\nThen his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:\n\n\"Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,\nWho has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,\nand has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation\nIn the house of his servant David \u2013\n\nAs he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old \u2013\nsalvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,\nshowing mercy to our forefathers,\nAnd mindful of his sacred covenant.\n\nThis was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham \u2013\nThat we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,\nand should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,\nIn his presence all our days.\n\nAnd you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,\nFor you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,\nto give his people the knowledge of salvation\nIn the forgiveness of their sins,\n\nthrough the tender mercy of our God,\nWhereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,\nto give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,\nAnd guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\nThe child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.\n\n; John and his baptism of Jesus, Imprisonment of John (Luke 3)\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene, and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah \u2013\n\n'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:\n\"Make ready the way of the Lord,\nMake his paths straight.\nEvery chasm will be filled,\nEvery mountain and hill will be leveled,\nThe winding ways will be straightened,\nThe rough roads made smooth,\nand everyone will see the salvation of God.\"'\n\nAnd John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: \"You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves 'Abraham is our ancestor,' for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n\"What are we to do then?\" the people asked. \"Let anyone who has two coats,\" answered John, \"share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.\"\n\nEven tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: \"Teacher, what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,\" John answered. And when some soldiers on active service asked \"And we \u2013 what are we to do?\" he said: \"Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.\"\n\nThen, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ, John, addressing them all, said: \"I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.\"\n\nAnd so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people. But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,  crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,  and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice \u2013 \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.\"\n\n; John's disciples and fast (Luke 5:33)\n\"John's disciples,\" they said to Jesus, \"Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Luke 7)\nAll these events were reported to John by his disciples. So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask \u2013 \"Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for some one else?\"\n\nWhen these men found Jesus, they said: \"John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask \u2013 'Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for somebody else?'\" At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. So his answer to the question was: \"Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard \u2013 the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.\"\n\nWhen John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. This is the man of whom scripture says \u2013\n\n'I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\nand he will prepare your way before you.'\n\nThere is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\"\n\n(All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John's baptism, acknowledged the justice of God. But the Pharisees and the students of the law, having rejected John's baptism, frustrated God's purpose in regard to them.)\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===In the Gospel of John===\nThe fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as \"a man sent from God\" who \"was not the light\", but \"came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:6\u20138|NKJV}}</ref> John clearly denies being the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet', instead describing himself as the \"voice of one crying in the wilderness\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:23|NKJV}}, compare {{bibleverse||Isaiah|40:3|NKJV}}</ref>\n\nUpon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the \"testifier and confessor ''par excellence''\", particularly when compared to figures like [[Nicodemus]].<ref>{{citation|last=Vande Vrede|first=Keith|title=A Contrast Between Nicodemus and John the Baptist in the Gospel of John|volume=57|date=December 2014|pages=715\u201326|editor-last=Kostenberger|editor-first=Andreas|journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|issue=4|issn=0360-8808|editor-link=Andreas J.

Unlike the other gospels, it is John himself who testifies to seeing \"the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him\". John explicitly announces that Jesus is the one \"who baptizes with the Holy Spirit\" and John even professes a \"belief that he is the Son of God\" and \"the Lamb of God\".\n\nThe Gospel of John reports that Jesus' disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification.<ref>{{bibleref2|John|3:22\u201336|9}}</ref> In this debate John argued that Jesus \"must become greater,\" while he (John) \"must become less\"<ref>{{bibleref2|John|3:30|31}}</ref> ([[Latin]] [[Vulgate]]: {{bibleref2|Ioannes|3:30|VULGATE|''illum oportet crescere me autem minui''}}).\n\nThe Gospel of John then points out that Jesus' disciples were baptizing more people than John.<ref>{{bibleref2|John|4:2}}</ref> Later, the Gospel relates that Jesus regarded John as \"a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light\".<ref>{{bibleref2|John|5:35|ESV}}</ref>\n\n{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel of John}}\n; John 1\nThere appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; he came as a witness \u2013 to bear witness to the light so that through him everyone might believe. He was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.\n\nWhen the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John \u2013 \"Who are you?\", he told them clearly and simply: \"I am not the Christ.\"\n\n\"What then?\" they asked. \"Are you Elijah?\"\n\"No,\" he said, \"I am not.\"\n\"Are you 'the prophet'?\" He answered, \"No.\"\n\"Who then are you?\" they continued; \"tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?\"\n\"I,\" he answered, \"am \u2013 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness \u2013 \"make a straight road for the Lord\"', as the prophet Isaiah said.\"\nThese men had been sent from the Pharisees; and their next question was: \"Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet'?\" John's answer was \u2013 \"I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.\" This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\nThe next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: \"Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! I was taking about him when I said 'After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.' I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.\"\n\nJohn also said: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him \u2013 he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.\" The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: \"There is the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.\n\n; John 3\nJohn, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. (For John had not yet been imprisoned). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of 'purification;' and the disciples came to John and said: \"Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony \u2013 he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.\" John's answer was \u2013 \"A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. You are yourselves witnesses that I said 'I am not the Christ,' but 'I have been sent before him as a messenger.' It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom's voice. This joy I have felt to the full. He must become greater, and I less.\"\n\nHe who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God's own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under 'God's displeasure.'\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===Comparative analysis===\nSimon J. Joseph has argued that the Gospel demotes the historical John by painting him only as a prophetic forerunner to Jesus whereas his ministry actually complemented Jesus'.<ref name=\"Joseph2012\">{{cite book|author=Simon J.

(Matthew and Luke drop the first part of the reference.)<ref name=\"Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31\">Carl R. Kazmierski, ''John the Baptist: Prophet and Evangelist'' (Liturgical Press, 1996) p. 31.</ref>\n\n; Baptism of Jesus\n\nThe gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, Jesus himself sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy\". They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the \"voice came out of heaven\" are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down \"out of heaven\" (John 12:28\u201330, John 1:32).\n\nIn Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead \"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.\"\n\nIn the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus's status.\n\n; John's knowledge of Jesus\n\nJohn's knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\n; John and Elijah\n{{see also|Matthew 3:4}}\nThe Gospels vary in their depiction of John's relationship to [[Elijah]]. Matthew and Mark describe John's attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in [[2 Kings 1:8]], who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is \"Elijah who was to come\" (Matt. 11:14 \u2013 see also Matt. 17:11\u201313); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah's successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah. In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and tells him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|NAB}}).\"\n\n==In Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews''==\nAn account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by [[Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100):<ref>\"Josephus, Flavius.\" In: Cross, F.

Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to [[Machaerus|Macherus]], the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death.

Some have claimed that this passage indicates that John died near the time of the destruction of Herod's army in 36 AD. However, in a different passage, Josephus states that the end of Herod's marriage with Aretas' daughter (after which John was killed) was only the beginning of hostilities between Herod and Aretas, which later escalated into the battle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hoehner|first1=Harold W.|title=Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fS28b9GC1dcC&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780310877103|date=2010-08-10}}</ref>\n\nDivergences between the passage's presentation and the biblical accounts of John include baptism for those whose souls have already been \"purified beforehand by righteousness\" is for purification of the body, not general repentance of sin (Mark 1:4).<ref name=\"bibleverse||Mark|1:4|NRSV\">{{bibleverse||Mark|1:4|NRSV}}</ref> Biblical scholar [[John Dominic Crossan]] differentiates between Josephus's account of John and Jesus, saying, \"John had a monopoly, but Jesus had a franchise.\" To get baptized, Crossan writes, you went only to John; to stop the movement one only needed to stop John (therefore his movement ended with his death). Jesus invited all to come and see how he and his companions had already accepted the government of God, entered it and were living it.

A portion of the rescued relics were carried to [[Jerusalem]], then to [[Alexandria]], where on 27 May 395, they were laid in the [[basilica]] newly dedicated to the Forerunner on the former site of the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|temple of Serapis]]. The tomb at Sebaste continued, nevertheless, to be visited by pious [[pilgrim]]s, and [[Saint Jerome]] bears witness to miracles being worked there.\n\nWhat became of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine.

However, the decapitation cloth of Saint John is kept at the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The Coptic Christian Orthodox Church also claim to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist.

In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:17}} the role of John is referred to as being \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:76}} as \"thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\" and in {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:77}} as being \"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.\"\n\nThere are several passages within the [[Old Testament]] which are interpreted by Christians as being [[prophecy|prophetic]] of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the [[Book of Malachi]] ({{Bibleref2|Malachi 3:1}}) that refers to a prophet who would ''prepare the way of the Lord'':\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.|Malachi 3:1<ref>{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:1|NRSV}}</ref>}}\n\nand also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5\u20136 where it says,\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.}}\n\nThe Jews of Jesus' day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; indeed, some present day Jews continue to await Elijah's coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the [[Passover Seder]]. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew 17:10}}, \"Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?\" The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,\n\n{{quote|Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\" Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.|Matthew 17:11\u201313}} (see also 11:14: \"...if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who was to come.\")\n\nThese passages are applied to John in the [[Synoptic Gospels]].<ref>Mat 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\n</ref><ref>Mar 1:2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. Mar 1:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</ref><ref>Luk 1:16\u201317 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</ref> But where Matthew specifically identifies John the Baptist as Elijah's spiritual successor ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 11.14, 17.13}}), the gospels of Mark and Luke are silent on the matter. The [[Gospel of John]] states that John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.\n\n{{quote|Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not deny, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ.\" They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\"|John 1:19\u201321}}\n\n====Influence on Paul====\nMany scholars believe there was contact between the early church in the [[Apostolic Age]] and what is called the \"[[Qumran]]-[[Essene]] community\".<ref name=EDSS>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-508450-4| title = Paul, Letters of| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls| date = 2008| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780195084504.001.0001}}{{subscription|[[OUP]]}}</ref> The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were found at Qumran, which the majority of historians and archaeologists identify as an Essene settlement.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-506512-1| title = Essenes | encyclopedia = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East| date = 2011| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780195065121.001.0001}}{{subscription|[[OUP]]}}</ref> John the Baptist is thought to have been either an Essene or \"associated\" with the community at Khirbet Qumran.

According to this belief, John was \"ordained by the angel of God\" when he was eight days old \"to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews\" and to prepare a people for the Lord. Latter-day Saints also believe that \"he was baptized while yet in his childhood.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 84:27\u201328|publisher=churchofjesuschrist.org|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Smith]] said: \"Let us come into New Testament times \u2013 so many are ever praising the Lord and His apostles.

In particular, John should have done everything in his power to persuade the Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah. He was to become Jesus' main disciple and John's disciples were to become Jesus' disciples. Unfortunately John didn't follow Jesus and continued his own way of baptizing people. Moreover, John also denied that he was Elijah when queried by several Jewish leaders {{bibleverse||John|1:21|NKJV}} contradicting Jesus who stated John is Elijah who was to come, {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|NKJV}}. Many Jews therefore, could not accept Jesus as the Messiah because John denied being Elijah, as the prophet's appearance was a prerequisite for the Messiah's arrival as stated in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:5|NKJV}}. According to the Unification Church, \"John the Baptist was in the position of representing Elijah's physical body, making himself identical with Elijah from the standpoint of their mission.\"\n\nJesus stated in {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:11|NKJV}}, \"there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist,\" however, in referring to John's blocking the way of the Jews' understanding of himself as the Messiah, said \"yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\" John's failure to follow Jesus became the chief obstacle to the fulfillment of Jesus' mission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unification.net/dp96/dp96-1-4.html |title=Exposition of the Divine Principle, 1996 Translation, Chapter 4|publisher=unification.net |accessdate=July 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.unification.net/dp73/dp73-1-4.html#1 Divine Principle, Part I Chapter 4; Advent of the Messiah]</ref><ref>5.

After John's death, Jesus' followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, \"countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead.\" Moss also references the incident in Matthew 16 where  disciples present before Jesus indicated some people believed he was John the Baptist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/were-jesus-and-john-the-baptist-competitors-finding-jesus-professor-describes-their-relationship.html|title=Were Jesus and John the Baptist Competitors?

Crosby, PhD, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA; Capuchin friar and priest; in his paper \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?,\" stated there was \"no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus.\" He conveys that John's concept of what a messiah should be, was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus. Crosby identifies twenty-five points in the Gospel accounts that lead to the conclusion that John's effectiveness as a \"precursor\" in encouraging others to follow Jesus was very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers having become Jesus\u2019 disciples. Crosby noted that while many others believed Jesus' miracles, there is no record of these \"signs\" convincing John, who continued a separate baptismal ministry, creating disciples resulting in a community that still exists in parts of the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/disciples-st-john-baptist-under-attack-2013121593050127653.html|title=Disciples of St John the Baptist under attack|first=Karlos|last=Zurutuza|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>\n\nCrosby stated \"an unbiased reading about John the Baptist \"leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus\u2019 messiahship.\"<ref>Crosby, Michael H.   \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?\"; Biblical Theology Bulletin, Volume 38 Nov, 2008; p158 -162 [http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120111755/http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf |date=2018-11-20 }}</ref>\n\nRobert L. Deffinbaugh, graduate from Dallas Theological Seminary pastor/teacher and elder at Community Bible Chapel in Richardson, Texas, wrote a paper \"John's Problem with Jesus ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:18\u201335|NET}}).\" Deffinbaugh comments of the difficulty of a more through examination of John because of the inclination to think of him in only positive terms.  He notes his  past piety, humility and encouraging some of his disciples to follow Jesus instead. While he was \"a great man,\" Deffinbaugh also writes John \"is not a perfect man,\" and discusses what he calls \"the worst moment of John\u2019s life, so far as the biblical record is concerned.\" He examines the incident where an imprisoned John the Baptist, after receiving news about Jesus, sends two of his disciples asking Jesus if he were the Messiah or another should be sought.\n\nJohn is not asking an incidental question, writes Deffinbaugh, but instead is issuing a public challenge precipitating a crises since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd. The implication was, if Jesus failed to answer the question satisfactorily \"we will look for someone else to be the Messiah.\" Deffinbaugh conveys John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was implementing, as John had previously warned that \"Messiah would come with fire.\" Jesus answered the question by evidence of his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity, \"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.\" ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:22|NET}}).<ref>https://bible.org/seriespage/22-johns-problem-jesus-luke-718-35  June 22, 2004</ref>\n\n==In art==\n\n[[File:Puvis de Chavannes, Pierre-C\u00e9cile - The Beheading of St John the Baptist - c. 1869.jpg|thumb|left|[[Puvis de Chavannes]], ''The Beheading of St John the Baptist'', c. 1869]]\n[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1849\u201350]]\n[[File:Baptism-christ.jpg|thumb|left|''The Baptism of Jesus Christ'', by Piero della Francesca, 1449]]\n[[File:Fondazione Querini Stampalia - San Giovanni Battista (1674-81) - Michele Fabris.jpg|thumb|left|''John the Baptist'' by  Michele Fabris<br>[[Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia]]]]\n[[File:San juan Wood Sculture By Santiago Martinez.jpg|thumb|right|Wood sculpture of John the Baptist's head by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], 1942]]\n[[File:Allori C San Giovanni.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cristofano Allori]]'s ''John the Baptist in the desert'']]\n\nThe [[beheading of Saint John the Baptist]] is a standard theme in Christian art,<ref name=\"World History\">Wetterau, Bruce.

Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus. In [[Byzantine art]] the composition of the ''[[Deesis]]'' came to be included in every [[Eastern Orthodox]] church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the [[Theotokos]] (Mary) flank a [[Christ Pantocrator]] and intercede for humanity; in many ways this is the equivalent of Western [[Crucifixion]]s on [[rood]]s and elsewhere, where [[John the Evangelist]] takes the place of John the Baptist (except in the idiosyncratic ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]''). John the Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, or where the donor patron was named for him or there was some other connection of patronage \u2013 John was the patron saint of [[Florence]], among many other cities, which means he features among the supporting saints in many important works.\n\nA number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the [[predella]] of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably the large series in [[grisaille]] [[fresco]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Chiostro dello Scalzo|it}}, which was [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s largest work, and the frescoed ''Life'' by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] in the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]], both in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by [[Filippo Lippi]] in [[Prato Cathedral]]. These include the typical scenes:<ref>See [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] for further information on these scenes</ref> the ''Annunciation to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]'', John's birth, his naming by his father, the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'', John's departure for the desert, his preaching in the desert, the ''Baptism of Christ'', John before Herod, the dance of [[Salome]], and his beheading.\n\n[[File:'De Gray' Hours (f.24.v) St John the Baptist.jpg|thumb|left|St John the Baptist, from a medieval [[book of hours]]]]\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - St John the Baptist - WGA12723.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1513\u20131516), [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n\nHis birth, which unlike the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late [[Middle Ages]], with depictions by [[Jan van Eyck]] in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown, and by the 15th-century scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular, sometimes, as in an [[engraving]] by [[Israhel van Meckenem]], the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod's court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|title=Engraving by Israhel van Meckenem|publisher=Artsmia.org|accessdate=February 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111185904/http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|archivedate=January 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Salome bearing John's head on a platter equally became a subject for the Northern Renaissance taste for images of glamorous but dangerous women ([[Delilah]], [[Judith]] and others),<ref>On this see Chapter V, \"The Power of Women\", in H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints; National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}</ref> and was often painted by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and engraved by the [[Little Masters]]. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with [[Carlo Dolci]] painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and his successors.\n\nAs a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the 15th century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the ''[[Presentation of Christ]]'', the ''[[Marriage of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Holy Kinship]]''. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s versions of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the [[Madonna and Child]] that included John. [[Raphael]] in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', ''[[La belle jardini\u00e8re]]'', ''[[Aldobrandini Madonna]]'', ''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'', [[Madonna dell'Impannata (Raphael)|''Madonna dell'Impannata'']], which were among his best-known works. John was also often shown by himself as an older child or adolescent, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross \u2013 another theme [[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|influenced by Leonardo]], whose equivocal composition, reintroducing the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael [[Titian]] and [[Guido Reni]] among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes. [[Caravaggio]] painted an especially large number of works including John, from [[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|at least five largely nude youths]] attributed to him, to three late works on his death \u2013 the great ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Execution]]'' in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|one in Madrid]], and [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio, London)|one in London]].\n\n[[File:St John the Baptist Titular Statue of Xewkija Gozo, Malta.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St John carved out of a blackberry tree by [[Pietro Paolo Azzopardi]] \u2013 1845. [[Xewkija]]]]\n\nAmiens cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the 16th century. This stresses the execution and the disposal of the saint's remains.\n\nA remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]]. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and Mary's mother [[Saint Anne|Anne]] in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the 19th century with [[Symbolist]] painters such as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Puvis de Chavannes]] ([[National Gallery, London]]).

In 1521, the island was given its formal name, \"''San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico''\", following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which [[Christopher Columbus]] had originally given the island. The names \"''San Juan Bautista''\" and \"''Puerto Rico''\" were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a [[Cartography|cartographic]] error. By 1746, the city's name (\"''Puerto Rico''\") had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island (\"''San Juan Bautista''\") had become that of the city. The [[List of U.S. state mottos|official motto]] of Puerto Rico also references the saint: ''Joannes Est Nomen Eius'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for \"his name is John\", from Luke 1:63).\n\nHe is also a patron saint of [[French Canada]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The Canadian cities of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] (1497), [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] (1604) and [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Qu\u00e9bec]] were all named in his honor. His feast day of June 24, celebrated officially in [[Quebec]] as the ''[[F\u00eate Nationale du Qu\u00e9bec]]'', and in Newfoundland as [[Discovery Day]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]]. In [[Scotland]], he is the patron saint of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], which used to be known as St. John's Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city's [[Professional sports|professional]] [[football club]] is called [[St Johnstone F.C.]]\n\nAlso, on the night of June 23 on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of [[Porto]], the second largest city in [[Portugal]]. An article from June 2004 in ''[[The Guardian]]'' remarked that \"Porto's [[Festa de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]] is one of Europe's liveliest street festivals, yet it is relatively unknown outside the country\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Matthew Hancock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2004/jun/12/portugal.guardiansaturdaytravelsection|title=There's only one S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o|work=The Guardian|date=June 12, 2004|accessdate=February 14, 2010|location=London}}</ref>\n\nHe is also patron of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] of Jerusalem, [[Malta]], [[Florence]], and [[Genoa]], Italy. John is patron saint of [[Xewkija]], [[Gozo]], Malta, which remember him with a great feast on the Sunday nearest to June 24.\n\n[[Calamba City, Laguna]], [[Calumpit, Bulacan]], [[Balayan, Batangas|Balayan]] and [[Lian, Batangas|Lian]] in [[Batangas (province)|Batangas]], [[Sipocot]] and [[San Fernando, Camarines Sur]], [[Daet, Camarines Norte]] and [[San Juan, Metro Manila]] are among several places in the [[Philippines]] that venerate John as the town or city patron. A common practise of many [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino fiestas]] in his honour is bathing and the dousing of people in memory of John's iconic act. The custom is similar in form to [[Songkran]] and [[Holi]], and serves as a playful respite from the intense tropical heat. While famed for the [[Black Nazarene]] it enshrines, [[Quiapo Church]] in [[Manila]] is actually dedicated to Saint John.\n\nHe is also patron of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston]], which covers the whole of [[South Carolina]] in the [[United States]].\n\nThe [[Baptistines (disambiguation)|Baptistines]] are the name given to a number of [[religious orders]] dedicated to the memory of John the Baptist.\n\nAlong with [[John the Evangelist]], John the Baptist is claimed as a patron saint by the fraternal society of [[Freemasonry|Free and Accepted Masons]] (better known as the Freemasons).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ward.html|title=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|publisher=Freemasons-freemasonry.com|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn many Mediterranean countries, the [[summer solstice]] is dedicated to St. John.

The [[Synoptic Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) describe John baptising Jesus; in the [[Gospel of John]] this is implied in {{bibleverse||John|1:32\u20131:34|NKJV}}.\n\n===In Mark===\n[[File:Brueghel l'Ancien - La Pr\u00e9dication de Saint Jean-Baptiste.jpg|thumb|right|''The Preaching of St. John the Baptist'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], 1566|upright=1.8]]\nThe Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfilment of a prophecy from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (in fact, a conflation of texts from Isaiah, [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]])<ref name=\"Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31\">Carl R. Kazmierski, ''John the Baptist: Prophet and Evangelist'' (Liturgical Press, 1996) p. 31.</ref>  about a messenger being sent ahead, and a voice crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing clothes of camel's hair, living on [[locust]]s and wild [[honey]]. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\n\nJesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how, as he emerges from the water, the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him 'like a dove'. A voice from heaven then says, \"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.\" ({{bibleref2|Mark|1:11|NRSV}})\n\nLater in the gospel there is an account of John's death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch [[Herod Antipas]], hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying [[Herodias]], the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who 'liked to listen' to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a 'righteous and holy man'.\n\nThe account then describes how Herod's daughter Herodias ([[NRSV]]; other translations refer to the girl as the ''daughter of Herodias'') dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John's disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.({{bibleref2|Mark|6:17\u201329|NRSV}})\n\nThere are a number of difficulties with this passage. The Gospel refers to Antipas as 'King'<ref>John R. Donahue, Daniel J.

And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nIn those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n;Death of John (Mark 6)\n\nKing Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" But others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And others said, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.\n\nBut an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.\" And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.\" And she went out and said to her mother, \"For what should I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the Baptist.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n\n([[English Standard Version]])\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===In Matthew===\n[[File:Mattia Preti - San Giovanni Battista Predicazione.jpg|thumb|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'', {{circa|1665}}, by [[Mattia Preti]]]]\nThe Gospel of Matthew account begins with the same modified quotation from Isaiah,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40.3&version=NRSV|title=Isaiah 40.3 NRSV \u2013 A voice cries out: \"In the wilderness |work=Bible Gateway}}</ref> moving the Malachi and Exodus material to later in the text, where it is quoted by Jesus.<ref name=\"Moyise2011\">{{cite book|author=Steve Moyise|title=Jesus and Scripture: Studying the New Testament Use of the Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9PRrvnVdzcC&pg=PA40|date=September 1, 2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3749-1|page=40}}</ref> The description of John is taken directly from Mark (\"clothing of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey\"), along with the proclamation that one was coming who would baptise with the Holy Spirit \"and fire\" ({{bibleref2|Matthew|3:1\u201312|NRSV}}).\n\nUnlike Mark, Matthew describes John as critical of Pharisees and Sadducees and as preaching \"the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" and a \"coming judgment\".\n\nMatthew shortens the account of the beheading of John, and adds two elements: that Herod Antipas wants John dead, and that the death is reported to Jesus by his disciples.<ref name=\"Wink2006\">{{cite book|author=Walter Wink|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWNe6CwgPKwC&pg=PA27|date=November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03130-1|page=27}}</ref> Matthew's approach is to shift the focus away from Herod and onto John as a prototype of Jesus.

Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n\"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\nThen Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\" But Jesus answered him, \"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Matthew 11)\n\nNow when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\nAs they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way before you.'\n\nTruly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n\"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,\n\n\"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;\nwe sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'\n\nFor John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\"\n\n; Death of John (Matthew 14)\n\nAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because John had been saying to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.\n\n(English Standard Version)\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===In Luke and Acts===\n{{Main|Nativity of Saint John the Baptist}}\n[[File:InfantJesus JohnBaptist.JPG|thumb|right|John the Baptist (right) with [[child Jesus]], in the painting ''The Holy Children with a Shell'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo]]]]\n\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] adds an account of John's infancy, introducing him as the miraculous son of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], an old man, and his wife [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]], who was past [[menopause]] and therefore unable to have children.<ref>Libby Ahluwalia, ''Understanding Philosophy of Religion'' (Folens, 2008), p. 180.</ref><ref>Just, Arthur A.; Oden, Thomas C.

His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.\n\nOne day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. But the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, 'to reconcile fathers to their children' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.\"\n\n\"How can I be sure of this?\" Zechariah asked the angel. \"For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.\"\n\n\"I am Gabriel,\" the angel answered, \"who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said, \"he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.\"\n\nSix months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: \"You have been shown great favor \u2013 the Lord is with you.\"\n\nMary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, when the angel spoke again: \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. The child will be great and will be called 'Son of the Most High,' and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n\n\"How can this be?\" Mary asked the angel. \"For I have no husband.\"\n\n\"The Holy Spirit will descend on you,\" answered the angel, \"and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called 'holy,' and 'Son of God.' And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"I am the servant of the Lord,\" exclaimed Mary; \"let it be with me as you have said.\" Then the angel left her.\n\nSoon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; and there she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried aloud: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child! But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.\"\n\nAnd Mary said:\n\n\"My soul exalts the Lord,\nmy spirit delights in God my Savior;\nfor he has remembered his humble servant girl;\nAnd from this hour all ages will count me happy!\n\nGreat things has the Almighty done for me;\nAnd holy is his name.\nFrom age to age his mercy rests\nOn those who honor him.\n\nMighty are the deeds of his arm;\nHe scatters the proud with their own devices,\nhe casts down princes from their thrones,\nand the humble he uplifts,\nthe hungry he loads with gifts,\nand the rich he sends empty away.\n\nHe has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,\nEver mindful of his mercy\n(As he promised to our forefathers)\nFor Abraham and his race for ever.\"\n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him 'Zechariah' after his father, when his mother spoke up: \"No, he is to be called John.\"\n\n\"You have no relation of that name!\" they exclaimed; and they made signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words \u2013 'His name is John.' Everyone was surprised; and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about; and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another \u2013 \"What can this child be destined to become?\" For the Power of the Lord was with him.\n\nThen his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:\n\n\"Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,\nWho has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,\nand has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation\nIn the house of his servant David \u2013\n\nAs he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old \u2013\nsalvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,\nshowing mercy to our forefathers,\nAnd mindful of his sacred covenant.\n\nThis was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham \u2013\nThat we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,\nand should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,\nIn his presence all our days.\n\nAnd you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,\nFor you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,\nto give his people the knowledge of salvation\nIn the forgiveness of their sins,\n\nthrough the tender mercy of our God,\nWhereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,\nto give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,\nAnd guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\nThe child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.\n\n; John and his baptism of Jesus, Imprisonment of John (Luke 3)\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene, and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah \u2013\n\n'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:\n\"Make ready the way of the Lord,\nMake his paths straight.\nEvery chasm will be filled,\nEvery mountain and hill will be leveled,\nThe winding ways will be straightened,\nThe rough roads made smooth,\nand everyone will see the salvation of God.\"'\n\nAnd John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: \"You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves 'Abraham is our ancestor,' for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n\"What are we to do then?\" the people asked. \"Let anyone who has two coats,\" answered John, \"share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.\"\n\nEven tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: \"Teacher, what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,\" John answered. And when some soldiers on active service asked \"And we \u2013 what are we to do?\" he said: \"Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.\"\n\nThen, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ, John, addressing them all, said: \"I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.\"\n\nAnd so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people. But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,  crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,  and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice \u2013 \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.\"\n\n; John's disciples and fast (Luke 5:33)\n\"John's disciples,\" they said to Jesus, \"Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Luke 7)\nAll these events were reported to John by his disciples. So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask \u2013 \"Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for some one else?\"\n\nWhen these men found Jesus, they said: \"John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask \u2013 'Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for somebody else?'\" At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. So his answer to the question was: \"Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard \u2013 the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.\"\n\nWhen John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. This is the man of whom scripture says \u2013\n\n'I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\nand he will prepare your way before you.'\n\nThere is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\"\n\n(All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John's baptism, acknowledged the justice of God. But the Pharisees and the students of the law, having rejected John's baptism, frustrated God's purpose in regard to them.)\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===In the Gospel of John===\nThe fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as \"a man sent from God\" who \"was not the light\", but \"came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:6\u20138|NKJV}}</ref> John clearly denies being the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet', instead describing himself as the \"voice of one crying in the wilderness\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:23|NKJV}}, compare {{bibleverse||Isaiah|40:3|NKJV}}</ref>\n\nUpon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the \"testifier and confessor ''par excellence''\", particularly when compared to figures like [[Nicodemus]].<ref>{{citation|last=Vande Vrede|first=Keith|title=A Contrast Between Nicodemus and John the Baptist in the Gospel of John|volume=57|date=December 2014|pages=715\u201326|editor-last=Kostenberger|editor-first=Andreas|journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|issue=4|issn=0360-8808|editor-link=Andreas J.

Unlike the other gospels, it is John himself who testifies to seeing \"the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him\". John explicitly announces that Jesus is the one \"who baptizes with the Holy Spirit\" and John even professes a \"belief that he is the Son of God\" and \"the Lamb of God\".\n\nThe Gospel of John reports that Jesus' disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification.<ref>{{bibleref2|John|3:22\u201336|9}}</ref> In this debate John argued that Jesus \"must become greater,\" while he (John) \"must become less\"<ref>{{bibleref2|John|3:30|31}}</ref> ([[Latin]] [[Vulgate]]: {{bibleref2|Ioannes|3:30|VULGATE|''illum oportet crescere me autem minui''}}).\n\nThe Gospel of John then points out that Jesus' disciples were baptizing more people than John.<ref>{{bibleref2|John|4:2}}</ref> Later, the Gospel relates that Jesus regarded John as \"a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light\".<ref>{{bibleref2|John|5:35|ESV}}</ref>\n\n{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel of John}}\n; John 1\nThere appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; he came as a witness \u2013 to bear witness to the light so that through him everyone might believe. He was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.\n\nWhen the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John \u2013 \"Who are you?\", he told them clearly and simply: \"I am not the Christ.\"\n\n\"What then?\" they asked. \"Are you Elijah?\"\n\"No,\" he said, \"I am not.\"\n\"Are you 'the prophet'?\" He answered, \"No.\"\n\"Who then are you?\" they continued; \"tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?\"\n\"I,\" he answered, \"am \u2013 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness \u2013 \"make a straight road for the Lord\"', as the prophet Isaiah said.\"\nThese men had been sent from the Pharisees; and their next question was: \"Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet'?\" John's answer was \u2013 \"I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.\" This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\nThe next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: \"Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! I was taking about him when I said 'After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.' I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.\"\n\nJohn also said: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him \u2013 he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.\" The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: \"There is the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.\n\n; John 3\nJohn, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. (For John had not yet been imprisoned). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of 'purification;' and the disciples came to John and said: \"Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony \u2013 he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.\" John's answer was \u2013 \"A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. You are yourselves witnesses that I said 'I am not the Christ,' but 'I have been sent before him as a messenger.' It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom's voice. This joy I have felt to the full. He must become greater, and I less.\"\n\nHe who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God's own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under 'God's displeasure.'\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===Comparative analysis===\nSimon J.

(Matthew and Luke drop the first part of the reference.)<ref name=\"Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31\">Carl R. Kazmierski, ''John the Baptist: Prophet and Evangelist'' (Liturgical Press, 1996) p. 31.</ref>\n\n; Baptism of Jesus\n\nThe gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, Jesus himself sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy\". They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the \"voice came out of heaven\" are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down \"out of heaven\" (John 12:28\u201330, John 1:32).\n\nIn Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead \"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.\"\n\nIn the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus's status.\n\n; John's knowledge of Jesus\n\nJohn's knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\n; John and Elijah\n{{see also|Matthew 3:4}}\nThe Gospels vary in their depiction of John's relationship to [[Elijah]]. Matthew and Mark describe John's attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in [[2 Kings 1:8]], who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is \"Elijah who was to come\" (Matt. 11:14 \u2013 see also Matt. 17:11\u201313); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah's successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah. In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and tells him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|NAB}}).\"\n\n==In Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews''==\nAn account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by [[Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100):<ref>\"Josephus, Flavius.\" In: Cross, F.

Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to [[Machaerus|Macherus]], the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death.

However, the decapitation cloth of Saint John is kept at the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The Coptic Christian Orthodox Church also claim to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist.

Johannes der T\u00e4ufer 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''John the Baptist'', [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], [[Rome]]]]\nThe [[Gospel]]s describe John the Baptist as having had a specific role ordained by [[God in Christianity|God]] as forerunner or precursor of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], who was the foretold [[Messiah]]. The New Testament Gospels speak of this role. In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:17}} the role of John is referred to as being \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:76}} as \"thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\" and in {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:77}} as being \"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.\"\n\nThere are several passages within the [[Old Testament]] which are interpreted by Christians as being [[prophecy|prophetic]] of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the [[Book of Malachi]] ({{Bibleref2|Malachi 3:1}}) that refers to a prophet who would ''prepare the way of the Lord'':\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.|Malachi 3:1<ref>{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:1|NRSV}}</ref>}}\n\nand also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5\u20136 where it says,\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.}}\n\nThe Jews of Jesus' day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; indeed, some present day Jews continue to await Elijah's coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the [[Passover Seder]]. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew 17:10}}, \"Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?\" The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,\n\n{{quote|Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\" Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.|Matthew 17:11\u201313}} (see also 11:14: \"...if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who was to come.\")\n\nThese passages are applied to John in the [[Synoptic Gospels]].<ref>Mat 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\n</ref><ref>Mar 1:2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</ref> But where Matthew specifically identifies John the Baptist as Elijah's spiritual successor ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 11.14, 17.13}}), the gospels of Mark and Luke are silent on the matter. The [[Gospel of John]] states that John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.\n\n{{quote|Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not deny, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ.\" They asked him, \"Then who are you?

In particular, John should have done everything in his power to persuade the Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah. He was to become Jesus' main disciple and John's disciples were to become Jesus' disciples. Unfortunately John didn't follow Jesus and continued his own way of baptizing people. Moreover, John also denied that he was Elijah when queried by several Jewish leaders {{bibleverse||John|1:21|NKJV}} contradicting Jesus who stated John is Elijah who was to come, {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|NKJV}}. Many Jews therefore, could not accept Jesus as the Messiah because John denied being Elijah, as the prophet's appearance was a prerequisite for the Messiah's arrival as stated in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:5|NKJV}}. According to the Unification Church, \"John the Baptist was in the position of representing Elijah's physical body, making himself identical with Elijah from the standpoint of their mission.\"\n\nJesus stated in {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:11|NKJV}}, \"there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist,\" however, in referring to John's blocking the way of the Jews' understanding of himself as the Messiah, said \"yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\" John's failure to follow Jesus became the chief obstacle to the fulfillment of Jesus' mission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unification.net/dp96/dp96-1-4.html |title=Exposition of the Divine Principle, 1996 Translation, Chapter 4|publisher=unification.net |accessdate=July 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.unification.net/dp73/dp73-1-4.html#1 Divine Principle, Part I Chapter 4; Advent of the Messiah]</ref><ref>5.

After John's death, Jesus' followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, \"countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead.\" Moss also references the incident in Matthew 16 where  disciples present before Jesus indicated some people believed he was John the Baptist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/were-jesus-and-john-the-baptist-competitors-finding-jesus-professor-describes-their-relationship.html|title=Were Jesus and John the Baptist Competitors?

Crosby, PhD, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA; Capuchin friar and priest; in his paper \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?,\" stated there was \"no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus.\" He conveys that John's concept of what a messiah should be, was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus. Crosby identifies twenty-five points in the Gospel accounts that lead to the conclusion that John's effectiveness as a \"precursor\" in encouraging others to follow Jesus was very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers having become Jesus\u2019 disciples. Crosby noted that while many others believed Jesus' miracles, there is no record of these \"signs\" convincing John, who continued a separate baptismal ministry, creating disciples resulting in a community that still exists in parts of the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/disciples-st-john-baptist-under-attack-2013121593050127653.html|title=Disciples of St John the Baptist under attack|first=Karlos|last=Zurutuza|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>\n\nCrosby stated \"an unbiased reading about John the Baptist \"leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus\u2019 messiahship.\"<ref>Crosby, Michael H.   \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?\"; Biblical Theology Bulletin, Volume 38 Nov, 2008; p158 -162 [http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120111755/http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf |date=2018-11-20 }}</ref>\n\nRobert L. Deffinbaugh, graduate from Dallas Theological Seminary pastor/teacher and elder at Community Bible Chapel in Richardson, Texas, wrote a paper \"John's Problem with Jesus ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:18\u201335|NET}}).\" Deffinbaugh comments of the difficulty of a more through examination of John because of the inclination to think of him in only positive terms.  He notes his  past piety, humility and encouraging some of his disciples to follow Jesus instead. While he was \"a great man,\" Deffinbaugh also writes John \"is not a perfect man,\" and discusses what he calls \"the worst moment of John\u2019s life, so far as the biblical record is concerned.\" He examines the incident where an imprisoned John the Baptist, after receiving news about Jesus, sends two of his disciples asking Jesus if he were the Messiah or another should be sought.\n\nJohn is not asking an incidental question, writes Deffinbaugh, but instead is issuing a public challenge precipitating a crises since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd. The implication was, if Jesus failed to answer the question satisfactorily \"we will look for someone else to be the Messiah.\" Deffinbaugh conveys John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was implementing, as John had previously warned that \"Messiah would come with fire.\" Jesus answered the question by evidence of his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity, \"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.\" ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:22|NET}}).<ref>https://bible.org/seriespage/22-johns-problem-jesus-luke-718-35  June 22, 2004</ref>\n\n==In art==\n\n[[File:Puvis de Chavannes, Pierre-C\u00e9cile - The Beheading of St John the Baptist - c. 1869.jpg|thumb|left|[[Puvis de Chavannes]], ''The Beheading of St John the Baptist'', c. 1869]]\n[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1849\u201350]]\n[[File:Baptism-christ.jpg|thumb|left|''The Baptism of Jesus Christ'', by Piero della Francesca, 1449]]\n[[File:Fondazione Querini Stampalia - San Giovanni Battista (1674-81) - Michele Fabris.jpg|thumb|left|''John the Baptist'' by  Michele Fabris<br>[[Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia]]]]\n[[File:San juan Wood Sculture By Santiago Martinez.jpg|thumb|right|Wood sculpture of John the Baptist's head by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], 1942]]\n[[File:Allori C San Giovanni.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cristofano Allori]]'s ''John the Baptist in the desert'']]\n\nThe [[beheading of Saint John the Baptist]] is a standard theme in Christian art,<ref name=\"World History\">Wetterau, Bruce.

New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>\n\nThe ''Baptism of Christ'' was one of the earliest scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' to be frequently depicted in [[Early Christian art]], and John's tall, thin, even gaunt, and bearded figure is already established by the 5th century. Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus. In [[Byzantine art]] the composition of the ''[[Deesis]]'' came to be included in every [[Eastern Orthodox]] church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the [[Theotokos]] (Mary) flank a [[Christ Pantocrator]] and intercede for humanity; in many ways this is the equivalent of Western [[Crucifixion]]s on [[rood]]s and elsewhere, where [[John the Evangelist]] takes the place of John the Baptist (except in the idiosyncratic ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]''). John the Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, or where the donor patron was named for him or there was some other connection of patronage \u2013 John was the patron saint of [[Florence]], among many other cities, which means he features among the supporting saints in many important works.\n\nA number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the [[predella]] of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably the large series in [[grisaille]] [[fresco]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Chiostro dello Scalzo|it}}, which was [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s largest work, and the frescoed ''Life'' by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] in the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]], both in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by [[Filippo Lippi]] in [[Prato Cathedral]]. These include the typical scenes:<ref>See [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] for further information on these scenes</ref> the ''Annunciation to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]'', John's birth, his naming by his father, the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'', John's departure for the desert, his preaching in the desert, the ''Baptism of Christ'', John before Herod, the dance of [[Salome]], and his beheading.\n\n[[File:'De Gray' Hours (f.24.v) St John the Baptist.jpg|thumb|left|St John the Baptist, from a medieval [[book of hours]]]]\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - St John the Baptist - WGA12723.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1513\u20131516), [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n\nHis birth, which unlike the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late [[Middle Ages]], with depictions by [[Jan van Eyck]] in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown, and by the 15th-century scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular, sometimes, as in an [[engraving]] by [[Israhel van Meckenem]], the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod's court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|title=Engraving by Israhel van Meckenem|publisher=Artsmia.org|accessdate=February 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111185904/http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|archivedate=January 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Salome bearing John's head on a platter equally became a subject for the Northern Renaissance taste for images of glamorous but dangerous women ([[Delilah]], [[Judith]] and others),<ref>On this see Chapter V, \"The Power of Women\", in H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints; National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}</ref> and was often painted by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and engraved by the [[Little Masters]]. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with [[Carlo Dolci]] painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and his successors.\n\nAs a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the 15th century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the ''[[Presentation of Christ]]'', the ''[[Marriage of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Holy Kinship]]''. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s versions of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the [[Madonna and Child]] that included John. [[Raphael]] in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', ''[[La belle jardini\u00e8re]]'', ''[[Aldobrandini Madonna]]'', ''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'', [[Madonna dell'Impannata (Raphael)|''Madonna dell'Impannata'']], which were among his best-known works. John was also often shown by himself as an older child or adolescent, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross \u2013 another theme [[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|influenced by Leonardo]], whose equivocal composition, reintroducing the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael [[Titian]] and [[Guido Reni]] among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes. [[Caravaggio]] painted an especially large number of works including John, from [[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|at least five largely nude youths]] attributed to him, to three late works on his death \u2013 the great ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Execution]]'' in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|one in Madrid]], and [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio, London)|one in London]].\n\n[[File:St John the Baptist Titular Statue of Xewkija Gozo, Malta.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St John carved out of a blackberry tree by [[Pietro Paolo Azzopardi]] \u2013 1845. [[Xewkija]]]]\n\nAmiens cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the 16th century. This stresses the execution and the disposal of the saint's remains.\n\nA remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]]. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and Mary's mother [[Saint Anne|Anne]] in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the 19th century with [[Symbolist]] painters such as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Puvis de Chavannes]] ([[National Gallery, London]]). [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' was illustrated by [[Aubrey Beardsley]], giving rise to some of his most memorable images.\n\n===In poetry===\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] poet [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni]] chose John the Baptist as one of biblical figures on which she wrote poetry.<ref>Robin, Larsen and Levin, p. 368</ref>\n\n===In music===\n{{sources|section|date=February 2019}}\n* [[Guido D'Arezzo]] (991/992 \u2013 after 1033) an Italian Benedictine monk founded the standard music stave based on a hymn to Saint John the Baptist.

In 1521, the island was given its formal name, \"''San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico''\", following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which [[Christopher Columbus]] had originally given the island. The names \"''San Juan Bautista''\" and \"''Puerto Rico''\" were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a [[Cartography|cartographic]] error. By 1746, the city's name (\"''Puerto Rico''\") had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island (\"''San Juan Bautista''\") had become that of the city. The [[List of U.S. state mottos|official motto]] of Puerto Rico also references the saint: ''Joannes Est Nomen Eius'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for \"his name is John\", from Luke 1:63).\n\nHe is also a patron saint of [[French Canada]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The Canadian cities of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] (1497), [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] (1604) and [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Qu\u00e9bec]] were all named in his honor. His feast day of June 24, celebrated officially in [[Quebec]] as the ''[[F\u00eate Nationale du Qu\u00e9bec]]'', and in Newfoundland as [[Discovery Day]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]]. In [[Scotland]], he is the patron saint of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], which used to be known as St. John's Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city's [[Professional sports|professional]] [[football club]] is called [[St Johnstone F.C.]]\n\nAlso, on the night of June 23 on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of [[Porto]], the second largest city in [[Portugal]].

A common practise of many [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino fiestas]] in his honour is bathing and the dousing of people in memory of John's iconic act. The custom is similar in form to [[Songkran]] and [[Holi]], and serves as a playful respite from the intense tropical heat. While famed for the [[Black Nazarene]] it enshrines, [[Quiapo Church]] in [[Manila]] is actually dedicated to Saint John.\n\nHe is also patron of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston]], which covers the whole of [[South Carolina]] in the [[United States]].\n\nThe [[Baptistines (disambiguation)|Baptistines]] are the name given to a number of [[religious orders]] dedicated to the memory of John the Baptist.\n\nAlong with [[John the Evangelist]], John the Baptist is claimed as a patron saint by the fraternal society of [[Freemasonry|Free and Accepted Masons]] (better known as the Freemasons).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ward.html|title=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|publisher=Freemasons-freemasonry.com|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn many Mediterranean countries, the [[summer solstice]] is dedicated to St. John.

He is known for his work as [[executive producer]] and [[showrunner]] of the [[cartoon series|animated]] sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'' from 1997 to 2001. Scully grew up in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] and long had an interest in writing. He was an [[underachiever]] at school and dropped out of college, going on to work in a series of jobs. Eventually, in 1986, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he worked as a stand-up comic and wrote for [[Yakov Smirnoff]].\n\nScully went on to write for several television sitcoms before 1993, when he was hired to write for ''The Simpsons''. There, he wrote twelve episodes, including \"[[Lisa on Ice]]\" and \"[[Team Homer]]\", and served as showrunner from [[The Simpsons (season 9)|seasons 9]] to [[The Simpsons (season 12)|12]]. Scully won three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for his work on the series, with many publications praising his episodes, but others criticizing his tenure as a period of decline in the show's quality. Scully still works on the show and also co-wrote 2007's ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.\n\nMore recently, Scully co-created ''[[The Pitts]]'' and ''[[Complete Savages]]'' as well as working on ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''. He co-developed the short-lived animated television version of ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]''.

He is known for his work as [[executive producer]] and [[showrunner]] of the [[cartoon series|animated]] sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'' from 1997 to 2001. Scully grew up in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] and long had an interest in writing. He was an [[underachiever]] at school and dropped out of college, going on to work in a series of jobs. Eventually, in 1986, he moved to [[Los Angeles]] where he worked as a stand-up comic and wrote for [[Yakov Smirnoff]].\n\nScully went on to write for several television sitcoms before 1993, when he was hired to write for ''The Simpsons''. There, he wrote twelve episodes, including \"[[Lisa on Ice]]\" and \"[[Team Homer]]\", and served as showrunner from [[The Simpsons (season 9)|seasons 9]] to [[The Simpsons (season 12)|12]]. Scully won three [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for his work on the series, with many publications praising his episodes, but others criticizing his tenure as a period of decline in the show's quality. Scully still works on the show and also co-wrote 2007's ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.\n\nMore recently, Scully co-created ''[[The Pitts]]'' and ''[[Complete Savages]]'' as well as working on ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]''. He co-developed the short-lived animated television version of ''[[Napoleon Dynamite (TV series)|Napoleon Dynamite]]''.
