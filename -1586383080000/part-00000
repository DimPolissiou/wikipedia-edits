It was released on January 1, 1974 by [[Columbia Records]]. The record was compiled immediately following the commercial success of [[lead single]] \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\". Six of the tracks on the album were meant for the singer's unreleased 1970 project ''The Singer''. Following the distribution of the soundtrack for the [[The Way We Were|1973 film of the same name]], Columbia added a caption to Streisand's LP (''Featuring the Hit Single The Way We Were and All in Love Is Fair'') in order to minimize confusion between the two albums.\n\nCovering a wide array of themes and topics, Streisand sings about recovering relationships, social awareness, and love in general. Like the majority of Streisand's catalog, ''The Way We Were'' was described as a [[Pop music|contemporary pop]] album blended with her signature vocal style. In terms of production, she heavily worked with [[Tommy LiPuma]] and [[Wally Gold]], while [[Marty Paich]] contributed to the title track. \n\nThe lead single (\"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\") was released on September 27, 1973 and became a chart topper in both the United States and Canada. It was also [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1974|the top-selling single in the former country in 1974]]. The second and final single, \"[[All in Love Is Fair#Barbra Streisand version|All in Love Is Fair]]\", was released in March 1974 and also charted in the two aforementioned countries.\n\nThe album received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised Streisand's vocals and found the record capable of being extremely successful. However, some critics felt the album was not carefully planned out and Streisand was acting out the tracks rather than actually singing them. Commercially, ''The Way We Were'' topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States and reached the top ten on album charts in Australia and Canada. It also entered the charts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Due to strong sales, it has since been certified 2\u00d7 Platinum in the United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe concept for the record first developed in late 1973, following the success of \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\", which was written specifically for the [[The Way We Were|1973 film of the same name]] starring Streisand and [[Robert Redford]].<ref name=\"Movie release date\" /> American composer and producer [[Marvin Hamlisch]] was commissioned to write the melody for the track, which he found to be hugely challenging due to Streisand's wants. She had wanted him to produce the composition in [[Key (music)|minor key]], but he instead wrote it in major key due to his fear that the song's lyrics would be revealed too quickly to the listener.<ref name=\"The Super Seventies review\">{{cite news|title=\"The Way We Were\" \u2013 Barbra Streisand: Columbia 45944|url=http://www.superseventies.com/1974_1singles.html|accessdate=November 14, 2016|publisher=[[MTV Classic (U.S. TV network)|The Super Seventies]]|date=February 1, 1974|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804014356/http://www.superseventies.com/1974_1singles.html|archivedate=August 4, 2016}}</ref> According to the liner notes of her 1991 [[greatest hits album]] ''[[Just for the Record (Barbra Streisand album)|Just for the Record]]'', \"The Way We Were\", \"All in Love is Fair\", \"Being at War with Each Other\", and \"Something So Right\" were the only tracks specifically recorded and created for the album.<ref name=\"Just for the Record\">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Just for the Record (Barbra Streisand album)|Just for the Record]] |others=Barbra Streisand |year=1991 |type=Liner notes |publisher=Columbia |id=CK 48648 }}</ref> The majority of the project's material consisted of demos and recordings from Streisand's recording sessions with [[Alan and Marilyn Bergman|Alan Bergman]] and [[Alan and Marilyn Bergman|Marilyn Bergman]] for an unreleased album titled ''The Singer''.<ref name=\"allmusicreview\" /> Both \"The Best Thing You've Ever Done\" and \"Summer Me, Winter Me\" were previously released together as a non-album single by Streisand in April 1970, and were originally intended for inclusion on the [[The Owl and the Pussycat (album)|official soundtrack]] to her 1970 film ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]]''.<ref name=\"United States TBTUED single\">{{cite AV media notes |title=''\"The Best Thing You've Ever Done\" / \"Summer Me, Winter Me\"'' |others=Barbra Streisand |year=1970 |type=Liner notes |publisher=Columbia |id=4-45147}}</ref>\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place at [[United Western Recorders|United-Western Recorders]] in [[Los Angeles]] between September 1969 and December 1973, while the mixing was performed at Hollywood Sound during that same time period. \"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" and \"My Buddy\"/\"How About Me\" were the first two songs recorded, while \"Being at War with Each Other\", \"Something So Right\", and \"All in Love Is Fair\" were the final three to be completed.

fifteenth studio album recorded by American vocalist [[Barbra Streisand]]. It was released on January 1, 1974 by [[Columbia Records]]. The record was compiled immediately following the commercial success of [[lead single]] \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\". Six of the tracks on the album was meant for the singer's unreleased 1970 project ''The Singer''. Following the distribution of the soundtrack for the [[The Way We Were|1973 film of the same name]], Columbia added a caption to Streisand's LP (''Featuring the Hit Single The Way We Were and All in Love Is Fair'') in order to minimize confusion between the two albums.\n\nCovering a wide array of themes and topics, Streisand sings about recovering relationships, social awareness, and love in general. Like the majority of Streisand's catalog, ''The Way We Were'' was described as a [[Pop music|contemporary pop]] album blended with her signature vocal style. In terms of production, she heavily worked with [[Tommy LiPuma]] and [[Wally Gold]], while [[Marty Paich]] contributed to the title track. \n\nThe lead single (\"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\") was released on September 27, 1973 and became a chart topper in both the United States and Canada. It was also [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1974|the top-selling single in the former country in 1974]]. The second and final single, \"[[All in Love Is Fair#Barbra Streisand version|All in Love Is Fair]]\", was released in March 1974 and also charted in the two aforementioned countries.\n\nThe album received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who praised Streisand's vocals and found the record capable of being extremely successful. However, some critics felt the album was not carefully planned out and Streisand was acting out the tracks rather than actually singing them. Commercially, ''The Way We Were'' topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States and reached the top ten on album charts in Australia and Canada. It also entered the charts in Japan and the United Kingdom. Due to strong sales, it has since been certified 2\u00d7 Platinum in the United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\n== Background and release ==\nThe concept for the record first developed in late 1973, following the success of \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\", which was written specifically for the [[The Way We Were|1973 film of the same name]] starring Streisand and [[Robert Redford]].<ref name=\"Movie release date\" /> American composer and producer [[Marvin Hamlisch]] was commissioned to write the melody for the track, which he found to be hugely challenging due to Streisand's wants. She had wanted him to produce the composition in [[Key (music)|minor key]], but he instead wrote it in major key due to his fear that the song's lyrics would be revealed too quickly to the listener.<ref name=\"The Super Seventies review\">{{cite news|title=\"The Way We Were\" \u2013 Barbra Streisand: Columbia 45944|url=http://www.superseventies.com/1974_1singles.html|accessdate=November 14, 2016|publisher=[[MTV Classic (U.S. TV network)|The Super Seventies]]|date=February 1, 1974|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804014356/http://www.superseventies.com/1974_1singles.html|archivedate=August 4, 2016}}</ref> According to the liner notes of her 1991 [[greatest hits album]] ''[[Just for the Record (Barbra Streisand album)|Just for the Record]]'', \"The Way We Were\", \"All in Love is Fair\", \"Being at War with Each Other\", and \"Something So Right\" were the only tracks specifically recorded and created for the album.<ref name=\"Just for the Record\">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Just for the Record (Barbra Streisand album)|Just for the Record]] |others=Barbra Streisand |year=1991 |type=Liner notes |publisher=Columbia |id=CK 48648 }}</ref> The majority of the project's material consisted of demos and recordings from Streisand's recording sessions with [[Alan and Marilyn Bergman|Alan Bergman]] and [[Alan and Marilyn Bergman|Marilyn Bergman]] for an unreleased album titled ''The Singer''.<ref name=\"allmusicreview\" /> Both \"The Best Thing You've Ever Done\" and \"Summer Me, Winter Me\" were previously released together as a non-album single by Streisand in April 1970, and were originally intended for inclusion on the [[The Owl and the Pussycat (album)|official soundtrack]] to her 1970 film ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]]''.<ref name=\"United States TBTUED single\">{{cite AV media notes |title=''\"The Best Thing You've Ever Done\" / \"Summer Me, Winter Me\"'' |others=Barbra Streisand |year=1970 |type=Liner notes |publisher=Columbia |id=4-45147}}</ref>\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place at [[United Western Recorders|United-Western Recorders]] in [[Los Angeles]] between September 1969 and December 1973, while the mixing was performed at Hollywood Sound during that same time period. \"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\" and \"My Buddy\"/\"How About Me\" were the first two songs recorded, while \"Being at War with Each Other\", \"Something So Right\", and \"All in Love Is Fair\" were the final three to be completed.

It is based on the [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year.

Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways.

Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda. [[Stephanie J. Block]] played Elphaba in all of the workshops (she was the original Elphaba in the first national tour, and joined the Broadway cast later on) before fellow performer [[Idina Menzel]] was cast in the role in late 2000. Earlier that same year, the creators recruited New York producer Stone, who began the transition of the workshop production into a full Broadway production. [[Joe Mantello]] was brought in as director and [[Wayne Cilento]] as choreographer while Tony Award-winning designer [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]] created the set and visual style for the production based on both [[William Wallace Denslow|W.

[[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]]. All of the songs featured on stage are present on the recording with the exception of \"The Wizard and I (Reprise)\" and \"The Wicked Witch of the East\".

It is based on the [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year. Its original stars included [[Idina Menzel]] as Elphaba, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Glinda, and [[Joel Grey]] as the Wizard.<ref name=\"ibdb\">{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13485 |title=Wicked |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |work= [[Internet Broadway Database]]}}</ref> The original Broadway production won three [[Tony Award]]s and seven [[Drama Desk Award]]s, while its original cast album received a [[Grammy Award]].\n\n''Wicked'' celebrated its sixteenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2019.

Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda.

[[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]].

Then you will not wreck your ship, nor will the sea destroy the sailors, unless Poseidon the Earth-Shaker be set upon it, or Zeus, the king of the deathless gods\u201d (II. 663-677).</ref> By the 3rd millennium BC, widespread civilisations had developed sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and are believed to have consciously oriented their temples to create alignment with the [[heliacal rising]]s of the stars.<ref>[[#Reference-Kelley-Milone-2005|Kelley and Milone (2005)]] p.268.</ref>\n\nThere is scattered evidence to suggest that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made during this period, particularly in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkad (region)|Akkad]], [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]). Two, from the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] (compiled in [[Babylon]] round 1700 BC) are reported to have been made during the reign of king [[Sargon of Akkad]] (2334-2279 BC).<ref>Two texts which refer to the 'omens of Sargon' are reported in E.

See also, [[#Reference-Neugebauer|Neugebauer (1969)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C pp.29-30].</ref> The history of scholarly celestial divination is therefore generally reported to begin with late [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian]] texts ({{circa}} 1800 BC), continuing through the Middle Babylonian and [[Assyria|Middle Assyrian]] periods ({{circa}} 1200 BC).<ref>[[#Reference-Rochberg|Rochberg (1998)]] p.x.</ref>\n\nBy the 16th century BC the extensive employment of omen-based astrology can be evidenced in the compilation of a comprehensive reference work known as ''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]''. Its contents consisted of 70 [[cuneiform]] tablets comprising 7,000 celestial omens. Texts from this time also refer to an oral tradition - the origin and content of which can only be speculated upon.<ref>[[#Reference-Baigent|Baigent (1994)]] p.71.</ref> At this time Babylonian astrology was solely mundane, concerned with the prediction of weather and political matters, and prior to the 7th century BC the practitioners' understanding of [[astronomy]] was fairly rudimentary.  Astrological symbols likely represented seasonal tasks, and were used as a yearly almanac of listed activities to remind a community to do things appropriate to the season or weather (such as symbols representing times for harvesting, gathering shell-fish, fishing by net or line, sowing crops, collecting or managing water reserves, hunting, and seasonal tasks critical in ensuring the survival of children and young animals for the larger group). By the 4th century,  their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy, at which point extensive [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] began to appear.<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] p.9.</ref>\n\nBabylonian astrology developed within the context of divination.  A collection of 32 tablets with inscribed liver models, dating from about 1875 BC, are the oldest known detailed texts of Babylonian divination, and these demonstrate the same interpretational format as that employed in celestial omen analysis.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.16.</ref>  Blemishes and marks found on the liver of the sacrificial animal were interpreted as symbolic signs which presented messages from the gods to the king.\n\nThe gods were also believed to present themselves in the celestial images of the [[classical planet|planets]] or [[star]]s with whom they were associated. Evil celestial omens attached to any particular planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.11.</ref>  Such indications were met with attempts to appease the god and find manageable ways by which the god's expression could be realised without significant harm to the king and his nation. An astronomical report to the king [[Esarhaddon]] concerning a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute kings, or substitute events, combined an unquestioning belief in magic and omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must have some kind of correlate within the natural world:\n{{quote|... In the beginning of the year a flood will come and break the dikes. When the Moon has made the eclipse, the king, my lord, should write to me. As a substitute for the king, I will cut through a dike, here in Babylonia, in the middle of the night. No one will know about it.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.12. Tablet source given as: ''State Archives of Assyria'' 8 250.</ref>}}\nUlla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book ''Mesopotamian Astrology'', argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its heavy reliance on magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of revenge, and so \u201cshares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations\u201d.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.13.</ref>  Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.19.</ref>  mundane astrology is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology.<ref>{{cite book|title=From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia|author=Michael Baigent|publisher=Arkana|date=1994}}</ref> It was only with the gradual emergence of [[horoscopic astrology]], from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of [[natal astrology]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Mundane astrology|author=Michael Baigent, Nicholas Campion and Charles Harvey|publisher=Thorsons|date=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Broecke2003\">{{cite book|author=Steven Vanden Broecke|title=The limits of influence: Pico, Louvain, and the crisis of Renaissance astrology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0yDeNFZOT4C&pg=PA185|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13169-9|pages=185\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Hellenistic Egypt==\n{{Main|Hellenistic astrology}}\nIn 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, historian Tamsyn Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the Egyptian [[zodiac]], which shared two signs \u2013 the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the [[Dendera Zodiac]] (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion's Claws).<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 24.</ref>\n\nAfter the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, Egypt came under [[Hellenistic]] rule and influence.  The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the scholars of Alexandria were prolific writers. It was in Ptolemaic Alexandria that [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This  contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. Along with this it incorporated the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] pp. 11-13.</ref>\n\nThe decans were a system of time measurement according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into \u2018hours\u2019. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over the course of the year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 20.</ref> The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the [[Dendera Zodiac]].\n\nParticularly important in the development of horoscopic astrology was the [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]], who lived in Alexandria in Egypt. Ptolemy's work the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition, and as a source of later reference is said to have \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\".<ref>[[#Robbins_Tet|Robbins, ''Ptolemy Tetrabiblos'']], 'Introduction' p. xii.</ref> It was one of the first astrological texts to be circulated in Medieval <ref>{{cite web |url = http://astrologyclub.org/history/ |title = The History of Astrology |accessdate = 2016-12-28 |date = 2014-06-13 }}</ref> Europe after being translated from Arabic into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]] (Tiburtinus) in Spain, 1138.<ref>FA Robbins, 1940; Thorndike 1923)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Firmicus Maternus]] (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named [[Nekauba|Nechepso]] and his priest [[Petosiris]].<ref>[[#Reference-Firmicus|Firmicus (4th century)]] (III.4) 'Proemium'.</ref> The [[Hermetism|Hermetic]] texts were also put together during this period and  [[Clement of Alexandria]], writing in the [[Roman era]], demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites:\n<blockquote>This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.<ref>[[#Reference-Roberts|Roberts (1906)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=yKsL6MsawugC&lpg=PP1&dq=ante-nicene%20fathers%20volume%20II&pg=PA488#v=onepage&q&f=false p.488].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Greece and Rome==\nThe conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to the cultures and [[cosmology|cosmological]] ideas of [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Greek overtook cuneiform script as the international language of intellectual communication and part of this process was the transmission of astrology from cuneiform to Greek.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 173.</ref> Sometime around 280 BC, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]] in order to teach astrology and Babylonian culture to the Greeks. With this, what historian [[Nicholas Campion]] calls, \"the innovative energy\" in astrology moved west to the Hellenistic world of Greece and Egypt.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 84.</ref>\nAccording to Campion, the astrology that arrived from the [[Eastern World]] was marked by its complexity, with different forms of astrology emerging. By the 1st century BC two varieties of astrology were in existence, one that required the reading of [[horoscope]]s in order to establish precise details about the past, present and future; the other being [[theurgic]] (literally  meaning 'god-work'), which emphasised the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars. While they were not mutually exclusive, the former sought information about the life, while the latter was concerned with personal transformation, where astrology served as a form of dialogue with the [[Divinity|Divine]].<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.173-174.</ref>\n\nAs with much else, Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].<ref name=B32>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32.</ref> However, our earliest references to demonstrate its arrival in Rome reveal its initial influence upon the lower orders of society,<ref name=B32 /> and display concern about uncritical recourse to the ideas of  Babylonian 'star-gazers'.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.227-228.</ref> Among the Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' came to be a common [[synonym]] for [[divination]] using planets and stars.<ref>[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]] p.16.</ref>\n\nThe first definite reference to astrology  comes from the work of the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BC composed a treatise warning farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32-33. See also [[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.228.</ref> The 2nd-century Roman poet [[Juvenal]], in his satirical attack on the habits of Roman women, also complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, despite their lowly social status, saying \"Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Amun|Hammon's]] fountain, ... nowadays no astrologer has credit unless he has been imprisoned in some distant camp, with chains clanking on either arm\".<ref>[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: '[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]' (translated by G. G. Ramsay, 1918, retrieved 5 July 2012).</ref>\n\nOne of the first astrologers to bring [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] astrology to Rome was [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]], who, in the first century CE, acted as the astrologer for the [[emperor]] [[Tiberius]].<ref name=\"B32\"/> Tiberius was the first emperor  reported to have had a court astrologer,<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.43.</ref> although his predecessor [[Augustus]] had also used astrology to help legitimise his [[Imperialism|Imperial]] rights.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.63.</ref> <!--Some referenced information needed with regard to bans against astrologers and use in Roman politics --> In the second century CE, the astrologer Claudius Ptolemy was so obsessed with getting horoscopes accurate that he began the first attempt to make an accurate world map (maps before this were more relativistic or allegorical) so that he could chart the relationship between the person's birthplace and the heavenly bodies. While doing so, he coined the term \"geography\".<ref>Thompson, Clive. \"The Whole World in your Hands\". ''Smithsonian'', July 2017. p. 19.</ref>\n\nEven though some use of astrology by the emperors appears to have happened, there was also a prohibition on astrology to a certain extent as well. In the 1st century CE, [[Publius Rufus Anteius]] was accused of the crime of funding the banished astrologer Pammenes, and requesting his own horoscope and that of then emperor [[Nero]]. For this crime, Nero forced Anteius to commit suicide.

The second Abbasid [[caliph]], [[Al Mansur]] (754-775) founded the city of [[Baghdad]] to act as a centre of learning, and  included in its design a library-translation centre known as ''Bayt al-Hikma'' \u2018Storehouse of Wisdom\u2019, which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic translations of Hellenistic astrological texts.<ref>[[#Reference-Houlding-2010|Houlding (2010)]] Ch. 8: 'The medieval development of Hellenistic principles concerning aspectual applications and orbs'; pp.12-13.</ref> The early translators included [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad,<ref>[[#Reference-Albiruni-chronology|Albiruni, Chronology (11th century)]] Ch.VIII, \u2018On the days of the Greek calendar\u2019, ''re''. 23 Tamm\u00fbz; Sachau.</ref> and [[Sahl ibn Bishr]] (a.k.a.

The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the [[List of traditional star names|star names]] that are commonly known today, such as [[Aldebaran]], [[Altair]], [[Betelgeuse]], [[Rigel]] and [[Vega]] retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic [[Arabic parts|lots]] to the extent that they became historically known as [[Arabic parts]], for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas they are clearly known to have been an important feature of [[Hellenistic astrology]].\n\nDuring the advance of Islamic science some of the practices of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]], and conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] through the suggestion that the Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance.<ref>[[#Reference-Saliba-1994|Saliba (1994)]] p.60, pp.67-69.</ref> Such refutations mainly concerned [[Judicial astrology|'judicial branches']] (such as [[horary astrology]]), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as [[Medical astrology|medical]] and [[Astrometeorology|meteorological]] astrology, these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time.\n\nFor example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology' ''Res\u0101la f\u012b eb\u1e6d\u0101l a\u1e25k\u0101m al-noj\u016bm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God's absolute power over creation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the capability of determining the exact influence of the stars.<ref>[[#Reference-Belo-2007|Belo (2007)]] p.228.</ref> In essence, Avicenna did not refute the essential dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.<ref>[[George Saliba]], ''Avicenna'': 'viii.

His notebook demonstrates that he had a wide range of clients, from all walks of life, and indicates that engagement with astrology in 15th-century England was not confined to those within learned, theological or political circles.<ref name=page>Sophie Page, 'Richard Trewythian and the Uses of Astrology in Late Medieval England', ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' Vol. 64, (2001), pp. 193-228.

Many individuals now credited with having overturned the old astrological order, such as [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], were themselves practicing astrologers.<ref>Wade Rowland, ''Galileo's Mistake: A New Look At the Epic Confrontation Between Galileo and the Church'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WWyF4vS8P7UC&pg=PA39&dq=astrologers+Galileo+Galilei,+Tycho+Brahe+and+Johannes+Kepler,&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s1DwT9OFPIK_0QX4tuSQDg&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false p.39]. (Arcade Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|9781559706841}}. Brahe is described as \"an acknowledged master of astrology\", Galileo as \"a dabbler, though by no means an adept\" and it is said of Kepler that \"astrology informed his entire career\".</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Renaissance the confidence placed in astrology diminished, with the breakdown of [[Aristotelian Physics]] and rejection of the distinction between the [[Celestial spheres|celestial]] and [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar realms]], which had historically acted as the foundation of astrological theory. Keith Thomas writes that although [[heliocentrism]] is consistent with astrology theory, 16th and 17th century astronomical advances meant that \"the world could no longer be envisaged as a compact inter-locking organism; it was now a mechanism of infinite dimensions, from which the hierarchical subordination of earth to heaven had irrefutably disappeared\".<ref name=Thomas>Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971) p. 414-415, {{ISBN|9780195213607}}</ref> Initially, amongst the astronomers of the time, \"scarcely anyone attempted a serious refutation in the light of the new principles\" and in fact astronomers \"were reluctant to give up the emotional satisfaction provided by a coherent and interrelated universe\". By the 18th century the intellectual investment which had previously maintained astrology's standing was largely abandoned.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Historian of science Ann Geneva writes:\n{{Quote|Astrology in seventeenth century England was not a science. It was not a Religion. It was not magic.  Nor was it astronomy, mathematics, puritanism, neo Platism, psychology, meteorology, alchemy or witchcraft. It used some of these as tools; it held tenets in common with others; and some people were adept at several of these skills. But in the final analysis it was only itself: a unique divinatory and prognostic art embodying centuries of accreted methodology and tradition.<ref>Ann Geneva, ''Astrology and the Seventeenth Century Mind: William Lilly and the Language of the Stars'', p.9.

The only work of this class to have survived is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]'', which contains rules for tracking the motions of the sun and the moon in the context of a five-year intercalation cycle. The date of this work is uncertain, as its late style of language and composition, consistent with the last centuries BC, albeit pre-[[Mauryan]], conflicts with some internal evidence of a much earlier date in the 2nd millennium BC.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005abd_s1.pdf\n |title       = Vedanga jyotisa of Lagadha\n |author      = Sastry, T.S.K.\n |editor      = [[K.V.

The oldest surviving treatises, such as the [[Yavanajataka]] or the [[Brihat-Samhita]], date to the early centuries AD.  The oldest astrological treatise in [[Sanskrit]] is  the ''[[Yavanajataka]]'' (\"Sayings of the Greeks\"), a versification by [[Sphujidhvaja]] in 269/270 AD of a now lost translation of a Greek treatise by [[Yavanesvara]] during the 2nd century AD under the patronage of the [[Western Satrap]] [[Saka]] king [[Rudradaman I]].<ref>Mc Evilley \"The shape of ancient thought\", p385 (\"The Yavanajataka is the earliest surviving Sanskrit text in horoscopy, and constitute the basis of all later Indian developments in horoscopy\", himself quoting [[David Pingree]] \"The Yavanajataka of Sphujidhvaja\" p5)</ref>\n\nIndian astronomy and astrology developed together. The earliest treatise on jyotish, the [[Bhrigu Samhita]], dates from the [[Vedic period|Vedic era]]. The sage Bhrigu is one of the Saptarshi, the seven sages who assisted in the creation of the universe. Written on pages of tree bark, the Samhita (Compilation) is said to contain five million horoscopes comprising all who have lived in the past or will live in the future. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy are from the 5th century AD, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of [[Aryabhata]] in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' and the lost ''Arya-siddh\u0101nta'', there is the ''[[Pancha-Siddh\u0101ntika]]'' of [[Varahamihira]].\n\n==China==\n{{Main|Chinese astrology}}\n[[File:Shang_dynasty_inscribed_tortoise_plastron.jpg|thumbnail|right|120px|An oracle bone \u2013 turtle shell]]\nChinese system is based on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and  [[Chinese calendar|calendar]]s and its significant development is tied to that of [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], which came to flourish during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD).<ref>{{cite book |title=Astrology and Cosmology in Early China: Conforming Earth to Heaven |first=David W. |last=Pankenier |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mUxCAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Astrology+and+Cosmology+in+Early+China:+Conforming+Earth+to+Heaven#v=onepage&q=Astrology%20and%20Cosmology%20in%20Early%20China%3A%20Conforming%20Earth%20to%20Heaven&f=false|isbn=9781107292246 }}</ref>\n\nChinese astrology has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmony, heaven, earth and water) and uses the principles of [[yin and yang]] and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the [[wu xing]] teachings, the 10 [[Celestial stems]], the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], the [[Chinese calendar|lunisolar calendar]] (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day and [[shichen]] (\u6642\u8fb0).\n\nAstrology was traditionally regarded highly in China, and  Confucius is said to have treated astrology with respect saying: \"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\".<ref name=\"Parkers\">[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]</ref> The 60-year cycle combining the five elements with the twelve animal signs of the zodiac has been documented in China since at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang (Shing or Yin) dynasty]] (ca 1766 BC \u2013 ca 1050 BC). [[Oracle bone|Oracles bones]] have been found dating from that period with the date according to the 60-year cycle inscribed on them, along with the name of the diviner and the topic being divined about. One of the most famous astrologers in China was [[Tsou Yen]] who lived in around 300 BC, and who wrote: \"When some new dynasty is going to arise, heaven exhibits auspicious signs for the people\".\n\n==Mesoamerica==\n{{Main|Maya calendar|Aztec calendar}}\nThe calendars of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. The earliest calendars were employed by peoples such as the Zapotecs and [[Olmec]]s, and later by such peoples as the [[Maya civilisation|Maya]], [[Mixtec]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]]. Although the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]] did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements to it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood.\n\nThe distinctive Mayan calendar used two main systems, one plotting the solar year of 360 days, which governed the planting of crops and other domestic matters; the other called the [[Tzolkin]] of 260 days, which governed ritual use. Each was linked to an elaborate astrological system to cover every facet of life. On the fifth day after the birth of a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim.<ref name=\"Parkers\"/> A 584-day [[Venus]] cycle was also maintained, which tracked the appearance and conjunctions of Venus. Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose. There is evidence that the Maya also tracked the movements of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, and possessed a zodiac of some kind. The Mayan name for the constellation Scorpio was also 'scorpion', while the name of the constellation Gemini was 'peccary'. There is some evidence for other constellations being named after various beasts.<ref>Michael D. Coe, 'The Maya', pp. 227\u201329, Thames and Hudson, London, 2005</ref> The most famous Mayan astrological observatory still intact is the Caracol observatory in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in modern-day Mexico.\n\nThe Aztec calendar shares the same basic structure as the Mayan calendar, with two main cycles of 360 days and 260 days. The 260-day calendar was called [[Tonalpohualli]] and was used primarily for divinatory purposes. Like the Mayan calendar, these two cycles formed a 52-year 'century', sometimes called the [[Calendar Round]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Astrology]]\n* [[Astrology and science]]\n* [[Classical planets in Western alchemy]]\n* [[Jewish views on astrology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Wikicite | id = Albiruni-chronology | reference= Al Biruni (11th century), '' The Chronology of Ancient Nations''; tr.

Astrological symbols likely represented seasonal tasks, and were used as a yearly almanac of listed activities to remind a community to do things appropriate to the season or weather (such as symbols representing times for harvesting, gathering shell-fish, fishing by net or line, sowing crops, collecting or managing water reserves, hunting, and seasonal tasks critical in ensuring the survival of children and young animals for the larger group). By the 4th century,  their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy, at which point extensive [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] began to appear.<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] p.9.</ref>\n\nBabylonian astrology developed within the context of divination.  A collection of 32 tablets with inscribed liver models, dating from about 1875 BC, are the oldest known detailed texts of Babylonian divination, and these demonstrate the same interpretational format as that employed in celestial omen analysis.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.16.</ref>  Blemishes and marks found on the liver of the sacrificial animal were interpreted as symbolic signs which presented messages from the gods to the king.\n\nThe gods were also believed to present themselves in the celestial images of the [[classical planet|planets]] or [[star]]s with whom they were associated. Evil celestial omens attached to any particular planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.11.</ref>  Such indications were met with attempts to appease the god and find manageable ways by which the god's expression could be realised without significant harm to the king and his nation. An astronomical report to the king [[Esarhaddon]] concerning a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute kings, or substitute events, combined an unquestioning belief in magic and omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must have some kind of correlate within the natural world:\n{{quote|... In the beginning of the year a flood will come and break the dikes. When the Moon has made the eclipse, the king, my lord, should write to me. As a substitute for the king, I will cut through a dike, here in Babylonia, in the middle of the night. No one will know about it.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.12. Tablet source given as: ''State Archives of Assyria'' 8 250.</ref>}}\nUlla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book ''Mesopotamian Astrology'', argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its heavy reliance on magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of revenge, and so \u201cshares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations\u201d.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.13.</ref>  Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.19.</ref>  mundane astrology is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology.<ref>{{cite book|title=From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia|author=Michael Baigent|publisher=Arkana|date=1994}}</ref> It was only with the gradual emergence of [[horoscopic astrology]], from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of [[natal astrology]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Mundane astrology|author=Michael Baigent, Nicholas Campion and Charles Harvey|publisher=Thorsons|date=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Broecke2003\">{{cite book|author=Steven Vanden Broecke|title=The limits of influence: Pico, Louvain, and the crisis of Renaissance astrology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0yDeNFZOT4C&pg=PA185|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13169-9|pages=185\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Hellenistic Egypt==\n{{Main|Hellenistic astrology}}\nIn 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, historian Tamsyn Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the Egyptian [[zodiac]], which shared two signs \u2013 the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the [[Dendera Zodiac]] (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion's Claws).<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 24.</ref>\n\nAfter the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, Egypt came under [[Hellenistic]] rule and influence.  The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the scholars of Alexandria were prolific writers. It was in Ptolemaic Alexandria that [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This  contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. Along with this it incorporated the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] pp. 11-13.</ref>\n\nThe decans were a system of time measurement according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into \u2018hours\u2019. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over the course of the year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 20.</ref> The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the [[Dendera Zodiac]].\n\nParticularly important in the development of horoscopic astrology was the [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]], who lived in Alexandria in Egypt. Ptolemy's work the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition, and as a source of later reference is said to have \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\".<ref>[[#Robbins_Tet|Robbins, ''Ptolemy Tetrabiblos'']], 'Introduction' p. xii.</ref> It was one of the first astrological texts to be circulated in Medieval <ref>{{cite web |url = http://astrologyclub.org/history/ |title = The History of Astrology |accessdate = 2016-12-28 |date = 2014-06-13 }}</ref> Europe after being translated from Arabic into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]] (Tiburtinus) in Spain, 1138.<ref>FA Robbins, 1940; Thorndike 1923)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Firmicus Maternus]] (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named [[Nekauba|Nechepso]] and his priest [[Petosiris]].<ref>[[#Reference-Firmicus|Firmicus (4th century)]] (III.4) 'Proemium'.</ref> The [[Hermetism|Hermetic]] texts were also put together during this period and  [[Clement of Alexandria]], writing in the [[Roman era]], demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites:\n<blockquote>This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.<ref>[[#Reference-Roberts|Roberts (1906)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=yKsL6MsawugC&lpg=PP1&dq=ante-nicene%20fathers%20volume%20II&pg=PA488#v=onepage&q&f=false p.488].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Greece and Rome==\nThe conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to the cultures and [[cosmology|cosmological]] ideas of [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Greek overtook cuneiform script as the international language of intellectual communication and part of this process was the transmission of astrology from cuneiform to Greek.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 173.</ref> Sometime around 280 BC, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]] in order to teach astrology and Babylonian culture to the Greeks. With this, what historian [[Nicholas Campion]] calls, \"the innovative energy\" in astrology moved west to the Hellenistic world of Greece and Egypt.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 84.</ref>\nAccording to Campion, the astrology that arrived from the [[Eastern World]] was marked by its complexity, with different forms of astrology emerging. By the 1st century BC two varieties of astrology were in existence, one that required the reading of [[horoscope]]s in order to establish precise details about the past, present and future; the other being [[theurgic]] (literally  meaning 'god-work'), which emphasised the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars. While they were not mutually exclusive, the former sought information about the life, while the latter was concerned with personal transformation, where astrology served as a form of dialogue with the [[Divinity|Divine]].<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.173-174.</ref>\n\nAs with much else, Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].<ref name=B32>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32.</ref> However, our earliest references to demonstrate its arrival in Rome reveal its initial influence upon the lower orders of society,<ref name=B32 /> and display concern about uncritical recourse to the ideas of  Babylonian 'star-gazers'.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.227-228.</ref> Among the Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' came to be a common [[synonym]] for [[divination]] using planets and stars.<ref>[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]] p.16.</ref>\n\nThe first definite reference to astrology  comes from the work of the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BC composed a treatise warning farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32-33. See also [[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.228.</ref> The 2nd-century Roman poet [[Juvenal]], in his satirical attack on the habits of Roman women, also complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, despite their lowly social status, saying \"Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Amun|Hammon's]] fountain, ... nowadays no astrologer has credit unless he has been imprisoned in some distant camp, with chains clanking on either arm\".<ref>[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: '[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]' (translated by G.

While doing so, he coined the term \"geography\".<ref>Thompson, Clive. \"The Whole World in your Hands\". ''Smithsonian'', July 2017. p. 19.</ref>\n\nEven though some use of astrology by the emperors appears to have happened, there was also a prohibition on astrology to a certain extent as well. In the 1st century CE, [[Publius Rufus Anteius]] was accused of the crime of funding the banished astrologer Pammenes, and requesting his own horoscope and that of then emperor [[Nero]]. For this crime, Nero forced Anteius to commit suicide.

The second Abbasid [[caliph]], [[Al Mansur]] (754-775) founded the city of [[Baghdad]] to act as a centre of learning, and  included in its design a library-translation centre known as ''Bayt al-Hikma'' \u2018Storehouse of Wisdom\u2019, which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic translations of Hellenistic astrological texts.<ref>[[#Reference-Houlding-2010|Houlding (2010)]] Ch. 8: 'The medieval development of Hellenistic principles concerning aspectual applications and orbs'; pp.12-13.</ref> The early translators included [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad,<ref>[[#Reference-Albiruni-chronology|Albiruni, Chronology (11th century)]] Ch.VIII, \u2018On the days of the Greek calendar\u2019, ''re''. 23 Tamm\u00fbz; Sachau.</ref> and [[Sahl ibn Bishr]] (a.k.a.

The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the [[List of traditional star names|star names]] that are commonly known today, such as [[Aldebaran]], [[Altair]], [[Betelgeuse]], [[Rigel]] and [[Vega]] retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic [[Arabic parts|lots]] to the extent that they became historically known as [[Arabic parts]], for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas they are clearly known to have been an important feature of [[Hellenistic astrology]].\n\nDuring the advance of Islamic science some of the practices of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]], and conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] through the suggestion that the Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance.<ref>[[#Reference-Saliba-1994|Saliba (1994)]] p.60, pp.67-69.</ref> Such refutations mainly concerned [[Judicial astrology|'judicial branches']] (such as [[horary astrology]]), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as [[Medical astrology|medical]] and [[Astrometeorology|meteorological]] astrology, these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time.\n\nFor example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology' ''Res\u0101la f\u012b eb\u1e6d\u0101l a\u1e25k\u0101m al-noj\u016bm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God's absolute power over creation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the capability of determining the exact influence of the stars.<ref>[[#Reference-Belo-2007|Belo (2007)]] p.228.</ref> In essence, Avicenna did not refute the essential dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it.<ref>[[George Saliba]], ''Avicenna'': 'viii.

Keith Thomas writes that although [[heliocentrism]] is consistent with astrology theory, 16th and 17th century astronomical advances meant that \"the world could no longer be envisaged as a compact inter-locking organism; it was now a mechanism of infinite dimensions, from which the hierarchical subordination of earth to heaven had irrefutably disappeared\".<ref name=Thomas>Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971) p. 414-415, {{ISBN|9780195213607}}</ref> Initially, amongst the astronomers of the time, \"scarcely anyone attempted a serious refutation in the light of the new principles\" and in fact astronomers \"were reluctant to give up the emotional satisfaction provided by a coherent and interrelated universe\". By the 18th century the intellectual investment which had previously maintained astrology's standing was largely abandoned.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Historian of science Ann Geneva writes:\n{{Quote|Astrology in seventeenth century England was not a science. It was not a Religion. It was not magic.  Nor was it astronomy, mathematics, puritanism, neo Platism, psychology, meteorology, alchemy or witchcraft. It used some of these as tools; it held tenets in common with others; and some people were adept at several of these skills. But in the final analysis it was only itself: a unique divinatory and prognostic art embodying centuries of accreted methodology and tradition.<ref>Ann Geneva, ''Astrology and the Seventeenth Century Mind: William Lilly and the Language of the Stars'', p.9.

The only work of this class to have survived is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]'', which contains rules for tracking the motions of the sun and the moon in the context of a five-year intercalation cycle.

The oldest surviving treatises, such as the [[Yavanajataka]] or the [[Brihat-Samhita]], date to the early centuries AD.  The oldest astrological treatise in [[Sanskrit]] is  the ''[[Yavanajataka]]'' (\"Sayings of the Greeks\"), a versification by [[Sphujidhvaja]] in 269/270 AD of a now lost translation of a Greek treatise by [[Yavanesvara]] during the 2nd century AD under the patronage of the [[Western Satrap]] [[Saka]] king [[Rudradaman I]].<ref>Mc Evilley \"The shape of ancient thought\", p385 (\"The Yavanajataka is the earliest surviving Sanskrit text in horoscopy, and constitute the basis of all later Indian developments in horoscopy\", himself quoting [[David Pingree]] \"The Yavanajataka of Sphujidhvaja\" p5)</ref>\n\nIndian astronomy and astrology developed together. The earliest treatise on jyotish, the [[Bhrigu Samhita]], dates from the Vedic era. The sage Bhrigu is one of the Saptarshi, the seven sages who assisted in the creation of the universe. Written on pages of tree bark, the Samhita (Compilation) is said to contain five million horoscopes comprising all who have lived in the past or will live in the future. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy are from the 5th century AD, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of [[Aryabhata]] in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' and the lost ''Arya-siddh\u0101nta'', there is the ''[[Pancha-Siddh\u0101ntika]]'' of [[Varahamihira]].\n\n==China==\n{{Main|Chinese astrology}}\n[[File:Shang_dynasty_inscribed_tortoise_plastron.jpg|thumbnail|right|120px|An oracle bone \u2013 turtle shell]]\nChinese system is based on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and  [[Chinese calendar|calendar]]s and its significant development is tied to that of [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], which came to flourish during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD).<ref>{{cite book |title=Astrology and Cosmology in Early China: Conforming Earth to Heaven |first=David W. |last=Pankenier |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mUxCAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Astrology+and+Cosmology+in+Early+China:+Conforming+Earth+to+Heaven#v=onepage&q=Astrology%20and%20Cosmology%20in%20Early%20China%3A%20Conforming%20Earth%20to%20Heaven&f=false|isbn=9781107292246 }}</ref>\n\nChinese astrology has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmony, heaven, earth and water) and uses the principles of [[yin and yang]] and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the [[wu xing]] teachings, the 10 [[Celestial stems]], the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], the [[Chinese calendar|lunisolar calendar]] (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day and [[shichen]] (\u6642\u8fb0).\n\nAstrology was traditionally regarded highly in China, and  Confucius is said to have treated astrology with respect saying: \"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\".<ref name=\"Parkers\">[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]</ref> The 60-year cycle combining the five elements with the twelve animal signs of the zodiac has been documented in China since at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang (Shing or Yin) dynasty]] (ca 1766 BC \u2013 ca 1050 BC). [[Oracle bone|Oracles bones]] have been found dating from that period with the date according to the 60-year cycle inscribed on them, along with the name of the diviner and the topic being divined about. One of the most famous astrologers in China was [[Tsou Yen]] who lived in around 300 BC, and who wrote: \"When some new dynasty is going to arise, heaven exhibits auspicious signs for the people\".\n\n==Mesoamerica==\n{{Main|Maya calendar|Aztec calendar}}\nThe calendars of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. The earliest calendars were employed by peoples such as the Zapotecs and [[Olmec]]s, and later by such peoples as the [[Maya civilisation|Maya]], [[Mixtec]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]]. Although the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]] did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements to it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood.\n\nThe distinctive Mayan calendar used two main systems, one plotting the solar year of 360 days, which governed the planting of crops and other domestic matters; the other called the [[Tzolkin]] of 260 days, which governed ritual use. Each was linked to an elaborate astrological system to cover every facet of life. On the fifth day after the birth of a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim.<ref name=\"Parkers\"/> A 584-day [[Venus]] cycle was also maintained, which tracked the appearance and conjunctions of Venus. Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose. There is evidence that the Maya also tracked the movements of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, and possessed a zodiac of some kind. The Mayan name for the constellation Scorpio was also 'scorpion', while the name of the constellation Gemini was 'peccary'. There is some evidence for other constellations being named after various beasts.<ref>Michael D. Coe, 'The Maya', pp. 227\u201329, Thames and Hudson, London, 2005</ref> The most famous Mayan astrological observatory still intact is the Caracol observatory in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in modern-day Mexico.\n\nThe Aztec calendar shares the same basic structure as the Mayan calendar, with two main cycles of 360 days and 260 days. The 260-day calendar was called [[Tonalpohualli]] and was used primarily for divinatory purposes. Like the Mayan calendar, these two cycles formed a 52-year 'century', sometimes called the [[Calendar Round]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Astrology]]\n* [[Astrology and science]]\n* [[Classical planets in Western alchemy]]\n* [[Jewish views on astrology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Wikicite | id = Albiruni-chronology | reference= Al Biruni (11th century), '' The Chronology of Ancient Nations''; tr.

The TV series was created for [[HBO]] by [[Damon Lindelof]], who also served as an executive producer and writer. Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Andrew Howard]], Jacob Ming-Trent, [[Tom Mison]], [[Sara Vickers]], Dylan Schombing, [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] and [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Jean Smart]] and [[Hong Chau]] joining the cast in later episodes.\n\nLindelof likened the television series to a \"[[remix]]\" of the original comic series. While the series is technically a sequel, which takes place 34 years after the events of the comics within the same alternate reality, Lindelof wanted to introduce new characters and conflicts that create a new story within the ''Watchmen'' continuity, rather than creating a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. The series focuses on events surrounding racist violence in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 2019. A [[white supremacist]] group called the Seventh Kavalry has taken up arms against the [[Tulsa Police Department]] because of perceived racial injustices, causing the police to conceal their identities with masks to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them in their homes following the \"White Night\". Angela Abar (King), a detective known as Sister Night, investigates the murder of her friend and superior, Judd Crawford (Johnson), and discovers secrets regarding the situations around [[vigilantism]].\n\nThe series, originally promoted by HBO as an ongoing drama series, premiered on October 20, 2019, before concluding its nine-episode run on December 15. Lindelof left his role as showrunner after the first season, stating that he had completed his intended story. HBO subsequently confirmed there are no further plans for the show to continue without Lindelof returning in some capacity, and reclassified the work as a limited series with possible future installments.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Watchmen'' takes place 34 years after the events of [[Watchmen|the comic series]]. Set in the comic's [[alternate history]] of the 20th century, [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]], once seen as heroes, have been outlawed due to their violent methods. In 1985, Adrian Veidt, formerly known as the vigilante [[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]], created a fake attack on [[New York City]] by a [[List of Watchmen characters#Alien Monster|squid-like alien]] that resulted in millions within New York being killed, coercing nations to work together against a common threat and to avert a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Veidt's actions disgusted his former companions, with [[Rorschach (character)|Rorschach]] planning to tell the world of Veidt's misdeeds before he is vaporized by [[Doctor Manhattan]], who subsequently left the planet, unaware Rorschach had sent his journal to be published beforehand.\n\nThe show takes place in 2019 [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].

In looking for a similar anxiety for contemporary times, Lindelof determined that [[Racism|racial tensions]] posed the same type of larger picture that would work well for the ''Watchmen'' universe, since it presented both historical and present conflicts.

Hooded Justice's identity was never established in the limited series, and Lindelof's suggestion that he was a black man created a challenge for the writers. One of the first tasks the writing staff had was to determine how Will would become Hooded Justice, effectively establishing the plot to the sixth episode \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\".<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> To further tie to the limited series, the writing staff only considered using the established characters that would best serve Angela's story so that she would remain the focus.<ref name=\"thr ep7\"/> To that end, they had established that characters like Doctor Manhattan, Laurie Blake, and Adrian Veidt were necessary to support Angela's discovery of her legacy. They had considered including Dan Dreiberg, the second [[Nite Owl]], as well, but Lindelof wanted to have a fair balance of old and new characters within the show, and felt that adding Dan would have tipped the balance too far away from the new characters. They did consider Dan's fate as part of the \"Peteypedia\" additional materials created by the show's writers, in which Dan remains in prison after he and Laurie were arrested for vigilantism in the past, and refusing to accept the FBI's offer to work with them as Laurie had done.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-dan-dreiberg-isnt-in-watchmen-hbo/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why Dan Dreiberg Wasn't in ''Watchmen'' |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nLindelof used his experience from his past shows to plot out the season prior to writing, stating \"What I've learned over time is you need to know the answers to the mysteries...If you don't know those, you're lost.

After completing the sixth episode, \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\", Lindelof felt the story was closer to its ending rather than as a midpoint, and that if they continued for four additional episodes, one of them would have been [[filler (media)|filler]], and instead opted to conclude the story with three episodes. The omitted episode would have likely covered more of Lady Trieu's backstory, according to Lindelof, though it would not have been exclusively devoted to that topic. Instead, some of this material was covered in conversations within the seventh episode \"[[An Almost Religious Awe]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-watchmen-was-9-episodes-instead-of-10/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why ''Watchmen'' Was Shortened to 9 Episodes Instead of the Original 10 |first=Adam |last=Chitwood |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nA show-within-the-show, ''American Hero Story'', was used to tell the purported backstory of Hooded Justice. Writer Cord Jefferson said ''American Hero Story'' was meant to be the opposite to what they were creating for the actual show, a \"cheesy\" production that perpetuated the in-universe myth of Hooded Justice being a white man.<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> Lindelof said the show was designed to be comparable to [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and ''[[American Crime Story]]'', and had even considered bringing in Murphy to play himself as the producer of ''American Hero Story''. He opted against this, but still treated ''American Hero Story'' like a Murphy work, and taking its producer to be somewhat secretive and seclusive, like Murphy.<ref name=\"ahs\"/> Some media critics took the ''American Hero Story'' segments to be a parody of [[Zack Snyder]]'s [[Watchmen (film)|2009 live-action adaption of ''Watchmen'']], a work generally panned by fans of the comic, but Lindelof and Kassell asserted this was not their intent. Kassell said \"I fully admire [Snyder] as a filmmaker so to hear that it could even be used as a negative comment feels terrible. What I was wanting to do with those (American Hero Story scenes) is like, 'This is the version we could make,' and we are very concretely not making that version.

Peteypedia was developed after most of the filming was completed, with writer [[Jeff Jensen]] overseeing it. The writing team were aware they had developed too much information that would fit into the broadcast show and debated how to present this, including as post-credit scenes or through [[social media]]. At the same time, HBO was working with Reznor and Ross on how to release the albums and were considering including additional [[liner note]]s in the vinyl releases, which included the additional background material the writers had developed. This led to creating reports and clippings similar to those presented in the original ''Watchmen'' comic, and presenting this as part of Peteypedia.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/how-watchmen-made-peteypedia.html |title=How Watchmen Built Out Its Universe With Peteypedia |first=Jackson |last=McHenry |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=December 23, 2019 |work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]}}</ref> Peteypedia allowed them, for example, to explain Laurie's trajectory from being the second Silk Spectre and fighting crime with Nite Owl at the end of the comic series, to becoming an FBI agent, elements of this that they had written briefly into the show but did not have broadcast time to spell out.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/> They also tied elements back to the original comic. Of note is the fictional novel ''Fogdancing'' written in-universe by Max Shea, one of the people that Veidt had used to device the squid attack in 1985. Jensen said that in the extra material with the graphic novel, ''Fogdancing'' had been made into a film at least twice, so the writers considered the work to be seminal to the characters in the television series, having the book appear at least twice during the show.

The TV series was created for [[HBO]] by [[Damon Lindelof]], who also served as an executive producer and writer. Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Andrew Howard]], Jacob Ming-Trent, [[Tom Mison]], [[Sara Vickers]], Dylan Schombing, [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] and [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Jean Smart]] and [[Hong Chau]] joining the cast in later episodes.\n\nLindelof likened the television series to a \"[[remix]]\" of the original comic series. While the series is technically a sequel, which takes place 34 years after the events of the comics within the same alternate reality, Lindelof wanted to introduce new characters and conflicts that create a new story within the ''Watchmen'' continuity, rather than creating a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. The series focuses on events surrounding racist violence in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 2019. A [[white supremacist]] group called the Seventh Kavalry has taken up arms against the [[Tulsa Police Department]] because of perceived racial injustices, causing the police to conceal their identities with masks to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them in their homes following the \"White Night\". Angela Abar (King), a detective known as Sister Night, investigates the murder of her friend and superior, Judd Crawford (Johnson), and discovers secrets regarding the situations around [[vigilantism]].\n\nThe series, originally promoted by HBO as an ongoing drama series, premiered on October 20, 2019, before concluding its nine-episode run on December 15. Lindelof left his role as showrunner after the first season, stating that he had completed his intended story. HBO subsequently confirmed there are no further plans for the show to continue without Lindelof returning in some capacity, and reclassified the work as a limited series with possible future installments.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Watchmen'' takes place 34 years after the events of [[Watchmen|the comic series]]. Set in the comic's [[alternate history]] of the 20th century, [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]], once seen as heroes, have been outlawed due to their violent methods. In 1985, Adrian Veidt, formerly known as the vigilante [[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]], created a fake attack on [[New York City]] by a [[List of Watchmen characters#Alien Monster|squid-like alien]] that resulted in millions within New York being killed, coercing nations to work together against a common threat and to avert a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Veidt's actions disgusted his former companions, with [[Rorschach (character)|Rorschach]] planning to tell the world of Veidt's misdeeds before he is vaporized by [[Doctor Manhattan]], who subsequently left the planet, unaware Rorschach had sent his journal to be published beforehand.\n\nThe show takes place in 2019 [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. A [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] group, the Seventh Kavalry, inspired by Rorschach's writings and masked image, wage violent war against minorities and the police that enforce special [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] for victims of racial injustice. On Christmas Eve 2016, during an event that came to be known as the \"White Night\", the Kavalry attacked the homes of 40 [[police officer]]s working for the [[Tulsa Police Department]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Why the White Night Is a Chilling Turning Point in Watchmen's Alt-History |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a29612697/white-night-watchmen-hbo-show-explained/ |website=Esquire |first=Brady |last=Langmann |date=October 28, 2019 |accessdate=October 29, 2019}}</ref> Of those who survived, only two stayed with the force: Detective Angela Abar and Police Chief Judd Crawford.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/10/27/20934540/watchmen-season-1-episode-2-recap-review-explained |title=Take a close look at Watchmen episode 2 |first=Eric |last=Thurm |date=October 28, 2019 |accessdate=October 28, 2019 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> As the police force was rebuilt, laws were passed that required police to not disclose their profession and to protect their identities while on the job by wearing masks, which includes allowing for costumed police officers.<ref name=\"ew deep dive\"/>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Watchmen characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 500\n| perrow    = 4\n| footer    = The principal cast for ''Watchmen'' includes (top row, left to right) [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Jean Smart]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], (bottom row, left to right) [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Hong Chau]], [[Louis Gossett Jr.]], and [[Jeremy Irons]].\n| image1    = Regina_King_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image2    = Don_Johnson_TIFF_2019.jpg\n| image3    = Jean_Smart_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image4    = Yahya_Abdul-Mateen_II_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image5    = Tim Blake Nelson 2016.jpg\n| image6    = Hong Chau 2016 cropped.jpg\n| image7    = Louis Gossett Jr. (Guadalajara Film Festival) 2.jpg\n| image8    = SDCC_2015_-_Jeremy_Irons_(19524260758)_(cropped).jpg\n}}\n\n===Main===\n<!--- Cast and order per closing credits, starting from pilot episode, new cast members will be add to bottom as closing credits change, per MOS:TVCAST--->\n* [[Regina King]] as Angela Abar / Sister Night, a Tulsa Police [[detective]] who wears a [[nun]]'s [[Religious habit|habit]] and a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].

Ninety-eight years later, masked Officer Charlie Sutton is hospitalized after being shot by a member of the Seventh Kavalry. Chief Judd Crawford calls for retaliation to hunt down the shooter. Angela Abar hears of the shooting and hunts down a suspect under her secret persona, Sister Night. With help from another costumed police officer, Wade Tillman/Looking Glass, Angela elicits the shooter's location at a cattle ranch used by the Kavalry.

Hooded Justice's identity was never established in the limited series, and Lindelof's suggestion that he was a black man created a challenge for the writers. One of the first tasks the writing staff had was to determine how Will would become Hooded Justice, effectively establishing the plot to the sixth episode \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\".<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> To further tie to the limited series, the writing staff only considered using the established characters that would best serve Angela's story so that she would remain the focus.<ref name=\"thr ep7\"/> To that end, they had established that characters like Doctor Manhattan, Laurie Blake, and Adrian Veidt were necessary to support Angela's discovery of her legacy. They had considered including Dan Dreiberg, the second [[Nite Owl]], as well, but Lindelof wanted to have a fair balance of old and new characters within the show, and felt that adding Dan would have tipped the balance too far away from the new characters. They did consider Dan's fate as part of the \"Peteypedia\" additional materials created by the show's writers, in which Dan remains in prison after he and Laurie were arrested for vigilantism in the past, and refusing to accept the FBI's offer to work with them as Laurie had done.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-dan-dreiberg-isnt-in-watchmen-hbo/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why Dan Dreiberg Wasn't in ''Watchmen'' |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nLindelof used his experience from his past shows to plot out the season prior to writing, stating \"What I've learned over time is you need to know the answers to the mysteries...If you don't know those, you're lost.

After completing the sixth episode, \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\", Lindelof felt the story was closer to its ending rather than as a midpoint, and that if they continued for four additional episodes, one of them would have been [[filler (media)|filler]], and instead opted to conclude the story with three episodes. The omitted episode would have likely covered more of Lady Trieu's backstory, according to Lindelof, though it would not have been exclusively devoted to that topic. Instead, some of this material was covered in conversations within the seventh episode \"[[An Almost Religious Awe]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-watchmen-was-9-episodes-instead-of-10/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why ''Watchmen'' Was Shortened to 9 Episodes Instead of the Original 10 |first=Adam |last=Chitwood |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nA show-within-the-show, ''American Hero Story'', was used to tell the purported backstory of Hooded Justice. Writer Cord Jefferson said ''American Hero Story'' was meant to be the opposite to what they were creating for the actual show, a \"cheesy\" production that perpetuated the in-universe myth of Hooded Justice being a white man.<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> Lindelof said the show was designed to be comparable to [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and ''[[American Crime Story]]'', and had even considered bringing in Murphy to play himself as the producer of ''American Hero Story''. He opted against this, but still treated ''American Hero Story'' like a Murphy work, and taking its producer to be somewhat secretive and seclusive, like Murphy.<ref name=\"ahs\"/> Some media critics took the ''American Hero Story'' segments to be a parody of [[Zack Snyder]]'s [[Watchmen (film)|2009 live-action adaption of ''Watchmen'']], a work generally panned by fans of the comic, but Lindelof and Kassell asserted this was not their intent. Kassell said \"I fully admire [Snyder] as a filmmaker so to hear that it could even be used as a negative comment feels terrible. What I was wanting to do with those (American Hero Story scenes) is like, 'This is the version we could make,' and we are very concretely not making that version.

Peteypedia was developed after most of the filming was completed, with writer [[Jeff Jensen]] overseeing it. The writing team were aware they had developed too much information that would fit into the broadcast show and debated how to present this, including as post-credit scenes or through [[social media]]. At the same time, HBO was working with Reznor and Ross on how to release the albums and were considering including additional [[liner note]]s in the vinyl releases, which included the additional background material the writers had developed. This led to creating reports and clippings similar to those presented in the original ''Watchmen'' comic, and presenting this as part of Peteypedia.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/how-watchmen-made-peteypedia.html |title=How Watchmen Built Out Its Universe With Peteypedia |first=Jackson |last=McHenry |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=December 23, 2019 |work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]}}</ref> Peteypedia allowed them, for example, to explain Laurie's trajectory from being the second Silk Spectre and fighting crime with Nite Owl at the end of the comic series, to becoming an FBI agent, elements of this that they had written briefly into the show but did not have broadcast time to spell out.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/> They also tied elements back to the original comic. Of note is the fictional novel ''Fogdancing'' written in-universe by Max Shea, one of the people that Veidt had used to device the squid attack in 1985. Jensen said that in the extra material with the graphic novel, ''Fogdancing'' had been made into a film at least twice, so the writers considered the work to be seminal to the characters in the television series, having the book appear at least twice during the show. Jensen created a whole plot summary of the work based on minimal clues from the comic, making the work to be about super-soldiers and having it tie to the idea of the ''Watchmen'' superhero culture.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/>\n\n===Continuation===\nWhile HBO had not yet confirmed a second season following the show's broadcast, Lindelof stated that if there were, he would not likely be back for it, but instead have another producer step forward to tell another story set in this universe.
