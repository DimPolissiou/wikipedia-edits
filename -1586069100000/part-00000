It was the property of [[Kuyavia]]n bishops and clergy until the end of the 18th century, when \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed by [[Prussia]] as a result of the [[second partition of Poland]].

It was then that \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced rapid growth in the cloth industry and in population due to the inflow of migrants, most notably Germans and Jews. Ever since the industrialization of the area, the city has struggled with many difficulties such as [[Multinational state|multinationalism]] and social inequality, which were vividly documented in the novel ''[[The Promised Land (novel)|The Promised Land]]'' written by Polish [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont]].

In 1806 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a joined the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and in 1810 it had approximately 190 inhabitants.

While in prison, Redford Raven shared a cell with a dying Navajo medicine man. The medicine man decided to share his secrets with Redford: He had designed a winged harness that, treated with a secret herb, could be worn by a man and permit him to glide upon the winds. The old Navajo trained Raven in the use of these wings until he died from his illness. Redford Raven tricked the guard into letting him escape by hovering to the ceiling and slipping out. Upon becoming Red Raven, he was able to safely escape the prison simply by flying out of reach of the guards.\n\nRed Raven's first action was to take revenge on Rawhide Kid. Not realizing Red Raven's new abilities, Rawhide Kid fired at Red Raven, who dodged every bullet. Red Raven then shot Rawhide Kid and left him for dead. Rawhide Kid was saved and nursed back to health by a young Navajo who was the son of the Navajo medicine man who gave Redford Raven his powers. Upon having recovered, Rawhide Kid was trained by the Navajo man into using the wings so that he can be on equal grounds with Red Raven. Upon finding Red Raven, Rawhide Kid was still trying to get a hang of operating the flying harness. Red Raven made a mistake of flying in front of the sun, enabling Rawhide Kid to shoot Red Raven's gun from his hand. Rawhide Kid then wrestled with Red Raven and brought him to the ground. The young Navajo man then burnt both wings in order to protect the secret.<ref>''Rawhide Kid'' #38</ref>\n\nRedford Raven later came to own a new pair of wings and had joined forces with [[Circus of Crime#Old West (1870s) members|Iron Mask's gang]] (consisting of Dr. Danger, Fat Man, [[Hurricane (comics)#Harry Kane|Hurricane]], and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]]). Upon being inspired by [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s brief sojourn in their timeline,<ref>''Avengers'' Vol.1 #142-143</ref> they began to commit high-scaled thefts until the time-traveling [[West Coast Avengers]] showed up, along with contemporary heroes Rawhide Kid, [[Two-Gun Kid]] and the [[Phantom Rider#Lincoln Slade|Phantom Rider]], and stopped the criminals in their tracks. Red Raven ended up fighting [[Iron Man]] and proved totally ineffectual against him; Iron Man tore off his wings, dropping him to the ground. Red Raven and the other criminals were arrested and handed over to the authorities in Tombstone, Arizona.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #18</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRed Raven's costume was reinforced synthetic stretch fabric containing miniature anti-gravity mechanisms, as well as large artificial wings which allowed the Red Raven to fly. He was armed with the Bird-People's advanced weaponry, including a [[ray gun]] and an [[anti-gravity]] gun. He was proficient in basic hand-to-hand combat techniques uniquely styled to make use of his advantage of flight.\n\nAs a Bird-Person, Dania was born with operative wings, hollow bones, and other adaptions for flight.\n\nRedford Raven had no inherent superpowers. He possessed a pair of artificial wings and used them to glide on the wind.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n===Original Red Raven===\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/Red_Raven_%28Liberty_Legion%29_%28Earth-616%29 Original Red Raven] at Marvel Wiki\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/redraven.htm  Red Raven] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

While in prison, Redford Raven shared a cell with a dying Navajo medicine man. The medicine man decided to share his secrets with Redford: He had designed a winged harness that, treated with a secret herb, could be worn by a man and permit him to glide upon the winds. The old Navajo trained Raven in the use of these wings until he died from his illness. Redford Raven tricked the guard into letting him escape by hovering to the ceiling and slipping out. Upon becoming Red Raven, he was able to safely escape the prison simply by flying out of reach of the guards.\n\nRed Raven's first action was to take revenge on Rawhide Kid. Not realizing Red Raven's new abilities, Rawhide Kid fired at Red Raven, who dodged every bullet. Red Raven then shot Rawhide Kid and left him for dead. Rawhide Kid was saved and nursed back to health by a young Navajo who was the son of the Navajo medicine man who gave Redford Raven his powers. Upon having recovered, Rawhide Kid was trained by the Navajo man into using the wings so that he can be on equal grounds with Red Raven. Upon finding Red Raven, Rawhide Kid was still trying to get a hang of operating the flying harness. Red Raven made a mistake of flying in front of the sun, enabling Rawhide Kid to shoot Red Raven's gun from his hand. Rawhide Kid then wrestled with Red Raven and brought him to the ground. The young Navajo man then burnt both wings in order to protect the secret.<ref>''Rawhide Kid'' #38</ref>\n\nRedford Raven later came to own a new pair of wings and had joined forces with [[Circus of Crime#Old West (1870s) members|Iron Mask's gang]] (consisting of Dr. Danger, Fat Man, [[Hurricane (comics)#Harry Kane|Hurricane]], and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]]). Upon being inspired by [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s brief sojourn in their timeline,<ref>''Avengers'' Vol.1 #142-143</ref> they began to commit high-scaled thefts until the time-traveling [[West Coast Avengers]] showed up, along with contemporary heroes Rawhide Kid, [[Two-Gun Kid]] and the [[Phantom Rider#Lincoln Slade|Phantom Rider]], and stopped the criminals in their tracks. Red Raven ended up fighting [[Iron Man]] and proved totally ineffectual against him; Iron Man tore off his wings, dropping him to the ground. Red Raven and the other criminals were arrested and handed over to the authorities in Tombstone, Arizona.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #18</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRed Raven's costume was reinforced synthetic stretch fabric containing miniature anti-gravity mechanisms, as well as large artificial wings which allowed the Red Raven to fly. He was armed with the Bird-People's advanced weaponry, including a [[ray gun]] and an [[anti-gravity]] gun. He was proficient in basic hand-to-hand combat techniques uniquely styled to make use of his advantage of flight.\n\nAs a Bird-Person, Dania was born with operative wings, hollow bones, and other adaptions for flight.\n\nRedford Raven had no inherent superpowers. He possessed a pair of artificial wings and used them to glide on the wind.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n===Original Red Raven===\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/Red_Raven_%28Liberty_Legion%29_%28Earth-616%29 Original Red Raven] at Marvel Wiki\n*[http://www.toonopedia.com/redraven.htm  Red Raven] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

It first begins with Dr. Sanjay Mehra ([[Rakesh Roshan]]) and his wife Sonia ([[Rekha]]) who are part of a car crash. Dr. Mehra has died while Sonia, who is pregnant, survives with injuries. This results in their son, Rohit Mehra ([[Hrithik Roshan]]), being born developmentally disabled. After receiving supernatural abilities from an alien he befriends, Rohit marries his best friend Nisha ([[Preity Zinta]]) by the end of the first film. Their son, Krishna Mehra (also Hrithik Roshan) is born with the same supernatural powers in the second film (Krrish) which he uses to help people, eventually turning into the superhero 'Krrish'. He is later romantically involved with city girl Priya ([[Priyanka Chopra]]). By the end of the second film, the characters Sonia, Rohit, Krishna, and Priya are the only members of the family that are still alive while Nisha died after a few days of Krishna's birth. The third film shows the entry of Kaal ([[Vivek Oberoi]]) who was created by Dr. Arya ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) during an experiment on Rohit thus being Rohit's second son and the main antagonist of the film. Kaal apparently kills Krrish but he is saved by Rohit who dies while giving life to dead Krrish through his solar experiment. Krishna finally kills Kaal and by the end of the third film, Krishna, Priya and their son, Rohit (named after his grandfather Rohit Mehra) are alive while Sonia died somewhere between the events of ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Krrish 3]]''.\n\n===''Koi... Mil Gaya'' (2003)===\n{{Main|Koi... Mil Gaya}}\n\nScientist Sanjay Mehra (Rakesh Roshan) creates a computer program from which he calls for extraterrestrial life. When he believes he has finally gotten a response, the scientific community mocks him. While driving home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead. Sanjay veers off the road and dies, but his pregnant wife Sonia ([[Rekha]]) survives and gives birth to their son Rohit (Hrithik Roshan), who is developmentally disabled as a result of the crash.\n\nAn older Rohit befriends a young woman named Nisha ([[Preity Zinta]]) and they find Sanjay's computer and summon the aliens by accident. The visiting aliens leave in haste, leaving one behind by accident. Rohit, Nisha and Rohit's friends find and befriend the alien, naming him Jadoo (\"Magic\") and discover his psychokinesis abilities. Jadoo discovers that Rohit is mentally abnormal and uses his powers to enhance the boy's mind. Rohit finds himself accepted by most of his peers. A bully, Raj, and his friends attempt to embarrass Rohit multiple times, only to be beaten in fights as well as in sport since Rohit's physical strength and agility are increased along with his mental abilities to the peak of human potential.\n\nEventually, the government gets suspicious of Rohit and suspects him of hiding Jadoo. A group of policemen manages to knock Rohit out and capture Jadoo, preparing to take him to America for testing. However, Rohit wakes up and summons the aliens to return for Jadoo. Using his enhanced abilities, Rohit arrives in time to rescue Jadoo and manages to send him in his species spaceship. As he leaves, Jadoo takes Rohit's powers and Rohit is mentally disabled again. However, this saves him from prosecution by the government and after everything dies down, Jadoo silently returns Rohit's new abilities permanently. Rohit and Nisha lead a happy life together from then on.\n\n===''Krrish'' (2006)===\n{{Main|Krrish}}\n\nFive-year-old orphan Krishna Mehra is undergoing an intelligence quotient test by his professors, who suspect he has high IQ and physical abilities. His grandmother Sonia ([[Rekha]]) takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village in northern India to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) meets Priya ([[Priyanka Chopra]]) when she vacations in the country. Krishna and Priya grow close just before she departs for her home in Singapore.\n\nTo appease her boss, Priya calls Krishna to join her in Singapore, where she tries to get him to perform heroic acts. Krishna does not, as he had promised his grandmother that he would hide his abilities. Krishna learns that his father Rohit was hired to help design a machine to see the future by Dr. Siddhant Arya ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]). He further learned that Rohit had been killed by Dr. Siddhant when he tried to destroy the machine, after learning of Siddhant's evil intentions. This caused his mother, Nisha ([[Preity Zinta]]), to die of a broken heart.\n\nKrishna later goes to a circus where an explosion occurs. He puts on a mask to hide his identity in order to save some trapped children, after which he is given the identity of superhero '''Krrish.''' Vikram Sinha ([[Sharat Saxena]]), who has been searching for Krishna for years, informs Krishna that his father Rohit is alive and Dr. Siddhant has been holding him captive. Krishna follows Siddhant to his island lair, where a huge fight ensues between Krrish and the doctor's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. In the final scene, Krrish mortally wounds Siddhant. Before he dies, Siddhant asks Krrish who he is, and Krishna reveals himself. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and Rohit back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit finds out his wife, Nisha, died after he disappeared. He mourns her, together with his son and mother, but still thanks Jadoo (who is somewhere between the stars) for giving his family this gift.\n\n===''Krrish 3'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Krrish 3}}\n\nRohit Mehra (Hrithik Roshan), who is a professional scientist now, is living a happy life in [[Mumbai]] along with his son Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) who is now married to Priya (Priyanka Chopra). While working in the laboratory, Rohit invents a device to bring back the life of dead tissue using solar energy through reflections but failed to complete it because of the high intensity of sun rays. Priya works as a journalist for Aaj Tak whereas Krishna is struggling hard to keep a steady job while helping the city with his superpowers as the superhero 'Krrish'.\n\nSomewhere in an isolated area, the owner of Kaal laboratories, Kaal ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), who has extraordinary telepathic powers, is completely handicapped with his body except his brain and two fingers. He has been creating powerful human-animal mutants (or Maanvars he calls them) using his DNA, particularly the ruthless chameleon mutant Kaya ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) who can assume any form she wants. Kaal has been trying hard to cure himself but has been unsuccessful thus far. He dreams of making billions by first creating dangerous viruses using his DNA, spreading them in densely populated areas and then selling his own antidotes.\n\nKaal chooses India as his next target and with Kaya and other mutants' help, he spreads his newly created virus in Mumbai which creates havoc among the city. Rohit, Krishna, and Priya remain unaffected by the virus. Rohit manages to create an antidote using Krishna's blood and Krishna spreads it throughout the city via explosions for quick effect. For this, Kaal's mutants attack and thrash Rohit's laboratory but Rohit and Priya are saved by Krrish. Priya is injured and hospitalized while one of the mutants is also injured which is kept in scientific custody by Rohit and his team. To find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood, Kaal kidnaps Priya who is pregnant with Krishna's child and Kaya takes Priya's form. Rohit and Krishna are informed that Priya has lost her child. Afterward, Kaya starts living as Priya with Krishna and seeks for the antidote formula. Rohit departs to Singapore to explore some answers after he finds out that the virus has a link with his own DNA and Kaal laboratories as well. Meanwhile, Kaya develops an attraction towards Krishna but he soon discovers her true identity and reveals himself as Krrish to her. Kaya decides to help Krishna and discloses that Priya and her child are still safe in Kaal's hideout.\n\nIn Singapore, Rohit is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Rohit unveils to Kaal that he was kidnapped by Dr. Siddhant Arya ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) who tried to create a synonymous avatar of the former but got only a disabled child and donated him into an orphanage where the boy was adopted by a wealthy family, who eventually grows up to become Kaal. Kaal cures himself by using Rohit's body serum. Krishna saves Priya after killing the mutants and finally reaches the correct hideout with Kaya's help where Kaal kills both of them. Kaal then surrounds himself completely into a steel body due to his powerful magnetic powers and departs to Mumbai in search of Priya meanwhile causing destruction to the city.\n\nAngered by Krishna's death, Rohit decides to bring Krrish back to life by using the device invented by him but sacrifices himself to absorb the high intensity of sunlight. Krrish, now thrice as powerful as before, comes after him and saves Priya. Krrish, unable to crush Kaal after brutally fighting with him, concludes that the latter could be demolished by melting his steel body. He quickly adjusts the mirrors for reflection and points Rohit's device towards Kaal whose steel body melts finally. The film ends with Priya delivering a baby which also shows signs of extraordinary power.\n\n===''Krrish'' 4 (2021)===\nRakesh Roshan has revealed that he will soon start working for ''Krrish 4'' as he feels that the public wants it. \"I will start working on the sequel soon. Due to public demand, we may include some sidekick characters as well,\" said Rakesh Roshan while celebrating the success of ''Krrish 3'', \"I'm currently not working on a film outside the ''Krrish'' franchise with Hrithik Roshan, but I will do a film in the future. I would love to direct him in a fresh script as soon as I'm relieved with this franchise,\" Rakesh Roshan explained. He was accompanied by Hrithik Roshan at this event in Tamil Nadu on Monday, 12 November. Hrithik Roshan spoke about how he felt playing a superhero. \"Being a superhero is like playing any one of us because we all have it inside us.

It first begins with Dr. Sanjay Mehra ([[Rakesh Roshan]]) and his wife Sonia ([[Rekha]]) who are part of a car-crash. Dr Mehra is killed while Sonia, who is pregnant, survives with injuries. This results in their son, Rohit Mehra ([[Hrithik Roshan]]), being born developmentally disabled. After receiving supernatural abilities from an alien he befriends, Rohit marries his best friend Nisha ([[Preity Zinta]]) by the end of the first film. Their son, Krishna Mehra (also Hrithik Roshan) is born with the same supernatural powers in the second film (Krrish) which he uses to help people, eventually turning into the superhero 'Krrish'. He is later romantically involved with city girl Priya ([[Priyanka Chopra]]). By the end of the second film, the characters Sonia, Rohit, Krishna and Priya are the only members of the family that are still alive while Nisha died after a few days of Krishna's birth. The third film shows the entry of Kaal ([[Vivek Oberoi]]) who was created by Dr. Arya ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) during an experiment on Rohit thus being Rohit's second son and the main antagonist of the film. Kaal apparently kills Krrish but he is saved by Rohit who dies while giving life to dead Krrish through his solar experiment. Krishna finally kills Kaal and by the end of the third film, Krishna, Priya and their son, Rohit (named after his grandfather Rohit Mehra) are alive while Sonia died somewhere between the events of ''[[Krrish]]'' and ''[[Krrish 3]]''.\n\n===''Koi... Mil Gaya'' (2003)===\n{{Main|Koi... Mil Gaya}}\n\nScientist Sanjay Mehra (Rakesh Roshan) creates a computer program from which he calls for extraterrestrial life. When he believes he has finally gotten a response, the scientific community mocks him. While driving home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead. Sanjay veers off the road and dies, but his pregnant wife Sonia ([[Rekha]]) survives and gives birth to their son Rohit (Hrithik Roshan), who is developmentally disabled as a result of the crash.\n\nAn older Rohit befriends a young woman named Nisha ([[Preity Zinta]]) and they find Sanjay's computer and summon the aliens by accident. The visiting aliens leave in haste, leaving one behind by accident. Rohit, Nisha and Rohit's friends find and befriend the alien, naming him Jadoo (\"Magic\") and discover his psychokinesis abilities. Jadoo discovers that Rohit is mentally abnormal and uses his powers to enhance the boy's mind. Rohit finds himself accepted by most of his peers. A bully, Raj, and his friends attempt to embarrass Rohit multiple times, only to be beaten in fights as well as in sport since Rohit's physical strength and agility are increased along with his mental abilities to the peak of human potential.\n\nEventually, the government gets suspicious of Rohit and suspects him of hiding Jadoo. A group of policemen manage to knock Rohit out and capture Jadoo, preparing to take him to America for testing. However, Rohit wakes up and summons the aliens to return for Jadoo. Using his enhanced abilities, Rohit arrives in time to rescue Jadoo and manages to send him in his species spaceship. As he leaves, Jadoo takes Rohit's powers and Rohit is mentally disabled again. However, this saves him from prosecution by the government and after everything dies down, Jadoo silently returns Rohit's new abilities permanently. Rohit and Nisha lead a happy life together from then on.\n\n===''Krrish'' (2006)===\n{{Main|Krrish}}\n\nFive-year-old orphan Krishna Mehra is undergoing an intelligence quotient test by his professors, who suspect he has high IQ and physical abilities. His grandmother Sonia ([[Rekha]]) takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village in northern India to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) meets Priya ([[Priyanka Chopra]]) when she vacations in the country. Krishna and Priya grow close just before she departs for her home in Singapore.\n\nTo appease her boss, Priya calls Krishna to join her in Singapore, where she tries to get him to perform heroic acts. Krishna does not, as he had promised his grandmother that he would hide his abilities. Krishna learns that his father Rohit was hired to help design a machine to see the future by Dr Siddhant Arya ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]). He further learned that Rohit had been killed by Dr Siddhant when he tried to destroy the machine, after learning of Siddhant's evil intentions. This caused his mother, Nisha ([[Preity Zinta]]), to die of a broken heart.\n\nKrishna later goes to a circus where an explosion occurs. He puts on a mask to hide his identity in order to save some trapped children, after which he is given the identity of superhero '''Krrish.''' Vikram Sinha ([[Sharat Saxena]]), who has been searching for Krishna for years, informs Krishna that his father Rohit is alive and Dr Siddhant has been holding him captive. Krishna follows Siddhant to his island lair, where a huge fight ensues between Krrish and the doctor's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. In the final scene, Krrish mortally wounds Siddhant. Before he dies, Siddhant asks Krrish who he is, and Krishna reveals himself. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and Rohit back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit finds out his wife, Nisha, died after he disappeared. He mourns her, together with his son and mother, but still thanks Jadoo (who is somewhere between the stars) for giving his family this gift.\n\n===''Krrish 3'' (2013)===\n{{Main|Krrish 3}}\n\nRohit Mehra (Hrithik Roshan), who is a professional scientist now, is living a happy life in [[Mumbai]] along with his son Krishna (Hrithik Roshan) who is now married to Priya (Priyanka Chopra). While working in the laboratory, Rohit invents a device to bring back the life of dead tissue using solar energy through reflections but failed to complete it because of the high intensity of sun rays. Priya works as a journalist for Aaj Tak whereas Krishna is struggling hard to keep a steady job while helping the city with his superpowers as the superhero 'Krrish'.\n\nSomewhere in an isolated area, the owner of Kaal laboratories, Kaal ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), who has extraordinary telepathic powers, is completely handicapped with his body except his brain and two fingers. He has been creating powerful human-animal mutants (or Maanvars he calls them) using his DNA, particularly the ruthless chameleon mutant Kaya ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) who can assume any form she wants. Kaal has been trying hard to cure himself but has been unsuccessful thus far. He dreams of making billions by first creating dangerous viruses using his DNA, spreading them in densely populated areas and then selling his own antidotes.\n\nKaal chooses India as his next target and with Kaya and other mutants' help, he spreads his newly created virus in Mumbai which creates havoc among the city. Rohit, Krishna and Priya remain unaffected by the virus. Rohit manages to create an antidote using Krishna's blood and Krishna spreads it throughout the city via explosions for quick effect. For this, Kaal's mutants attack and thrash Rohit's laboratory but Rohit and Priya are saved by Krrish. Priya is injured and hospitalized while one of the mutants is also injured which is kept in scientific custody by Rohit and his team. To find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood, Kaal kidnaps Priya who is pregnant with Krishna's child and Kaya takes Priya's form. Rohit and Krishna are informed that Priya has lost her child. Afterwards, Kaya starts living as Priya with Krishna and seeks for the antidote formula. Rohit departs to Singapore to explore some answers after he finds out that the virus has a link with his own DNA and Kaal laboratories as well. Meanwhile, Kaya develops an attraction towards Krishna but he soon discovers her true identity and reveals himself as Krrish to her. Kaya decides to help Krishna and discloses that Priya and her child are still safe in Kaal's hideout.\n\nIn Singapore, Rohit is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Rohit unveils to Kaal that he was kidnapped by Dr Siddhant Arya ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) who tried to create a synonymous avatar of the former but got only a disabled child and donated him into an orphanage where the boy was adopted by a wealthy family, who eventually grows up to become Kaal. Kaal cures himself by using Rohit's body serum. Krishna saves Priya after killing the mutants and finally reaches the correct hideout with Kaya's help where Kaal kills both of them. Kaal then surrounds himself completely into a steel body due to his powerful magnetic powers and departs to Mumbai in search of Priya meanwhile causing destruction to the city.\n\nAngered by Krishna's death, Rohit decides to bring Krrish back to life by using the device invented by him but sacrifices himself to absorb the high intensity of sunlight. Krrish, now thrice as powerful as before, comes after him and saves Priya. Krrish, unable to crush Kaal after brutally fighting with him, concludes that the latter could be demolished by melting his steel body. He quickly adjusts the mirrors for reflection and points Rohit's device towards Kaal whose steel body melts finally. The film ends with Priya delivering a baby which also shows signs of extraordinary power.\n\n===''Krrish'' 4 (2021)===\nRakesh Roshan has revealed that he will soon start working for ''Krrish 4'' as he feels that the public wants it. \"I will start working on the sequel soon. Due to public demand, we may include some sidekick characters as well,\" said Rakesh Roshan while celebrating the success of ''Krrish 3'', \"I'm currently not working on a film outside the ''Krrish'' franchise with Hrithik Roshan, but I will do a film in the future.
