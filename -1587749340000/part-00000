announced that the Swiss national coronavirus contact tracing app will be based on DP-3T.<ref>{{Cite

W. I.|last2=Corporation|first2=a branch of the Swiss Broadcasting|website=SWI swissinfo.ch|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> On the 22 April 2020, the [[Austrian Red Cross]], leading on the national digital contact tracing app, announced its migration to the approach of DP-3T.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20200422_OTS0052/stopp-corona-app-weiterentwicklung-mit-hilfe-der-zivilgesellschaft|title=Stopp Corona-App: Weiterentwicklung mit Hilfe der Zivilgesellschaft|website=OTS.at|language=de|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe DP-3T protocol works off the basis of Ephemeral IDs (EphID), semi-random rotating strings that uniquely identify clients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/frances-inria-and-germanys-fraunhofer-detail-their-robert-contact-tracing-protocol/|title=France\u2019s Inria and Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer detail their ROBERT contact-tracing protocol|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> When two clients encounter each other, they exchange EphIDs and store them locally in a contact log.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/|title=Protecting Lives & Liberty: How Contact Tracing Can Foil COVID-19 & Big Brother|website=ncase.me|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> Then, once a user tests positive for infection, a report is sent to a central server. Each client on the network then collects the reports from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a EphID contained in the report. If a matching EphID is found, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like PEPP-PT, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Ephemeral ID ==\nSimilar to the [[TCN Protocol]] and its Temporary Contact Numbers, the DP-3T protocol makes use of 16 byte ''Ephemeral IDs'' (EphID) to uniquely identify devices in the proximity of a client. These EphIDs are logged locally on a receiving client's device and is never transmitted to third parties.\n\nTo generate an EphID, first a client generates a secret key that rotates daily (<math>SK_t</math>) by computing <math>SK_t = H(SK_{t-1})</math>, where <math>H()</math> is a cryptographic hash function such as [[SHA-2|SHA-256]]. <math>SK_0</math> is calculated by a standard secret key algorithm such as [[Ed25519]]. The client will use <math>SK_t</math> during day <math>t</math> to generate a list of EphIDs. At the beginning of the day, a client generates a local list of size <math>n=(24*60)/l</math> new EphIDs to broadcast throughout the day, where <math>l</math> is the lifetime of a EphID in minutes. To prevent malicious third parties from establishing patterns of movement by tracing static identifiers over a large area, EphIDs are rotated frequently. Given the secret day key <math>SK_t</math>, each device computes <math>EphID_n(BK) = PRG(PRF(SK_t, BK))</math>, where <math>BK</math> is a global fixed string, <math>PRF()</math> is a pseudo-random function like [[HMAC-SHA256]], and <math>PRG()</math> is a stream cipher producing <math>n * 16</math> bytes. This stream is then split into 16-byte chunks and randomly sorted to obtain the EphIDs of the day.\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe DP-3T protocol is made up of two separate responsibilities, tracking and logging close range encounters with other users (device handshake), and the reporting of those encounters such that other clients can determine if they have been in contact with an infected patient (infection reporting). Like most digital contact tracing protocols, the device handshake uses [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] to find and exchange details with local clients, and the infection reporting stage uses [[HTTPS]] to upload a report to a central reporting server. Additionally, like other [[:Category:Digital contact tracing protocols with decentralized reporting|decentralized reporting protocols]], the central reporting server never has access to any client's contact logs; rather the report is structured such that clients can individually derive contact from the report.\n\n=== Device handshake ===\nIn order to find and communicate with clients in proximity of a device, the protocol makes use of both the server and client modes of Bluetooth LE, switching between the two frequently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android/blob/develop/dp3t-sdk/sdk/src/main/java/org/dpppt/android/sdk/internal/TracingService.java|title=DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android/dp3t-sdk/sdk/src/main/java/org/dpppt/android/sdk/internal/TracingService.java|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> In server mode the device advertises it's EphID to be read by clients, with clients scanning for servers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/71/what-is-a-client-and-server-in-ble|title=What is a client and server in BLE?|website=Nordic DevZone|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> When a client and server meet, the client reads the EphID and subsequently writes it's own EphID to the server. The two devices then store the encounter in their respective contact logs in addition to a [[timestamp]] and signal strength. The signal strength is later used as part of the infection reporting process to estimate the distance between an infected patient and the user.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen reporting infection, there exists a central reporting server controlled by the local health authority. Before a user can submit a report, the health authority must first confirm infection and generate a code authorizing the client to upload the report. The health authority additionally instructs the patient on which day their report should begin (denoted as <math>t</math>). The client then uploads the pair <math>SK_t</math> and <math>t</math> to the central reporting server, which other clients in the network download at a later date. By using the same algorithm used to generate the original EphIDs, clients can reproduce every EphID used for the period past and including <math>t</math>, which they then check against their local contact log to determine whether the user has been in close proximity to an infected patient.\n\nIn the entire protocol, the health authority never has access to contact logs, and only serve to test patients and authorize report submissions.<ref name=\"whitepaper\" />{{Rp|p. 11}}\n\n== Epidemiological analysis ==\nWhen a user installs a DP-3T app, they are asked if they want to opt in to sharing data with [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]]. If the user consents, when they are confirmed to have been within close contact of an infected patient the respective contact log entry containing the encounter is scheduled to be sent to a central statistics server. In order to prevent malicious third parties from discovering potential infections by detecting these uploads; reports are sent at regular intervals, with indistinguishable dummy reports sent when there is no data to transmit.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[BlueTrace]]\n* [[TCN Protocol]]\n* [[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]]\n* [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]]\n\n==

announced that the Swiss national coronavirus contact tracing app will be based on DP-3T.<ref>{{Cite

W. I.|last2=Corporation|first2=a branch of the Swiss Broadcasting|website=SWI swissinfo.ch|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> On the 22 April 2020, the [[Austrian Red Cross]], leading on the national digital contact tracing app, announced its migration to the approach of DP-3T.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20200422_OTS0052/stopp-corona-app-weiterentwicklung-mit-hilfe-der-zivilgesellschaft|title=Stopp Corona-App: Weiterentwicklung mit Hilfe der Zivilgesellschaft|website=OTS.at|language=de|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe DP-3T protocol works off the basis of Ephemeral IDs (EphID), semi-random rotating strings that uniquely identify clients.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/frances-inria-and-germanys-fraunhofer-detail-their-robert-contact-tracing-protocol/|title=France\u2019s Inria and Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer detail their ROBERT contact-tracing protocol|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> When two clients encounter each other, they exchange EphIDs and store them locally in a contact log.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ncase.me/contact-tracing/|title=Protecting Lives & Liberty: How Contact Tracing Can Foil COVID-19 & Big Brother|website=ncase.me|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> Then, once a user tests positive for infection, a report is sent to a central server. Each client on the network then collects the reports from the server and independently checks their local contact logs for a EphID contained in the report. If a matching EphID is found, then the user has come in close contact with an infected patient, and is warned by the client. Since each device locally verifies contact logs, and thus contact logs are never transmitted to third parties, the central reporting server cannot by itself ascertain the identity or contact log of any client in the network. This is in contrast to competing protocols like PEPP-PT, where the central reporting server receives and processes client contact logs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@frankvolkel/tracetogether-under-the-hood-7d5e509aeb5d|title=TraceTogether: under the hood|last=Liauw|first=\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddec Frank|date=2020-04-09|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n== Ephemeral ID ==\nSimilar to the [[TCN Protocol]] and its Temporary Contact Numbers, the DP-3T protocol makes use of 16 byte ''Ephemeral IDs'' (EphID) to uniquely identify devices in the proximity of a client. These EphIDs are logged locally on a receiving client's device and is never transmitted to third parties.\n\nTo generate an EphID, first a client generates a secret key that rotates daily (<math>SK_t</math>) by computing <math>SK_t = H(SK_{t-1})</math>, where <math>H()</math> is a cryptographic hash function such as [[SHA-2|SHA-256]]. <math>SK_0</math> is calculated by a standard secret key algorithm such as [[Ed25519]]. The client will use <math>SK_t</math> during day <math>t</math> to generate a list of EphIDs. At the beginning of the day, a client generates a local list of size <math>n=(24*60)/l</math> new EphIDs to broadcast throughout the day, where <math>l</math> is the lifetime of a EphID in minutes. To prevent malicious third parties from establishing patterns of movement by tracing static identifiers over a large area, EphIDs are rotated frequently. Given the secret day key <math>SK_t</math>, each device computes <math>EphID_n(BK) = PRG(PRF(SK_t, BK))</math>, where <math>BK</math> is a global fixed string, <math>PRF()</math> is a pseudo-random function like [[HMAC-SHA256]], and <math>PRG()</math> is a stream cipher producing <math>n * 16</math> bytes. This stream is then split into 16-byte chunks and randomly sorted to obtain the EphIDs of the day.\n\n== Technical specification ==\nThe DP-3T protocol is made up of two separate responsibilities, tracking and logging close range encounters with other users (device handshake), and the reporting of those encounters such that other clients can determine if they have been in contact with an infected patient (infection reporting). Like most digital contact tracing protocols, the device handshake uses [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] to find and exchange details with local clients, and the infection reporting stage uses [[HTTPS]] to upload a report to a central reporting server. Additionally, like other [[:Category:Digital contact tracing protocols with decentralized reporting|decentralized reporting protocols]], the central reporting server never has access to any client's contact logs; rather the report is structured such that clients can individually derive contact from the report.\n\n=== Device handshake ===\nIn order to find and communicate with clients in proximity of a device, the protocol makes use of both the server and client modes of Bluetooth LE, switching between the two frequently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android/blob/develop/dp3t-sdk/sdk/src/main/java/org/dpppt/android/sdk/internal/TracingService.java|title=DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android/dp3t-sdk/sdk/src/main/java/org/dpppt/android/sdk/internal/TracingService.java|last=|first=|date=|website=GitHub|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> In server mode the device advertises it's EphID to be read by clients, with clients scanning for servers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/71/what-is-a-client-and-server-in-ble|title=What is a client and server in BLE?|website=Nordic DevZone|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> When a client and server meet, the client reads the EphID and subsequently writes it's own EphID to the server. The two devices then store the encounter in their respective contact logs in addition to a [[timestamp]] and signal strength. The signal strength is later used as part of the infection reporting process to estimate the distance between an infected patient and the user.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen reporting infection, there exists a central reporting server controlled by the local health authority. Before a user can submit a report, the health authority must first confirm infection and generate a code authorizing the client to upload the report. The health authority additionally instructs the patient on which day their report should begin (denoted as <math>t</math>). The client then uploads the pair <math>SK_t</math> and <math>t</math> to the central reporting server, which other clients in the network download at a later date. By using the same algorithm used to generate the original EphIDs, clients can reproduce every EphID used for the period past and including <math>t</math>, which they then check against their local contact log to determine whether the user has been in close proximity to an infected patient.\n\nIn the entire protocol, the health authority never has access to contact logs, and only serve to test patients and authorize report submissions.<ref name=\"whitepaper\" />{{Rp|p. 11}}\n\n== Epidemiological analysis ==\nWhen a user installs a DP-3T app, they are asked if they want to opt in to sharing data with [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]]. If the user consents, when they are confirmed to have been within close contact of an infected patient the respective contact log entry containing the encounter is scheduled to be sent to a central statistics server. In order to prevent malicious third parties from discovering potential infection by detecting the upload of statistic reports; reports are sent at regular intervals, with indistinguishable dummy reports sent when there is no data to transmit.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[BlueTrace]]\n* [[TCN Protocol]]\n* [[Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing]]\n* [[Google / Apple contact tracing project]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://github.com/DP-3T DP-3T Github]\n\n[[Category:Application layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:Software associated with the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Software using the MPL license]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols]]\n[[Category:Software using the Apache license]]\n[[Category:2020 coronavirus pandemic in Europe]]\n[[Category:Digital contact tracing protocols with decentralized reporting]]\n", "name_user": "Bravetheif", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEpidemiological analysis", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_Privacy-Preserving_Proximity_Tracing"}

Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[neckerchief]] [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, vests, spurs, [[cowboy boot]]s, and [[buckskins]] (alternatively [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]]). Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Mexicans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Outlaw (stock character)#American Western|outlaws]], [[gambling|gamblers]], soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk). The ambience is usually punctuated with a [[Western music (North America)|Western music]] [[Film score|score]], including [[American folk music|American]] and [[Music of Spain|Spanish]]/[[Music of Mexico|Mexican folk music]] such as [[country music|country]], [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], [[New Mexico music]], and [[ranchera]]s.\n\nWesterns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape of deserts and mountains. Often, the vast landscape plays an important role, presenting a \"mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West.\"<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\">{{cite book|last=Cowie | first=Peter | title= John Ford and the American West | publisher=Harry Abrams Inc. | location= New York | year=2004 | isbn= 978-0-8109-4976-8}}</ref> Specific settings include ranches, small frontier towns, saloons, railways, wilderness, and isolated military forts of the Wild West.\n\nCommon plots include:\n* The construction of a railroad or a telegraph line on the wild frontier.\n* Ranchers protecting their family ranch from [[rustler]]s or large landowners, or who build a ranch empire.\n* Revenge stories, which hinge on the chase and pursuit by someone who has been wronged.\n* Stories about cavalry fighting Native Americans.\n* Outlaw gang plots.\n* Stories about a lawman or bounty hunter tracking down his quarry.\n\nMany Westerns use a stock plot of depicting a crime, then showing the pursuit of the wrongdoer, ending in revenge and retribution, which is often dispensed through a [[shootout]] or [[Fast draw|quick-draw]] duel.<ref name=\"Agnew\">Agnew, Jeremy.

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]</ref> \n\nClassic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:The Great Train Robbery (1903) - yt.webm|alt=|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903)]]\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.  He preferred to remain anonymous, so he resigned and built a sixth grave that supposedly held his body.  He fights on as a lawman, wearing a mask, for, \"Outlaws live in a world of fear.  Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A.

Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and [[The Dark Tower series|''The Dark Tower'' series]] of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].\n\n====Florida Western====\n[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office.

[[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held.

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]].

American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[neckerchief]] [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, vests, spurs, [[cowboy boot]]s, and [[buckskins]] (alternatively [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]]). Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], [[Spaniards]], [[Mexicans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Outlaw (stock character)#American Western|outlaws]], [[gambling|gamblers]], soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk).

Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western film ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) became one of the biggest hits of that year, and made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream movie star. The popularity of Westerns continued to grow in the 1940s, with the release of films such as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943), ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948), and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948). The 1950s have been described as the \"Golden Age of the Western,\" and saw the release of films such as ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' (1950), ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[Wichita (1955 film)|Wichita]]'' (1955),  ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). Notable Western films released in the 1960s include ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), and ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]</ref> \n\nClassic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.\n\n[[File:The Great Train Robbery (1903) - yt.webm|alt=|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903)]]\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.

Fear of the mysterious.\"]]\nThe Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.<ref name=\"kimnewman\">{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}</ref>  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice\u2013\"frontier justice\"\u2013dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/>  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.\n\nIn some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[Knight-errant|knights errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].<ref name=\"kimnewman\"/> Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures, but only to their own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.\n\nThe Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Oftentimes, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, \"where life has no value\".\n\n==Film==\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[File:Gary Cooper 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'']]\nThe [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those \"set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]].\"<ref>{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.<ref>McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133</ref> Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.<ref>Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.</ref>  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival\u2013and as a means to settle disputes using \"frontier justice\". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWestern films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html, ''New York Times Magazine''] (November 10, 2007).</ref> leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a \"pulp\" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining B Westerns. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&f=false Indick, William.

While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the \"Injuns\" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorizing small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''.\n\nEarly Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, as in other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOften, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) \"present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans\".<ref name=\"Cowie 2004\"/>\n\n===Subgenres===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Dan Duryea in Along Came Jones trailer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Duryea]] in ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945)]]\nAuthor and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:<ref>Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967</ref><ref name=\"cgw199010\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&pub=2&id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\n# ''Union Pacific story''.

Many epic Westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).\n\n====Euro-Western====\nEuro-Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]). Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns<ref>{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher & British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}</ref> because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in [[Yugoslavia]], were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. Some new Euro-Westerns emerged in the 2010s, including [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']], and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.\n\n====Fantasy Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nFantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include fantasy mythology as background.

An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].\n\n====Greek Western====\nAccording to the naming conventions after [[Spaghetti Western]], in Greece is also referred to as \"fasolada Western\" (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 = bean soup, i.e. the so called national dish of Greece).

Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.\n\n==== Indo Western ====\nThe first Western films made in India \u2013 ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], perhaps most resembles the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular \"zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office.

[[Laal Kaptaan]] (2019) is an Indo western starring [[Saif Ali Khan]] which is set during of rise of [[British Empire]] in India.\n\n====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====\nWhile many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].\n\n====Meat pie Western====\n{{main|Meat pie Western}} \nThe Meat pie Western (a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker \"[[Spaghetti Western]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=Hollywood|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|first=John-Michael|last=Howson|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}</ref>) is a Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].<ref name=AusF>{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0195507843|page=310}}</ref> Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[The Kangaroo Kid (1950 film)|The Kangaroo Kid]]'' (1950),''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982)  and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre.<ref name=DT2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-meat-pie-westerns-have-been-around-for-more-than-a-century/news-story/220b01591983bdbc46fef9cacd5fa925?nk=d2a04456400b3ffd92de3375f1b5fc9e-1558436137|publisher=Daily Telegraph|work=Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2018|title=Australian 'meat pie' westerns have been around for more than a century|first=Troy|last=Lennon|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Northwestern====\nThe [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].\n\n====Ostern====\n{{main|Ostern}}\n[[Ostern]]s, also known as \"Red Western\"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],<nowiki>   and usually portrayed the </nowiki>[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.\n\n[[Gojko Miti\u0107]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die S\u00f6hne der gro\u00dfen B\u00e4rin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.\n\n====Pornographic Western====\nThe most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n====Ramen Western====\nFirst used in the publicity of the film [[Tampopo]]. the term 'Ramen Western' is play on words using a national dish as a prefix like [[Spaghetti Western]] or Meat Pie Western. The term is used to describe Western style films set in Asia. Examples include ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Weird]]'' and ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ramen Western|url=http://www.criminalelement.com/ramen-westerns-far-east-meets-old-west/|website=criminalelement.com|date=2011-08-16}}</ref>\n\n====Revisionist Western====\nAfter the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as \"savages\" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), [[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.\n\n====Science fiction Western====\nThe [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965), ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s \"Six Gun Planet\" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.com/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the Western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].\n\n====Space Western====\nThe [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of lawless frontiers in [[Deep space exploration|deep space]], while more overt influences may feature literal [[Space Cowboy (disambiguation)|cowboys in outer space]] who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[BraveStarr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''Firefly'' TV series). Another example is the Japanese anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''. The classic Western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977, with 2018's ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and 2019's ''[[Star Wars: The Mandalorian]]'' more directly featuring Western tropes. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars.\"\n\n====Spaghetti Western====\n{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the \"[[Spaghetti Westerns]]\" also known as \"Italo-Westerns\". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), the third film of the [[Dollars Trilogy]].  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almer\u00eda|region of Almer\u00eda]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical Westerns.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}</ref> Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.\n[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|[[Clint Eastwood]] as the ambiguously-named protagonist of the [[Dollars Trilogy]] (marketed as \"the [[Man with No Name]]\") in a publicity image of ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'', a film by [[Sergio Leone]].]]\n\nThe Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.<ref name=TG/> Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]<ref name=TG/> became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]].

It is a more rare Western, as most focus during warm weather or areas where it doesn't snow. Popular films of this subgenre are [[Sergio Corbucci|Sergio Corbucci's]] ''[[ The Great Silence ]]'' (1968) and [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' (2015).\n\n====Weird Western====\n{{main|Weird West}}\nThe [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. The ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with Western.\n\n===Genre studies===\n[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]\n\nIn the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.\n\nOne of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that \"Westerns\" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered \"Westerns.\"\n\n===Influences===\nBeing period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 }}</ref> ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: 'Films of Kenneth Anger' and 'Samurai Classics'|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}</ref> Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=Far Cry from the Original Site |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 }} December 14, 2015</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called \"[[Red Western]]\" or \"Ostern\". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAn offshoot of the Western genre is the \"post-apocalyptic\" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as \"''Wagon Train'' to the stars\" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nMore recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|left|thumb|<center>[[John Wayne]] (1948)</center>]]\n\nThe character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir|noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''\u2014an individual bound only by his own private code of honor\u2014has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet \"New Canaan\", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse\u2014with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held.

The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.<ref>{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}</ref>\n\nLiterary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].\n\n==Television==\n{{Main|Westerns on television|List of Westerns on television}}\n[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]\n[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.<ref>Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland & Company, 1995)</ref> Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1955-1962), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).

(editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''</ref> Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'', and the short-lived but highly-acclaimed ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)]]'' that originated from a miniseries with the same name. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006. [[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|''Hell on Wheels'']], a fictionalized story of the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] for five seasons between 2011 and 2016. ''[[Longmire (TV series)|Longmire]]'' was a Western series that centers on [[Walt Longmire]], a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, [[Wyoming]]. Originally aired on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] network from 2012 to 2014 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] in 2015 until the show's conclusion in 2017. \n\n[[File:Wild West 1908.jpg|thumb|300px|\"As Wild felled one of the redskins by a blow from the butt of his revolver, and sprang for the one with the tomahawk, the chief's daughter suddenly appeared. Raising her hands, she exclaimed, 'Go back, Young Wild West. I will save her!'\" (1908)]]\n\n==Visual art==\n{{Main|Artists of the American West}}\nA number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as \"Western Art\" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the \"Wild West\" on canvas.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12\u201327}}</ref> Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.<ref>{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nThe popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.\n\n===Anime and manga===\nWith [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[K\u014dya no Sh\u014dnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[sh\u014dnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the \"Steel Ball Run\" race.\n\n===Comics===\n[[Western comics]] have included serious entries, (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (namely ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]'') or more modern ones as [[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').\n\n===Games===\nWestern [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive|Desperados]]'' series (2001\u2013), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (2009\u2013)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).\n\n===Radio dramas===\nWestern [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun\u2013Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Web series===\nWesterns have been showcased in short episodic web series.

[[Mille Lacs Lake|Mille Lacs]] Chief Fine-Day was an early member of Enmegahbowh's church, and took over the mission in 1861.\n\n==The Dakota War==\nIn 1821, the Sioux on the upper Minnesota River entered into two treaties with the United States government, the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and the [[Treaty of Mendota]], which together ceded their claims to millions of acres and enabled white settlement in Minnesota. In exchange, the Sioux were to receive a reservation and annual payments totaling more than two million dollars, but ultimately received little other than a few trade goods. Most of the payments were actually made to white traders (supposedly for goods provided to the Sioux) or stolen through corruption within the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. When Minnesota became a state in 1858, the tribes sent representatives to Washington, D.C. led by [[Little Crow]] to complain about not receiving the benefits negotiated in the treaty, but had little success. The land on their reservation proved not arable, and new settlement practices restricted hunting.\n\nDuring the [[Dakota War of 1862]], which began as treaty payments were due for distribution to the starving Sioux at [[Fort Ridgely]], the Gull Lake Band of [[Mississippi Chippewa]] rose to attack near-by [[Fort Ripley (Minnesota fort)|Fort Ripley]]. Enmegahbowh prevented other Ojibwa bands from joining the Gull Lake Band, for which the rebels imprisoned him. Enmegahbowh escaped and traveled thirty miles at night to warn Fort Ripley. This discouraged the Gull Lake Band from attacking the fort. However, many Ojibwe resented Enmegahbowh's actions for years, even though he followed his people (and the Gull Lake band and other Ojibwa) when they were removed to the environs of the [[Leech Lake Indian Reservation]] and then eventually to the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]].<ref name=thomas/>\n\nIn 1867 Bishop Whipple ordained Enmegahbowh a priest.<ref name=neslund>Neslund, Robert, \"St. Columba's Mission, co-founded by Enmegahbowh, celebrates its sesquicentennial\", ''Soundings'', June 2002, Vol.24, Number 3, p.14]</ref> In 1869 he encouraged Chief White Cloud's mission to establish peace between the Ojibwe and the Sioux in 1869.<ref name=thomas/>\n\nIn March 1880, Enmegahbowh and Chief Fine-Day traveled across the eastern United States for three months in order to raise money for a new St. Columba Episcopal Church at White Earth. While in Ohio, they impressed the governor, and also addressed the Ohio state legislature, raising $6000 for their project. After Chief Fine-Day died in 1883, Enmegahbowh referred to him as \"our noblest chief\" and recommended that a stained glass window in the church memorialize him.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nEnmegahbowh died at the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern [[Minnesota]] on June 12, 1902 at the age of 95, and is buried in St. Columba's churchyard.

[[Mille Lacs Lake|Mille Lacs]] Chief Fine-Day was an early member of Enmegahbowh's church, and took over the mission in 1861.\n\n==The Dakota War==\nIn 1821, the Sioux on the upper Minnesota River entered into two treaties with the United States government, the [[Treaty of Traverse des Sioux]] and the [[Treaty of Mendota]], which together ceded their claims to millions of acres and enabled white settlement in Minnesota. In exchange, the Sioux were to receive a reservation and annual payments totaling more than two million dollars, but ultimately received little other than a few trade goods. Most of the payments were actually made to white traders (supposedly for goods provided to the Sioux) or stolen through corruption within the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. When Minnesota became a state in 1858, the tribes sent representatives to Washington, D.C. led by [[Little Crow]] to complain about not receiving the benefits negotiated in the treaty, but had little success. The land on their reservation proved not arable, and new settlement practices restricted hunting.\n\nDuring the [[Dakota War of 1862]], which began as treaty payments were due for distribution to the starving Sioux at [[Fort Ridgely]], the Gull Lake Band of [[Mississippi Chippewa]] rose to attack near-by [[Fort Ripley (Minnesota fort)|Fort Ripley]]. Enmegahbowh prevented other Ojibwa bands from joining the Gull Lake Band, for which the rebels imprisoned him. Enmegahbowh escaped and traveled thirty miles at night to warn Fort Ripley. This discouraged the Gull Lake Band from attacking the fort. However, many Ojibwe resented Enmegahbowh's actions for years, even though he followed his people (and the Gull Lake band and other Ojibwa) when they were removed to the environs of the [[Leech Lake Indian Reservation]] and then eventually to the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]].<ref name=thomas/>\n\nIn 1867 Bishop Whipple ordained Enmegahbowh a priest.<ref name=neslund>[http://archive.episcopalchurch.org/documents/NAM_Enmegedgahbowh.pdf Neslund, Robert, \"St. Columba's Mission, co-founded by Enmegahbowh, celebrates its sesquicentennial\", ''Soundings'', June 2002, Vol.24, Number 3, p.14]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1869 he encouraged Chief White Cloud's mission to establish peace between the Ojibwe and the Sioux in 1869.<ref name=thomas/>\n\nIn March 1880, Enmegahbowh and Chief Fine-Day traveled across the eastern United States for three months in order to raise money for a new St. Columba Episcopal Church at White Earth. While in Ohio, they impressed the governor, and also addressed the Ohio state legislature, raising $6000 for their project. After Chief Fine-Day died in 1883, Enmegahbowh referred to him as \"our noblest chief\" and recommended that a stained glass window in the church memorialize him.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nEnmegahbowh died at the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern [[Minnesota]] on June 12, 1902 at the age of 95, and is buried in St. Columba's churchyard.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Release and aftermath ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Hunky Dory'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615072909/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Hunky Dory|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823012137/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|archivedate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled on Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150839/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|isbn=0-85712-595-8|chapter=David Bowie}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5score = 10/10<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Wolk|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|title=David Bowie: ''Five Years 1969\u20131973''|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206231305/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=David Bowie: ''Hunky Dory'' (reissue)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003202846/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|archivedate=3 October 2003}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002175230/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10{{sfn|Weisbard|Marks|1995|page=55}}\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|title=Consumer Guide (22)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=30 December 1971|accessdate=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815194640/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time composing songs on piano rather than guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}} It was at this studio where Bowie wrote future ''Ziggy Stardust'' tracks \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Release and aftermath ==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=''Hunky Dory'' \u2013 David Bowie|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 March 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615072909/http://www.allmusic.com/album/hunky-dory-mw0000189509|archive-date=15 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Hunky Dory|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823012137/http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?ID=3887|archivedate=23 August 2007}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled on Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150839/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|isbn=0-85712-595-8|chapter=David Bowie}}</ref>\n|rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5score = 10/10<ref name=\"Wolk Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Wolk|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|title=David Bowie: ''Five Years 1969\u20131973''|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=1 October 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206231305/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21066-five-years-1969-1973/|archive-date=6 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=David Bowie: ''Hunky Dory'' (reissue)|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=18 March 1999|accessdate=14 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003202846/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/cd/review.asp?aid=50071&cf=331|archivedate=3 October 2003}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n|rev7Score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n|rev8 = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n|rev8score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002175230/https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|archive-date=2 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|rev9 = ''[[Spin Alternative Record Guide]]''\n|rev9score = 9/10{{sfn|Weisbard|Marks|1995|page=55}}\n|rev10 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n|rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"Christgau\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|title=Consumer Guide (22)|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|date=30 December 1971|accessdate=28 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815194640/http://robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cg22.php|archive-date=15 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\nFollowing the success of Peter Noone's version of \"Oh!

However, spending her summer on a ranch in [[Montana]] at age 19 rekindled her love of animals, and she enrolled in a pre-[[veterinary]] course in biology at the [[University of California, Davis]]. In defiance to her stepfather's wishes for her to attend a business school, Dian wanted to spend her professional life working with animals. As a consequence, Dian's parents failed to give her any substantial amount of financial support throughout her adult life.<ref name=\"farley\" /> She supported herself by working as a clerk at [[White Front]] (a department store), doing other clerking and laboratory work, and laboring as a [[machinist]] in a factory.\n\nAlthough Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulties with basic sciences including [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], and failed her second year of the program.

Alexander's route included visits to [[Tsavo]], Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of [[Manyara]], famous for attracting giant flocks of [[flamingo]]s; and the [[Ngorongoro]] Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife.<ref name=GFDFL/> The final two sites for her visit were [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] (the archeological site of [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]]); and [[Mount Mikeno|Mt. Mikeno]] in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist [[George Schaller]] had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of [[Jane Goodall]] and the importance of long-term research of the [[great apes]].<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nAlthough Fossey had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys,<ref name=GFDFL/> by October 16, she was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in [[Uganda]], the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans.

Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas in the same manner as [[Jane Goodall]] had with chimpanzees in Tanzania.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives|year=1998|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|pages=294\u2013296|editor1=Kenneth T.

With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named \"Lily\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga Mountains]], Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref>  Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to \"Lily\" and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\"/> She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual \"noseprints\" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the [[Belgian Congo]] until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the [[Congo Crisis]]. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks. Fossey eventually escaped through bribery to Walter Baumg\u00e4rtel's Travellers Rest Hotel in [[Kisoro]], where her escort was arrested by the Ugandan military.<ref name=GFDFL/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/ |title=About Dian Fossey - Info about the Life of Dian Fossey |publisher=Gorillafund.org |date=2013-11-16 |accessdate=2014-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612232428/http://gorillafund.org/dian_fossey/ |archivedate=2010-06-12 }}</ref>\nAdvised by the Ugandan authorities not to return to Congo, after meeting Leakey in Nairobi, Fossey agreed with him against [[Us embassy|US Embassy]] advice to restart her study on the [[Rwanda]]n side of the [[Virunga Mountains|Virungas]].<ref name=GFDFL/> In Rwanda, Fossey had met local American expatriate [[Rosamond Carr]], who introduced her to [[Belgium|Belgian]] local Alyette DeMunck; DeMunck had a local's knowledge of Rwanda and offered to find Fossey a suitable site for study.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\n==Conservation work in Rwanda==\n[[File:Visoke.jpg|upright=1.15|thumbnail|right|Fossey established her research camp on the foothills of [[Mount Bisoke]].]]\nOn September 24, 1967, Fossey founded the [[Karisoke Research Center]], a remote [[rainforest]] camp nestled in [[Ruhengeri]] province in the saddle of two volcanoes. For the research center's name, Fossey used \"Kari\" for the first four letters of [[Mount Karisimbi]] that overlooked her camp from the south, and \"soke\" for the last four letters of [[Mount Bisoke]], the slopes of which rose to the north, directly behind camp.<ref name=GFDFL/> Established {{convert|3000|m|ft}} up Mount Bisoke, the defined study area covered {{convert|25|km2|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/2|title=Dian Fossey text|magazine=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> She became known by locals as Nyirmachabelli, or Nyiramacibiri, roughly translated as \"The woman who lives alone on the mountain.\"<ref name=\"Montgomery130\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=130}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the gorillas from the Congo side of the Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been partially habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as [[poachers]], and it took longer for Fossey to be able to study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance.<ref name=\"Montgomery138\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=138}}</ref>\n\nMany research students left after not being able to handle the cold, dark, and extremely muddy conditions around Karisoke on the slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes, where paths usually had to be cut through six-foot-tall grass with a machete.<ref name=\"Montgomery131\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|pp=131\u20132}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to poaching===\nWhile [[hunting]] had been illegal in the national park of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] in Rwanda since the 1920s, the law was rarely enforced by park conservators, who were often bribed by [[poachers]] and paid a salary less than Fossey's own African staff.<ref name=\"farley\"/> On three occasions, Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young, the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas' deaths.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Through the [[Digit Fund]], Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps in the Karisoke study area. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name=\"Mowat223\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|p=223}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/> In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's [[elephant]]s for [[ivory]] and killed more than a dozen gorillas.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/>\n\nFossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the [[Cologne Zoological Garden|zoo]] in [[Cologne, Germany]]. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name=\"Mowat74\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74\u20138}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name=\"farley\"/> She viewed the holding of animals in \"prison\" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name=\"fossey\">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>\n\nWhile gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name=\"Mowat187\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name=\"fossey\"/><ref name=\"Mowat187\"/>\n\nAccording to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.<ref name=\"farley\"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and [[bushmeat]] hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \"to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \"active conservation\" or the international conservation groups' \"theoretical conservation.\"<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\n===Opposition to tourism===\nFossey strongly opposed [[wildlife tourism]], as gorillas are very susceptible to [[Anthroponotic disease|human anthroponotic diseases]] like [[influenza]] for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.<ref name=\"Mowat174\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174\u20135}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillafund.org/travel|title=Visit Gorillas - The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Preservation of habitat===\nFossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into [[pyrethrum]] farms.

[[Harold Hayes]]'s book ''The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey'' was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done. The film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'' was based on Hayes' 1987 article in ''Life'' magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.\n\n''No One Loved Gorillas More'' (2005) was written by Camilla de la Bedoyere and published by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] in the [[United States]] and [[Palazzo Editions]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey'' was written by the investigative journalist Georgianne Nienaber and published in 2006. This account of Fossey's story is told as if in her own words from beyond the grave. Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist [[Alex Shoumatoff]] called ''African Madness'', in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people. The author also wrote a lengthy article titled \"The Fatal Obsession of Dian Fossey\".<ref>Shoumatoff, Alex (September 1986).

The author gives a candid and vivid portrait of Fossey's mercurial personality, her ill treatment of staff and research students, and her alcohol-fueled tirades. The book also shows the daily workings of camp, Fossey's dependence on her students and the movement to remove her from Karisoke years before her brutal murder.<ref name=\"Fowler 2018\">{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=John |title=A forest in the clouds : my year among the mountain gorillas in the remote enclave of Dian Fossey |publisher=Pegasus Books |location=New York |year=2018 |isbn=9781681776330 |oclc=1022267461}}</ref>\n\n===In media===\nThe [[Kentucky Opera]] Visions Program, in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], has written an [[opera]] about Fossey, entitled ''Nyiramachabelli''; it premiered on May 23, 2006.\n\n[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to ''Gorillas in the Mist'' from Fossey in 1985, and [[Warner Bros. Studios]] bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by [[Rosamond Carr]]. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'', starring [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Bryan Brown]], and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]]. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.\n\nIn the 2011 BBC documentary ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', [[Adam Curtis]] uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of [[ecology]], a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.\n\nIn December 2017, ''Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist'', a three-hour series, aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]], The series tells the story of Fossey's life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage and reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Dian Fossey: Secrets In The Mist|url=http://www.natgeotv.com/za/shows/natgeo/dian-fossey-secrets-in-the-mist#synopsis|website=National Geographic TV|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last=Fossey |first=Dian |author-mask=2 |title=Gorillas in the Mist |url=https://archive.org/details/gorillasinmist00dian |url-access=registration |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Mass |year=1983 |isbn=9780395282175 |oclc=9132014}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-link=Thomas B.

Alexander's route included visits to [[Tsavo]], Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of [[Manyara]], famous for attracting giant flocks of [[flamingo]]s; and the [[Ngorongoro]] Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife.<ref name=GFDFL/> The final two sites for her visit were [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] (the archeological site of [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]]); and [[Mount Mikeno|Mt. Mikeno]] in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist [[George Schaller]] had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of [[Jane Goodall]] and the importance of long-term research of the [[great apes]].<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nAlthough Fossey had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys,<ref name=GFDFL/> by October 16, she was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in [[Uganda]], the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans.

Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas in the same manner as [[Jane Goodall]] had with chimpanzees in Tanzania.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives|year=1998|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|pages=294\u2013296|editor1=Kenneth T.

With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named \"Lily\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga Mountains]], Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref>  Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to \"Lily\" and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\"/> She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual \"noseprints\" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the [[Belgian Congo]] until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the [[Congo Crisis]]. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks.

For the research center's name, Fossey used \"Kari\" for the first four letters of [[Mount Karisimbi]] that overlooked her camp from the south, and \"soke\" for the last four letters of [[Mount Bisoke]], the slopes of which rose to the north, directly behind camp.<ref name=GFDFL/> Established {{convert|3000|m|ft}} up Mount Bisoke, the defined study area covered {{convert|25|km2|mi2}}.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/07/archive/fossey-gorillas-1981/dian-fossey-text/2|title=Dian Fossey text|magazine=National Geographic|accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref> She became known by locals as Nyirmachabelli, or Nyiramacibiri, roughly translated as \"The woman who lives alone on the mountain.\"<ref name=\"Montgomery130\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=130}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the gorillas from the Congo side of the Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been partially habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as [[poachers]], and it took longer for Fossey to be able to study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance.<ref name=\"Montgomery138\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=138}}</ref>\n\nMany research students left after not being able to handle the cold, dark, and extremely muddy conditions around Karisoke on the slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes, where paths usually had to be cut through six-foot-tall grass with a machete.<ref name=\"Montgomery131\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|pp=131\u20132}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to poaching===\nWhile [[hunting]] had been illegal in the national park of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] in Rwanda since the 1920s, the law was rarely enforced by park conservators, who were often bribed by [[poachers]] and paid a salary less than Fossey's own African staff.<ref name=\"farley\"/> On three occasions, Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young, the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas' deaths.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Through the [[Digit Fund]], Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps in the Karisoke study area. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name=\"Mowat223\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|p=223}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/> In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's [[elephant]]s for [[ivory]] and killed more than a dozen gorillas.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/>\n\nFossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the [[Cologne Zoological Garden|zoo]] in [[Cologne, Germany]]. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name=\"Mowat74\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74\u20138}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name=\"farley\"/> She viewed the holding of animals in \"prison\" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name=\"fossey\">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>\n\nWhile gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name=\"Mowat187\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name=\"fossey\"/><ref name=\"Mowat187\"/>\n\nAccording to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.<ref name=\"farley\"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and [[bushmeat]] hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \"to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \"active conservation\" or the international conservation groups' \"theoretical conservation.\"<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\n===Opposition to tourism===\nFossey strongly opposed [[wildlife tourism]], as gorillas are very susceptible to [[Anthroponotic disease|human anthroponotic diseases]] like [[influenza]] for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.<ref name=\"Mowat174\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174\u20135}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillafund.org/travel|title=Visit Gorillas - The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Preservation of habitat===\nFossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into [[pyrethrum]] farms.

[[Harold Hayes]]'s book ''The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey'' was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done. The film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'' was based on Hayes' 1987 article in ''Life'' magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.\n\n''No One Loved Gorillas More'' (2005) was written by Camilla de la Bedoyere and published by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] in the [[United States]] and [[Palazzo Editions]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey'' was written by the investigative journalist Georgianne Nienaber and published in 2006. This account of Fossey's story is told as if in her own words from beyond the grave. Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist [[Alex Shoumatoff]] called ''African Madness'', in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people. The author also wrote a lengthy article titled \"The Fatal Obsession of Dian Fossey\".<ref>Shoumatoff, Alex (September 1986).

''Vanity Fair''.</ref>\n\n''A Forest in the Clouds: My Year among the Mountain Gorillas in the Remote Enclave of Dian Fossey'', by John Fowler,  is a first-person account from inside Dian Fossey's camp. The author gives a candid and vivid portrait of Fossey's mercurial personality, her ill treatment of staff and research students, and her alcohol-fueled tirades. The book also shows the daily workings of camp, Fossey's dependence on her students and the movement to remove her from Karisoke years before her brutal murder.<ref name=\"Fowler 2018\">{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=John |title=A forest in the clouds : my year among the mountain gorillas in the remote enclave of Dian Fossey |publisher=Pegasus Books |location=New York |year=2018 |isbn=9781681776330 |oclc=1022267461}}</ref>\n\n===In media===\nThe [[Kentucky Opera]] Visions Program, in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], has written an [[opera]] about Fossey, entitled ''Nyiramachabelli''; it premiered on May 23, 2006.\n\n[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to ''Gorillas in the Mist'' from Fossey in 1985, and [[Warner Bros. Studios]] bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by [[Rosamond Carr]]. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'', starring [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Bryan Brown]], and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]]. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.\n\nIn the 2011 BBC documentary ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', [[Adam Curtis]] uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of [[ecology]], a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.\n\nIn December 2017, ''Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist'', a three-hour series, aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]], The series tells the story of Fossey's life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage and reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Dian Fossey: Secrets In The Mist|url=http://www.natgeotv.com/za/shows/natgeo/dian-fossey-secrets-in-the-mist#synopsis|website=National Geographic TV|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last=Fossey |first=Dian |author-mask=2 |title=Gorillas in the Mist |url=https://archive.org/details/gorillasinmist00dian |url-access=registration |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Mass |year=1983 |isbn=9780395282175 |oclc=9132014}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-link=Thomas B.

The sweetener may be [[sugar]], [[high-fructose corn syrup]], fruit juice, [[sugar substitute]]s (in the case of diet drinks) or some combination of these.
