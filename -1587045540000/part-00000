[[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Scottish Premiership]] club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national team]].\n\nGriffiths started his career at [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] where he made his debut as a sixteen-year-old. He then moved to [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in 2009 for \u00a3125,000. During his five years in the [[Scottish First Division]] he earned six young player of the month awards. With Dundee in financial trouble, Griffiths moved to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] for around \u00a3150,000 in January 2011.\n\nHaving not been a Wolves first team regular, he spent the 2011\u201312 season on loan to [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. This loan was renewed for the following season, during which he won the [[SFWA Footballer of the Year]] award and made his debut appearance for Scotland. After it appeared Griffiths had become part of Wolves' plans during the 2013\u201314 season he moved mid-season to join Celtic.\n\n==Club career==\n===Livingston===\nGriffiths made his debut for [[Livingston F.C.|Livingston]] as a sixteen-year-old, after coming on as an 82nd minute [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] during a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] on 30 December 2006.<ref name=\"Livingston 1-3 Airdrie Utd\">{{cite news|title=Livingston 1\u20133 Airdrie Utd| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/6214943.stm|work=BBC Sport|date=30 December 2006}}</ref> His teammates in his breakthrough period at [[Almondvale Stadium]] included fellow youth graduates and future Scotland colleagues [[Robert Snodgrass]] and [[Graham Dorrans]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/7194844.stm |title=Stirling Albion 1-4 Livingston |work=BBC Sport|date=19 January 2008|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> He went on trial at [[Premier League]] team [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in April 2009 and impressed enough to warrant a move.

The episode originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on January 19, 2012. It was written by Owen Ellickson and was directed by [[Charles McDougall]]. The episode guest starred [[Lindsey Broad]] and [[Eleanor Seigler]].\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) decides to sell his mansion following his divorce and [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. There, [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) tries to make [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Meanwhile, Robert gives everyone a tour of his massive home.\n\n\"Pool Party\" received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing the episode's lack of a finite plot. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], \"Pool Party\" drew 6.02 million viewers and received a 3 rating/7% share in the 18\u201349 demographic, marking a slight increase from the previous episode, \"[[Trivia (The Office)|Trivia]]\". The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and was the highest rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) is forced to sell his mansion at the behest of his ex-wife following his divorce, [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) takes his girlfriend Jessica ([[Eleanor Seigler]]) to the party and brings an engagement ring his Jessica-approving mother gave him, hoping to propose. The ring goes missing from Andy's pants and he is horrified that he cannot find it. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) and [[Phyllis Vance]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) later find the ring and decide, based on the superstition of finding a lost ring, that it must be destroyed, setting it in the pool atop a tiny pyre. [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]), having been told by [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) that Andy followed her home after the [[Christmas Wishes (The Office)|Christmas party]], decides to make Andy jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Dwight initially refuses, but, after realizing that Erin's choosing him as her co-conspirator is flattering to his attractiveness, agrees to help. The two flirt outrageously whenever Andy is close by, but Andy does not notice. To ensure Andy's attention, Erin and Dwight challenge Andy and Jessica to a series of [[chicken fight]]s in the pool. After several defeats, Erin is so determined to win a match that she pushes Dwight to the point where he passes out in the water, ending the game. In a final attempt to make Andy jealous, Dwight tells Andy he wants to pursue a romance with Erin but wants to avoid an \"Angela-type situation\" between them. Andy assures Dwight that he and Erin are through but, at the mention of Dwight having sex with Erin that very night, suggests that Dwight take things slowly instead, leading Dwight to pointedly tell him \"You're an idiot.\" Erin later swims up to Andy with the lost ring, and he admits that he has doubts about proposing to Jessica. This makes Erin very happy.\n\nWhile most of the employees are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the guys a tour of his massive home, spending most of the time mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild [[Bacchanalia#Modern_usage|Bacchanalia]]s. Ruing his wine cellar will only \"go to the lawyers\" if left undrunk, he obligingly opens it to those along, who proceed to get drunk with him. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay for the duration of the tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by [[Gabe Lewis]] ([[Zach Woods]]) and [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their [[Sycophancy|brown-nosing]] battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by co-producer Owen Ellickson, his first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the eighth season.<ref name=\"poolep\">{{Cite episode | title = Pool Party | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = January 12, 2012 | season = 8 | number = 12}}</ref> It was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], his seventh directing credit for the series.<ref name=\"poolep\"/> The episode also marks the sixth appearance of [[Lindsey Broad]], who plays [[Cathy Simms|Cathy]], Pam's replacement during her [[maternity leave]].<ref name=\"castingbroad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/09/the-office-lindsey-broad/ |title=The Office Exclusive: 'Til Death's Lindsey Broad Befriends Pam |author=Ausiello, Michael |date=September 8, 2011 |publisher=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> Due to [[Jenna Fischer]]'s actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode.<ref name=\"maternity\">{{cite web|last=Hochberg |first=Mina |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |title=The Office's Jenna Fischer Confirms That Baby No. 2 Is On the Way for Pam and Jim \u2013 Vulture |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=August 21, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101095327/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}</ref> The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode.

The episode originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on January 19, 2012. It was written by Owen Ellickson and was directed by [[Charles McDougall]]. The episode guest starred [[Lindsey Broad]] and [[Eleanor Seigler]].\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) decides to sell his mansion following his divorce and [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. There, [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]) tries to make [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Meanwhile, Robert gives everyone a tour of his massive home.\n\n\"Pool Party\" received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing the episode's lack of a finite plot. According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], \"Pool Party\" drew 6.02 million viewers and received a 3 rating/7% share in the 18\u201349 demographic, marking a slight increase from the previous episode, \"[[Trivia (The Office)|Trivia]]\". The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and was the highest rated NBC series of the night.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter [[Robert California]] ([[James Spader]]) is forced to sell his mansion at the behest of his ex-wife following his divorce, [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) suggests that he have an office pool party. [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) takes his girlfriend Jessica ([[Eleanor Seigler]]) to the party and brings an engagement ring his Jessica-approving mother gave him, hoping to propose. The ring goes missing from Andy's pants and he is horrified that he cannot find it. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) and [[Phyllis Vance]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) later find the ring and decide, based on the superstition of finding a lost ring, that it must be destroyed, setting it in the pool atop a tiny pyre. [[Erin Hannon]] ([[Ellie Kemper]]), having been told by [[Meredith Palmer]] ([[Kate Flannery]]) that Andy followed her home after the [[Christmas Wishes (The Office)|Christmas party]], decides to make Andy jealous by flirting with [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]). Dwight initially refuses, but, after realizing that Erin's choosing him as her co-conspirator is flattering to his attractiveness, agrees to help. The two flirt outrageously whenever Andy is close by, but Andy does not notice. To ensure Andy's attention, Erin and Dwight challenge Andy and Jessica to a series of [[chicken fight]]s in the pool. After several defeats, Erin is so determined to win a match that she pushes Dwight to the point where he passes out in the water, ending the game. In a final attempt to make Andy jealous, Dwight tells Andy he wants to pursue a romance with Erin but wants to avoid an \"Angela-type situation\" between them. Andy assures Dwight that he and Erin are through but, at the mention of Dwight having sex with Erin that very night, suggests that Dwight take things slowly instead, leading Dwight to pointedly tell him \"You're an idiot.\" Erin later swims up to Andy with the lost ring, and he admits that he has doubts about proposing to Jessica. This makes Erin very happy.\n\nWhile most of the employees are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the guys a tour of his massive home, spending most of the time mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild [[Bacchanalia#Modern_usage|Bacchanalia]]s. Ruing his wine cellar will only \"go to the lawyers\" if left undrunk, he obliging opens it to those along, who proceed to get drunk with him. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay for the duration of the tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by [[Gabe Lewis]] ([[Zach Woods]]) and [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their [[Sycophancy|brown-nosing]] battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by co-producer Owen Ellickson, his first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the eighth season.<ref name=\"poolep\">{{Cite episode | title = Pool Party | series = The Office | serieslink = The Office (American TV series) | network = NBC | airdate = January 12, 2012 | season = 8 | number = 12}}</ref> It was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], his seventh directing credit for the series.<ref name=\"poolep\"/> The episode also marks the sixth appearance of [[Lindsey Broad]], who plays [[Cathy Simms|Cathy]], Pam's replacement during her [[maternity leave]].<ref name=\"castingbroad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/09/the-office-lindsey-broad/ |title=The Office Exclusive: 'Til Death's Lindsey Broad Befriends Pam |author=Ausiello, Michael |date=September 8, 2011 |publisher=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=November 12, 2011}}</ref> Due to [[Jenna Fischer]]'s actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode.<ref name=\"maternity\">{{cite web|last=Hochberg |first=Mina |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |title=The Office's Jenna Fischer Confirms That Baby No. 2 Is On the Way for Pam and Jim \u2013 Vulture |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=August 21, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101095327/http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/the_offices_jenna_fischer_conf.html |archivedate=November 1, 2011 }}</ref> The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode.
