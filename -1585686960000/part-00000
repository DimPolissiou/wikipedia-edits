They appeared on the ''[[Quest for Camelot#Soundtrack|Quest for Camelot]]'' soundtrack in May 1998. The duet was included on albums by both artists, released a few months later on ''Sogno'' and ''These Are Special Times''. Bocelli sung original Italian while Dion translated into English. The song won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] from the 1998 film ''Quest for Camelot'', the second win in a row for a [[Celine Dion]] song.  In that film, Dion sang it as a solo with slightly different lyrics. It was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1999 and a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]] in 2000. Dion performed it with Bocelli at both ceremonies.\n\nIt was also featured on Dion's compilation ''[[The Collector's Series, Volume One]]'' (2000) and greatest hits ''[[My Love: Essential Collection|My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection]]'' (2008). A re-recorded solo version by Celine Dion (renamed \"A Mother's Prayer\") appeared on her 2004 album ''[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|Miracle]]''. Dion performed \"The Prayer\" live during her [[Taking Chances Tour]] as a virtual duet with Bocelli on the screen; the performance was released in the ''[[Taking Chances World Tour: The Concert]]'' CD/DVD. The song appeared also on Bocelli's 2007 compilation ''[[The Best of Andrea Bocelli: Vivere]]''.  Dion joined Bocelli to perform the song in his ''[[Concerto: One Night in Central Park]]'' concert in 2011; the performance was subsequently released on CD and DVD.  Both Dion and Bocelli have sung the song with other artists, and various other artists have recorded the song, either as a duet or a solo.\n\nThe original version of \"The Prayer\" failed to chart on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], but was very popular on the adult contemporary charts in both Canada and the United States, peaking at number 6 and number 22 respectively. It has also become popular during [[Christmas]], weddings and, in some cases, funerals and religious services.\n\n==Critical reception==\nPaul Verna from ''Billboard'' called this song a \"gorgeous duet\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwoEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=pl&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=dion&f=false |title=Billboard - Google Ksi\u0105\u017cki |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> Chuck Taylor from ''Billboard'' reviewed \"The Prayer\", calling it \"a breathtaking, ultra-lush song, and the tour de force combination of Dion and Bocelli [which] will send a half-dozen chills up your spine\".

It has been worn by military personnel from many different nations including Australia, Britain, India, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia, France, the United States, the Confederate States, Germany and many others. Australia and New Zealand have had various models of slouch hat as standard issue headwear since the late Victorian period.\n\nToday it is worn by military personnel from a number of countries, although it is primarily associated with Australia, where it is considered to be a national symbol. The distinctive Australian slouch hat, sometimes called an \"Australian bush hat\" or \"digger hat\", has one side of the brim turned up or pinned to the side of the hat with a [[Rising Sun (badge)|Rising Sun Badge]] in order to allow a rifle to be slung over the shoulder. This was also the practice with the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade|New Zealand Mounted Rifles]], with the New Zealand military insignia worn on the front of the puggaree of that era.\n\nIn the United States it was also called the Kossuth hat, after [[Lajos Kossuth]]. During the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) the headgear was common among both Confederate and Union troops in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], although not always with its brim turned up at the side. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], as commander of the [[Rough Riders]], Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became known for wearing a slouch hat.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VCAgansingRai.jpg|thumb|Naik [[Agansing Rai]] VC, [[5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]]]\n\nThe name \"slouch hat\" refers to the fact that one side droops down as opposed to the other which is pinned against the side of the crown.<ref name=\"diggerhistory.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|title=NZ Slouch|publisher=Digger History|accessdate=1 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920015848/http://diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|archivedate=20 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This style of hat has been worn for many hundreds of years, especially during the [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century when it became associated with the forces of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[Cavaliers]], but it was also fashionable for the aristocracy throughout Europe during that time until it was superseded by the cocked hat with two ([[bicorne|bicorn]]) or three ([[tricorn]]) points.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIt was introduced into Australia around 1885, although it traces its military use back to Austrian skirmishers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/web2.airmail.net/napoleon/Austrian_infantry.htm#austrianinfantryuniforms |title=Austrian Infantry|author=Unknown |publisher=napolun.com Chinese Napoleonic History|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The modern slouch hat is derived from the black \"Corsican hat\" (Korsehut) &ndash; historically used in the Austrian army during the Napoleonic Wars.

It has been worn by military personnel from many different nations including Australia, Britain, India, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia, France, the United States, the Confederate States, Germany and many others. Australia and New Zealand have had various models of slouch hat as standard issue headwear since the late Victorian period.\n\nToday it is worn by military personnel from a number of countries, although it is primarily associated with Australia, where it is considered to be a national symbol. The distinctive Australian slouch hat, sometimes called an \"Australian bush hat\" or \"digger hat\", has one side of the brim turned up or pinned to the side of the hat with a [[Rising Sun (badge)|Rising Sun Badge]] in order to allow a rifle to be slung over the shoulder. This was also the practice with the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade|New Zealand Mounted Rifles]], with the New Zealand military insignia worn on the front of the puggaree of that era.\n\nIn the United States it was also called the Kossuth hat, after [[Lajos Kossuth]]. During the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) the headgear was common among both Confederate and Union troops in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], although not always with its brim turned up at the side. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], as commander of the [[Rough Riders]], Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became known for wearing a slouch hat.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VCAgansingRai.jpg|thumb|Naik [[Agansing Rai]] VC, [[5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]]]\n\nThe name \"slouch hat\" refers to the fact that one side droops down as opposed to the other which is pinned against the side of the crown.<ref name=\"diggerhistory.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|title=NZ Slouch|publisher=Digger History|accessdate=1 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920015848/http://diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|archivedate=20 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This style of hat has been worn for many hundreds of years, especially during the [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century when it became associated with the forces of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[Cavaliers]], but it was also fashionable for the aristocracy throughout Europe during that time until it was superseded by the cocked hat with two ([[bicorne|bicorn]]) or three ([[tricorn]]) points.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIt was introduced into Australia around 1885, although it traces its military use back to Austrian skirmishers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/web2.airmail.net/napoleon/Austrian_infantry.htm#austrianinfantryuniforms |title=Austrian Infantry|author=Unknown |publisher=napolun.com Chinese Napoleonic History|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The modern slouch hat is derived from the black \"Corsican hat\" (Korsehut) &ndash; historically used in the Austrian army during the Napoleonic Wars.

Some American soldiers assigned to units in the [[China Burma India Theatre of World War II]] (CBI) such as the [[OSS Detachment 101]] and the [[1st Air Commando Group]] wore British Army issue bush hats with their uniforms without official authorization.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe standard headgear for US soldiers in the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s was a fatigue baseball or field cap that offered little protection from the sun. Local tailors made a slouch hat in a style between a French type bush hat of the [[First Indochina War]] and an Australian type bush hat with a snap on the brim to pin one side up that was widely bought and unofficially worn by American troops in Vietnam.  The local tailors usually used green fatigue cloth or leopard skin pattern [[military camouflage]] from old parachutes. The hat often had a cloth arc emblazoned with the word VIET-NAM on the brim.  The US [[1st Air Commando Group]] members officially adopted the green slouch hat on 22 May 1964<ref>Chinnery 1994, p.97.</ref> as their distinctive and practical headgear with an \"AIR COMMANDO\" arc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn 1972 the [[United States Army|US Army]] authorized female drill sergeants to wear a similar type cloth bush hat with the brim pinned up on the side as their distinctive headgear.  The [[United States Air Force|US Air Force's]] female military training instructors were given a blue Air Force slouch hat.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Indian police===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ARPC.JPG|thumb|left|100px|Armed Reserve Police Constable, [[Kerala Police]]]] -->A few state police forces in India use slouch hats, or did so in the past. The Armed Reserve wing of the [[Kerala Police]] wore slouch hats up to the 1980s, but today the slouch hat is only worn by Recruit Trainee Police Constables (RTPC) during their training. The Armed Reserve policemen of Kerala Police now wear a blue peaked cap. The [[Karnataka Police]] continues to use slouch hats for its members in the lower ranks of the police ([[Constables]] and [[Head Constable]]s), with the colours of the police unit embroidered on the turned-up brim. The number of the individual officer is also fixed onto the side of the brim. The [[Rajasthan Police|Rajasthan Provincial Constabulary]]: the armed branch of the Rajasthan Police, also uses the slouch hat pinned up to the side, as the standard service and ceremonial headgear for all its Constables and Head Constables. In [[Sikkim]], the slouch hat or \"terai\" hat is worn in Gorkha style by ceremonial guards and quarter guards of the [[Sikkim Police]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Ireland===\nThe uniform of the [[Irish Volunteers]] included a slouch hat, and it was worn by many of the rebels during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]], and also the uniform of the [[Irish Citizens Army]].

Though the Service Cap became standard after the formation of the Territorial Force in 1908, the Royal East Kent Mounted Rifles used them for ceremonial purposes until around 1910. <ref>Mollo, Boris (2006).

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue.

Histologically, they are similar to intestinal or cervical adenocarcinomas, and are often actually metastases of [[appendiceal cancer|appendiceal]] or [[colon cancer]]s. Advanced mucinous adenocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, generally worse than serous tumors, and are often resistant to platinum chemotherapy, though they are rare.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Pseudomyxoma peritonei ======\n{{Main|Pseudomyxoma peritonei}}\n\n''Pseudomyxoma peritonei'' refers to a collection of encapsulated mucous or gelatinous material in the abdominopelvic cavity, which is very rarely caused by a primary mucinous ovarian tumor. More commonly, it is associated with ovarian metastases of intestinal cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n===== Undifferentiated epithelial =====\nUndifferentiated cancers - those where the cell type cannot be determined - make up about 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers and have a comparatively poor prognosis.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> When examined under the microscope, these tumors have very abnormal cells that are arranged in clumps or sheets. Usually there are recognizable clumps of serous cells inside the tumor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Malignant Brenner tumor ======\n{{Main|Brenner tumor}}\n\nMalignant Brenner tumors are rare. Histologically, they have dense fibrous stroma with areas of transitional epithelium, and some squamous differentiation. To be classified as a malignant Brenner tumor, it must have Brenner tumor foci and transitional cell carcinoma. The transitional cell carcinoma component is typically poorly differentiated and resembles urinary tract cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n====== Transitional cell carcinoma ======\n{{Main|Transitional cell carcinoma}}\n\nTransitional cell carcinomas represent less than 5% of ovarian cancers.

Sex cord-stromal tumors are the main hormone-producing ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":8\">{{harvnb|Williams Gynecology|2012}}</ref>\n\nSeveral different cells from the [[mesenchyme]] can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign.

Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHistologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the [[embryonic disc]], made up of epithelial, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Polyembryoma =====\n{{Main|Polyembryoma}}\nPolyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several [[embryo]]-like bodies with structures resembling a [[germ disk]], [[yolk sac]], and [[amniotic sac]]. [[Syncytiotrophoblast|Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells]] also occur in polyembryomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====\nPrimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Mixed tumors ====\nMixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear cell/endometrioid.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25\u201330% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====\nOvarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.<ref name=Harrisons/> About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[appendiceal cancer]], and [[stomach cancer]] (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called [[Krukenberg tumor]]s).<ref name=Harrisons/> Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.<ref name=Levy>{{Cite book|title = Premalignant & Malignant Disorders of the Ovaries & Oviducts|last = Levy|first = Gary | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|last2 = Purcell|last3 = Karen|work = CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e| veditors = DeCherney AH, Nathan L, Laufer N, Roman AS |url = http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|isbn = 978-0-07-163856-2|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175639/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|archivedate = 2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Borderline tumors====\nOvarian [[borderline tumor]]s, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40\u201349. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|changes in cell size or nucleus size]], [[nuclear atypia|abnormal nuclei]], cell stratification, and [[papillary projections|small projections on cells]] (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Staging ===\nOvarian cancer is staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total [[Hysterectomy|abdominal hysterectomy]] via [[Laparotomy|midline laparotomy]], [[Salpingoophorectomy|removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes]], [[Omentectomy|(usually) the omentum]], [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s, assessment of [[Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection|retroperitoneal lymph nodes]] (including the [[Pelvic lymph nodes|pelvic]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node|para-aortic lymph nodes]]), [[appendectomy]] in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for [[cytopathology]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=SGO/> Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.<ref name=Harrisons/> 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.<ref name=\":7\" /> The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk.

Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.

This is often done after completion of childbearing years. This reduces the chances of developing both breast cancer (by around 50%) and ovarian cancer (by about 96%) in people at high risk. Women with ''BRCA'' gene mutations usually also have their Fallopian tubes removed at the same time (salpingo-oophorectomy), since they also have an increased risk of [[Fallopian tube cancer]]. However, these statistics may overestimate the risk reduction because of how they have been studied.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nPeople with a significant family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a [[genetic counselor]] to see if  testing for BRCA mutations would be beneficial.<ref name=Hoffman35/> The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and tubal ligation reduce the risk.<ref name=\"CibulaWidschwendter2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cibula D, Widschwendter M, M\u00e1jek O, Dusek L | title = Tubal ligation and the risk of ovarian cancer: review and meta-analysis | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201367 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20634209 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq030 }}</ref>\nThere may an association of developing ovarian cancer and ovarian stimulation during infertility treatments.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible.

Debulking surgery is usually only done once.<ref name=Jayson/> More complete debulking is associated with better outcomes: women with no macroscopic evidence of disease after debulking have a median survival of 39 months, as opposed to 17 months with less complete surgery.<ref name=Harrisons/> By removing metastases, many cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are removed, and any clumps of cells that have died are also removed. This allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells, which are more likely to be fast-growing and therefore chemosensitive.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nInterval debulking surgery is another protocol used, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, debulking surgery is performed, and chemotherapy is finished after debulking.<ref name=\":2\" /> Though no definitive studies have been completed, it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary debulking surgery in terms of survival, and shows slightly lower morbidity.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nThere are several different surgical procedures that can be employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option. This depends on how easily the tumor can be removed, how much fluid has accumulated in the abdomen, and overall health.<ref name=Jayson/> It can be helpful in people who had their first surgery done by a generalist and in epithelial ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":7\" /> Secondary surgery can be effective in dysgerminomas and immature teratomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe major side effect of an oophorectomy in younger women is early [[menopause]], which can cause [[osteoporosis]]. After surgery, hormone replacement therapy can be considered, especially in younger women. This therapy can consist of a combination of estrogen and progesterone, or estrogen alone.

Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate.  In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery. This is called \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\", and is common when a tumor cannot be completely removed or optimally debulked via surgery.

These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, [[urinary bladder]], [[bowel]],  [[mesentery|lining of the bowel wall]], and [[Greater omentum|omentum]], forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.\n\nThe five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Statistics and outlook for ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518192429/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref> For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.<ref name=\"SEER\">Survival rates based on SEER incidence and NCHS mortality statistics, as cited by the National Cancer Institute in [http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets&nbsp;\u2014 Cancer of the Ovary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706145616/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html |date=2014-07-06 }}</ref> About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1\u20134 years after treatment.<ref name=Harrisons/> [[Brain metastasis]] is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and [[Whole brain radiotherapy|whole brain radiation therapy]] can improve survival.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOvarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.<ref name=Current/> Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I.<ref name=\":8\" /> Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more.<ref name=Harrisons/> Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nComplications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.<ref name=Jayson/> Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the [[intestinal lumen]], or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal [[peristalsis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gucalp |first1 = Rasim |last2 = Dutcher |first2 = Janice | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Oncologic Emergencies |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\n=== Prognostic factors ===\nThere are a number of [[prognostic factor]]s in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors - those indicating better chances of survival - include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]] are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of [[let-7b]], [[HIF1A]], [[EPH receptor A1|EphA1]], and [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]] are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for [[WT1]] carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Survival rates ===\nOverall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:<ref name=Harrisons/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-right: 10px;\"\n!

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery.<ref name=Jayson/> The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Prognosis research===\nResearch into various [[prognostic factor]]s for ovarian cancer is also going on. Recent research shows that [[thrombocytosis]] predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Immunotherapy===\nWhile an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no goodevidence that [[immunotherapy]] is effective for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\"pmid30199097\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paijens ST, Leffers N, Daemen T, Helfrich W, Boezen HM, Cohlen BJ, Melief CJ, de Bruyn M, Nijman HW | title = Antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = CD007287 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30199097 | pmc = 6513204 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007287.pub4 }}</ref> However, trials of the antibody and [[VEGF]] inhibitor [[bevacizumab]], which can slow the [[angiogenesis|growth of new blood vessels]] in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with [[pazopanib]], which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer<ref name=Jayson/> and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate.<ref name=Harrisons/> It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Pharmacology===\n[[mTOR inhibitor]]s were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hyperlipidemia]]) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause [[diarrhea]]. Another investigated drug is [[selumetinib]], a [[MAPK]] inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\nBevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[proteinuria]]. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to [[fistula]]e or [[bowel perforation]]. [[Vintafolide]], which consists of an [[antifolate]] conjugated with [[vinblastine]], is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because [[folate receptor]]s are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers.<ref name=Jayson/> Another potential immunotherapy is [[trastuzumab]], which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations.<ref name=Harrisons/> Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. [[Combretastatin]] and [[pazopanib]] are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. [[Trebananib]] and [[tasquinimod]] are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[farletuzumab]] is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves [[vaccines]], including [[TroVax]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAn alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of [[carboplatin]] and [[etoposide]], is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Intraperitoneal chemotherapy]] has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched.<ref name=Jayson/> Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: [[irinotecan]] combined with cisplatin.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[PARP inhibitor]]s have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, [[olaparib]] has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which [[biomarker]]s are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.<ref name=Jayson/> [[Rucaparib]] is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. [[Niraparib]] is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Inflammation===\n\nThere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries. It may be due to the inflammatory process present with pelvic inflammatory disease.<ref name=\"IngerslevHogdall2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingerslev K, Hogdall E, Schnack TH, Skovrider-Ruminski W, Hogdall C, Blaakaer J | title = The potential role of infectious agents and pelvic inflammatory disease in ovarian carcinogenesis | journal = Infectious Agents and Cancer | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 25 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28529540 | pmc = 5437405 | doi = 10.1186/s13027-017-0134-9 }}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trials===\n[[Clinical trial]]s are monitored and funded by US governmental organizations to test treatment options to see if they are safe and effective.

Thus [[Nulliparity|not having children]] is a risk factor for ovarian cancer, likely because ovulation is suppressed via pregnancy.  During ovulation, cells are constantly stimulated to divide while ovulatory cycles continue. Therefore, [[Nulliparity|people who have not borne children]] are at twice the risk of ovarian cancer than those who have. A longer period of ovulation caused by early [[menarche|first menstruation]] and late [[menopause]] is also a risk factor.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /><ref name=\"CRUKRisks\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gong TT, Wu QJ, Vogtmann E, Lin B, Wang YL | title = Age at menarche and risk of ovarian cancer: a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 132 | issue = 12 | pages = 2894\u2013900 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23175139 | pmc = 3806278 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.27952 }}</ref> Both obesity and hormone replacement therapy also raise the risk.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nThe risk of developing ovarian cancer is less for women who have fewer menstrual cycles, no menstrual cycles, [[breast feeding]], take oral contraceptives, have multiple pregnancies, and have a pregnancy at an early age.  The risk of developing ovarian cancer is reduced in women who have had [[tubal ligation]] (colloquially known as having one's \"tubes tied\"), both ovaries removed, or [[hysterectomy]] (an operation in which the uterus, and sometimes the cervix, is removed).<ref name=\"CDCsep2016\" /> Age is also a risk factor.<ref name = Harrisons/><ref name=\"Gib2016\"/>\n\n=== Hormones ===\nUse of fertility medication may contribute to ovarian [[borderline tumor]] formation, but the link between the two is disputed and difficult to study.<ref name=Jayson/> Fertility drugs may be associated with a higher risk of borderline tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /> Those who have been treated for infertility but remain nulliparous are at higher risk for epithelial ovarian cancer; however, those who are successfully treated for infertility and subsequently give birth are at no higher risk.

Higher doses of estrogen increase this risk.<ref name=\":7\" /> Endometriosis is another risk factor for ovarian cancer,<ref name=CRUKRisks/> as is pain with menstruation. Endometriosis is associated with clear-cell and endometrioid subtypes, low-grade serous tumors, stage I and II tumors, grade 1 tumors, and lower mortality.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBefore menopause, obesity can increase a person's risk of ovarian cancer, but this risk is not present after menopause. This risk is also relevant in those who are both obese and have never used HRT.

People with [[hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer]] (Lynch syndrome), and those with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genetic abnormalities are at increased risk.\n\nThe major genetic risk factor for ovarian cancer is a mutation in ''BRCA1'' or ''BRCA2'' genes, or in [[DNA mismatch repair]] genes, which is present in 10% of ovarian cancer cases. Only one [[allele]] need be mutated to place a person at high risk. The gene can be inherited through either the maternal or paternal line, but has variable [[penetrance]].<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Though mutations in these genes are usually associated with increased risk of breast cancer, they also carry a substantial lifetime risk of ovarian cancer, a risk that peaks in a person's 40s and 50s. The lowest risk cited is 30% and the highest 60%.<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Hoffman35/> Mutations in BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 15\u201345%.<ref name=\":7\" /> Mutations in ''BRCA2'' are less risky than those with ''BRCA1'', with a lifetime risk of 10% (lowest risk cited) to 40% (highest risk cited).<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /> On average, BRCA-associated cancers develop 15 years before their sporadic counterparts, because people who inherit the mutations on one copy of their gene only need one mutation to start the process of carcinogenesis, whereas people with two normal genes would need to acquire two mutations.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nIn the United States, five of 100 women with a [[first-degree relative]] with ovarian cancer will eventually get ovarian cancer themselves, placing those with affected family members at triple the risk of women with unaffected family members.

Type I ovarian cancers, which tend to be less aggressive, tend to have [[microsatellite instability]] in several genes, including both oncogenes (most notably ''[[BRAF (gene)|BRAF]]''  and ''[[KRAS]]'') and tumor suppressors (most notably ''[[PTEN (gene)|PTEN]]'').<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> The most common mutations in Type I cancers are ''KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN, PIK3CA,'' and ''ARID1A.''<ref name=\":7\" /> Type II cancers, the more aggressive type, have different genes mutated, including ''[[p53]], BRCA1'', and ''BRCA2''.<ref name=Jayson/> Low-grade cancers tend to have mutations in KRAS, whereas cancers of any grade that develop from low malignant potential tumors tend to have mutations in p53.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Type I cancers tend to develop from precursor lesions, whereas Type II cancers can develop from a [[serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma]].<ref name=\":7\" /> [[Serous cancer]]s that have BRCA mutations also inevitably have p53 mutations, indicating that the removal of both functional genes is important for cancer to develop.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nIn 50% of high-grade serous cancers, homologous recombination DNA repair is dysfunctional, as are the [[notch signaling pathway|notch]] and [[FOXM1]] signaling pathways. They also almost always have p53 mutations. Other than this, mutations in high-grade serous carcinoma are hard to characterize beyond their high degree of [[genomic instability]]. ''BRCA1'' and ''BRCA2'' are essential for homologous recombination DNA repair, and [[germline mutation]]s in these genes are found in about 15% of people with ovarian cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> The most common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the [[frameshift mutations]] that originated in a small [[founder effect|founding population]] of Ashkenazi Jews.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nAlmost 100% of rare mucinous carcinomas have mutations in ''KRAS'' and amplifications of ''ERBB2'' (also known as ''Her2/neu'').<ref name=Jayson/> Overall, 20% of ovarian cancers have mutations in ''Her2/neu''.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nSerous carcinomas may develop from [[serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma]], rather than developing spontaneously from ovarian tissue.

The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} [[Genomics]] approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n[[CT scanning]] is preferred to assess the extent of the tumor in the abdominopelvic cavity, though [[magnetic resonance imaging]] can also be used.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> CT scanning can also be useful for finding [[omental caking]] or differentiating fluid from solid tumor in the abdomen, especially in low malignant potential tumors. However, it may not detect smaller tumors. Sometimes, a [[Chest radiograph|chest x-ray]] is used to detect metastases in the chest or [[pleural effusion]]. Another test for metastatic disease, though it is infrequently used, is a [[barium enema]], which can show if the rectosigmoid colon is involved in the disease. [[Positron emission tomography]], [[bone scan]]s, and [[paracentesis]] are of limited use; in fact, paracentesis can cause metastases to form at the needle insertion site and may not provide useful results.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> However, paracentesis can be used in cases where there is no pelvic mass and ascites is still present.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> A physician suspecting ovarian cancer may also perform [[mammography]] or an [[endometrial biopsy]] (in the case of abnormal bleeding) to assess the possibility of breast malignancies and endometrial malignancy, respectively. [[Vaginal ultrasonography]] is often the first-line imaging study performed when an adnexal mass is found. Several characteristics of an adnexal mass indicate ovarian malignancy; they usually are solid, irregular, multilocular, and/or large; and they typically have papillary features, central vessels, and/or irregular internal septations.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, SCST has no definitive characteristics on radiographic study.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTo definitively diagnose ovarian cancer, a surgical procedure to inspect the abdomen is required. This can be an open procedure ([[laparotomy]], incision through the [[abdominal wall]]) or [[keyhole surgery]] ([[laparoscopy]]). During this procedure, suspicious tissue is removed and sent for [[Histopathology|microscopic analysis]]. Usually, this includes a unilateral [[salpingo-oophorectomy]], removal of a single affected ovary and Fallopian tube. Fluid from the abdominal cavity can also be analyzed for cancerous [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. If cancer is found, this procedure can also be used to determine the extent of its spread (which is a form of [[tumor staging]]).<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\n==== Risk scoring ====\n{{anchor | RMI}}A widely recognized method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer is the risk of malignancy index (RMI), calculated based on an initial [[Medical diagnosis#Other diagnostic procedure methods|workup]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=\"NICE2011\">{{cite web |url = http://publications.nice.org.uk/ovarian-cancer-cg122/appendix-d-risk-of-malignancy-index-rmi-i |work = NICE clinical guidelines |date = April 2011 |title = Guideline CG122.

These include [[fibroblast]]s and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include [[ovarian torsion]], [[hemorrhage]] from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, [[precocious puberty#Isosexual and heterosexual|isosexual precocious pseudopuberty]] may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation ([[menometrorrhagia|excessive bleeding]], [[oligomenorrhea|infrequent menstruation]], or [[amenorrhea|no menstruation]]) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur at the same time as [[endometrial cancer]] or [[breast cancer]]. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause [[virilization]] and [[hirsutism|excessive hair growth]] due to the production of [[testosterone]] and [[androstenedione]], which can also cause [[Cushing's syndrome]] in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and [[hydrothorax]].<ref name=Harrisons/> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\n===== Granulosa cell tumor =====\nGranulosa cell tumors are the most common sex-cord stromal tumors, making up 70% of cases, and are divided into two histologic subtypes: adult granulosa cell tumors, which develop in women over 50, and juvenile granulosa tumors, which develop before puberty or before the age of 30. Both develop in the [[ovarian follicle]] from a population of cells that surrounds [[germinal cell]]s.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Adult granulosa cell tumor ======\nAdult granulosa cell tumors are characterized by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: [[menometrorrhagia]]; [[endometrial hyperplasia]]; [[Breast pain|tender]], [[Breast enlargement|enlarged breasts]]; [[Vaginal bleeding|postmenopausal bleeding]]; and [[Amenorrhoea|secondary amenorrhea]]. The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n====== Juvenile granulosa cell tumor ======\n\n===== Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor =====\nSertoli-Leydig tumors are most common in women before the age of 30, and particularly common before puberty.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Sclerosing stromal tumors =====\nSclerosing stromal tumors  typically occur in girls before puberty or women before the age of 30.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Germ cell tumor ====\n{{Main|Ovarian germ cell tumors}}\nGerm cell tumors of the ovary develop from the ovarian [[germ cells]].<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Germ cell tumor]] accounts for about 30% of ovarian tumors, but only 5% of ovarian cancers, because most germ-cell tumors are [[teratoma]]s and most teratomas are benign. Malignant teratomas tend to occur in older women, when one of the germ layers in the tumor develops into a [[squamous cell carcinoma]].<ref name=Harrisons/> Germ-cell tumors tend to occur in young women (20s\u201330s) and girls, making up 70% of the ovarian cancer seen in that age group.<ref name=Current>{{cite book |chapter = Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology |title = Current Diagnosis & Treatment Obstetrics & Gynecology |isbn = 978-0071638562  |edition = 11th |year = 2012 |first1 = Alan |last1 = DeCherney |first2 = Lauren |last2 = Nathan  |first3 = T.

Some germ-cell tumors have an [[isochromosome]] 12, where one arm of chromosome 12 is deleted and replaced with a duplicate of the other.<ref name=Harrisons/> Most germ-cell cancers have a better prognosis than other subtypes and are more sensitive to chemotherapy. They are more likely to be stage I at diagnosis.<ref name=\":8\" /> Overall, they metastasize more frequently than epithelial ovarian cancers. In addition, the cancer markers used vary with tumor type: [[choriocarcinomas]] are monitored with [[beta-HCG]] and endodermal sinus tumors with [[alpha-fetoprotein]].<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nGerm-cell tumors are typically discovered when they become large, palpable masses. However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual precocious puberty. They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/> The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is [[Abdominal pain|subacute abdominal pain]] caused by the tumor bleeding, [[Necrosis|necrotizing]], or stretching the [[ovarian capsule]]. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause [[Acute abdomen|acute abdominal pain]], which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the [[menstrual cycle]]. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a [[Well-woman examination|routine examination]] and does not cause symptoms.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nDiagnosing germ cell tumors may be difficult because the normal menstrual cycle and [[puberty]] can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of [[Teenage pregnancy|teen pregnancy]]. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, [[karyotype]], human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring gonadal dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign [[ovarian cyst]].<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Dysgerminoma =====\n{{Main|Dysgerminoma}}\nDysgerminoma accounts for 35% of ovarian cancer in young women and is the most likely germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25\u201330% of cases.<ref name=Current/><ref name=\":8\" /> These tumors may have mutations in [[CD117|the ''KIT'' gene]], a mutation known for its role in [[gastrointestinal stromal tumor]]. [[Swyer syndrome|People with an XY karyotype and ovaries]] ([[gonadal dysgenesis]]) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries ([[Turner syndrome]]) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a [[gonadoblastoma]] in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10\u201320% of the time.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThey are composed of cells that cannot [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] further and develop directly from germ cells or from gonadoblastomas. Dysgerminomas contain [[syncytiotrophoblast]]s in approximately 5% of cases, and can therefore cause elevated hCG levels. On gross appearance, dysgerminomas are typically pink to tan-colored, have multiple lobes, and are solid. Microscopically, they appear identical to [[seminoma]]s and very close to [[Embryonic germ cell|embryonic primordial germ cells]], having large, polyhedral, rounded [[clear cell]]s. The nuclei are uniform and round or square with prominent [[Nucleolus|nucleoli]] and the [[cytoplasm]] has high levels of [[glycogen]]. Inflammation is another prominent histologic feature of dysgerminomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Choriocarcinoma =====\n{{Main|Choriocarcinoma}}\nChoriocarcinoma can occur as a primary ovarian tumor developing from a germ cell, though it is usually a gestational disease that metastasizes to the ovary. Primary ovarian choriocarcinoma has  a poor prognosis and can occur without a pregnancy. They produce high levels of hCG and can cause [[Precocious puberty|early puberty]] in children or [[menometrorrhagia]] (irregular, heavy menstruation) after menarche.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Immature (solid) teratoma =====\n{{Main|Immature teratoma}}Immature, or solid, teratomas are the most common type of ovarian germ cell tumor, making up 40\u201350% of cases. Teratomas are characterized by the presence of disorganized tissues arising from all three embryonic [[germ layer]]s: [[ectoderm]], [[mesoderm]], and [[endoderm]]; immature teratomas also have undifferentiated [[stem cell]]s that make them more malignant than mature teratomas (dermoid cysts). The different tissues are visible on gross pathology and often include bone, cartilage, hair, [[mucus]], or [[Sebaceous gland|sebum]], but these tissues are not visible from the outside, which appears to be a solid mass with lobes and cysts. Histologically, they have large amounts of [[neuroectoderm]] organized into sheets and tubules along with [[Neuroglia|glia]]; the amount of neural tissue determines the histologic grade. Immature teratomas usually only affect one ovary (10% co-occur with dermoid cysts) and usually metastasize throughout the peritoneum. They can also cause mature teratoma implants to grow throughout the abdomen in a disease called [[growing teratoma syndrome]]; these are usually benign but will continue to grow during chemotherapy, and often necessitate further surgery. Unlike mature teratomas, immature teratomas form many [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]], making them less likely to cause ovarian torsion. There is no specific marker for immature teratomas, but [[carcinoembryonic antigen]] (CEA), CA-125, CA19-9, or AFP can sometimes indicate an immature teratoma.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nStage I teratomas make up the majority (75%) of cases and have the best prognosis, with 98% of patients surviving 5 years; if a Stage I tumor is also grade 1, it can be treated with unilateral surgery only. Stage II though IV tumors make up the remaining quarter of cases and have a worse prognosis,  with 73\u201388% of patients surviving 5 years.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Mature teratoma (dermoid cyst) =====\n{{Main|Dermoid cyst}}\nMature teratomas, or dermoid cysts, are rare tumors consisting of mostly benign tissue that develop after menopause. The tumors consist of disorganized tissue with nodules of malignant tissue, which can be of various types. The most common malignancy is [[Squamous-cell carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]], but [[adenocarcinoma]], [[basal-cell carcinoma]], [[Carcinoid|carcinoid tumor]], [[neuroectodermal tumor]], [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]], [[sarcoma]], [[Sebaceous carcinoma|sebaceous tumor]], and [[struma ovarii]] can also be part of the dermoid cyst. They are treated with surgery and adjuvant platinum chemotherapy or radiation.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor =====\n{{Main|Yolk sac tumor}}\n[[Yolk sac]] tumors, formerly called endodermal sinus tumors, make up approximately 10\u201320% of ovarian germ cell malignancies, and have the worst prognosis of all [[ovarian germ cell tumors]]. They occur both before menarche (in one-third of cases) and after menarche (the remaining two-thirds of cases). Half of people with yolk sac tumors are diagnosed in stage I. Typically, they are unilateral until metastasis, which occurs within the peritoneal cavity and via the bloodstream to the lungs. Yolk sac tumors grow quickly and recur easily, and are not easily treatable once they have recurred. Stage I yolk sac tumors are highly treatable, with a 5-year disease free survival rate of 93%, but stage II-IV tumors are less treatable, with survival rates of 64\u201391%.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nTheir gross appearance is solid, friable, and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors are characterized by the presence of [[Schiller\u2013Duval body|Schiller-Duval bodies]] (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete [[alpha-fetoprotein]] and can be [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemically]] stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Embryonal carcinoma =====\n{{Main|Embryonal carcinoma}}\nEmbryonal carcinomas, a rare tumor type usually found in mixed tumors, develop directly from germ cells but are not terminally differentiated; in rare cases they may develop in dysgenetic gonads. They can develop further into a variety of other neoplasms, including choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor, and teratoma. They occur in younger people, with an average age at diagnosis of 14, and secrete both alpha-fetoprotein (in 75% of cases) and hCG.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nHistologically, embryonal carcinoma appears similar to the [[embryonic disc]], made up of epithelial, [[Anaplasia|anaplastic]] cells in disorganized sheets, with gland-like spaces and papillary structures.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n===== Polyembryoma =====\n{{Main|Polyembryoma}}\nPolyembryomas, the most immature form of teratoma and very rare ovarian tumors, are histologically characterized by having several [[embryo]]-like bodies with structures resembling a [[germ disk]], [[yolk sac]], and [[amniotic sac]]. [[Syncytiotrophoblast|Syncytiotrophoblast giant cells]] also occur in polyembryomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Squamous cell carcinoma ====\nPrimary ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are rare and have a poor prognosis when advanced. More typically, ovarian squamous cell carcinomas are cervical metastases, areas of differentiation in an endometrioid tumor, or derived from a mature teratoma.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n==== Mixed tumors ====\nMixed tumors contain elements of more than one of the above classes of tumor histology. To be classed as a mixed tumor, the minor type must make up more than 10% of the tumor.<ref name=\":7\" /> Though mixed carcinomas can have any combination of cell types, mixed ovarian cancers are typically serous/endometrioid or clear cell/endometrioid.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Mixed germ cell tumors make up approximately 25\u201330% of all germ cell ovarian cancers, with combinations of dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumor, and/or immature teratoma. The prognosis and treatment vary based on the component cell types.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n==== Secondary ovarian cancer ====\nOvarian cancer can also be a secondary cancer, the result of [[metastasis]] from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body.<ref name=Harrisons/> About 7% of ovarian cancers are due to metastases, while the rest are primary cancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Common primary cancers are [[breast cancer]], [[colon cancer]], [[appendiceal cancer]], and [[stomach cancer]] (primary gastric cancers that metastasize to the ovary are called [[Krukenberg tumor]]s).<ref name=Harrisons/> Krukenberg tumors have signet ring cells and mucinous cells.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> Endometrial cancer and lymphomas can also metastasize to the ovary.<ref name=Levy>{{Cite book|title = Premalignant & Malignant Disorders of the Ovaries & Oviducts|last = Levy|first = Gary | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|last2 = Purcell|last3 = Karen|work = CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment: Obstetrics & Gynecology, 11e| veditors = DeCherney AH, Nathan L, Laufer N, Roman AS |url = http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|isbn = 978-0-07-163856-2|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170910175639/http://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?bookid=498&sectionid=41008645|archivedate = 2017-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==== Borderline tumors====\nOvarian [[borderline tumor]]s, sometimes called low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian tumors, have some benign and some malignant features.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> LMP tumors make up approximately 10%-15% of all ovarian tumors.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> They develop earlier than epithelial ovarian cancer, around the age of 40\u201349. They typically do not have extensive invasion; 10% of LMP tumors have areas of stromal microinvasion (<3mm, <5% of tumor). LMP tumors have other abnormal features, including increased mitosis, [[pleomorphism (cytology)|changes in cell size or nucleus size]], [[nuclear atypia|abnormal nuclei]], cell stratification, and [[papillary projections|small projections on cells]] (papillary projections). Serous and/or mucinous characteristics can be seen on histological examination, and serous histology makes up the overwhelming majority of advanced LMP tumors. More than 80% of LMP tumors are Stage I; 15% are stage II and III and less than 5% are stage IV.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Implants of LMP tumors are often non-invasive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Staging ===\nOvarian cancer is staged using the [[International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics|FIGO]] staging system and uses information obtained after surgery, which can include a total [[Hysterectomy|abdominal hysterectomy]] via [[Laparotomy|midline laparotomy]], [[Salpingoophorectomy|removal of (usually) both ovaries and Fallopian tubes]], [[Omentectomy|(usually) the omentum]], [[pelvic washing|pelvic (peritoneal) washing]]s, assessment of [[Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection|retroperitoneal lymph nodes]] (including the [[Pelvic lymph nodes|pelvic]] and [[Paraaortic lymph node|para-aortic lymph nodes]]), [[appendectomy]] in suspected mucinous tumors, and pelvic/peritoneal biopsies for [[cytopathology]].<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=SGO/> Around 30% of ovarian cancers that appear confined to the ovary have metastasized microscopically, which is why even stage-I cancers must be staged completely.<ref name=Harrisons/> 22% of cancers presumed to be stage I are observed to have lymphatic metastases.<ref name=\":7\" /> The AJCC stage is the same as the FIGO stage.

Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the [[lymphatic system]] and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the [[Suspensory ligament of ovary|infundibulopelvic ligament]], the [[Broad ligament of the uterus|broad ligament]], and the [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]. The most commonly affected groups include the [[paraaortic lymph node|paraaortic]], [[hypogastric lymph node|hypogastric]], [[external iliac lymph nodes|external iliac]], [[obturator lymph nodes|obturator]], and [[inguinal lymph node]]s. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\n== Screening ==\nThere is no simple and reliable way to test for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any signs or symptoms. Screening is not recommended in women who are at average risk, as evidence does not support a reduction in death and the high rate of false positive tests may lead to unneeded surgery, which is accompanied by its own risks.<ref name=Gros2018/> The [[Pap test]] does not screen for ovarian cancer.<ref name = CDCsep2016/>\n\nOvarian cancer is usually only palpable in advanced stages.<ref name=Hoffman35/>  Screening is not recommended using [[CA-125]] measurements, [[HE4]] levels, ultrasound, or adnexal palpation in women who are at average risk. Risk of developing ovarian cancer in those with genetic factors can be reduced. Those with a genetic predisposition may benefit from screening. This high risk group has benefited with earlier detection.<ref name=Jayson/><ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82>{{cite book |last1 = Croswell |first1 = Jennifer M. |last2 = Brawley |first2 = Otis W. |last3 = Kramer |first3 = Barnett S. | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Prevention and Early Detection of Cancer |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref>\n\nOvarian cancer has low prevalence, even in the high-risk group of women from the ages of 50 to 60 (about one in 2000), and screening of women with average risk is more likely to give ambiguous results than detect a problem which requires treatment. Because ambiguous results are more likely than detection of a treatable problem, and because the usual response to ambiguous results is invasive interventions, in women of average risk, the potential harms of having screening without an indication outweigh the potential benefits. The purpose of screening is to diagnose ovarian cancer at an early stage, when it is more likely to be treated successfully.<ref name=Harrisons/><ref name=Harrisons82/>\n\nScreening with [[transvaginal ultrasound]], pelvic examination, and CA-125 levels can be used instead of preventive surgery in women who have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This strategy has shown some success.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\n== Prevention==\nPeople with strong genetic risk for ovarian cancer may consider the surgical removal of their ovaries as a preventive measure.

The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby invasion of other tissues by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may  remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), uterus (hysterectomy), and the [[Greater omentum|omentum]] (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.<ref name=\"CanadianCS2017\" />\n\nFor low-grade, unilateral stage-IA cancers, only the involved ovary (which must be unruptured) and Fallopian tube will be removed. This can be done especially in young people who wish to preserve their fertility. However, a risk of microscopic metastases exists and staging must be completed.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> If any metastases are found, a second surgery to remove the remaining ovary and uterus is needed.<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Tranexamic acid]] can be administered prior to surgery to reduce the need for blood transfusions due to blood loss during the surgery.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIf a tumor in a premenopausal woman is determined to be a low malignant potential tumor during surgery, and it is clearly stage I cancer, only the affected ovary is removed. For postmenopausal women with low malignant potential tumors, hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is still the preferred option. During staging, the appendix can be examined or removed. This is particularly important with mucinous tumors.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> In children or adolescents with ovarian cancer, surgeons typically attempt to preserve one ovary to allow for the completion of [[puberty]], but if the cancer has spread, this is not always possible. Dysgerminomas in particular tend to affect both ovaries: 8\u201315% of dysgerminomas are present in both ovaries.<ref name=\"Current\" /> People with low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors are typically treated only with surgery,<ref name=\"Harrisons\" /> which is often curative.<ref name=\":1\" /> In general, germ cell tumors can be treated with unilateral surgery unless the cancer is widespread or fertility is not a factor.<ref name=\":8\" /> In women with surgically staged advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (stages III and IV), studies suggest all attempts should be made to reach complete cytoreduction (surgical efforts to remove the bulk of the tumor).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Elattar|first=Ahmed|last2=Bryant|first2=Andrew|last3=Winter-Roach|first3=Brett A|last4=Hatem|first4=Mohamed|last5=Naik|first5=Raj|date=2011-08-10|title=Optimal primary surgical treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD007565|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd007565.pub2|issn=1465-1858|pmc=6457688|pmid=21833960}}</ref>\n\nIn advanced cancers, where complete removal is not an option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called [[debulking]] surgery. This surgery is not always successful, and is less likely to be successful in women with extensive metastases in the peritoneum, stage- IV disease, cancer in the [[porta hepatis|transverse fissure of the liver]], [[mesentery]], or diaphragm, and large areas of ascites. Debulking surgery is usually only done once.<ref name=Jayson/> More complete debulking is associated with better outcomes: women with no macroscopic evidence of disease after debulking have a median survival of 39 months, as opposed to 17 months with less complete surgery.<ref name=Harrisons/> By removing metastases, many cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are removed, and any clumps of cells that have died are also removed. This allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells, which are more likely to be fast-growing and therefore chemosensitive.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nInterval debulking surgery is another protocol used, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, debulking surgery is performed, and chemotherapy is finished after debulking.<ref name=\":2\" /> Though no definitive studies have been completed, it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary debulking surgery in terms of survival, and shows slightly lower morbidity.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nThere are several different surgical procedures that can be employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since debulking metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending on the extent of the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, [[omentectomy]], [[splenectomy]], [[bowel resection]], [[Diaphragm resection|diaphragm stripping or resection]], [[appendectomy]], or even a posterior [[pelvic exenteration]].<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nTo fully stage ovarian cancer, [[lymphadenectomy]] can be included in the surgery, but a significant survival benefit to this practice may not happen.<ref name=Jayson/> This is particularly important in germ cell tumors because they frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes.<ref name=Harrisons/>\n\nIf ovarian cancer recurs, secondary surgery is sometimes a treatment option. This depends on how easily the tumor can be removed, how much fluid has accumulated in the abdomen, and overall health.<ref name=Jayson/> It can be helpful in people who had their first surgery done by a generalist and in epithelial ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":7\" /> Secondary surgery can be effective in dysgerminomas and immature teratomas.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe major side effect of an oophorectomy in younger women is early [[menopause]], which can cause [[osteoporosis]]. After surgery, hormone replacement therapy can be considered, especially in younger women. This therapy can consist of a combination of estrogen and progesterone, or estrogen alone. Estrogen alone is safe after hysterectomy; when the uterus is still present, unopposed estrogen dramatically raises the risk of [[endometrial cancer]].<ref name=Jayson/> Estrogen therapy after surgery does not change survival rates.<ref name=\":7\" /> People having ovarian cancer surgery are typically hospitalized afterwards for 3\u20134 days and spend around a month recovering at home.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Surgery for ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/surgery-for-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518161131/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/surgery-for-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref> Surgery outcomes are best at hospitals that do a large number of ovarian cancer surgeries.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" />\n\nIt is unclear if [[laparoscopy]] or [[laparotomy]] is better or worse for FIGO stage I ovarian cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Falcetta FS, Lawrie TA, Medeiros LR, da Rosa MI, Edelweiss MI, Stein AT, Zelmanowicz A, Moraes AB, Zanini RR, Rosa DD | display-authors = 6 | title = Laparoscopy versus laparotomy for FIGO stage I ovarian cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | pages = CD005344 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27737492 | pmc = 6464147 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005344.pub4 }}</ref> There is also no apparent difference between total abdominal hysterectomy and supracervical hysterectomy for advanced cancers.

Chemotherapy is used after surgery to treat any residual disease, if appropriate.  In some cases, there may be reason to perform chemotherapy first, followed by surgery. This is called \"neoadjuvant chemotherapy\", and is common when a tumor cannot be completely removed or optimally debulked via surgery. Though it has not been shown to increase survival, it can reduce the risk of complications after surgery.

Interventions are available to help with the needs and social support. Many ovarian cancer survivors report a good quality of life and [[optimism]]. Others reported a \"spiritual change\" that helped them find [[Meaning of life|meaning]] during their experience. Others have described their loss of faith after their diagnosis with ovarian cancer.

It is disproportionately deadly because it lacks any clear early detection or screening test, meaning most cases are not diagnosed until they have reached advanced stages.<ref name=\"SGOfive\"/><ref name=Jayson/>\n\nOvarian cancer metastasizes early in its development, often before it has been diagnosed. High-grade tumors metastasize more readily than low-grade tumors. Typically, tumor cells begin to metastasize by growing in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Harrisons/> More than 60% of women presenting with ovarian cancer have stage-III or stage-IV cancer, when it has already spread beyond the ovaries. Ovarian cancers shed cells into the naturally occurring fluid within the abdominal cavity. These cells can then implant on other abdominal (peritoneal) structures, including the uterus, [[urinary bladder]], [[bowel]],  [[mesentery|lining of the bowel wall]], and [[Greater omentum|omentum]], forming new tumor growths before cancer is even suspected.\n\nThe five-year survival rate for all stages of ovarian cancer is 46%; the one-year survival rate is 72% and the ten-year survival rate is 35%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Statistics and outlook for ovarian cancer|url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|website = www.cancerresearchuk.org|accessdate = 2015-05-16|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518192429/http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/type/ovarian-cancer/treatment/statistics-and-outlook-for-ovarian-cancer|archivedate = 2015-05-18}}</ref> For cases where a diagnosis is made early in the disease, when the cancer is still confined to the primary site, the five-year survival rate is 92.7%.<ref name=\"SEER\">Survival rates based on SEER incidence and NCHS mortality statistics, as cited by the National Cancer Institute in [http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html SEER Stat Fact Sheets&nbsp;\u2014 Cancer of the Ovary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706145616/http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/ovary.html |date=2014-07-06 }}</ref> About 70% of women with advanced disease respond to initial treatment, most of whom attain complete remission, but half of these women experience a recurrence 1\u20134 years after treatment.<ref name=Harrisons/> [[Brain metastasis]] is more common in stage III/IV cancer but can still occur in cancers staged at I/II. People with brain metastases survive a median of 8.2 months, though surgery, chemotherapy, and [[Whole brain radiotherapy|whole brain radiation therapy]] can improve survival.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOvarian cancer survival varies significantly with subtype. Dysgerminomas have a very favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.<ref name=Current/> Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I.<ref name=\":8\" /> Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a decade or more.<ref name=Harrisons/> Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.<ref name=Hoffman35/>\n\nComplications of ovarian cancer can include spread of the cancer to other organs, progressive function loss of various organs, ascites, and intestinal obstructions, which can be fatal. Intestinal obstructions in multiple sites are the most common proximate cause of death.<ref name=Jayson/> Intestinal obstruction in ovarian cancer can either be a true obstruction, where tumor blocks the [[intestinal lumen]], or a pseudo-obstruction, when tumor prevents normal [[peristalsis]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Gucalp |first1 = Rasim |last2 = Dutcher |first2 = Janice | name-list-format = vanc |chapter = Oncologic Emergencies |veditors = Longo DL, Kasper DL, Jameson JL, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Loscalzo J |title = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine |publisher = McGraw-Hill |year = 2012 |edition = 18th |isbn = 978-0-07-174889-6|title-link = Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine }}</ref> Continuous accumulation of ascites can be treated by placing a drain that can be self-drained.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\n=== Prognostic factors ===\nThere are a number of [[prognostic factor]]s in ovarian cancer. Positive prognostic factors - those indicating better chances of survival - include no residual disease after surgery (stage III/IV), complete macroscopic resection (stage IV), BRCA2 mutations, young age (under 45 years), nonserous type, low histologic grade, early stage, co-occurrence with endometrial cancer, and low CA-125 levels. There is conflicting evidence for BRCA1 as a prognostic factor. Conversely, negative prognostic factors - those that indicate a worse chance of survival - include rupture of the ovarian capsule during surgery, older age (over 45 years), mucinous type, stage IV, high histologic grade, clear cell type, upper abdominal involvement, high CA-125 levels, the presence of tumor cells in the blood, and elevated [[Cyclooxygenase 2|cyclooxygenase-2]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nExpression of various mRNAs can also be prognostic for ovarian cancer. High levels of [[Drosha]] and [[Dicer]] are associated with improved survival, whereas high levels of [[let-7b]], [[HIF1A]], [[EPH receptor A1|EphA1]], and [[Poly ADP ribose polymerase|poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase]] are associated with worse survival. Cancers that are positive for [[WT1]] carry a worse prognosis; estrogen-receptor positive cancers have a better prognosis.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Survival rates ===\nOverall five-year survival rates for all types of ovarian cancer are presented below by stage and histologic grade:<ref name=Harrisons/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-align: center; margin-right: 10px;\"\n!

Overall, in a 5-year period, 20% of stage I and II cancers recur. Most recurrences are in the abdomen.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\" /> If a recurrence occurs in advanced disease, it typically occurs within 18 months of initial treatment (18 months [[progression-free survival]]). Recurrences can be treated, but the disease-free interval tends to shorten and chemoresistance increases with each recurrence.<ref name=Jayson/> When a dysgerminoma recurs, it is most likely to recur within a year of diagnosis, and other malignant germ cell tumors recur within 2 years 90% of the time. Germ cell tumors other than dysgerminomas have a poor prognosis when they relapse, with a 10% long-term survival rate.<ref name=\":8\"/> Low malignant potential tumors rarely relapse, even when fertility-sparing surgery is the treatment of choice. 15% of LMP tumors relapse after unilateral surgery in the previously unaffected ovary, and they are typically easily treated with surgery. More advanced tumors may take up to 20 years to relapse, if they relapse at all, and are only treated with surgery unless the tumor has changed its histological characteristics or grown very quickly. In these cases, and when there is significant ascites, chemotherapy may also be used. Relapse is usually indicated by rising CA-125 levels and then progresses to symptomatic relapse within 2\u20136 months.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Recurrent sex cord-stromal tumors are typically unresponsive to treatment but not aggressive.<ref name=\":8\"/>\n\nIt is the most deadly gynecologic cancer.<ref name=\"Hoffman35\">{{cite book |chapter = Epithelial Ovarian Cancer |pages = 853\u2013878 |title = Williams Gynecology |edition = 2nd |publisher = McGraw Hill Medical |first1 = Barbara L. |last1 = Hoffman |first2 = John O. |last2 = Schorge |first3 = Joseph I. |last3 = Schaffer |first4 = Lisa M. |last4 = Halvorson |first5 = Karen D. |last5 = Bradshaw |first6 = F.

One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery.<ref name=Jayson/> The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population.<ref name=Hoffman35/> Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Prognosis research===\nResearch into various [[prognostic factor]]s for ovarian cancer is also going on. Recent research shows that [[thrombocytosis]] predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer.<ref name=Jayson/> Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Immunotherapy===\nWhile an active area of research, as of 2018 there is no goodevidence that [[immunotherapy]] is effective for ovarian cancer.<ref name=\"pmid30199097\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Paijens ST, Leffers N, Daemen T, Helfrich W, Boezen HM, Cohlen BJ, Melief CJ, de Bruyn M, Nijman HW | title = Antigen-specific active immunotherapy for ovarian cancer | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = CD007287 | date = September 2018 | pmid = 30199097 | pmc = 6513204 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007287.pub4 }}</ref> However, trials of the antibody and [[VEGF]] inhibitor [[bevacizumab]], which can slow the [[angiogenesis|growth of new blood vessels]] in the cancer, have shown promising results, especially in combination with [[pazopanib]], which also slows the process of blood vessel growth. Bevacizumab has been particularly effective in preliminary studies on stage-III and -IV cancer<ref name=Jayson/> and has been cited as having at least a 15% response rate.<ref name=Harrisons/> It is being investigated particularly in mucinous ovarian cancers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Pharmacology===\n[[mTOR inhibitor]]s were a highly investigated potential treatment in the 2000s and 2010s, but the side effects of these drugs (particularly [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hyperlipidemia]]) were not well tolerated and the survival benefit not confirmed. PI3 kinase inhibitors have been of interest, but they tend to be highly toxic and cause [[diarrhea]]. Another investigated drug is [[selumetinib]], a [[MAPK]] inhibitor. It improved survival, but did not correlate with any mutations found in tumors.<ref name=Jayson/>\n\nBevacizumab can also be combined with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[proteinuria]]. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to [[fistula]]e or [[bowel perforation]]. [[Vintafolide]], which consists of an [[antifolate]] conjugated with [[vinblastine]], is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because [[folate receptor]]s are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers.<ref name=Jayson/> Another potential immunotherapy is [[trastuzumab]], which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations.<ref name=Harrisons/> Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. [[Combretastatin]] and [[pazopanib]] are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. [[Trebananib]] and [[tasquinimod]] are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The [[monoclonal antibody]] [[farletuzumab]] is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves [[vaccines]], including [[TroVax]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nAn alternative to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of [[carboplatin]] and [[etoposide]], is a current topic of research for germ cell malignancies.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[Intraperitoneal chemotherapy]] has also been under investigation during the 2000s and 2010s for its potential to deliver higher doses of cytotoxic agent to tumors. Preliminary trials with cisplatin and paclitaxel have shown it is not well tolerated, but does improve survival, and more tolerable regimens are being researched.<ref name=Jayson/> Cisplatin and paclitaxel are both being researched as intraperitoneal chemotherapy agents. A specific chemotherapy regimen for rare clear-cell cancers is also under investigation: [[irinotecan]] combined with cisplatin.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[PARP inhibitor]]s have also shown promise in early trials, particularly in people with ''BRCA'' gene mutations, since the BRCA protein interacts with the PARP pathway. It is also being studied in recurrent ovarian cancer in general, where preliminary studies have shown longer PFS. Specifically, [[olaparib]] has shown greater survival compared to doxorubicin, though this treatment is still being investigated. It is not clear yet which [[biomarker]]s are predictive of responsiveness to PARP inhibitors.<ref name=Jayson/> [[Rucaparib]] is another PARP inhibitor being researched in BRCA-positive and BRCA-negative recurrent advanced ovarian cancer. [[Niraparib]] is a PARP inhibitor being tested in BRCA-positive recurrent ovarian cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Tyrosine kinase inhibitors]] are another investigational drug class that may have applications in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the [[receptor tyrosine kinase]] inhibitor group, including [[pazopanib]], [[cediranib]], and [[nintedanib]], have also been shown to increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015.<ref name=\"Jayson\" /> Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3\u20134 months and increased survival by 3 months.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[MK-1775]] is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. [[Nintedanib]] is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Histone deacetylase inhibitor]]s (HDACi) are another area of research.\n\n===Hormones and radiation===\nHormone therapies are a topic of current research in ovarian cancer, particularly, the value of certain medications used to treat breast cancer. These include [[tamoxifen]], [[letrozole]], and [[anastrozole]]. Preliminary studies have showed a benefit for tamoxifen in a small number of people with advanced ovarian cancer. Letrozole may help to slow or stop growth of [[estrogen receptor]] positive ovarian cancer. Anastrozole is being investigated in postmenopausal people with estrogen receptor-positive cancer.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nResearch into mitigating side effects of ovarian cancer treatment is also ongoing. [[Radiation fibrosis]], the formation of scar tissue in an area treated with radiation, may be relieved with [[Hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen therapy]], but research has not been completed in this area. Treatment of ovarian cancer may also cause people to experience psychiatric difficulties, including [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Research is ongoing to determine how counseling and psychotherapy can help people who have ovarian cancer during treatment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Inflammation===\n\nThere are some indications that pelvic inflammatory disease may be associated with ovarian cancer, especially in non-western countries.

The manager would cut [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]]s on behalf of clients who may not be as charismatic (or had [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]s depicting them as silent, or with limited ability to speak [[English language|English]]). As such, successful managers almost invariably had the \"[[Blarney Stone|gift of the gab]]\", though it wasn't unheard of to see managers paired with wrestlers who had no trouble cutting their own promos. A notable example of this would be [[CM Punk]], who was managed by [[Paul Heyman]] from 2012 to 2013. Punk had no trouble cutting his own promos, but Heyman would also cut his own promos alongside Punk in support of his client's act.\n\n[[File:Paul Bearer in 1996.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Paul Bearer]] carrying the urn he used to control [[The Undertaker]]]]\nWhile the basic goal of a manager to give his or her wrestlers a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] does not change, the tactics depend on several factors, especially alignment. Managers, when used judiciously, are capable of completely change the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match. A heel manager, for example, may instruct their clients to constantly duck tougher opponents or interfere in their matches to secure a win by cheating. A [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] manager, on the other hand, may spend the majority of their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#P|interview time]] talking about how tough their client is and going out of their way to find bigger and better opponents to challenge, or rally the audience to chant and cheer in support of their client during matches. Often the very act of aligning with a manager, or conversely breaking away from a manager they've worked with, can change a wrestler's alignment, making them a sudden fan favorite or heel.\n\nCertain wrestlers employ a specific kind of manager known as a \"handler.\" If a wrestler's character calls for it, a handler is the only person who can manage the behaviour of a \"wild\" wrestler's who is prone to \"go out of control\". A classic example of this was [[The Undertaker]], who in his early [[The Undertaker#Debut and various feuds .281990.E2.80.931994.29|Deadman]] persona could only be controlled by [[Paul Bearer]], through an urn which was said to have all of the Undertaker's powers. A legitimate example is [[Arnold Skaaland]], who not only managed [[Andre The Giant]] for a time but was once assigned by promoter [[Vince McMahon Sr.]] as his real life handler. Skaaland was responsible for keeping Andre, known for his alcoholism, out of serious trouble and to ensure that he would reach a venue in time to wrestle a scheduled match.<ref>{{cite| url=https://drunkard.com/10_06_andre_giant/174735832588632/| title=The Greatest Drunk on Earth: Andre the Giant | publisher= Modern Drunkard Magazine| author=English, Richard }}</ref>\n\nA few managers, like [[Paul Ellering]], are [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#legit|legitimate]] managers in the truest sense of the word, taking care of the day-to-day needs of their clients by dealing with travel arrangements, rentals, lodgings and even contractual negotiations.<ref>{{cite | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1fsWqWR0V8 | title=Jim Cornette on \"Precious\" Paul Ellering Legitimately Managing the Road Warriors in NWA/WCW | author=Cornette, Jim | date=17 June 2017}}</ref> Others, such as [[Jim Cornette]] or [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], participate as real-life bookers and/or road agents for their promotions behind the scenes while performing concurrently as managers.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Black Jack Lanza & Bobby Heenan - The New Illustrated Wrestling News A.W.A. Edition - 1971 No.46.jpg|thumb|[[Blackjack Lanza]] with longtime manager [[Bobby Heenan]]]]\nIn the [[History of professional wrestling#1887\u20131950s|early years of pro wrestling]], the vast majority of professional wrestling managers were men, and female managers were rare. A number of prominent women like [[Miss Elizabeth]], [[Sherri Martel]] and [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]] made their debuts during the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]] and went on to have storied careers in several wrestling promotions as wrestling managers.\n\nUp until the mid-1990s, managers were very common because they served a secondary purpose: \"getting [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]].\" During the territorial era, most managers did not travel from territory to territory, but instead remained in one territory to provide instant heat to the promotion's new heel acts. Notable examples include \"The Mouth of The South\" [[Jimmy Hart]] in Memphis, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]] in the [[American Wrestling Association]], and the \"Three Wise Men\" ([[Lou Albano]], [[Freddie Blassie]], and [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]]) in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (now the WWE).<ref name =\"Managers\">{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1114/567352/views-from-the-turnbuckle-a-look-at-histories-greatest-managers/| title=Views From The Turnbuckle: A Look At Histories Greatest Managers, Managers Today And More | publisher= Wrestling Inc| author=Collings, Jesse | date=13 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy the 2000s, major promotions like the WWE have favoured elevating the careers of wrestlers who are able to speak for themselves. As a result, the previously ubiquitous role of a manager has declined in favor of either female valets who occasionally get involved in wrestling matches, or by [[Professional wrestling authority figures|people who hold on-screen power]] as General Managers, Commissioners or various corporate officer positions.<ref name =\"Managers\" /> However, contemporary wrestling personalities such as [[Paul Heyman]] and [[Vickie Guerrero]] have demonstrated that managers are still effective at drawing heat, and when used judiciously, are capable of changing the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match by contributing drama and tension.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.geek.com/news/professional-wrestlings-best-managers-1639645/| title=Professional wrestling\u2019s best managers | publisher= Geek.com| author=Sitterson, Aubrey | date=17 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Miz and Maryse.jpg|left|thumb|[[Maryse Ouellet|Maryse]] depicted as a manager or valet for [[The Miz]], her real life husband.]] \nAlthough managers and valets are terms used interchangeably for a woman who accompanies a wrestler to the ring, a major point of difference is that the former is usually depicted as a professional spokesperson who crafts and/or guides a wrestler's career, while the latter may serve as little more than [[Attractiveness#Eye candy (slang for visual appeal)|eye candy]] and/or as a distraction to opposing wrestlers or [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]]s with their [[Sexual attraction|sex appeal]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=95ZzAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=valet+eye+candy&source=bl&ots=59_foYEYnD&sig=EWnTOH3U-WPGZWaxRQBJC_G55QQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWoNq4z9fYAhXKxLwKHTPOB5wQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q=valet%20eye%20candy&f=false | title=A Fool for Old School ... Wrestling, That is | author=Berger, Richard | isbn=\t0981249809}}</ref>\n\nThe role of a valet is a significant part of professional wrestling history, at least within the context of North American industry. Historically, North American women wrestlers often received less attention or recognition compared to their male counterparts and often did not enjoy the same exposure compared to their Japanese or Mexican counterparts. As a result, the purpose of a valet role is to provide female talent more opportunities as well as visibility within the industry. It is thought that a valet, by virtue of her presence and/or the dynamics of her relationship with her associated wrestler, could contribute an element that amplifies their personas and get their act over. Many valets are not required to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cut promos]] on their associated wrestler's behalf and generally have rather passive roles, since their physical appearance tend to be emphasized at the exclusion of all other traits;<ref name=\"Valet\">{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/04/do-valets-still-have-a-place-in-pro-wrestling.html | title=Do Valets still have a place in pro wrestling | publisher=Paste Magazine | accessdate=November 8, 2017}}</ref> other valets may deviate from convention and assert a dominant role over their wrestlers, if their characters call for it.\n\nIn spite of their limited wrestling ability, perceived or otherwise, valets are more likely to participate in the occasional wrestling match in comparison to managers, and are frequently booked in mixed tag team matches against rival valets and their associated wrestlers as part of storyline angles.<ref>{{cite | url=https://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/old-school-wrestling-8-specialty-matches-we-loved-and-7-we-hated/ | title=Old-School Wrestling: 8 Specialty Matches We Loved And 7 We Hated | author=Rock, Rob | publisher = TheSportster.com|date = 28 September 2016}}</ref> There are also numerous examples of female performers in the wrestling industry who started off as valets and went on to be recognized as marquee competitors in their own right, such as [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]], [[Trish Stratus]], and [[The Fabulous Moolah]].<ref name=\"Valet\"/>\n\nMale supporting characters who fit the original definition of a [[valet]] are uncommon in professional wrestling; a recent example was [[Ricardo Rodriguez (wrestler)|Ricardo Rodriguez]], who performed as [[Alberto Del Rio]]'s on-screen attendant and personal ring announcer during his tenure in the WWE.<ref>{{cite | url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/81002/five-moves-of-news-headlines-from-the-world-of-pro-wrestling| title=Five Moves of News: Headlines From the World of Pro-Wrestling!| author=Mateja, Jesse | publisher = Den Of Geek|date = 19 March 2013}}</ref> A male performer who accompanies a prominent female wrestler to the ring could be considered a valet as well, though this is exceptionally rare.<ref name=\"Valet\"/>\n[[File:Christian cage 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Travis Tomko|Tomko]] (left) working as [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]'s enforcer]]\nWhile they are not managers in the traditional sense, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#enforcer|enforcers]] \u2014 full-time wrestlers who accompany another wrestler to the ring \u2014 also serve both in and out of storylines to further the interests of a wrestler in their care.  Larger but less charismatic wrestlers are conventionally booked in the role of an enforcer; this is done so that these wrestlers can get over with the crowd by sharing the charisma of the wrestler they accompany. A wrestler can also be the enforcer for an entire stable, traditionally serving as the biggest and strongest individual in the group (if not the entire promotion). In this scenario, the enforcer is utilized to \"protect\" the leader of the faction, and is often relegated to tag team matches to help them get over with the fans. Enforcers appear in storylines where wrestlers need to have their back watched by keeping outside interference from taking place in a match, to serve as outside interference themselves, or to further a storyline without actually recording a real match by defending their associates from ambushes outside the ring by other wrestlers. [[The Acolytes Protection Agency]] (APA) had a unique gimmick where instead of a long term association with one wrestler, tag team or stable, they would be hired by different wrestlers each week to act as their bodyguards or to prevent outside interference.\n\nPerhaps the best-known example in professional wrestling history is [[Arn Anderson]], whose career has been highlighted by his association with Ric Flair and various members of [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] stable as \"The Enforcer\".<ref>{{cite | url=https://www.postandcourier.com/staff/mike_mooneyham/arn-anderson-was-heart-of-the-horsemen/article_bf908834-3c67-52b4-9170-29bde4a5875b.html| title=Arn Anderson was heart of the Horsemen| author=Mooneyham, Mike | publisher = The Post and Courier|date = July 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of professional wrestling managers and valets]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Professional wrestling slang]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Supporting character in professional wrestling}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Brock Lesnar with Paul Heyman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brock Lesnar]] being accompanied by his \"Advocate\", [[Paul Heyman]]]]\nIn [[professional wrestling]], a '''manager''' is a [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|supporting character]] paired with a wrestler (or wrestlers) for a variety of reasons.

A [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] manager, on the other hand, may spend the majority of their [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#P|interview time]] talking about how tough their client is and going out of their way to find bigger and better opponents to challenge, or rally the audience to chant and cheer in support of their client during matches. Often the very act of aligning with a manager, or conversely breaking away from a manager they've worked with, can change a wrestler's alignment, making them a sudden fan favorite or heel.\n\nCertain wrestlers employ a specific kind of manager known as a \"handler.\" If a wrestler's character calls for it, a handler is the only person who can manage the behaviour of a \"wild\" wrestler's who is prone to \"go out of control\". A classic example of this was [[The Undertaker]], who in his early [[The Undertaker#Debut and various feuds .281990.E2.80.931994.29|Deadman]] persona could only be controlled by [[Paul Bearer]], through an urn which was said to have all of the Undertaker's powers. A legitimate example is [[Arnold Skaaland]], who not only managed [[Andre The Giant]] for a time but was once assigned by promoter [[Vince McMahon Sr.]] as his real life handler. Skaaland was responsible for keeping Andre, known for his alcoholism, out of serious trouble and to ensure that he would reach a venue in time to wrestle a scheduled match.<ref>{{cite| url=https://drunkard.com/10_06_andre_giant/174735832588632/| title=The Greatest Drunk on Earth: Andre the Giant | publisher= Modern Drunkard Magazine| author=English, Richard }}</ref>\n\nA few managers, like [[Paul Ellering]], are [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#legit|legitimate]] managers in the truest sense of the word, taking care of the day-to-day needs of their clients by dealing with travel arrangements, rentals, lodgings and even contractual negotiations.<ref>{{cite | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1fsWqWR0V8 | title=Jim Cornette on \"Precious\" Paul Ellering Legitimately Managing the Road Warriors in NWA/WCW | author=Cornette, Jim | date=17 June 2017}}</ref> Others, such as [[Jim Cornette]] or [[Gary Hart (wrestler)|Gary Hart]], participate as real-life bookers and/or road agents for their promotions behind the scenes while performing concurrently as managers.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Black Jack Lanza & Bobby Heenan - The New Illustrated Wrestling News A.W.A. Edition - 1971 No.46.jpg|thumb|[[Blackjack Lanza]] with longtime manager [[Bobby Heenan]]]]\nIn the [[History of professional wrestling#1887\u20131950s|early years of pro wrestling]], the vast majority of professional wrestling managers were men, and female managers were rare. A number of prominent women like [[Miss Elizabeth]], [[Sherri Martel]] and [[Nancy Benoit|Woman]] made their debuts during the [[1980s professional wrestling boom]] and went on to have storied careers in several wrestling promotions as wrestling managers.\n\nUp until the mid-1990s, managers were very common because they served a secondary purpose: \"getting [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]].\" During the territorial era, most managers did not travel from territory to territory, but instead remained in one territory to provide instant heat to the promotion's new heel acts. Notable examples include \"The Mouth of The South\" [[Jimmy Hart]] in Memphis, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]] in the [[American Wrestling Association]], and the \"Three Wise Men\" ([[Lou Albano]], [[Freddie Blassie]], and [[Ernie Roth|The Grand Wizard]]) in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (now the WWE).<ref name =\"Managers\">{{cite web| url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2013/1114/567352/views-from-the-turnbuckle-a-look-at-histories-greatest-managers/| title=Views From The Turnbuckle: A Look At Histories Greatest Managers, Managers Today And More | publisher= Wrestling Inc| author=Collings, Jesse | date=13 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy the 2000's, major promotions like the WWE have favoured elevating the careers of wrestlers who are able to speak for themselves. As a result, the previously ubiquitous role of a manager has declined in favor of either female valets who occasionally get involved in wrestling matches, or by [[Professional wrestling authority figures|people who hold on-screen power]] as General Managers, Commissioners or various corporate officer positions.<ref name =\"Managers\" /> However, contemporary wrestling personalities such as [[Paul Heyman]] and [[Vickie Guerrero]] have demonstrated that managers are still effective at drawing heat, and when used judiciously, are capable of changing the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match by contributing drama and tension.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.geek.com/news/professional-wrestlings-best-managers-1639645/| title=Professional wrestling\u2019s best managers | publisher= Geek.com| author=Sitterson, Aubrey | date=17 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Miz and Maryse.jpg|left|thumb|[[Maryse Ouellet|Maryse]] depicted as a manager or valet for [[The Miz]], her real life husband.]] \nAlthough managers and valets are terms used interchangeably for a woman who accompanies a wrestler to the ring, a major point of difference is that the former is usually depicted as a professional spokesperson who crafts and/or guides a wrestler's career, while the latter may serve as little more than [[Attractiveness#Eye candy (slang for visual appeal)|eye candy]] and/or as a distraction to opposing wrestlers or [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]]s with their [[Sexual attraction|sex appeal]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=95ZzAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=valet+eye+candy&source=bl&ots=59_foYEYnD&sig=EWnTOH3U-WPGZWaxRQBJC_G55QQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWoNq4z9fYAhXKxLwKHTPOB5wQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q=valet%20eye%20candy&f=false | title=A Fool for Old School ... Wrestling, That is | author=Berger, Richard | isbn=\t0981249809}}</ref>\n\nThe role of a valet is a significant part of professional wrestling history, at least within the context of North American industry. Historically, North American women wrestlers often received less attention or recognition compared to their male counterparts and often did not enjoy the same exposure compared to their Japanese or Mexican counterparts. As a result, the purpose of a valet role is to provide female talent more opportunities as well as visibility within the industry. It is thought that a valet, by virtue of her presence and/or the dynamics of her relationship with her associated wrestler, could contribute an element that amplifies their personas and get their act over. Many valets are not required to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cut promos]] on their associated wrestler's behalf and generally have rather passive roles, since their physical appearance tend to be emphasized at the exclusion of all other traits;<ref name=\"Valet\">{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/04/do-valets-still-have-a-place-in-pro-wrestling.html | title=Do Valets still have a place in pro wrestling | publisher=Paste Magazine | accessdate=November 8, 2017}}</ref> other valets may deviate from convention and assert a dominant role over their wrestlers, if their characters call for it.\n\nIn spite of their limited wrestling ability, perceived or otherwise, valets are more likely to participate in the occasional wrestling match in comparison to managers, and are frequently booked in mixed tag team matches against rival valets and their associated wrestlers as part of storyline angles.<ref>{{cite | url=https://www.thesportster.com/wrestling/old-school-wrestling-8-specialty-matches-we-loved-and-7-we-hated/ | title=Old-School Wrestling: 8 Specialty Matches We Loved And 7 We Hated | author=Rock, Rob | publisher = TheSportster.com|date = 28 September 2016}}</ref> There are also numerous examples of female performers in the wrestling industry who started off as valets and went on to be recognized as marquee competitors in their own right, such as [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]], [[Trish Stratus]], and [[The Fabulous Moolah]].<ref name=\"Valet\"/>\n\nMale supporting characters who fit the original definition of a [[valet]] are uncommon in professional wrestling; a recent example was [[Ricardo Rodriguez (wrestler)|Ricardo Rodriguez]], who performed as [[Alberto Del Rio]]'s on-screen attendant and personal ring announcer during his tenure in the WWE.<ref>{{cite | url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/81002/five-moves-of-news-headlines-from-the-world-of-pro-wrestling| title=Five Moves of News: Headlines From the World of Pro-Wrestling!| author=Mateja, Jesse | publisher = Den Of Geek|date = 19 March 2013}}</ref> A male performer who accompanies a prominent female wrestler to the ring could be considered a valet as well, though this is exceptionally rare.<ref name=\"Valet\"/>\n[[File:Christian cage 2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Travis Tomko|Tomko]] (left) working as [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]'s enforcer]]\nWhile they are not managers in the traditional sense, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#enforcer|enforcers]] \u2014 full-time wrestlers who accompany another wrestler to the ring \u2014 also serve both in and out of storylines to further the interests of a wrestler in their care.  Larger but less charismatic wrestlers are conventionally booked in the role of an enforcer; this is done so that these wrestlers can get over with the crowd by sharing the charisma of the wrestler they accompany. A wrestler can also be the enforcer for an entire stable, traditionally serving as the biggest and strongest individual in the group (if not the entire promotion). In this scenario, the enforcer is utilized to \"protect\" the leader of the faction, and is often relegated to tag team matches to help them get over with the fans. Enforcers appear in storylines where wrestlers need to have their back watched by keeping outside interference from taking place in a match, to serve as outside interference themselves, or to further a storyline without actually recording a real match by defending their associates from ambushes outside the ring by other wrestlers. [[The Acolytes Protection Agency]] (APA) had a unique gimmick where instead of a long term association with one wrestler, tag team or stable, they would be hired by different wrestlers each week to act as their bodyguards or to prevent outside interference.\n\nPerhaps the best-known example in professional wrestling history is [[Arn Anderson]], whose career has been highlighted by his association with Ric Flair and various members of [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] stable as \"The Enforcer\".<ref>{{cite | url=https://www.postandcourier.com/staff/mike_mooneyham/arn-anderson-was-heart-of-the-horsemen/article_bf908834-3c67-52b4-9170-29bde4a5875b.html| title=Arn Anderson was heart of the Horsemen| author=Mooneyham, Mike | publisher = The Post and Courier|date = July 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of professional wrestling managers and valets]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Professional wrestling slang]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets|*]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)"}

[[University of California, Los Angeles]]</ref>\n\nThe Czech&ndash;Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the [[high medieval]] period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech&ndash;Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the [[Czech National Revival]]. The main [[nonstandard dialect|non-standard variety]], known as Common Czech, is based on the [[vernacular]] of [[Prague]], but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of the Czech Republic. The [[Moravian dialects]] spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.\n\nCzech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten [[monophthong]]s, three [[diphthong]]s and 25 consonants (divided into \"hard\", \"neutral\" and \"soft\" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether.

The diversification of the [[Czech-Slovak languages|Czech-Slovak]] group within [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] began around that time, marked among other things by  its ephemeral use of the [[voiced velar fricative]] consonant (/\u0263/)<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=112}}</ref> and consistent stress on the first syllable.<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=153}}</ref>\n\nThe Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries.

After the [[Bohemian Revolt]] (of predominantly Protestant aristocracy) which was defeated by the [[Habsburg]]s in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language.

This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 25\"/>\n\nSome prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, ''[[wikt:od|od]]'' (from, away from) and ''[[wikt:z#Czech|z]]'' (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; ''[[wikt:na#Czech|na]]'' means \"onto\" or \"for\" with the accusative case, but \"on\" with the locative.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=201\u2013205}}</ref>\n\nThis is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:\n{| cellpadding=3\n|''Czech:'' || ''Nes-l'' || ''js-em'' || ''krabic-i'' || ''do'' || ''dom-u'' || ''se'' || ''sv-\u00fdm'' || ''p\u0159\u00edtel-em.''\n|-\n|''Gloss:'' || carry-SG.M.PST || be-1.SG || box-SG.ACC || into || house-SG.GEN || with || own-SG.INS || friend-SG.INS\n|}\n''English:'' I carried the box into the house with my friend.\n\n====Gender====\n\nCzech distinguishes three [[grammatical gender|genders]]\u2014masculine, feminine, and neuter\u2014and the masculine gender is subdivided into [[animacy|animate]] and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in ''-a'', ''-e'', or a consonant; neuter nouns in ''-o'', ''-e'', or ''-\u00ed'', and masculine nouns in a consonant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=22\u201324}}</ref> Adjectives agree in gender and animacy with the nouns they modify.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=51}}</ref> The main effect of gender in Czech morphology is the difference in noun and adjective declension, as well as in endings of verbal participles and past-tense verbs, which are also marked for gender, e.g. ''d\u011blal'' (he did, or made); ''d\u011blala'' (she did, or made) and ''d\u011blalo'' (it did, or made).<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=141}}</ref> Gender also plays a semantic role; most nouns that describe people and animals, including personal names, have separate masculine and feminine forms which are normally formed by adding a suffix to the stem, for example ''\u010cech'' (Czech man) has the feminine form ''\u010ce\u0161ka'' (Czech woman).<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=238}}</ref>\n\nExamples of declension patterns for noun phrases of various genders follow:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ \n! rowspan=\"2\" | Case\n! colspan=\"4\" | Noun/adjective\n|-\n| Big dog (m. anim. sg.)\n| Black backpack (m. inanim. sg.)\n| Small cat (f. sg.)\n| Hard wood (n. sg.)\n|-\n!

Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five require subject and direct object noun phrases to be declined in the genitive plural instead of the nominative or accusative, and when used as subjects these phrases take singular verbs. For example:<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=114}}</ref>\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!English\n!Czech\n|-\n| one Czech crown was...\n| ''jedna koruna \u010desk\u00e1 byla...''\n|-\n| two Czech crowns were...\n| ''dv\u011b koruny \u010desk\u00e9 byly...''\n|-\n| three Czech crowns were...\n| ''t\u0159i koruny \u010desk\u00e9 byly...''\n|-\n| four Czech crowns were...\n| ''\u010dty\u0159i koruny \u010desk\u00e9 byly...''\n|-\n| five Czech crowns were...\n| ''p\u011bt korun \u010desk\u00fdch bylo...''\n|}\n\nNumbers decline for case, and the numbers one and two are also inflected for gender. Numbers one through five are shown below as examples.

Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ''[[wikt:ruka|ruka]]'' (hand)\u2014''ruce'' (nominative); ''[[wikt:noha|noha]]'' (leg)\u2014''nohama'' (instrumental), ''nohou'' (genitive/locative); ''[[wikt:oko|oko]]'' (eye)\u2014''o\u010di'', and ''[[wikt:ucho|ucho]]'' (ear)\u2014''u\u0161i''. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=40}}</ref> These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in ''mezi \u010dty\u0159ma o\u010dima'' (face to face, lit. ''among four eyes''). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, ''nohy'' (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kom\u00e1rek|2012|p=238}}</ref>\n\n===Verb conjugation===\n{{Main|Czech conjugation}}\nCzech verbs agree with their subjects in [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), and in constructions involving [[participle]]s also in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. They are conjugated for tense (past, present or [[future tense|future]]) and mood ([[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] or [[conditional mood|conditional]]). For example, the conjugated verb ''[[wikt:mluvit|mluv\u00edme]]'' (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the [[infinitive]] ''mluvit'' by its ending, ''-\u00edme''.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 131\"/> The infinitive form of Czech verbs ends in ''-t'' (archaically, ''-ti''). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, ''m\u016f\u017eu t\u011b sly\u0161et''\u2014\"I can ''hear'' you\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=7}}</ref> \n\n====Aspect====\n{{See also|Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages}}\nTypical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two [[grammatical aspect]]s: [[perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs\u2014for example, ''[[wikt:koupit|koupit]]'' (perfective) and ''[[wikt:kupovat|kupovat]]'' (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing or repeated. This is distinct from [[past tense|past]] and [[present tense]].<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 146\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=146}}</ref> Any verb of either aspect can be conjugated into either the past or present tense,<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 131\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=131}}</ref> but the future tense is only used with imperfective verbs.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 151\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=151}}</ref> Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 146\"/>\n\nThe verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix\u2014for example, the imperfective ''ps\u00e1t'' (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective ''napsat'' (to write down). The most common prefixes are ''na-'', ''o-'', ''po-'', ''s-'', ''u-'', ''vy-'', ''z-'' and ''za-''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=147}}</ref> In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs ''koupit'' (to buy) and ''prodat'' (to sell) have the imperfective forms ''kupovat'' and ''prod\u00e1vat''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=147\u2013148}}</ref> Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and [[frequentative]] forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb ''j\u00edt'' (to go) has the iterative form ''chodit'' (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form ''chod\u00edvat'' (to go occasionally).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luke\u0161|first1=Dominik|publisher=DominikLuke\u0161.net|title=Gramatick\u00e1 terminologie ve vyu\u010dov\u00e1n\u00ed - Terminologie a platonick\u00fd sv\u011bt gramatick\u00fdch idej\u00ed|url=http://www.dominiklukes.net/bibliography/platonickysvetgramatickychkategorii|accessdate=August 5, 2014|year=2001}}</ref>\n\nMany verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of being\u2014''[[wikt:b\u00fdt|b\u00fdt]]'' (to be), ''[[wikt:cht\u00edt|cht\u00edt]]'' (to want), ''[[wikt:moct|moct]]'' (to be able to), ''[[wikt:le\u017eet|le\u017eet]]'' (to lie down, to be lying down)\u2014have no perfective form.

Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak State]] (which then aligned with [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]), literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the [[Axis powers]] lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the [[Prague Spring]] of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech,<ref name=\"tuebingen\"/> due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation.

[[University of California, Los Angeles]]</ref>\n\nThe Czech&ndash;Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the [[high medieval]] period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech&ndash;Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the [[Czech National Revival]]. The main [[nonstandard dialect|non-standard variety]], known as Common Czech, is based on the [[vernacular]] of [[Prague]], but is now spoken as an interdialect throughout most of the Czech Republic. The [[Moravian dialects]] spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.\n\nCzech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten [[monophthong]]s, three [[diphthong]]s and 25 consonants (divided into \"hard\", \"neutral\" and \"soft\" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a [[raised alveolar trill]], which is known to occur as a [[phoneme]] in only a few other languages, represented by the [[grapheme]] ''[[\u0159]]''. Czech uses a simple [[orthography]] which [[phonology|phonologists]] have used as a model.\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|right|alt=Language-tree graph|Classification of Czech within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family.

This branch includes [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], [[Upper Sorbian|Upper]] and [[Lower Sorbian]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]].

The West Slavic polity of  [[Great Moravia]] formed by the 9th century. The [[Christianization of Bohemia]] took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the [[Czech-Slovak languages|Czech-Slovak]] group within [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] began around that time, marked among other things by  its ephemeral use of the [[voiced velar fricative]] consonant (/\u0263/)<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=112}}</ref> and consistent stress on the first syllable.<ref>{{Harvnb|Liberman|Trubetskoi|2001|p=153}}</ref>\n\nThe Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries. Literary works written in Czech appear in the late 13th and early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century. The first complete [[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translation]] also dates to this period.<ref name=\"Sussex Cubberley 2011 98 99\"/> Old Czech texts, including poetry and cookbooks, were produced outside the university as well.<ref name=\"Piotrowski 2009 95\">{{Harvnb|Piotrowski|2012|p=95}}</ref>\n\nLiterary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the [[Bohemian Reformation]]. [[Jan Hus]] contributed significantly to the standardization of [[Czech orthography]], advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners (particularly in religion) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language.<ref name=\"Sussex Cubberley 2011 98 99\">{{Harvnb|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=98\u201399}}</ref>\n\n=== Early Modern Czech ===\nThere was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century.<ref name=\"tuebingen\">{{cite web|url=http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/tilman.berger/Publikationen/CzechSlovak.pdf|title=Slovaks in Czechia \u2013 Czechs in Slovakia|publisher=[[University of T\u00fcbingen]]|last=Berger|first=Tilman|accessdate=August 9, 2014}}</ref> In the 16th century, the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent, marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics, especially Slovak Jesuits, beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on the language of the [[Trnava]] region.\n\nThe publication of the [[Kralice Bible]] between 1579 and 1593 (the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages) became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries.\n\nIn 1615, the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom. After the [[Bohemian Revolt]] (of predominantly Protestant aristocracy) which was defeated by the [[Habsburg]]s in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language. In 1627, Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia, especially among the upper classes.<ref name=\"Cerna 2007 26\">{{Harvnb|Cerna|Machalek|2007|p=26}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern Czech ===\n[[File:Jan Vil\u00edmek - Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd.jpg|thumb|right|[[Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd]], whose writing played a key role in reviving Czech as a written language.|alt=In a detailed pencil sketch, a middle-aged man in a suit looks idly into the distance.]]\n{{see also|Czech National Revival}}\nThe modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|p=92}}</ref> By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|p=95}}</ref> Sometime before the 18th century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /\u028e/ which survives in Slovak.<ref name=\"Maxwell 2009 106\"/>\n\nWith the beginning of the national revival of the mid-18th century,  Czech historians began to emphasize their people's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries, rebelling against the [[Counter-Reformation]] (the Habsburg re-catholization efforts which had denigrated Czech and other non-[[Latin language|Latin]] languages).<ref>{{Harvnb|Agnew|1994|p=250}}</ref> Czech [[Philology|philologists]] studied sixteenth-century texts, advocating the return of the language to [[high culture]].<ref name=\"Agnew 1994 251\u2013252\">{{Harvnb|Agnew|1994|pp=251\u2013252}}</ref> This period is known as the Czech National Revival<ref name=\"Wilson 2010 18\">{{Harvnb|Wilson|2009|p=18}}</ref> (or Renaissance).<ref name=\"Agnew 1994 251\u2013252\"/>\n\nDuring the national revival, in 1809 linguist and historian [[Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd]] released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled ''Ausf\u00fchrliches Lehrgeb\u00e4ude der b\u00f6hmischen Sprache'' (''Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language'').

However, [[Josef Jungmann]] and other revivalists used Dobrovsk\u00fd's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival.<ref name=\"Wilson 2010 18\"/> Changes during this time included spelling reform (notably, ''\u00ed'' in place of the former ''j'' and ''j'' in place of ''g''), the use of ''t'' (rather than ''ti'') to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns (which had been a late borrowing from German).<ref name=\"Maxwell 2009 106\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|2009|p=106}}</ref> These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chloupek|Nekvapil|1993|p=96}}</ref> Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal, widespread use.<ref name=\"Wilson 2010 18\"/>\n\nAdherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from [[Common Czech]] (a widespread, informally used interdialectal variety), such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined.

As a [[pro-drop language]], in Czech an [[Transitivity (grammar)|intransitive]] sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=74}}</ref> Enclitics (primarily [[auxiliary verb]]s and pronouns) appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence, after the first stressed unit.

In practice, however, word order is flexible and used for [[topicalization]] and focus. Although Czech has a [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] [[Passive voice|passive]] construction (like English), in colloquial style, word-order changes frequently replace the passive voice. For example, to change \"Peter killed Paul\" to \"Paul was killed by Peter\" the order of subject and object is inverted: ''Petr zabil Pavla'' (\"Peter killed Paul\") becomes \"Paul, Peter killed\" (''Pavla zabil Petr''). ''Pavla'' is in the [[accusative case]], the grammatical object of the verb.{{sfn|Short|2009|p=325}}\n \nA word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized, unless an upward [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] indicates that the sentence is a question:<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n*''Pes j\u00ed bagetu.'' \u2013 The dog eats the baguette (rather than eating something else).\n*''Bagetu j\u00ed pes.'' \u2013 The dog eats the baguette (rather than someone else doing so).\n*''Pes bagetu j\u00ed.'' \u2013 The dog eats the baguette (rather than doing something else to it).\n*''J\u00ed pes bagetu?'' \u2013 Does the dog eat the baguette?

This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 25\"/>\n\nSome prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, ''[[wikt:od|od]]'' (from, away from) and ''[[wikt:z#Czech|z]]'' (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; ''[[wikt:na#Czech|na]]'' means \"onto\" or \"for\" with the accusative case, but \"on\" with the locative.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=201\u2013205}}</ref>\n\nThis is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:\n{| cellpadding=3\n|''Czech:'' || ''Nes-l'' || ''js-em'' || ''krabic-i'' || ''do'' || ''dom-u'' || ''se'' || ''sv-\u00fdm'' || ''p\u0159\u00edtel-em.''\n|-\n|''Gloss:'' || carry-SG.M.PST || be-1.SG || box-SG.ACC || into || house-SG.GEN || with || own-SG.INS || friend-SG.INS\n|}\n''English:'' I carried the box into the house with my friend.\n\n====Gender====\n\nCzech distinguishes three [[grammatical gender|genders]]\u2014masculine, feminine, and neuter\u2014and the masculine gender is subdivided into [[animacy|animate]] and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in ''-a'', ''-e'', or a consonant; neuter nouns in ''-o'', ''-e'', or ''-\u00ed'', and masculine nouns in a consonant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|pp=22\u201324}}</ref> Adjectives agree in gender and animacy with the nouns they modify.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=51}}</ref> The main effect of gender in Czech morphology is the difference in noun and adjective declension, as well as in endings of verbal participles and past-tense verbs, which are also marked for gender, e.g. ''d\u011blal'' (he did, or made); ''d\u011blala'' (she did, or made) and ''d\u011blalo'' (it did, or made).<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=141}}</ref> Gender also plays a semantic role; most nouns that describe people and animals, including personal names, have separate masculine and feminine forms which are normally formed by adding a suffix to the stem, for example ''\u010cech'' (Czech man) has the feminine form ''\u010ce\u0161ka'' (Czech woman).<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=238}}</ref>\n\nExamples of declension patterns for noun phrases of various genders follow:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ \n! rowspan=\"2\" | Case\n! colspan=\"4\" | Noun/adjective\n|-\n| Big dog (m. anim. sg.)\n| Black backpack (m. inanim. sg.)\n| Small cat (f. sg.)\n| Hard wood (n. sg.)\n|-\n!

Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five require subject and direct object noun phrases to be declined in the genitive plural instead of the nominative or accusative, and when used as subjects these phrases take singular verbs. For example:<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=114}}</ref>\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!English\n!Czech\n|-\n| one Czech crown was...\n| ''jedna koruna \u010desk\u00e1 byla...''\n|-\n| two Czech crowns were...\n| ''dv\u011b koruny \u010desk\u00e9 byly...''\n|-\n| three Czech crowns were...\n| ''t\u0159i koruny \u010desk\u00e9 byly...''\n|-\n| four Czech crowns were...\n| ''\u010dty\u0159i koruny \u010desk\u00e9 byly...''\n|-\n| five Czech crowns were...\n| ''p\u011bt korun \u010desk\u00fdch bylo...''\n|}\n\nNumbers decline for case, and the numbers one and two are also inflected for gender.

Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ''[[wikt:ruka|ruka]]'' (hand)\u2014''ruce'' (nominative); ''[[wikt:noha|noha]]'' (leg)\u2014''nohama'' (instrumental), ''nohou'' (genitive/locative); ''[[wikt:oko|oko]]'' (eye)\u2014''o\u010di'', and ''[[wikt:ucho|ucho]]'' (ear)\u2014''u\u0161i''. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=40}}</ref> These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in ''mezi \u010dty\u0159ma o\u010dima'' (face to face, lit. ''among four eyes''). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, ''nohy'' (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kom\u00e1rek|2012|p=238}}</ref>\n\n===Verb conjugation===\n{{Main|Czech conjugation}}\nCzech verbs agree with their subjects in [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), and in constructions involving [[participle]]s also in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. They are conjugated for tense (past, present or [[future tense|future]]) and mood ([[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] or [[conditional mood|conditional]]). For example, the conjugated verb ''[[wikt:mluvit|mluv\u00edme]]'' (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the [[infinitive]] ''mluvit'' by its ending, ''-\u00edme''.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 131\"/> The infinitive form of Czech verbs ends in ''-t'' (archaically, ''-ti''). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, ''m\u016f\u017eu t\u011b sly\u0161et''\u2014\"I can ''hear'' you\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=7}}</ref> \n\n====Aspect====\n{{See also|Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages}}\nTypical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two [[grammatical aspect]]s: [[perfective aspect|perfective]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairs\u2014for example, ''[[wikt:koupit|koupit]]'' (perfective) and ''[[wikt:kupovat|kupovat]]'' (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing or repeated. This is distinct from [[past tense|past]] and [[present tense]].<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 146\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=146}}</ref> Any verb of either aspect can be conjugated into either the past or present tense,<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 131\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=131}}</ref> but the future tense is only used with imperfective verbs.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 151\">{{Harvnb|Naughton|2005|p=151}}</ref> Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.<ref name=\"Naughton 2005 146\"/>\n\nThe verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix\u2014for example, the imperfective ''ps\u00e1t'' (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective ''napsat'' (to write down).

His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n\nBorn in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British \"[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]\".<ref name=Blackmail/> Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nBy 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). ''Rebecca'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture#1940s|Academy Award for Best Picture]], although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]];<ref name=Rebecca/> he was also nominated for ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944) and ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award.  \n\nThe \"[[Hitchcockian]]\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into [[voyeurism|voyeurs]], and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film \"is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\"{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=62}} \n\nAfter a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and ''[[Dial M For Murder]]'' (1954).  By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films [[List of films considered the best|often ranked]] among the greatest of all time: ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.<ref name=\"AFI top 100\">{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Greatest American Films of All Time |url=https://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx |publisher=American Film Institute |accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> In 2012, ''Vertigo'' replaced [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) as the [[British Film Institute]]'s greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics.<ref name=Christie2012/> By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]],{{efn|The films selected for the [[National Film Registry]] are ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).<ref name=loc>{{cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=21 December 2018}}{{pb}} \n[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/descriptions-and-essays/ \"Brief Descriptions and Expanded Essays of National Film Registry Titles\"].

It is set in England; Hitchcock used the north coast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] for the English coastline sequence. The film is the first of four projects on which [[Cary Grant]] worked with Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role.

Grant's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142\u2013143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer.

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance. That was solved by having Hitchcock's image appear in a newspaper that [[William Bendix]] is reading in the boat, showing the director in a before-and-after advertisement for \"Reduco-Obesity Slayer\".<ref name=Spoto1999p267>The film was ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944).

After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the \"Necktie Murders\", which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]).

In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde.

In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.\n\nHis films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1\u20139}}</ref><!--replace source-->\n\n===Relationship with actors===\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor= #E0E6F8\n |quote =&nbsp;...

[[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\".<ref>{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}</ref> For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds.

He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision.

After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. \n\nAccording to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

His films garnered a total of 46 Oscar nominations and six wins.\n\nBorn in [[Leytonstone, Essex]], Hitchcock entered the film industry in 1919 as a [[Intertitle|title card]] designer after training as a technical clerk and copy writer for a telegraph-cable company. He made his directorial debut with the silent film ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925). His first successful film, ''[[The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog]]'' (1927), helped to shape the [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, while his 1929 film, ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'', was the first British \"[[Sound film#Transition: Europe|talkie]]\".<ref name=Blackmail/> Two of his 1930s thrillers, ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), are ranked among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|greatest British films]] of the 20th century.\n\nBy 1939 Hitchcock was a filmmaker of international importance, and film producer [[David O. Selznick]] persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' (1941), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), and ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946). ''Rebecca'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture#1940s|Academy Award for Best Picture]], although Hitchcock himself was only nominated as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]];<ref name=Rebecca/> he was also nominated for ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944) and ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), although he never won the Best Director Academy Award.  \n\nThe \"[[Hitchcockian]]\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into [[voyeurism|voyeurs]], and framing [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic [[Robin Wood (critic)|Robin Wood]] wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film \"is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\"{{sfn|Wood|2002|p=62}} \n\nAfter a brief lull of commercial success in the late 1940s, Hitchcock returned to form with ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951) and ''[[Dial M For Murder]]'' (1954).  By 1960 Hitchcock had directed four films [[List of films considered the best|often ranked]] among the greatest of all time: ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.<ref name=\"AFI top 100\">{{cite web |title=AFI's 100 Greatest American Films of All Time |url=https://www.afi.com/100Years/movies10.aspx |publisher=American Film Institute |accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> In 2012, ''Vertigo'' replaced [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) as the [[British Film Institute]]'s greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics.<ref name=Christie2012/> By 2018 eight of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]],{{efn|The films selected for the [[National Film Registry]] are ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963).<ref name=loc>{{cite web|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=21 December 2018}}{{pb}} \n[https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/descriptions-and-essays/ \"Brief Descriptions and Expanded Essays of National Film Registry Titles\"].

The film is the first of four projects on which [[Cary Grant]] worked with Hitchcock, and it is one of the rare occasions that Grant was cast in a sinister role.

Grant's character is a killer in the book on which the film was based, ''[[Before the Fact]]'' by [[Francis Iles]], but the studio felt that Grant's image would be tarnished by that. Hitchcock therefore settled for an ambiguous finale, although, as he told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, he would have preferred to end with the wife's murder.{{sfn|Truffaut|1983|pp=142\u2013143}}{{efn|Hitchcock told [[Bryan Forbes]] in 1967: \"They had gone through the film in my absence and taken out every scene that indicated the possibility that Cary Grant was a murderer.

Steinbeck then began work on the script which would become the film ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]'' (1944). However, Steinbeck was unhappy with the film and asked that his name be removed from the credits, to no avail. The idea was rewritten as a short story by [[Harry Sylvester]] and published in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1943. The action sequences were shot in a small boat in the studio water tank. The locale posed problems for Hitchcock's traditional cameo appearance.

Stewart eventually manages to convince his policeman buddy ([[Wendell Corey]]) and his girlfriend (Kelly). As with ''Lifeboat'' and ''Rope'', the principal characters are depicted in confined or cramped quarters, in this case Stewart's studio apartment.

After two espionage films, the plot marked a return to the murder-thriller genre. Richard Blaney ([[Jon Finch]]), a volatile barman with a history of explosive anger, becomes the prime suspect in the investigation into the \"Necktie Murders\", which are actually committed by his friend Bob Rusk ([[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]]).

In ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (1935), [[Madeleine Carroll]] is put in handcuffs. [[Ingrid Bergman]], whom Hitchcock directed three times (''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949)), is dark blonde.

In ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), Francie (Grace Kelly again) offers to help a man she believes is a burglar. In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959) respectively, [[Kim Novak]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]] play the blonde heroines. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), [[Janet Leigh]]'s character steals $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40,000|1960|fmt=eq}}) and is murdered by Norman Bates, a reclusive psychopath. [[Tippi Hedren]], a blonde, appears to be the focus of the attacks in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963). In ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), the title character, again played by Hedren, is a thief. In ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', French actresses [[Dany Robin]] as Stafford's wife and [[Claude Jade]] as Stafford's daughter are blonde heroines, the mistress was played by brunette [[Karin Dor]]. Hitchcock's last blonde heroine was [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as a phony psychic turned amateur sleuth in ''[[Family Plot]]'' (1976), his final film. In the same film, the diamond smuggler played by [[Karen Black]] wears a long blonde wig in several scenes.\n\nHis films often feature characters struggling in their relationships with their mothers, such as [[Norman Bates]] in ''Psycho''. In ''North by Northwest'' (1959), Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men are after him. In ''The Birds'' (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother ([[Jessica Tandy]]). The killer in ''Frenzy'' (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train'' hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by [[Marion Lorne]]). Sebastian ([[Claude Rains]]) in ''Notorious'' has a clearly conflicting relationship with his mother, who is (rightly) suspicious of his new bride, Alicia Huberman ([[Ingrid Bergman]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Kaganski|1997|pp=1\u20139}}</ref><!--replace source-->\n\n===Relationship with actors===\n{{Quote box\n |bgcolor= #E0E6F8\n |quote =&nbsp;...

[[James Mason]] said that Hitchcock regarded actors as \"animated props\".<ref>{{harvnb|Whitty|2016|p=263}}</ref> For Hitchcock, the actors were part of the film's setting. He told Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut: \"The chief requisite for an actor is the ability to do nothing well, which is by no means as easy as it sounds.

He was reported to have never even bothered looking through the [[viewfinder]], since he did not need to, although in publicity photos he was shown doing so. He also used this as an excuse to never have to change his films from his initial vision.

After investigating script revisions, notes to other production personnel written by or to Hitchcock, and other production material, Krohn observed that Hitchcock's work often deviated from how the screenplay was written or how the film was originally envisioned.<ref name= \"krohn1\u20137\">{{harvnb|Krohn|2000|pp=1\u20137}}</ref> He noted that the myth of storyboards in relation to Hitchcock, often regurgitated by generations of commentators on his films, was to a great degree perpetuated by Hitchcock himself or the publicity arm of the studios. For example, the celebrated crop-spraying sequence of ''North by Northwest'' was not storyboarded at all. After the scene was filmed, the publicity department asked Hitchcock to make storyboards to promote the film, and Hitchcock in turn hired an artist to match the scenes in detail.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\">{{harvnb|Bellour|Penley|2000|p=217}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\nEven when storyboards were made, scenes that were shot differed from them significantly. Krohn's analysis of the production of Hitchcock classics like ''Notorious'' reveals that Hitchcock was flexible enough to change a film's conception during its production. Another example Krohn notes is the American remake of ''The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' whose shooting schedule commenced without a finished script and moreover went over schedule, something that, as Krohn notes, was not an uncommon occurrence on many of Hitchcock's films, including ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]''. While Hitchcock did do a great deal of preparation for all his films, he was fully cognisant that the actual film-making process often deviated from the best-laid plans and was flexible to adapt to the changes and needs of production as his films were not free from the normal hassles faced and common routines used during many other film productions.<ref name=\"Raymond Bellour 2000 p. 217\"/>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Extended Interview.ogv|thumb|alt= Close-up of Hitchcock for a media clip of a 1966 interview|Hitchcock interview, around 1966]]\nKrohn's work also sheds light on Hitchcock's practice of generally shooting in chronological order, which he notes sent many films over budget and over schedule and, more importantly, differed from the standard operating procedure of Hollywood in the Studio System Era. Equally important is Hitchcock's tendency to shoot alternative takes of scenes. This differed from coverage in that the films were not necessarily shot from varying angles so as to give the editor options to shape the film how they choose (often under the producer's aegis).<ref name=\"Heritage02-28-07\">{{cite web|last=Lehman|first=David|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|title=Alfred Hitchcock's America|work=American Heritage|date=April\u2013May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711184905/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2007/2/2007_2_28.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}} Rather they represented Hitchcock's tendency to give himself options in the editing room, where he would provide advice to his editors after viewing a rough cut of the work. \n\nAccording to Krohn, this and a great deal of other information revealed through his research of Hitchcock's personal papers, script revisions and the like refute the notion of Hitchcock as a director who was always in control of his films, whose vision of his films did not change during production, which Krohn notes has remained the central long-standing myth of Alfred Hitchcock.

The series began in arcades in 1999 with ''[[Mr. Driller (video game)|Mr. Driller]]'', running on the [[Namco System 12]] arcade hardware, and would see several ports and sequels for arcades and home video game systems, the latest being the 2015 game ''Mr. Driller for Kakeo'', released exclusively for mobile phones in South Korea. Early games in the series were developed by Project Driller, an internal development team at Namco in the 2000s.\n\nThe series stars Susumu Hori, the son of ''[[Dig Dug]]'' protagonist Taizo Hori and ''[[Baraduke]]'' protagonist Masuyo Tobi. Gameplay revolves around the player destroying colorful blocks in an attempt to reach the bottom of each stage. Blocks will disappear when four of a color are connected, which can cause large chain reactions. The player has an oxygen meter that will constantly drain as the game progresses - collecting air capsules will replenish a fraction of the meter. Brown-colored \"X Blocks\" take five hits to destroy, which will deplete a small portion of the player's oxygen meter.\n\nThe original ''Mr. Driller'' was originally intended as a third entry in Namco's own ''Dig Dug'' series, aptly titled ''Dig Dug 3''. Technical restrains caused the project to be shelved, however Namco executives expressed interest in the project, causing the game to be revived as an official project. The series has received mostly mixed reviews from critics, who praised its addictive gameplay and characters, although some would criticize some entries for a poor presentation or lack of variety compared to other games.\n\n==Titles==\n===Games===\n{{Timeline of release years\n| range1 = 1999 \u2013 2015\n| range1_color = #FF7AFB #DE3AC8\n| 1999 = ''[[Mr. Driller (video game)|Mr. Driller]]''\n| 2000 = ''[[Mr. Driller 2]]''\n| 2001 = ''Mr. Driller G''\n| 2002a = ''Mr. Driller A''\n| 2002b = ''[[Mr. Driller: Drill Land]]''\n| 2004 = ''[[Mr. Driller Drill Spirits]]''\n| 2006 = ''Mr. Driller Aqua''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mr. Driller Online]]''\n| 2009a = ''[[Mr. Driller W]]''\n| 2009b = ''Mr. Driller Drill Till You Drop''\n| 2009c = ''Mr. Driller'' (iOS)\n| 2015 = ''Mr. Driller for Kakeo''\n}}\n* '''''[[Mr. Driller (video game)|Mr. Driller]]''''' is the first entry in the series, originally released for arcades in 1999.

It established the series' core gameplay mechanics and introduced series protagonist Susumu Hori, who would appear in all games to follow. Home versions of the game were met with mixed to positive reviews, many praising its gameplay and characters while criticizing its lack of multiplayer and extra content.

A Microsoft Windows port was released exclusively in Japan that same year. The game introduces Puchi, Susumu's brown-spotted dog, and Anna Hottenmeyer, a friend and rival of Susumu, both of which would become staple for the series. New to this game are \"Crystal Blocks\", star-marked blocks that will disappear shortly after a brief period of time, and a split-screen multiplayer mode. The Game Boy Advance version was released for the [[Wii U Virtual Console]] in 2014.\n\n* '''''Mr. Driller G''''', also known as ''Mr. Driller Great'', was released for arcades and the PlayStation exclusively for Japan in 2001. The third installment introduced many recurring characters, including Susumu's older brother Ataru Hori, ''Dig Dug'' protagonist and father Taizo Hori, and the robotic drill Holinger-Z. ''G'' features a story mode, revolving around Susumu and company in their efforts to prevent antagonist Dr. Manhole from destroying the world with large, mechanical drills. A \"Scenerio\" mode is also included that adds power-up items, such as a speed boost and the ability to climb two blocks higher. The PlayStation version was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Store on June 26, 2013 in Japan, under the PSone Classics brand.\n\n* '''''Mr. Driller A''''', also known as ''Mr. Driller Ace'', was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002, exclusive to Japan.\n\n* '''''[[Mr. Driller Drill Spirits]]''''' was released for the Nintendo DS in 2004, becoming a launch title for the system in North America, Europe and Japan.\n\n==Common elements==\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn Mr. Driller, after a character is selected and a country is selected, the player then drills a seemingly endless onslaught of colored blocks, ending with that country's given mileage (given in meters). The levels are randomly generated, and the blocks can merge with other similarly colored blocks, therefore disppearing after 4 or more blocks merge. There are 4 main colors of blocks: red, blue, green, and yellow. There are also 3 special kinds of blocks: white blocks, which are pale blocks that don't merge with other similarly colored ones; crystal blocks, blocks that last for around a few seconds before disappearing; and X-blocks, brown crate-like boxes that take 5 drill hits to disintegrate, and also take off 20% of the player's air supply. The player has an air supply that acts as his vitality gauge, and when it is under 30%, the player's complexion will turn blue and a bubble with an air capsule will appear over his head. To keep the air from running out, the player can collect air capsules that replenish the driller's health by 20%. A life is lost when the player's air runs out, or if he/she is squished by falling blocks. The gameplay has been described as \"[[Dig Dug]] meets [[Tetris]].\"\n\n===Characters===\n*'''Susumu Hori''' - the series's main protagonist and the highest-ranked Driller in the world, and the son of legendary Driller, Taizo Hori (of Dig Dug fame). He is a little crazy, but is still a good-natured, courageous young boy with a strong sense of justice. He is [[Japanese people|Japanese]], has brown hair and eyes, and wears a pink and light blue jumpsuit and helmet. His performance in the game is all-around, with normal walking speed and a normal air-consumption rate. He is usually recommended for intermediate players. Susumu is voiced by [[Mitsuko Horie]].\n*'''Puchi''' - a genius talking wonder dog and companion to Susumu. He has been Susumu's closest confidant ever since Susumu found him abandoned as a little puppy and nursed him back to health. He is a white dog with brown spots. He was first playable in ''Mr. Driller G''. In the game, Puchi moves slower than Susumu, but his air consumption is slower as well. He also has the ability to jump up two blocks high. In the Scenario Driller mode of ''Mr. Driller G'', he follows Susumu in one of the stages and barks when he is near a hidden Dristone. He is usually recommended for beginning players. Puchi is voiced by [[Mitsuko Horie]].\n*''' Toby Masuyo'''- Susumu's mother and star of [[Baraduke]], an ex-soldier of the United Galactic Space Force (UGSF) and took part in the battle of Alien Sector in 1985. Masuyo is the mother of Susumu and Ataru. She used to be married to Taizo Hori, but for unknown reasons, they are separated. She is Japanese and has short light brown hair with dark brown eyes. She wears a yellow space bio-suit with orange gloves, blue/green boots and white belts going around her body that connect to a jet pack. She is a support character and assists her son in the Mr. Dig games.\n*'''Taizo Hori''' - Susumu's father and star of [[Dig Dug]], a legendary Driller and chairman of the Driller Council. He is the hero of the 1982 Dig Dug Incident and is a globetrotting adventurer. He is Japanese, has brown eyes and a goatee, wears a white suit with red chevrons and a blue belt, red boots, blue gloves, and a white-and-blue helmet. He was first playable in ''Mr. Driller G''. In the game his walking speed is slow and his air consumption rate is fast. However, he can make blocks disappear much faster, making his descent speed quicker as well. He is usually recommended for expert players.\n*'''Anna Hottenmeyer''' - Susumu's friend and fierce rival and the second-highest-ranked Driller in the world. She is [[German people|German]], and has blue eyes, blonde hair, and wears a white jumpsuit with a pink star on the front, pink sleeves, and blue goggles. She was first playable in ''Mr. Driller 2''. In the game, her performance is only slightly different from Susumu, with a slightly faster walking speed and a slightly faster air consumption rate. She is usually recommended for expert players. Anna is slightly older than Susumu by two months. Anna is voiced by [[Mitsuko Horie]].\n*'''Ataru Hori''' - Susumu's older brother. He works as an unlicensed Driller ever since he left home after an argument with his father, Taizo, and has been trying to find his purpose in life ever since. He is Japanese, has brown eyes, has gray hair, and wears a gray suit with a white star on the front, a gray helmet, and a red scarf. Normally has a black rabbit named Usagi (or Rabbit, in English-speaking countries) that follows him on his travels. He was first playable in ''Mr. Driller G''. In the game, he is able to move very fast, but has a fast air consumption rate. He is usually recommended for expert players.\n*'''Holinger-Z''' - A robot created by Dr. Z to take on jobs that are too dangerous for humans, and serves as Anna's butler-robot. He is a gray robot who can morph into the form of a drill. He was first playable in ''Mr. Driller G''. In the game, Holinger-Z moves fairly slow and has a slow air consumption rate. His special feature is that he can withstand a fallen block once before dying; when a rock falls on him, his head will act as a \"barrier\" and the rest of the body continues to drill. He is usually recommended for beginning players. Holinger-Z's name is based on [[Mazinger Z]].\n*'''Usagi''' - Also known as '''Rabbit''' in English-speaking countries. The companion of Ataru Hori. He came from outer space and crashed to earth. Ataru saved him from the wreckage, and has since befriended him. He has normally been an unlockable character in the game since the introduction of the six standard playable characters in ''Mr. Driller G''. In the game, he is able to move very fast, but has a fast air consumption rate. He also can jump up two blocks akin to Puchi, make blocks disappear much faster akin to Taizo, and destroy three blocks instead of one. Rather than talking, he makes unusual sounds. In a secret Scenario Driller stage in ''Mr. Driller G'', he follows Ataru and notifies when he is near a hidden Dristone. It is debated whether his skills make gameplay easier or harder, but the former is more likely because of his numerous skills.\n*'''Dr. Z''' - a brilliant scientist who sends the Driller team out on various missions around the world. He has gray hair, a round cucumber-shaped nose, and wears a lab coat and tie. He bears a slight resemblance to [[Professor Ochanomizu|Dr. Ochanomizu]] from [[Astro Boy (1960 TV series)|Astro Boy]].\n*'''Dr. Manhole''' - a drill scientist who has been mocked by fellow scientists, and since then has made attempts to destroy the world with giant drills. He sometimes works with the Ankoku Drillers. He was the main antagonist in the Scenario Driller mode of ''Mr. Driller G'' and ''Mr. Driller Drill Land'' (disguised as the founder of the amusement park), and appears in the Pressure Driller mode of ''Mr. Driller Drill Spirits'', possibly the one who made the giant drill that closes in on the player.\n*'''Ankoku Drillers''' - Sometimes called '''Team Ankoku''', these are three drillers who work with Dr. Manhole to stop Susumu and his friends. The leader is '''Keel Sark,''' who is fast and is said to have ninja skills. The other members are '''Eguri Hatakeyama,''' a mean-tempered girl who uses a whiplike drill and has a crush on Ataru Hori, and '''Kowasu,''' an android stolen from the Driller laboratories who holds respect towards Taizo Hori, and uses a three-direction drill. They have so far only appeared in ''Mr. Driller G'' for the ''[[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]'' and ''Mr. Driller Drill Land'' for the ''[[Nintendo GameCube]]''; they are secretly playable in the former's Versus mode after certain conditions are met.\n*'''Undergrounders''' - strange blue creatures that inhabit the underground world. They are the ones usually responsible for the numerous blocks that often invade the Earth. They are said to be very intelligent but a little careless. They are ruled over by a king. In the game, they occasionally appear behind drilled blocks and offer a small additional bonus. They also appear when a certain score amount is reached and another block is drilled; the undergrounder holds up a sign that says \"1-Up,\" giving the player another life. There are apparently also undergrounders in space, except they have been colored as either purple or yellow, depending on the game.\n\n==Reception==\n{{VG series reviews\n|gr = yes\n|game1 = Mr. Driller <small>(PlayStation)</small>\n|gr1 = 75%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller for PlayStation |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/ps/914190-mr-driller/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game2 = Mr. Driller <small>(Dreamcast)</small>\n|gr2 = 82%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller for Dreamcast |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/259120-mr-driller/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game3 = Mr. Driller <small>(Game Boy Color)</small>\n|gr3 = 65%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller for Game Boy Color |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/365742-mr-driller/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game4 = [[Mr. Driller 2]]\n|gr4 = 65%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller 2 for Game Boy Advance |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/gba/471250-mr-driller-2/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|mc4 = 62/100<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller 2 for Game Boy Advance Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/game-boy-advance/mr-driller-2 |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game5 = [[Mr. Driller: Drill Land]]\n|gr5 = 89%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller: Drill Land for GameCube |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/gamecube/914473-mr-driller-drill-land/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game6 = Mr. Driller A\n|gr6 = 80%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller Ace for Game Boy Advance |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/gba/561125-mr-driller-ace/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game7 = [[Mr. Driller Drill Spirits]]\n|gr7 = 71%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller: Drill Spirits |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/ds/924751-mr-driller-drill-spirits/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|mc7 = 70/100<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller: Drill Spirits for Nintendo DS Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/mr-driller-drill-spirits |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game8 = [[Mr. Driller Online]]\n|gr8 = 50%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller Online for Xbox 360 |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/xbox360/945622-mr-driller-online/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|mc8 = 45/100<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller Online for Xbox 360 Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/mr-driller-online |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game9 = [[Mr. Driller W]]\n|gr9 = 75%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller W for Wii |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/wii/958328-mr-driller-w/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|mc9 = 71/100<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller W for Wii Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/mr-driller-w |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|game10 = Mr. Driller Drill Till You Drop\n|gr10 = 77%<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller: Drill till you Drop for DS |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/ds/991518-mr-driller-drill-till-you-drop/index.html |website=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n|mc10 = 73/100<ref>{{cite web |title=Mr. Driller: Drill till you Drop for DS Reviews |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/mr-driller-drill-till-you-drop |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=26 July 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.horisusumu.com/ Official website (Japanese)]\n\n{{Dig Dug/Mr. Driller series}}\n{{Bandai Namco franchises}}\n\n[[Category:Bandai Namco Entertainment franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1999]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game series\n| width = \n| title = Mr. Driller\n| image = File:Mr._Driller_series_logo.svg\n| platforms = [[Arcade game|Arcade]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Dreamcast]], [[WonderSwan Color]], [[Game Boy Color]], [[Windows]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Mobile phone]], [[GameCube]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Xbox 360]], [[DSiWare]], [[Wii]], [[iOS]]\n| developer = {{unbulleted list|[[Namco]]|[[Bandai Namco Studios]]}}\n| publisher = [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]\n| genre = [[Puzzle game|Puzzle]]\n| creator = Yasuhito Nagaoka\n| first release version = ''[[Mr. Driller (video game)|Mr. Driller]]''\n| first release date = November 1999\n| latest release version = ''Mr. Driller for Kakeo''\n| latest release date = May 12, 2015\n}}\n{{nihongo foot|'''''Mr. Driller'''''|\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30ea\u30e9\u30fc|Misuta Dorira|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[puzzle video game]] franchise developed and published by [[Namco]], now owned by their successor company [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]. The series began in arcades in 1999 with ''[[Mr. Driller (video game)|Mr. Driller]]'', running on the [[Namco System 12]] arcade hardware, and would see several ports and sequels for arcades and home video game systems, the latest being the 2015 game ''Mr. Driller for Kakeo'', released exclusively for mobile phones in South Korea. Early games in the series were developed by Project Driller, an internal development team at Namco in the 2000's.\n\nThe series stars Susumu Hori, the son of ''[[Dig Dug]]'' protagonist Taizo Hori and ''[[Baraduke]]'' protagonist Masuyo Tobi. Gameplay revolves around the player destroying colorful blocks in an attempt to reach the bottom of each stage. Blocks will disappear when four of a color are connected, which can cause large chain reactions. The player has an oxygen meter that will constantly drain as the game progresses - collecting air capsules will replenish a fraction of the meter. Brown-colored \"X Blocks\" take five hits to destroy, which will deplete a small portion of the player's oxygen meter.\n\nThe original ''Mr. Driller'' was originally intended as a third entry in Namco's own ''Dig Dug'' series, aptly titled ''Dig Dug 3''. Technical restrains caused the project to be shelved, however Namco executives expressed interest in the project, causing the game to be revived as an official project. The series has received mostly mixed reviews from critics, who praised its addictive gameplay and characters, although some would criticize some entries for a poor presentation or lack of variety compared to other games.\n\n==Titles==\n===Games===\n{{Timeline of release years\n| range1 = 1999 \u2013 2015\n| range1_color = #FF7AFB #DE3AC8\n| 1999 = ''[[Mr. Driller (video game)|Mr. Driller]]''\n| 2000 = ''[[Mr. Driller 2]]''\n| 2001 = ''Mr. Driller G''\n| 2002a = ''Mr. Driller A''\n| 2002b = ''[[Mr. Driller: Drill Land]]''\n| 2004 = ''[[Mr. Driller Drill Spirits]]''\n| 2006 = ''Mr. Driller Aqua''\n| 2008 = ''[[Mr. Driller Online]]''\n| 2009a = ''[[Mr. Driller W]]''\n| 2009b = ''Mr. Driller Drill Till You Drop''\n| 2009c = ''Mr. Driller'' (iOS)\n| 2015 = ''Mr. Driller for Kakeo''\n}}\n* '''''[[Mr. Driller (video game)|Mr. Driller]]''''' is the first entry in the series, originally released for arcades in 1999.

It established the series' core gameplay mechanics and introduced series protagonist Susumu Hori, who would appear in all games to follow.

A Microsoft Windows port was released exclusively in Japan that same year. The game introduces Puchi, Susumu's brown-spotted dog, and Anna Hottenmeyer, a friend and rival of Susumu, both of which would become staple for the series. New to this game are \"Crystal Blocks\", star-marked blocks that will disappear shortly after a brief period of time, and a split-screen multiplayer mode. The Game Boy Advance version was released for the [[Wii U Virtual Console]] in 2014.\n\n* '''''Mr. Driller G''''', also known as ''Mr. Driller Great'', was released for arcades and the PlayStation exclusively for Japan in 2001. The third installment introduced many recurring characters, including Susumu's older brother Ataru Hori, ''Dig Dug'' protagonist and father Taizo Hori, and the robotic drill Holinger-Z. ''G'' features a story mode, revolving around Susumu and company in their efforts to prevent antagonist Dr. Manhole from destroying the world with large, mechanical drills. A \"Scenerio\" mode is also included that adds power-up items, such as a speed boost and the ability to climb two blocks higher. The PlayStation version was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Store on June 26, 2013 in Japan, under the PSone Classics brand.\n\n* '''''Mr. Driller A''''', also known as ''Mr. Driller Ace'', was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002, exclusive to Japan.\n\n* '''''[[Mr. Driller Drill Spirits]]''''' was released for the Nintendo DS in 2004, becoming a launch title for the system in North America, Europe and Japan.\n\n==Common elements==\n{{Expand section|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn Mr. Driller, after a character is selected and a country is selected, the player then drills a seemingly endless onslaught of colored blocks, ending with that country's given mileage (given in meters). The levels are randomly generated, and the blocks can merge with other similarly colored blocks, therefore disppearing after 4 or more blocks merge. There are 4 main colors of blocks: red, blue, green, and yellow. There are also 3 special kinds of blocks: white blocks, which are pale blocks that don't merge with other similarly colored ones; crystal blocks, blocks that last for around a few seconds before disappearing; and X-blocks, brown crate-like boxes that take 5 drill hits to disintegrate, and also take off 20% of the player's air supply. The player has an air supply that acts as his vitality gauge, and when it is under 30%, the player's complexion will turn blue and a bubble with an air capsule will appear over his head. To keep the air from running out, the player can collect air capsules that replenish the driller's health by 20%. A life is lost when the player's air runs out, or if he/she is squished by falling blocks. The gameplay has been described as \"[[Dig Dug]] meets [[Tetris]].\"\n\n===Characters===\n*'''Susumu Hori''' - the series's main protagonist and the highest-ranked Driller in the world, and the son of legendary Driller, Taizo Hori (of Dig Dug fame).

Since the 1970s (and the fall of the world henequen and chicle markets due to the advent of synthetic substitutes), the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula has reoriented its economy towards [[tourism]], especially in the Mexican state of [[Quintana Roo]]. Once a small fishing village, [[Canc\u00fan]] in the northeast of the peninsula has grown into a thriving city. The [[Riviera Maya]], which stretches along the east coast of the peninsula between [[Canc\u00fan]] and [[Tulum]], houses over 50,000 beds. The best-known locations are the former fishing town of [[Playa del Carmen]], the ecological parks [[Xcaret]] and [[Xel-H\u00e1]] and the Maya ruins of [[Tulum]] and [[Coba]].\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Sediment off the Yucatan Peninsula.jpg|thumb|[[Sediment]] off the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.]]\nThe peninsula is the exposed portion of the larger Yucat\u00e1n Platform, all of which is composed of [[Carbonate rock|carbonate]] and soluble rocks, being mostly [[limestone]] although [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and [[evaporite]]s are also present at various depths. The whole of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is an unconfined flat lying [[karst]] landscape.<ref name=\"readersnatural\" /> Sinkholes, known locally as [[cenotes]], are widespread in the northern lowlands.\n\nAccording to the [[Alvarez hypothesis]], the [[mass extinction]] of the dinosaurs at the transition from the Cretaceous to the Paleogene Period, the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] (K\u2013Pg boundary), 65 million years ago was caused by an asteroid impact somewhere in the greater [[Caribbean Basin]]. The deeply buried [[Chicxulub crater]] is centered off the north coast of the peninsula near the town of [[Chicxulub, Yucat\u00e1n|Chicxulub]]. The now-famous \"Ring of Cenotes\" (visible in [[NASA]] imagery) outlines one of the shock-waves from this impact event in the rock of ~66 million years of age, which lies more than 1&nbsp;km below the modern ground surface near the centre, with the rock above the impact strata all being younger in age. The presence of the crater has been determined first on the surface from the Ring of Cenotes, but also by geophysical methods, and direct drilling with recovery of the drill cores.\n\nThe [[Arrowsmith Bank]] is a [[submerged bank]] located off the northeastern end of the peninsula.<ref>[http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-236291&fid=6437&c=undersea_features Arrowsmith Bank, Undersea Features - Geographical Names]</ref>\n\n==Water resources==\nDue to the extreme [[karst]] nature of the whole peninsula, the northern half is devoid of rivers. Where [[lake]]s and [[swamp]]s are present, the water is marshy and generally unpotable. Due to its coastal location, the whole of the peninsula is underlain by an extensive contiguous density stratified coastal [[aquifer]], where a fresh water lens formed from [[meteoric water]] floats on top of intruding saline water from the coastal margins. The thousands of sinkholes known as [[cenotes]] throughout the region provide access to the groundwater system. The cenotes have long been relied on by ancient and contemporary [[Maya peoples|Maya]] people.<ref name=\"readersnatural\" /><ref>[[BBC]]: ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'', part 4: [[Cave]]s.</ref>\n\n==Flora==\nShort and tall tropical jungles are the predominant natural vegetation types of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nThe boundaries between northern Guatemala ([[Pet\u00e9n (department)|El Pet\u00e9n]]), Mexico ([[Campeche]] and [[Quintana Roo]]), and western [[Belize]] are still occupied by the largest continuous tracts of tropical [[rainforest]] in [[Central America]]. However, these forests are suffering extensive [[deforestation]].[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/982931]\n\n== Climate ==\nLike much of the [[Caribbean]], the peninsula lies within the Atlantic Hurricane Belt, and with its almost uniformly flat terrain it is vulnerable to these large storms coming from the east. The [[2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was a particularly bad season for [[Mexico]]'s tourism industry, with two forceful category 5 storms hitting, [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] and [[Hurricane Wilma]]. The [[2006 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was a typical year which left the Yucat\u00e1n untouched, but in the 2007 Atlantic Hurricane season Yucat\u00e1n was hit by [[Hurricane Dean]] (also a category 5 storm), nevertheless Dean left little damage on the peninsula despite heavy localized flooding.\n\nStrong storms called nortes can quickly descend on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula any time of year. Although these storms pummel the area with heavy rains and high winds, they tend to be short-lived, clearing after about an hour. The average percentage of days with rain per month ranges from a monthly low of 7% in April to a high of 25% in October. Breezes can have a cooling effect, [[humidity]] is generally high, particularly in the remaining rainforest areas.<ref>[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/mexico/Yucatan-Weather-Climate/704]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Jaguar]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* Juan Luis Pena Chapa, Manuel Martin Castillo, and Juan Carlos Gonzalez Avila, ''The Performance of the Economy of the Yucatan Peninsula from 1970\u20131993'' [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Publications/Documents/RR-00-014.pdf]\n* Marcio L.

Since the 1970s (and the fall of the world henequen and chicle markets due to the advent of synthetic substitutes), the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula has reoriented its economy towards [[tourism]], especially in the Mexican state of [[Quintana Roo]]. Once a small fishing village, [[Canc\u00fan]] in the northeast of the peninsula has grown into a thriving city. The [[Riviera Maya]], which stretches along the east coast of the peninsula between [[Canc\u00fan]] and [[Tulum]], houses over 50,000 beds. The best-known locations are the former fishing town of [[Playa del Carmen]], the ecological parks [[Xcaret]] and [[Xel-H\u00e1]] and the Maya ruins of [[Tulum]] and [[Coba]].\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Sediment off the Yucatan Peninsula.jpg|thumb|[[Sediment]] off the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.]]\nThe peninsula is the exposed portion of the larger Yucat\u00e1n Platform, all of which is composed of [[Carbonate rock|carbonate]] and soluble rocks, being mostly [[limestone]] although [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] and [[evaporite]]s are also present at various depths. The whole of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is an unconfined flat lying [[karst]] landscape.<ref name=\"readersnatural\" /> Sinkholes, known locally as [[cenotes]], are widespread in the northern lowlands.\n\nAccording to the [[Alvarez hypothesis]], the [[mass extinction]] of the dinosaurs at the transition from the Cretaceous to the Paleogene Period, the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]] (K\u2013Pg boundary), 65 million years ago was caused by an asteroid impact somewhere in the greater [[Caribbean Basin]]. The deeply buried [[Chicxulub crater]] is centered off the north coast of the peninsula near the town of [[Chicxulub, Yucat\u00e1n|Chicxulub]]. The now-famous \"Ring of Cenotes\" (visible in [[NASA]] imagery) outlines one of the shock-waves from this impact event in the rock of ~66 million years of age, which lies more than 1&nbsp;km below the modern ground surface near the centre, with the rock above the impact strata all being younger in age. The presence of the crater has been determined first on the surface from the Ring of Cenotes, but also by geophysical methods, and direct drilling with recovery of the drill cores.\n\nThe [[Arrowsmith Bank]] is a [[submerged bank]] located off the northeastern end of the peninsula.<ref>[http://geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-236291&fid=6437&c=undersea_features Arrowsmith Bank, Undersea Features - Geographical Names]</ref>\n\n==Water resources==\nDue to the extreme [[karst]] nature of the whole peninsula, the northern half is devoid of rivers. Where [[lake]]s and [[swamp]]s are present, the water is marshy and generally unpotable. Due to its coastal location, the whole of the peninsula is underlain by an extensive contiguous density stratified coastal [[aquifer]], where a fresh water lens formed from [[meteoric water]] floats on top of intruding saline water from the coastal margins. The thousands of sinkholes known as [[cenotes]] throughout the region provide access to the groundwater system. The cenotes have long been relied on by ancient and contemporary [[Maya peoples|Maya]] people.<ref name=\"readersnatural\" /><ref>[[BBC]]: ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]'', part 4: [[Cave]]s.</ref>\n\n==Flora==\nShort and tall tropical jungles are the predominant natural vegetation types of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\nThe boundaries between northern Guatemala ([[Pet\u00e9n (department)|El Pet\u00e9n]]), Mexico ([[Campeche]] and [[Quintana Roo]]), and western [[Belize]] are still occupied by the largest continuous tracts of tropical [[rainforest]] in [[Central America]]. However, these forests are suffering extensive [[deforestation]].[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/982931]\n\n== Climate ==\nLike much of the [[Caribbean]], the peninsula lies within the Atlantic Hurricane Belt, and with its almost uniformly flat terrain it is vulnerable to these large storms coming from the east. The [[2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was a particularly bad season for [[Mexico]]'s tourism industry, with two forceful category 5 storms hitting, [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] and [[Hurricane Wilma]]. The [[2006 Atlantic Hurricane Season]] was a typical year which left the Yucat\u00e1n untouched, but in the 2007 Atlantic Hurricane season Yucat\u00e1n was hit by [[Hurricane Dean]] (also a category 5 storm), nevertheless Dean left little damage on the peninsula despite heavy localized flooding.\n\nStrong storms called nortes can quickly descend on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula any time of year. Although these storms pummel the area with heavy rains and high winds, they tend to be short-lived, clearing after about an hour. The average percentage of days with rain per month ranges from a monthly low of 7% in April to a high of 25% in October. Breezes can have a cooling effect, [[humidity]] is generally high, particularly in the remaining rainforest areas.<ref>[http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/mexico/Yucatan-Weather-Climate/704]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Jaguar]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* Juan Luis Pena Chapa, Manuel Martin Castillo, and Juan Carlos Gonzalez Avila, ''The Performance of the Economy of the Yucatan Peninsula from 1970\u20131993'' [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Publications/Documents/RR-00-014.pdf]\n* Marcio L.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the portion of the spine where radiculopathy is suspected may reveal evidence of degenerative change, arthritic disease, or another explanatory lesion responsible for the patient's symptoms. Electrodiagnostic testing, consisting of NCS ([[nerve conduction study]]) and EMG ([[electromyography]]), is also a powerful diagnostic tool that may show nerve root injury in suspected areas. On nerve conduction studies, the pattern of diminished [[Compound muscle action potential]] and normal sensory nerve action potential may be seen given that the lesion is proximal to the [[posterior root ganglion]]. Needle EMG is the more sensitive portion of the test, and may reveal active denervation in the distribution of the involved nerve root, and neurogenic-appearing voluntary motor units in more chronic radiculopathies.

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) of the portion of the spine where radiculopathy is suspected may reveal evidence of degenerative change, arthritic disease, or another explanatory lesion responsible for the patient's symptoms. Electrodiagnostic testing, consisting of NCS ([[nerve conduction study]]) and EMG ([[electromyography]]), is also a powerful diagnostic tool that may show nerve root injury in suspected areas. On nerve conduction studies, the pattern of diminished [[Compound muscle action potential]] and normal sensory nerve action potential may be seen given that the lesion is proximal to the [[posterior root ganglion]]. Needle EMG is the more sensitive portion of the test, and may reveal active denervation in the distribution of the involved nerve root, and neurogenic-appearing voluntary motor units in more chronic radiculopathies.

While it is often mistaken for [[diabetes]] or [[hyperglycaemia]], hyperinsulinemia can result from a variety of metabolic diseases and conditions. While hyperinsulinemia is often seen in people with early stage type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is not the cause of the condition and is only one symptom of the disease. Type 1 diabetes only occurs when pancreatic beta-cell function is impaired. Hyperinsulinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions including [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], in neonates and in drug induced hyperinsulinemia. It can also occur in congenital hyperinsulism, including [[nesidioblastosis]].\n\nHyperinsulinemia is associated with [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], [[dyslipidemia]], and [[glucose intolerance]].<ref name=\"pmid3884667\">{{cite journal|last=Modan|first=Michaela|author2=Halkin H |author3=Almog S |author4=Lusky A |author5=Eshkol A |author6=Shefi M |author7=Shitrit A |author8=Fuchs Z. |title=Hyperinsulinemia: A link between hypertension obesity and glucose intolerance|journal=J.

If the mother of the infant is a diabetic, and does not properly control her blood glucose levels, the hyperglycemic maternal blood can create a hyperglycemic environment in the fetus. To compensate for the increased blood glucose levels, fetal pancreatic beta cells can undergo [[hyperplasia]]. The rapid division of beta cells results in increased levels of insulin being secreted to compensate for the high blood glucose levels. Following birth, the hyperglycemic maternal blood is no longer accessible to the neonate resulting in a rapid drop in the newborn\u2019s blood glucose levels. As insulin levels are still elevated this may result in hypoglycemia.  To treat the condition, high concentration doses of glucose are given to the neonate as required maintaining normal blood glucose levels. The hyperinsulinemia condition subsides after one to two days.<ref>Ferry, R.J. (2010).

While it is often mistaken for [[diabetes]] or [[hyperglycaemia]], hyperinsulinemia can result from a variety of metabolic diseases and conditions. While hyperinsulinemia is often seen in people with early stage type 2 diabetes mellitus, it is not the cause of the condition and is only one symptom of the disease. Type 1 diabetes only occurs when pancreatic beta-cell function is impaired. Hyperinsulinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions including [[diabetes mellitus type 2]], in neonates and in drug induced hyperinsulinemia. It can also occur in congenital hyperinsulism, including [[nesidioblastosis]].\n\nHyperinsulinemia is associated with [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], [[dyslipidemia]], and [[glucose intolerance]].<ref name=\"pmid3884667\">{{cite journal|last=Modan|first=Michaela|author2=Halkin H |author3=Almog S |author4=Lusky A |author5=Eshkol A |author6=Shefi M |author7=Shitrit A |author8=Fuchs Z. |title=Hyperinsulinemia: A link between hypertension obesity and glucose intolerance|journal=J.
