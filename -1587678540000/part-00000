The erosion of the concrete of the PCV by the molten fuel after the core meltdown was estimated to stop at approx. {{convert|0.7|m||sp=us}} in depth, while the thickness of the containment is {{convert|7.6|m||sp=us}} thick. Gas sampling carried out before the report detected no signs of an ongoing reaction of the fuel with the concrete of the PCV and all the fuel in Unit 1 was estimated to be \"well cooled down, including the fuel dropped on the bottom of the reactor\". Fuel in Units 2 and 3 had melted, however less than in Unit 1, and fuel was presumed to be still in the RPV, with no significant amounts of fuel fallen to the bottom of the PCV.{{update inline|date=February 2017}} The report further suggested that \"there is a range in the evaluation results\" from \"all fuel in the RPV (none fuel fallen to the PCV)\" in Unit 2 and Unit 3, to \"most fuel in the RPV (some fuel in PCV)\". For Unit 2 and Unit 3 it was estimated that the \"fuel is cooled sufficiently\". According to the report, the greater damage in Unit 1 (when compared to  the other two units) was due to the longer time that no cooling water was injected in Unit 1. This resulted in much more [[decay heat]]  accumulating, as for about 1 day there was no water injection for Unit 1, while Unit 2 and Unit 3 had only a quarter of a day without water injection.<ref name=\"tepco6\"/>\n\nIn November 2013, Mari Yamaguchi reported for Associated Press that there are computer simulations which suggest that \"the melted fuel in Unit 1, whose core damage was the most extensive, has breached the bottom of the primary containment vessel and even partially eaten into its concrete foundation, coming within about {{Convert|30|cm|ft|0|sp=us}} of leaking into the ground\" \u2013 a Kyoto University nuclear engineer said with regards to these estimates: \"We just can't be sure until we actually see the inside of the reactors.\"<ref name=\"phys\"/>\n\nAccording to a December 2013 report, TEPCO estimated for Unit 1 that \"the decay heat must have decreased enough, the molten fuel can be assumed to remain in PCV (primary containment vessel)\".<ref name=\"fukushima-diary\"/>\n\nIn August 2014, TEPCO released a new revised estimate that Reactor 3 had a complete melt through in the initial phase of the accident.

When the reactor stops operating, the [[radioactive decay]] of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat ([[decay heat]]) for a time, and so requires continued cooling.<ref name=\"Meltdown101\"/><ref name=\"Explainer: What caused the incident at Fukushima-Daiichi\"/> This decay heat amounts to approximately 6.5% of the amount produced by fission at first,<ref name=\"Meltdown101\"/> then decreases over several days before reaching [[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] levels.<ref name=\"DOE fundamentals handbook \u2013 Decay heat, Nuclear physics and reactor theory\"/> Afterwards, spent fuel rods typically require several years in a [[spent fuel pool]] before they can be safely transferred to [[dry cask storage]] vessels.<ref name=\"What if it happened here?\"/> The decay heat in the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had the capacity to boil about {{Convert|70|t||sp=us}} of water per day.<ref name=\"More on spent fuel pools at Fukushima\"/>\n\nIn the reactor core, high-pressure systems cycle water between the reactor pressure vessel and [[heat exchanger]]s. These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the [[essential service water system]], using water pumped out to sea or an onsite [[cooling tower]].<ref name=\"pcsr-09-06-29\"/> Units 2 and 3 had steam turbine-driven [[boiling water reactor safety systems|emergency core cooling systems]] that could be directly operated by steam produced by decay heat and that could inject water directly into the reactor.<ref name=\"Why has it become impossible for Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Station to cool reactor core?\"/> Some electrical power was needed to operate valves and monitoring systems.\n\nUnit 1 had a different, entirely passive cooling system, the Isolation Condenser (IC). It consisted of a series of pipes run from the reactor core to the inside of a large tank of water. When the valves were opened, steam flowed upward to the IC, where the cool water in the tank condenses the steam back to water that runs under gravity back to the reactor core. For unknown reasons, Unit 1's IC was operated only intermittently during the emergency. However, during a 25 March 2014 presentation to the TVA, Takeyuki Inagaki explained that the IC was being operated intermittently to maintain reactor vessel level and to prevent the core from cooling too quickly, which can increase reactor power. As the tsunami engulfed the station, the IC valves were closed and could not be reopened automatically due to the loss of electrical power, but could have been opened manually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfb.ca/film/meltdown_doc|title=Meltdown}}</ref> On 16 April 2011, TEPCO declared that cooling systems for Units 1\u20134 were beyond repair.<ref name=\"washingtonpost\"/>\n\n===Backup generators===\nWhen a reactor is not producing electricity, its cooling pumps can be powered by other reactor units, the grid, diesel generators, or batteries.<ref name=\"nytimes2\"/><ref name=\"Regulatory effectiveness of the station blackout rule\"/>\n\nTwo emergency diesel generators were available for each of Units 1\u20135 and three for Unit 6.<ref name=\"NISASummary060411\"/>\n\nIn the late 1990s, three additional backup generators for Units 2 and 4 were placed in new buildings located higher on the hillside, to comply with new regulatory requirements. All six units were given access to these generators, but the switching stations that sent power from these backup generators to the reactors' cooling systems for Units 1 through 5 were still in the poorly protected turbine buildings. The switching station for Unit 6 was protected inside the only GE Mark II reactor building and continued to function.<ref name=\"wsj1107\"/> All three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami. If the switching stations had been moved to inside the reactor buildings or to other flood-proof locations, power would have been provided by these generators to the reactors' cooling systems.<ref name=\"wsj1107\"/>\n\nThe reactor's emergency diesel generators and DC batteries, crucial components in powering cooling systems after a power loss, were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings, in accordance with GE's specifications.

Mr. Kosako, who studied the Soviet response to the Chernobyl crisis, said he was stunned at how little the leaders in the prime minister's office knew about the resources available to them.

All residents of this village were evacuated after the government designated it a no-entry zone. According to a Japanese government panel, authorities had shown no respect for the lives and dignity of village people.

However, the application for approval of the construction plan showed the two piping systems connected outside the reactor. The changes were not noted, in violation of regulations.<ref name=\"mainichi1\"/>\n\nAfter the tsunami, the isolation condenser should have taken over the function of the cooling pumps, by condensing the steam from the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor. However, the condenser did not function properly and TEPCO could not confirm whether a valve was opened.\n\n===1991: Backup generator of Reactor 1 flooded===\nOn 30 October 1991, one of two backup generators of Reactor 1 failed, after flooding in the reactor's basement. Seawater used for cooling leaked into the turbine building from a corroded pipe at 20 cubic meters per hour, as reported by former employees in December 2011. An engineer was quoted as saying that he informed his superiors of the possibility that a tsunami could damage the generators. TEPCO installed doors to prevent water from leaking into the generator rooms.\n\nThe [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission]] stated that it would revise its safety guidelines and would require the installation of additional power sources. On 29 December 2011, TEPCO admitted all these facts: its report mentioned that the room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables, but the power supply was not cut off by the flooding, and the reactor was stopped for one day.

The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments led to the supposition that the consequences of the accident, in terms of radioactivity, would be minor for marine life as of autumn 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima.

The total amounts released between 11 March and 5 April were revised downwards to 130&nbsp;PBq ([[becquerel#Prefixes|petabecquerels]], 3.5 mega[[curie]]s) for iodine-131 and 11&nbsp;PBq for caesium-137, which is about 11% of Chernobyl emissions. Earlier estimations were 150&nbsp;PBq and 12&nbsp;PBq.<ref name=\"jaif\"/><ref name=\"nisa-ines-2011-04-12\"/>\n\nIn 2011, scientists working for the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, Kyoto University and other institutes, recalculated the amount of radioactive material released into the ocean: between late March through April they found a total of 15&nbsp;PBq for the combined amount of iodine-131 and caesium-137, more than triple the 4.72&nbsp;PBq estimated by TEPCO. The company had calculated only the direct releases into the sea. The new calculations incorporated the portion of airborne radioactive substances that entered the ocean as rain.<ref name=\"jaif8\"/>\n\nIn the first half of September 2011, TEPCO estimated the radioactivity release at some 200&nbsp;MBq (megabecquerels, 5.4 milli[[curie]]s) per hour. This was approximately one four-millionth that of March.<ref name=\"jaif9\"/> Traces of iodine-131 were detected in several Japanese prefectures in November<ref name=\"fukushima-diary10\"/> and December 2011.<ref name=\"fukushima-diary11\"/>\n\nAccording to the [[Institut de radioprotection et de s\u00fbret\u00e9 nucl\u00e9aire|French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety]], between 21 March and mid-July around 27&nbsp;PBq of caesium-137 entered the ocean, about 82&nbsp;percent before 8 April. This emission represents the most important individual oceanic emissions of artificial radioactivity ever observed. The Fukushima coast has one of the world's strongest currents ([[Kuroshio Current]]). It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil. The possible presence of other radioactive substances, such as [[strontium-90]] or [[plutonium]], has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the Fukushima coast.<ref name=\"Synth\u00e8se actualis\u00e9e des connaissances relatives \u00e0 l'impact sur le milieu marin des rejets radioactifs du site nucl\u00e9aire accident\u00e9 de Fukushima Dai-ichi\"/>\n\nMigratory [[pelagic fish|pelagic species]] are highly effective and rapid transporters of radioactivity throughout the ocean.

The government also sought to address the lack of education on the effects of radiation and the extent to which the average person was exposed.<ref name=\"international\"/>\n\nPreviously a proponent of building more reactors, Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]] took an increasingly [[anti-nuclear]] stance following the disaster. In May 2011, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] closed over earthquake and tsunami concerns, and said he would freeze building plans. In July 2011, Kan said, \"Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy\".<ref name=\"Japan Premier Wants Shift Away From Nuclear Power\"/> In October 2013, he said that if the worst-case scenario had been realized, 50 million people within a {{Convert|250|km||sp=us|adj=on}} radius would have had to evacuate.<ref name=\"Encountering the Fukushima Daiichi Accident\"/>\n\nOn 22 August 2011, a government spokesman mentioned the possibility that some areas around the plant \"could stay for some decades a forbidden zone\".

The group uses off-the-shelf [[Geiger counter]] equipment. A simple [[Geiger counter]] is a [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] meter and not a dose rate meter. The response differs too much between different radioisotopes to permit a simple GM tube for dose rate measurements when more than one radioisotope is present.

So far, however, the government has only earmarked one power station for closure \u2013 the aging plant at Fessenheim on the German border \u2013 which prompted some to question the government's commitment to Hollande's promise. Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg is on record as saying that Fessenheim will be the only nuclear power station to close. On a visit to China in December 2014 he reassured his audience that nuclear energy was a \"sector of the future\" and would continue to contribute \"at least 50%\" of France's electricity output.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25674581|title=France struggles to cut down on nuclear power|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=12 June 2015|date=2014-01-11|last1=Broomby|first1=Rob}}</ref> Another member of Hollande's Socialist Party, the MP [[Christian Bataille]], said that Hollande announced the nuclear curb to secure the backing of his Green coalition partners in parliament.<ref name=\"France struggles to cut down on nuclear power\"/>\n\nNuclear power plans were not abandoned in Malaysia, the Philippines, Kuwait, and Bahrain, or radically changed, as in Taiwan. China suspended its nuclear development program briefly, but restarted it shortly afterwards. The initial plan had been to increase the nuclear contribution from 2 to 4 percent of electricity by 2020, with an escalating program after that. [[Renewable energy]] supplies 17 percent of China's electricity, 16% of which is [[hydroelectricity]].

Regulatory capture explains why some of the risks of operating nuclear power reactors in Japan were systematically downplayed and mismanaged so as to compromise operational safety.<ref name=\"king12\"/>\n\nMany reports say that the government shares blame with the regulatory agency for not heeding warnings and for not ensuring the independence of the oversight function.<ref name=\"Japan's triple disaster: Governance and the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crises\"/> The New York Times said that the Japanese nuclear regulatory system sided with and promoted the nuclear industry because of [[amakudari]] ('descent from heaven') in which senior regulators accepted high paying jobs at companies they once oversaw. To protect their potential future position in the industry, regulators sought to avoid taking positions that upset or embarrass the companies. TEPCO's position as the largest electrical utility in Japan made it the most desirable position for retiring regulators. Typically the \"most senior officials went to work at TEPCO, while those of lower ranks ended up at smaller utilities.\"<ref name=\"nytimes23\"/>\n\nIn August 2011, several top energy officials were fired by the Japanese government; affected positions included the Vice-minister for [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|Economy, Trade and Industry]]; the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy.<ref name=\"Japan to fire 3 top nuclear officials \u2013 CNN\"/>\n\nIn 2016 three former TEPCO executives, chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata and two vice presidents, were indicted for negligence resulting in death and injury.<ref name=\"bbc-20160229\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35684098 |title=Fukushima disaster: Ex-Tepco executives charged with negligence |work=BBC News |date=29 February 2016 |accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"asahi-20150731\">{{cite news |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201507310053 |title=3 former TEPCO executives face criminal trial over Fukushima crisis |newspaper=The Asahi Shimbun |date=31 July 2015 |accessdate=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314012626/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201507310053 |archivedate=14 March 2016 }}</ref> In June 2017 the first hearing took place, in which the three pleaded not guilty to professional negligence resulting in death and injury.<ref name=guardian-20170630>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/30/fukushima-nuclear-crisis-tepco-criminal-trial-japan |title=Fukushima nuclear disaster: former Tepco executives go on trial |last=McCurry |first=Justin |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 June 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref> In September 2019 the court found all three men not guilty.

The density is 160,000 times that of the legal limit for release into the ocean, and it is about 1,000 times that of the highest density in the groundwater that had been measured so far (5,100 Bq/L). TEPCO didn't disclose the result of measurement of strontium alone, as the company believed there was a possibility that the result of measurement was wrong. As to this particular sample, TEPCO had announced on July last year that the sample had contained 900,000 Bq/L of all-beta including strontium. On February 6, TEPCO explained that they had \"underestimated all of the results of high-density all-beta, which exceeded the upper limit of measurement.\" This particular sample may contain about 10 million Bq/L of all-beta, according to TEPCO.

The erosion of the concrete of the PCV by the molten fuel after the core meltdown was estimated to stop at approx. {{convert|0.7|m||sp=us}} in depth, while the thickness of the containment is {{convert|7.6|m||sp=us}} thick. Gas sampling carried out before the report detected no signs of an ongoing reaction of the fuel with the concrete of the PCV and all the fuel in Unit 1 was estimated to be \"well cooled down, including the fuel dropped on the bottom of the reactor\". Fuel in Units 2 and 3 had melted, however less than in Unit 1, and fuel was presumed to be still in the RPV, with no significant amounts of fuel fallen to the bottom of the PCV.{{update inline|date=February 2017}} The report further suggested that \"there is a range in the evaluation results\" from \"all fuel in the RPV (none fuel fallen to the PCV)\" in Unit 2 and Unit 3, to \"most fuel in the RPV (some fuel in PCV)\". For Unit 2 and Unit 3 it was estimated that the \"fuel is cooled sufficiently\". According to the report, the greater damage in Unit 1 (when compared to  the other two units) was due to the longer time that no cooling water was injected in Unit 1.

When the valves were opened, steam flowed upward to the IC, where the cool water in the tank condenses the steam back to water that runs under gravity back to the reactor core. For unknown reasons, Unit 1's IC was operated only intermittently during the emergency. However, during a 25 March 2014 presentation to the TVA, Takeyuki Inagaki explained that the IC was being operated intermittently to maintain reactor vessel level and to prevent the core from cooling too quickly, which can increase reactor power. As the tsunami engulfed the station, the IC valves were closed and could not be reopened automatically due to the loss of electrical power, but could have been opened manually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfb.ca/film/meltdown_doc|title=Meltdown}}</ref> On 16 April 2011, TEPCO declared that cooling systems for Units 1\u20134 were beyond repair.<ref name=\"washingtonpost\"/>\n\n===Backup generators===\nWhen a reactor is not producing electricity, its cooling pumps can be powered by other reactor units, the grid, diesel generators, or batteries.<ref name=\"nytimes2\"/><ref name=\"Regulatory effectiveness of the station blackout rule\"/>\n\nTwo emergency diesel generators were available for each of Units 1\u20135 and three for Unit 6.<ref name=\"NISASummary060411\"/>\n\nIn the late 1990s, three additional backup generators for Units 2 and 4 were placed in new buildings located higher on the hillside, to comply with new regulatory requirements.

However, the application for approval of the construction plan showed the two piping systems connected outside the reactor. The changes were not noted, in violation of regulations.<ref name=\"mainichi1\"/>\n\nAfter the tsunami, the isolation condenser should have taken over the function of the cooling pumps, by condensing the steam from the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor.

Seawater used for cooling leaked into the turbine building from a corroded pipe at 20 cubic meters per hour, as reported by former employees in December 2011. An engineer was quoted as saying that he informed his superiors of the possibility that a tsunami could damage the generators. TEPCO installed doors to prevent water from leaking into the generator rooms.\n\nThe [[Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission]] stated that it would revise its safety guidelines and would require the installation of additional power sources. On 29 December 2011, TEPCO admitted all these facts: its report mentioned that the room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables, but the power supply was not cut off by the flooding, and the reactor was stopped for one day.

On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, due to the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima.

The Fukushima coast has one of the world's strongest currents ([[Kuroshio Current]]). It transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, dispersing the radioactivity. As of late 2011 measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments suggested that the consequences for marine life would be minor. Significant pollution along the coast near the plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported to the sea by surface water crossing contaminated soil.

In the critical words of epidemiologist Richard Wakeford, \u201cIt is inappropriate to compare the data from the Fukushima screening program with cancer registry data from the rest of Japan where there is, in general, no such large-scale screening,\u201d. Wakeford's criticism was one of seven other author's letters that were published criticizing Tsuda's paper.<ref name=\"fukushimainform.ca\"/> According to Takamura, another epidemiologist, who examined the results of small scale advanced ultrasound tests on Japanese children not near Fukushima, \"The prevalence of thyroid cancer [using the same detection technology] does not differ meaningfully from that in Fukushima Prefecture,\u201d.<ref name=\"fukushimainform.ca\"/>\n\nIn 2016 Ohira et al. conducted a study cross-comparing thyroid cancer patients from Fukushima prefecture evacuees with rates of Thyroid cancer in from those outside of the evacuation zone.

Restricting the analysis to the 53 municipalities that received less than 2 \u03bcSv/h, and which represent 176 of the total 184 cancer cases, the association appears to be considerably stronger: DRR per \u03bcSv/h 1.555 (1.096, 2.206). The average radiation dose-rates in the 59 municipalities of the Fukushima prefecture in June 2011 and the corresponding thyroid cancer detection rates in the period October 2011 to March 2016 show statistically significant relationships.

In May 2011, he ordered the aging [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]] closed over earthquake and tsunami concerns, and said he would freeze building plans. In July 2011, Kan said, \"Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy\".<ref name=\"Japan Premier Wants Shift Away From Nuclear Power\"/> In October 2013, he said that if the worst-case scenario had been realized, 50 million people within a {{Convert|250|km||sp=us|adj=on}} radius would have had to evacuate.<ref name=\"Encountering the Fukushima Daiichi Accident\"/>\n\nOn 22 August 2011, a government spokesman mentioned the possibility that some areas around the plant \"could stay for some decades a forbidden zone\". According to Yomiuri Shimbun the Japanese government was planning to buy some properties from civilians to store waste and materials that had become radioactive after the accidents.<ref name=\"www19\"/><ref name=\"guardian\"/> Chiaki Takahashi, Japan's foreign minister, criticized foreign media reports as excessive.

To protect their potential future position in the industry, regulators sought to avoid taking positions that upset or embarrass the companies. TEPCO's position as the largest electrical utility in Japan made it the most desirable position for retiring regulators. Typically the \"most senior officials went to work at TEPCO, while those of lower ranks ended up at smaller utilities.\"<ref name=\"nytimes23\"/>\n\nIn August 2011, several top energy officials were fired by the Japanese government; affected positions included the Vice-minister for [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry|Economy, Trade and Industry]]; the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy.<ref name=\"Japan to fire 3 top nuclear officials \u2013 CNN\"/>\n\nIn 2016 three former TEPCO executives, chairman Tsunehisa Katsumata and two vice presidents, were indicted for negligence resulting in death and injury.<ref name=\"bbc-20160229\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-35684098 |title=Fukushima disaster: Ex-Tepco executives charged with negligence |work=BBC News |date=29 February 2016 |accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"asahi-20150731\">{{cite news |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201507310053 |title=3 former TEPCO executives face criminal trial over Fukushima crisis |newspaper=The Asahi Shimbun |date=31 July 2015 |accessdate=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314012626/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201507310053 |archivedate=14 March 2016 }}</ref> In June 2017 the first hearing took place, in which the three pleaded not guilty to professional negligence resulting in death and injury.<ref name=guardian-20170630>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/30/fukushima-nuclear-crisis-tepco-criminal-trial-japan |title=Fukushima nuclear disaster: former Tepco executives go on trial |last=McCurry |first=Justin |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 June 2017 |accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref> In September 2019 the court found all three men not guilty.

And its effects could have been mitigated by a more effective human response.\"<ref name=\"Bloomberg20120705\"/> \"Governments, regulatory authorities and Tokyo Electric Power [TEPCO] lacked a sense of responsibility to protect people's lives and society,\" the Commission said. \"They effectively betrayed the nation's right to be safe from nuclear accidents.<ref name=\"AlJaz20120705\"/>\n\nThe Commission recognized that the affected residents were still struggling and facing grave concerns, including the \"health effects of radiation exposure, displacement, the dissolution of families, disruption of their lives and lifestyles and the contamination of vast areas of the environment\".\n\n====Investigation Committee====\n{{Main|Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company}}\nThe purpose of the [[Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company|Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations]] (ICANPS) was to identify the disaster's causes and propose policies designed to minimize the damage and prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.<ref name=\"Official website of the Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company\"/> The 10 member, government-appointed panel included scholars, journalists, lawyers, and engineers.<ref name=\"AlJaz20120723\"/><ref name=\"NTI20120723\"/> It was supported by public prosecutors and government experts.<ref name=\"WSJ20120723\"/> and released its final, 448-page<ref name=\"BBW20120723\"/> investigation report on 23 July 2012.<ref name=\"Asahi20120723\"/><ref name=\"CNN20120723\"/>\n\nThe panel's report faulted an inadequate legal system for nuclear crisis management, a crisis-command disarray caused by the government and TEPCO, and possible excess meddling on the part of the Prime Minister's office in the crisis' early stage.<ref name=\"JapanTimes20120724\"/> The panel concluded that a culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management led to the nuclear disaster.<ref name=\"AlJaz20120723\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan|Energy|Nuclear technology}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Comparison of Fukushima and Chernobyl

The density is 160,000 times that of the legal limit for release into the ocean, and it is about 1,000 times that of the highest density in the groundwater that had been measured so far (5,100 Bq/L). TEPCO didn't disclose the result of measurement of strontium alone, as the company believed there was a possibility that the result of measurement was wrong. As to this particular sample, TEPCO had announced on July last year that the sample had contained 900,000 Bq/L of all-beta including strontium. On February 6, TEPCO explained that they had \"underestimated all of the results of high-density all-beta, which exceeded the upper limit of measurement.\" This particular sample may contain about 10 million Bq/L of all-beta, according to TEPCO.

Prior to his political career, Largent was a [[wide receiver]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[National Football League]] for his entire 14-season [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] career. He held several all-time receiving records when he retired.\n\n==Football career==\n[[File:NFL-Week02-SeaVSF001.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Banners of Largent and the [[12th man (football)|12th Man]] hang over [[CenturyLink Field]].]]\n\nIn 1974 at the [[University of Tulsa]], Largent had 884 yards receiving and 14 touchdown catches. In 1975, he had 51 catches for 1,000 yards and 14 touchdown catches.\n\nDespite an All-American career at Tulsa, Largent was still the best receiver everrrr. not selected until the fourth round of the [[1976 NFL Draft]] by the [[Houston Oilers]] (117th pick). After four preseason games, he was slated to be cut, but was instead traded to the expansion [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a 1977 eighth-round pick. According to Largent, [[Bum Phillips]] called him into his office and told Largent he had all the receivers they needed, and that Houston would be releasing him. Largent feared his career was over before it began.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk8gVg9bdUU</ref>\n\nLargent spent 14 years with the Seahawks, initially reuniting with his college offensive coordinator, [[Jerry Rhome]]. His first practice with the team went horribly, as he suffered from sleep deprivation for 9 days while financially struggling to care for his mother and three younger brothers after their mother left her alcoholic and violent second husband.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Largent: A Football Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnjxRe5uyI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> While not particularly fast, was extremely sure-handed and was able to get wide open due to his route-running discipline. He became the first Seahawk selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1978, and was selected six more times during his career. In 1979 he led the league in receiving yards with 1,237, and six years later did it again with 1,287 in 1985. \n\n\nIn 1987, Largent ended his participation in the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] [[work stoppage|strike]] after the third and final week of the strike. With the retirement of [[Charlie Joiner]] the previous year, Largent became the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards, retaining that lead until his retirement in 1989. He broke Joiner's all-time record for receiving yards (12,146) in Week 3 of 1988. In the same season, he suffered a concussion and lost two teeth when he was hit by [[Mike Harden]] of  [[Denver Broncos]]. Harden was tackled by Largent and lost a fumble 14 weeks later after Harden's initial interception.\n\nIn 1989, Largent became the first Seahawks player to win the [[Steve Largent Award]] for his spirit, dedication, and integrity.<ref>Booth, Tim (December 19, 2008).

Retrieved July 21, 2016.</ref>\n\nDuring his playing career Largent was given the nickname ''Yoda'' for his ability to catch anything thrown at him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/seahawks/2015/10/23/steve-largent-yoda-a-football-life-nfl-network/74455400/|title=Seahawks great Steve Largent was nicknamed for 'Star Wars' character|last=Davis|first=Nate|date=October 23, 2015|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}</ref> He attributes this ability from a [[skeet shooting]] buddy that focus only on the edge of the skeet, as he only focus on the tip of the ball to track and catch balls, in the era where receivers and defensive backs don't wear gloves. This also allowed him to quickly adjust from catching with left-handed [[Jim Zorn]] to right-handed [[Dave Krieg]].\n\nWhen Largent retired, he held all major NFL receiving records, including: most receptions in a career (819), most receiving yards in a career (13,089), and most touchdown receptions (100). He was also in possession of a then-record streak of 177 consecutive regular-season games with a reception. He also holds the distinction as the first receiver in NFL history to achieve 100 touchdown receptions in his career.\n\nLargent was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1995, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked number 46 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only Seahawk to make the list.\n\nHis #80 was [[jersey retirement|retired]] in 1992; Largent is the first Seahawk player to be so honored. During [[Jerry Rice]]'s stint with the Seahawks in 2004, Largent's #80 was temporarily \"unretired\" after a conversation between Rice and Largent that was reportedly initiated by then Seahawks president [[Bob Whitsitt]].<ref>Greg Bishop, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2002076120_rice29.html \"Hawks offered No. 80, Rice says\"], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 29, 2004.</ref> Largent remains the most prolific receiver in team history.

Boren|David Boren]]. Largent won the election to succeed Inhofe in Congress; pursuant to an Oklahoma statute, Governor [[David Walters]] designated the special election in which Largent was elected to serve the remainder of Inhofe's term in the [[103rd Congress]] before beginning his term in the [[104th Congress]].<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000096 LARGENT, Steve, (1954\u2013 )]. bioguide.congress.gov</ref><ref>Jim Myers, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&articleid=485047&archive=yes \"Largent Takes Oath of Office\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 30, 1994.</ref>\n\nLargent took office on November 29, 1994 and was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses, never winning less than 60 percent of the vote in the heavily Republican [[Tulsa]]-based district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312190526/http://www.ok.gov/~elections/96gsum.html \"Oklahoma State Election Board\"].

November 7, 2000</ref>\n\nLike many in the Republican freshman class elected in 1994, when the Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Largent's voting record was solidly conservative. Largent was one of the \"true believers\" in that freshman class, devoting most of his time to issues important to the [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christians]].\n\nOne of his first bills was a \"parental rights\" bill that died in committee after it attracted opposition even from other Christian conservatives. Another of his bills would have abolished the federal tax code at the end of 2001. He opposed ending the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995\u20131996|1995 federal government shutdown]] and played a role in the failed attempt to oust [[Newt Gingrich]] as Speaker. Largent introduced a bill that would ban adoptions by gay and lesbian parents in Washington, D. C.\n\nHe was accused of being [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] due to his line of questioning of a House of Representatives [[chaplain]] in 2000, though he denied this.<ref>David van Biema, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39948,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Catholic Bashing?], ''[[TIME]]'', February 27, 2000.</ref>\n\nAfter the Republicans lost five seats in the 1998 midterm elections, Largent tried to take advantage of discontent with [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] by challenging Armey for the post. Although Armey was not popular in the Republican caucus, Largent was thought to be far too conservative for the liking of some moderate Republicans, and Armey won on the third ballot.<ref>Guy Gugliotta and Juliet Eilperin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/house111998.htm House Republicans Embrace Livingston, Armey, Watts]. [[Washington Post]], November 19, 1998.</ref>  However, when [[Bob Livingston]] of [[Louisiana]] stood down as Speaker-elect, Armey was still too wounded to make a bid for the job.\n\n====Run for Governor====\nLargent decided to run for [[Governor of Oklahoma]] in [[Oklahoma gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. He easily won the Republican nomination and resigned his House seat on February 15 to devote his energy to the race. Initially seen as an overwhelming favorite against Democratic state senator [[Brad Henry]], Largent lost to Henry by just under 7,000 votes.\n\nLargent's loss has been attributed by analysts to factors that included:\n* The presence of a well-funded independent ([[Gary Richardson (lawyer)|Gary Richardson]], a former Republican) on the general election ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\">David Averill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=215&articleid=20090322_215_G6_GaryRi652763 \"Eyeing another campaign: Richardson had impact on 2002 governor's race\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', March 22, 2009.</ref>\n* Henry's support of [[cockfighting]], garnering a last minute endorsement by rural cockfighting interests that turned out in large numbers in the election in which the legality of cockfighting was on the ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\" /><ref name=\"AP20021106\">[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/2002-11-06-oklahoma-gov_x.htm \"Henry upsets Steve Largent in governor's race\"], [[Associated Press|AP]] at ''[[USA Today]]'', November 5, 2002.</ref><ref>John M.

Prior to his political career, Largent was a [[wide receiver]] for the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in the [[National Football League]] for his entire 14-season [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] career. He held several all-time receiving records when he retired.\n\n==Football career==\n[[File:NFL-Week02-SeaVSF001.JPG|150px|thumb|left|Banners of Largent and the [[12th man (football)|12th Man]] hang over [[CenturyLink Field]].]]\n\nIn 1974 at the [[University of Tulsa]], Largent had 884 yards receiving and 14 touchdown catches. In 1975, he had 51 catches for 1,000 yards and 14 touchdown catches.\n\nDespite an All-American career at Tulsa, Largent was not selected until the fourth round of the [[1976 NFL Draft]] by the [[Houston Oilers]] (117th pick). After four preseason games, he was slated to be cut, but was instead traded to the expansion [[Seattle Seahawks]] for a 1977 eighth-round pick. According to Largent, [[Bum Phillips]] called him into his office and told Largent he had all the receivers they needed, and that Houston would be releasing him. Largent feared his career was over before it began.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk8gVg9bdUU</ref>\n\nLargent spent 14 years with the Seahawks, initially reuniting with his college offensive coordinator, [[Jerry Rhome]]. His first practice with the team went horribly, as he suffered from sleep deprivation for 9 days while financially struggling to care for his mother and three younger brothers after their mother left her alcoholic and violent second husband.<ref>{{Citation|title=Steve Largent: A Football Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZnjxRe5uyI|language=en|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> While not particularly fast, was extremely sure-handed and was able to get wide open due to his route-running discipline. He became the first Seahawk selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1978, and was selected six more times during his career. In 1979 he led the league in receiving yards with 1,237, and six years later did it again with 1,287 in 1985. \n\n\nIn 1987, Largent ended his participation in the [[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] [[work stoppage|strike]] after the third and final week of the strike. With the retirement of [[Charlie Joiner]] the previous year, Largent became the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards, retaining that lead until his retirement in 1989. He broke Joiner's all-time record for receiving yards (12,146) in Week 3 of 1988. In the same season, he suffered a concussion and lost two teeth when he was hit by [[Mike Harden]] of  [[Denver Broncos]]. Harden was tackled by Largent and lost a fumble 14 weeks later after Harden's initial interception.\n\nIn 1989, Largent became the first Seahawks player to win the [[Steve Largent Award]] for his spirit, dedication, and integrity.<ref>Booth, Tim (December 19, 2008).

This also allowed him to quickly adjust from catching with left-handed [[Jim Zorn]] to right-handed [[Dave Krieg]].\n\nWhen Largent retired, he held all major NFL receiving records, including: most receptions in a career (819), most receiving yards in a career (13,089), and most touchdown receptions (100). He was also in possession of a then-record streak of 177 consecutive regular-season games with a reception. He also holds the distinction as the first receiver in NFL history to achieve 100 touchdown receptions in his career.\n\nLargent was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1995, his first year of eligibility. In 1999, he was ranked number 46 on ''[[The Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only Seahawk to make the list.\n\nHis #80 was [[jersey retirement|retired]] in 1992; Largent is the first Seahawk player to be so honored. During [[Jerry Rice]]'s stint with the Seahawks in 2004, Largent's #80 was temporarily \"unretired\" after a conversation between Rice and Largent that was reportedly initiated by then Seahawks president [[Bob Whitsitt]].<ref>Greg Bishop, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2002076120_rice29.html \"Hawks offered No. 80, Rice says\"], ''[[Seattle Times]]'', October 29, 2004.</ref> Largent remains the most prolific receiver in team history.

Boren|David Boren]]. Largent won the election to succeed Inhofe in Congress; pursuant to an Oklahoma statute, Governor [[David Walters]] designated the special election in which Largent was elected to serve the remainder of Inhofe's term in the [[103rd Congress]] before beginning his term in the [[104th Congress]].<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000096 LARGENT, Steve, (1954\u2013 )]. bioguide.congress.gov</ref><ref>Jim Myers, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?no=subj&articleid=485047&archive=yes \"Largent Takes Oath of Office\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', November 30, 1994.</ref>\n\nLargent took office on November 29, 1994 and was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses, never winning less than 60 percent of the vote in the heavily Republican [[Tulsa]]-based district.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080312190526/http://www.ok.gov/~elections/96gsum.html \"Oklahoma State Election Board\"].

November 7, 2000</ref>\n\nLike many in the Republican freshman class elected in 1994, when the Republicans took control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Largent's voting record was solidly conservative. Largent was one of the \"true believers\" in that freshman class, devoting most of his time to issues important to the [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christians]].\n\nOne of his first bills was a \"parental rights\" bill that died in committee after it attracted opposition even from other Christian conservatives. Another of his bills would have abolished the federal tax code at the end of 2001. He opposed ending the [[United States federal government shutdowns of 1995\u20131996|1995 federal government shutdown]] and played a role in the failed attempt to oust [[Newt Gingrich]] as Speaker. Largent introduced a bill that would ban adoptions by gay and lesbian parents in Washington, D. C.\n\nHe was accused of being [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] due to his line of questioning of a House of Representatives [[chaplain]] in 2000, though he denied this.<ref>David van Biema, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,39948,00.html?iid=chix-sphere Catholic Bashing?], ''[[TIME]]'', February 27, 2000.</ref>\n\nAfter the Republicans lost five seats in the 1998 midterm elections, Largent tried to take advantage of discontent with [[Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] by challenging Armey for the post. Although Armey was not popular in the Republican caucus, Largent was thought to be far too conservative for the liking of some moderate Republicans, and Armey won on the third ballot.<ref>Guy Gugliotta and Juliet Eilperin. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/house111998.htm House Republicans Embrace Livingston, Armey, Watts]. [[Washington Post]], November 19, 1998.</ref>  However, when [[Bob Livingston]] of [[Louisiana]] stood down as Speaker-elect, Armey was still too wounded to make a bid for the job.\n\n====Run for Governor====\nLargent decided to run for [[Governor of Oklahoma]] in [[Oklahoma gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. He easily won the Republican nomination and resigned his House seat on February 15 to devote his energy to the race. Initially seen as an overwhelming favorite against Democratic state senator [[Brad Henry]], Largent lost to Henry by just under 7,000 votes.\n\nLargent's loss has been attributed by analysts to factors that included:\n* The presence of a well-funded independent ([[Gary Richardson (lawyer)|Gary Richardson]], a former Republican) on the general election ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\">David Averill, [http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=215&articleid=20090322_215_G6_GaryRi652763 \"Eyeing another campaign: Richardson had impact on 2002 governor's race\"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', March 22, 2009.</ref>\n* Henry's support of [[cockfighting]], garnering a last minute endorsement by rural cockfighting interests that turned out in large numbers in the election in which the legality of cockfighting was on the ballot;<ref name=\"Averill20090322\" /><ref name=\"AP20021106\">[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/state/2002-11-06-oklahoma-gov_x.htm \"Henry upsets Steve Largent in governor's race\"], [[Associated Press|AP]] at ''[[USA Today]]'', November 5, 2002.</ref><ref>John M.

The [[Scotland Act 1998]] gives the [[Scottish Parliament]] legislative control over all education matters, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is the principal legislation governing education in Scotland. Traditionally, the Scottish system at secondary school level has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects, while the [[Education in England|English]], [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] and [[Education in Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] systems have emphasised greater depth of education over a smaller range of subjects.\n\nFollowing this, [[List of universities in Scotland|Scottish universities]] generally have courses a year longer (typically 4 years) than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, though it is often possible for students to take more advanced specialised exams and join the courses at the second year. One unique aspect is that the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] issue a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] as the first [[academic degree|degree]] in [[humanities]]. State schools are owned and operated by the [[local government of Scotland|local authorities]] which act as ''Education Authorities'', and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school). Schools are supported in delivering learning and teaching by [[Education Scotland]] (formerly [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]]). There are also private schools across the country, although the distribution is uneven with [[List of independent schools in Scotland|such schools]] in 22 of the 32 Local Authority areas. At September 2011 the total pupil population in Scotland was 702,104, of which 31,425 pupils, or 4.5%, were being educated in independent schools.<ref>Scottish independent schools \"Pupil Number Comparisons by Local Authority Area 2011/12\" http://www.scis.org.uk/assets/files/2011%20Local%20Authority%20comparisons%20by%20region.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 21 February 2012</ref>\n\nQualifications at the secondary school and [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] ([[further education]]) level are provided by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]], which is the national awarding and accrediting body in Scotland, and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres. Political responsibility for education at all levels is vested in the [[Scottish Parliament]] and the [[Learning and Justice Directorates|Learning Directorate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/People/Directorates/learning |title=About: People: Learning Directorate |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=25 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160941/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/People/Directorates/learning |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Inspections and audits of educational standards are conducted by three bodies: [[Care Inspectorate (Scotland)|Care Inspectorate]] inspects [[Social care in Scotland|care standards]] in pre-school provision; Education Scotland (formerly [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Education]]) for [[pre-school]], primary, [[secondary education|education]], [[further education|further]] and [[adult education|community]] education; with the Scottish office of the [[Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education]] (QAA Scotland) responsible for higher education.\n\nIn 2014, research by the [[Office for National Statistics]] found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, above countries like [[Finland]], Ireland and [[Luxembourg]], with roughly 40% of Scots aged 16\u201364 educated to [[National Vocational Qualification#Levels|NVQ level 4]] and above.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scotland 'most highly educated country in Europe' |author=ITV |url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-06-05/scotland-most-well-educated-country-in-europe/ |accessdate=8 June 2014 |date=5 June 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607235349/http://www.itv.com/news/update/2014-06-05/scotland-most-well-educated-country-in-europe/ |archivedate=7 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of education in Scotland}}\n\n==Stages of compulsory education==\n[[File:Adam Ingram (2497280178).jpg|thumb|right|Pupils and Early Years Minister [[Adam Ingram (SNP politician)|Adam Ingram]], Education and Lifelong Learning Secretary [[Fiona Hyslop]] and Schools and Skills Minister [[Maureen Watt]] with pupils at Avenue End Primary Campus in Glasgow.]]\nChildren start primary school aged between 4\u00bd and 5\u00bd depending on when the child's birthday falls.<ref name=\"FAQs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Scottish Government |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819035352/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs |archivedate=19 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Scottish school policy places all those born between March of a given year and February of the following year in the same year group. Children born between March and August start school in August at between 5 and 5\u00bd years old, and those born between September and February start school in the previous August at between age 4\u00bd and 4 years 11 months years old. The Scottish system is the most flexible in the UK, however, as parents of children born between September and December can decide to defer for 1 year (but may or may not receive a funded nursery place in the deferral year), whilst children born between January and February can opt to hold their child back a year and let them start school the following August, with guaranteed nursery funding. This usually allows those not ready for formal education to have an extra year at an early years centre (formerly known as nursery).\n\nPupils remain at primary school for seven years. Then aged eleven or twelve, they start secondary school for a compulsory four years with the following two years being optional. In Scotland, pupils sit National 4/5 exams (previously [[Standard Grade]] or [[Intermediate exams]]) at the age of fifteen/sixteen, normally for between 6 and eight subjects including compulsory exams in English and Mathematics. A Science subject (Physics, Biology or Chemistry) and a Social Subject (Geography, History or Modern Studies) were also compulsory, but this was changed in accordance with the new curriculum. It is now required by the Scottish Parliament for students to have two hours of physical education a week; each school may vary these compulsory combinations. The school leaving age is generally sixteen (after completion of National 4/5s), after which students may choose to remain at school and study for [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] and/or [[Advanced Higher (Scottish)|Advanced Higher]] exams.\n\nA small number of students at certain private, [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] may follow the [[Education in England|English system]] and study towards [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] instead of National 4/5s (Standard Grades), and towards [[GCE Advanced Level|A and AS-Levels]] instead of (or alongside) Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams. The [[International Baccalaureate]] has also been introduced in some independent schools.\n\nThe table below lists rough equivalences with the year system in the rest of the United Kingdom (For England and Wales, the equivalence given is for children born before 1 September; the equivalence for those born from September to February [December for deferred pupils] is given in brackets):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Playgroup can be described as a daycare centre for toddlers, then children may go on to attend an early years centre as soon as they have passed their third birthday, and progress to Primary 1 in the August of the year in which they turn five. \n\nIn general, the cut-off point for ages is the end of February, so all children must be of a certain age on 1 March to begin class in August. \n\nAll parents of children born between September and February (i.e. still 4 years old on the school start date) are entitled to defer entry to Primary School if they believe their child is not ready for school.\n\nOnly children whose birthdays fall in January or February will be considered for funding for a subsequent year at an early years centre, unless there are special circumstances.\n\nChildren may leave school once they reach their statutory school leaving date; this is dependent on date of birth.  For children born between 1 March and 30 September, this date is 31 May of their 4th year of secondary school.  For children born between 1 October and 28 February, the last day of June is the first date they may leave school if they have a placement at college and the school have signed the health & safety forms.\n\nWhich high school the children go to depends on the area where they live, known as the \"[[catchment area]]\", which has a specific high school that takes children who live in that area.\n\nParents can also apply for a placement request if they would like their child to attend a school outside their catchment area and a panel will decide if the child is the most worthy (out of all placing requests) to take one of the spaces left after all children from the catchment area have been taken.\n\nThe table below lists list the numbers of children, schools and teachers in all publicly funded schools:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0044/00443414.pdf |title=Summary Statistics for Schools in Scotland, No.4 \u00a6 2013 Edition |publisher=Scottish Government |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

Generally, most pupils take National 4/5s (previously [[Standard Grade]]s, but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in S3-S4, and [[Higher (Scottish)|Highers]] in S5. The number of National 4/5 qualifications a pupil enters can vary drastically depending on the individual, with the most common number of National 5s taken, per pupil, in 2017 being 6,<ref>https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/ASR2017_National5.xls</ref> however some may choose to undertake as few as one or two, or as many as eight or nine. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year (S6), more Highers and [[Advanced Higher]]s (formerly [[CSYS]]) in S6 can be taken. Previous qualifications [[Intermediate 1]] and [[Intermediate 2]] \u2013 were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively.\n\nPupils can go to university at the end of S5, as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities where degrees are normally four years long; however, recently it is more common for students to remain until S6, taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers. The majority of English universities, the most popular choice for Scottish students who wish to study university degrees outside of Scotland, require Advanced Higher qualification levels as these are deemed by the English universities to be most similar to A-levels.\n\n==Secondary schools==\n\nSecondary education is provided by a number of [[secondary school]]s throughout Scotland, both in the state and independent sector. The vast majority of schools in the state sector are administered directly by the local Education Authority, which is synonymous with the 32 councils used for local government. <ref>Section 123 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973</ref>\n\nThere are three broad classifications of schools in Scotland<ref>[https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7819 House of Commons Library - Schools in Scotland]</ref>: \n\n* '''State-funded schools''': These are schools under the management of an education authority. Theses schools do not charge fees to attend and have no entrance restrictions. Both denominational and non-denominational schools fall within this category. In the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 they are also referred to as 'public schools' (not to be confused with the other meaning of [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n* '''Grant-Aided schools''': Grant-Aided schools are independent of their education authority and can decide on their own governance, but are directly funded by the [[Scottish Government|Scottish Ministers]]. There is one mainstream Grant-Aided school in Scotland, [[Jordanhill School]], formerly linked to [[Jordanhill College of Education]]. The remaining seven Grant-Aided schools are [[special schools]], which are Capability Scotland: Corseford School, Capability Scotland: Stanmore House School, [[Donaldson's School]], East Park School, Harmeny School, the [[Royal Blind School]] and the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments (Craighalbert Centre). Despite their status, several of these schools are members of the [[Scottish Council of Independent Schools]].\n\n* '''Independent schools''': Independent schools are schools that are not under management of an education authority and do not receive direct state funding. To qualify as a school, it must provide full-time education for at least five pupils of school age. Schools of this type are required to register and are subject to inspections by [[Education Scotland|Her Majesty's inspectors]]. Most are members of the [[Scottish Council of Independent Schools]]. One independent school, [[St Mary's Music School]], receives Aided Places (similar to the abolished [[Assisted Places Scheme]]) where fees can be paid by the Scottish Ministers.\n\n===School naming=== \n[[File:Marr College, Troon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marr College]] in [[Troon]], [[South Ayrshire]], carries the name College rather than High School or Academy]]\nThere is not a set name for secondary schools in Scotland, but whatever they might be called, with just a few specific exceptions in mainly rural or island authorities, state secondary schools in Scotland are fully [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] and non-selective. Amongst the state-run secondary schools:\n\n* 188 are nominally ''High Schools''. These are spread across the country. Almost all Catholic secondaries are high schools, with the majority of the other names being non-denominational schools. For example, in West Dunbartonshire, the non-denominational schools are Vale of Leven, Dumbarton, and Clydebank Academies while the Catholic schools are Our Lady & Saint Patrick's High School and St Peter the Apostle's High School.\n* 131 are nominally ''Academies''. These are spread across the country but are in high concentration in North-East Scotland and Ayrshire, an example is [[Banchory Academy]]. There are also three Royal Academies, in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]]; [[Tain]]; and [[Inverness]].\n* 15 are nominally ''Secondary Schools'' (colloquially abbreviated to \"secondaries\").\n* 14 are nominally ''Grammar Schools''. Most of these schools were defined as [[grammar schools]] under a previous (now dissolved) system but their names remain. Popular areas for grammar schools are [[Argyll and Bute]], East Lothian and [[South Lanarkshire]].\n* 13 are simply ''Schools''. These schools cater for Primary as well as Secondary school children. They are found in rural areas or islands.\n* 8 are ''Junior High Schools''. These schools are found exclusively in the [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] Islands. They cater for school children from P1 to S4.\n* 4 are ''Colleges''. These include [[Madras College]] (in [[St Andrews]], Fife), [[Marr College]] (in [[Troon]], [[South Ayrshire]]) and [[St Joseph's College, Dumfries|St Joseph's College]] (in [[Dumfries]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]]).\n\nOther schools include The Community School of Auchterarder, [[Auchterarder]], [[Perth and Kinross]]; The Nicolson Institute, [[Stornoway]], [[Western Isles]]; North Walls Community School on [[Hoy]], [[Orkney Islands]] and Wester Hailes Education Centre, [[Wester Hailes]], Edinburgh. All of these are, equally, fully comprehensive non-selective schools, differing only in designation from all other state secondary schools in Scotland.\n\n==School provision==\n\n===National Curriculum===\n{{Main|Curriculum for Excellence}}\nIn 2003, work began on an education reform programme, to produce a new ''[[Curriculum for Excellence]]'' that would replace existing guidance on the school curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp |title=How was the curriculum developed: Process of change: Timeline About Curriculum for Excellence |publisher=Education Scotland |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113301/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Curriculum for Excellence was launched in Scottish secondary schools from school session 2012\u20132013.\n\nIn 2017, new reforms were introduced moving control over curriculum and schools more towards head teachers and parents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-and-tories-back-john-swinney-s-school-reforms-1-4489307|title=SNP and Tories back John Swinney\u2019s school reforms|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628201324/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-and-tories-back-john-swinney-s-school-reforms-1-4489307|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religion in schools===\nThe vast majority of schools are non-[[Religious denomination|denominational]], and include the parish schools, pioneered by the Church of Scotland and other Protestant Churches, which became state schools in 1872.

Of over 2,500 schools in Scotland, there are 366 state schools which are Roman Catholic, three Episcopalian and one Jewish. The [[Education (Scotland) Act 1918]] brought Roman Catholic schools within the State education system, ensuring the promotion of a Roman Catholic ethos within such schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs|title=Frequently Asked Questions|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|date=1 April 2003|website=www.gov.scot|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721174221/http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n\n==Attainment==\n\nIn 2015, the Scottish Government launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge which aims to achieve equity in educational outcomes throughout Scotland.

The [[Scotland Act 1998]] gives the [[Scottish Parliament]] legislative control over all education matters, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 is the principal legislation governing education in Scotland. Traditionally, the Scottish system at secondary school level has emphasised breadth across a range of subjects, while the [[Education in England|English]], [[Education in Wales|Welsh]] and [[Education in Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] systems have emphasised greater depth of education over a smaller range of subjects.\n\nFollowing this, [[List of universities in Scotland|Scottish universities]] generally have courses a year longer (typically 4 years) than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK, though it is often possible for students to take more advanced specialised exams and join the courses at the second year. One unique aspect is that the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] issue a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] as the first [[academic degree|degree]] in [[humanities]]. State schools are owned and operated by the [[local government of Scotland|local authorities]] which act as ''Education Authorities'', and the compulsory phase is divided into primary school and secondary school (often called high school). Schools are supported in delivering learning and teaching by [[Education Scotland]] (formerly [[Learning and Teaching Scotland]]). There are also private schools across the country, although the distribution is uneven with [[List of independent schools in Scotland|such schools]] in 22 of the 32 Local Authority areas. At September 2011 the total pupil population in Scotland was 702,104, of which 31,425 pupils, or 4.5%, were being educated in independent schools.<ref>Scottish independent schools \"Pupil Number Comparisons by Local Authority Area 2011/12\" http://www.scis.org.uk/assets/files/2011%20Local%20Authority%20comparisons%20by%20region.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 21 February 2012</ref>\n\nQualifications at the secondary school and [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] ([[further education]]) level are provided by the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]], which is the national awarding and accrediting body in Scotland, and delivered through various schools, colleges and other centres.

Children born between March and August start school in August at between 5 and 5\u00bd years old, and those born between September and February start school in the previous August at between age 4\u00bd and 4 years 11 months years old. The Scottish system is the most flexible in the UK, however, as parents of children born between September and December can decide to defer for 1 year (but may or may not receive a funded nursery place in the deferral year), whilst children born between January and February can opt to hold their child back a year and let them start school the following August, with guaranteed nursery funding. This usually allows those not ready for formal education to have an extra year at an early years centre (formerly known as nursery).\n\nPupils remain at primary school for seven years. Then aged eleven or twelve, they start secondary school for a compulsory four years with the following two years being optional. In Scotland, pupils sit National 4/5 exams (previously [[Standard Grade]] or [[Intermediate exams]]) at the age of fifteen/sixteen, normally for between 6 and eight subjects including compulsory exams in English and Mathematics. A Science subject (Physics, Biology or Chemistry) and a Social Subject (Geography, History or Modern Studies) were also compulsory, but this was changed in accordance with the new curriculum. It is now required by the Scottish Parliament for students to have two hours of physical education a week; each school may vary these compulsory combinations. The school leaving age is generally sixteen (after completion of National 4/5s), after which students may choose to remain at school and study for [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] and/or [[Advanced Higher (Scottish)|Advanced Higher]] exams.\n\nA small number of students at certain private, [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] may follow the [[Education in England|English system]] and study towards [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] instead of National 4/5s (Standard Grades), and towards [[GCE Advanced Level|A and AS-Levels]] instead of (or alongside) Higher Grade and Advanced Higher exams. The [[International Baccalaureate]] has also been introduced in some independent schools.\n\nThe table below lists rough equivalences with the year system in the rest of the United Kingdom (For England and Wales, the equivalence given is for children born before 1 September; the equivalence for those born from September to February [December for deferred pupils] is given in brackets):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

For children born between 1 March and 30 September, this date is 31 May of their 4th year of secondary school.  For children born between 1 October and 28 February, the last day of June is the first date they may leave school if they have a placement at college and the school have signed the health & safety forms.\n\nWhich high school the children go to depends on the area where they live, known as the \"[[catchment area]]\", which has a specific high school that takes children who live in that area.\n\nParents can also apply for a placement request if they would like their child to attend a school outside their catchment area and a panel will decide if the child is the most worthy (out of all placing requests) to take one of the spaces left after all children from the catchment area have been taken.\n\nThe table below lists list the numbers of children, schools and teachers in all publicly funded schools:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0044/00443414.pdf |title=Summary Statistics for Schools in Scotland, No.4 \u00a6 2013 Edition |publisher=Scottish Government |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!

S4\n! S5\n!

Generally, most pupils take National 4/5s (previously [[Standard Grade]]s, but some schools offered Intermediates instead) in S3-S4, and [[Higher (Scottish)|Highers]] in S5. The number of National 4/5 qualifications a pupil enters can vary drastically depending on the individual, with the most common number of National 5s taken, per pupil, in 2017 being 6,<ref>https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/files_ccc/ASR2017_National5.xls</ref> however some may choose to undertake as few as one or two, or as many as eight or nine. For those who wish to remain at school for the final year (S6), more Highers and [[Advanced Higher]]s (formerly [[CSYS]]) in S6 can be taken. Previous qualifications [[Intermediate 1]] and [[Intermediate 2]] \u2013 were intended to be roughly equivalent to General and Credit Level Standard Grades respectively.\n\nPupils can go to university at the end of S5, as Highers provide the entry requirements for Scottish universities where degrees are normally four years long; however, recently it is more common for students to remain until S6, taking further Highers and/or taking Advanced Highers. The majority of English universities, the most popular choice for Scottish students who wish to study university degrees outside of Scotland, require Advanced Higher qualification levels as these are deemed by the English universities to be most similar to A-levels.\n\n==Secondary schools==\n\nSecondary education is provided by a number of [[secondary school]]s throughout Scotland, both in the state and independent sector. The vast majority of schools in the state sector are administered directly by the local Education Authority, which is synonymous with the 32 councils used for local government. <ref>Section 123 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973</ref>\n\nThere are three broad classifications of schools in Scotland<ref>[https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7819 House of Commons Library - Schools in Scotland]</ref>: \n\n* '''State-funded schools''': These are schools under the management of an education authority. Theses schools do not charge fees to attend and have no entrance restrictions. Both denominational and non-denominational schools fall within this category. In the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 they are also referred to as 'public schools' (not to be confused with the other meaning of [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n* '''Grant-Aided schools''': Grant-Aided schools are independent of their education authority and can decide on their own governance, but are directly funded by the [[Scottish Government|Scottish Ministers]]. There is one mainstream Grant-Aided school in Scotland, [[Jordanhill School]], formerly linked to [[Jordanhill College of Education]]. The remaining seven Grant-Aided schools are [[special schools]], which are Capability Scotland: Corseford School, Capability Scotland: Stanmore House School, [[Donaldson's School]], East Park School, Harmeny School, the [[Royal Blind School]] and the Scottish Centre for Children with Motor Impairments (Craighalbert Centre). Despite their status, several of these schools are members of the [[Scottish Council of Independent Schools]].\n\n* '''Independent schools''': Independent schools are schools that are not under management of an education authority and do not receive direct state funding. To qualify as a school, it must provide full-time education for at least five pupils of school age. Schools of this type are required to register and are subject to inspections by [[Education Scotland|Her Majesty's inspectors]]. Most are members of the [[Scottish Council of Independent Schools]]. One independent school, [[St Mary's Music School]], receives Aided Places (similar to the abolished [[Assisted Places Scheme]]) where fees can be paid by the Scottish Ministers.\n\n===School naming=== \n[[File:Marr College, Troon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marr College]] in [[Troon]], [[South Ayrshire]], carries the name College rather than High School or Academy]]\nThere is not a set name for secondary schools in Scotland, but whatever they might be called, with just a few specific exceptions in mainly rural or island authorities, state secondary schools in Scotland are fully [[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] and non-selective. Amongst the state-run secondary schools:\n\n* 188 are nominally ''High Schools''. These are spread across the country. Almost all Catholic secondaries are high schools, with the majority of the other names being non-denominational schools. For example, in West Dunbartonshire, the non-denominational schools are Vale of Leven, Dumbarton, and Clydebank Academies while the Catholic schools are Our Lady & Saint Patrick's High School and St Peter the Apostle's High School.\n* 131 are nominally ''Academies''. These are spread across the country but are in high concentration in North-East Scotland and Ayrshire, an example is [[Banchory Academy]]. There are also three Royal Academies, in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire]]; [[Tain]]; and [[Inverness]].\n* 15 are nominally ''Secondary Schools'' (colloquially abbreviated to \"secondaries\").\n* 14 are nominally ''Grammar Schools''. Most of these schools were defined as [[grammar schools]] under a previous (now dissolved) system but their names remain. Popular areas for grammar schools are [[Argyll and Bute]], East Lothian and [[South Lanarkshire]].\n* 13 are simply ''Schools''. These schools cater for Primary as well as Secondary school children. They are found in rural areas or islands.\n* 8 are ''Junior High Schools''. These schools are found exclusively in the [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]] Islands. They cater for school children from P1 to S4.\n* 4 are ''Colleges''. These include [[Madras College]] (in [[St Andrews]], Fife), [[Marr College]] (in [[Troon]], [[South Ayrshire]]) and [[St Joseph's College, Dumfries|St Joseph's College]] (in [[Dumfries]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]]).\n\nOther schools include The Community School of Auchterarder, [[Auchterarder]], [[Perth and Kinross]]; The Nicolson Institute, [[Stornoway]], [[Western Isles]]; North Walls Community School on [[Hoy]], [[Orkney Islands]] and Wester Hailes Education Centre, [[Wester Hailes]], Edinburgh. All of these are, equally, fully comprehensive non-selective schools, differing only in designation from all other state secondary schools in Scotland.\n\n==School provision==\n\n===National Curriculum===\n{{Main|Curriculum for Excellence}}\nIn 2003, work began on an education reform programme, to produce a new ''[[Curriculum for Excellence]]'' that would replace existing guidance on the school curriculum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp |title=How was the curriculum developed: Process of change: Timeline About Curriculum for Excellence |publisher=Education Scotland |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113301/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/thecurriculum/whatiscurriculumforexcellence/howwasthecurriculumdeveloped/processofchange/timeline.asp |archivedate=26 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Curriculum for Excellence was launched in Scottish secondary schools from school session 2012\u20132013.\n\nIn 2017, new reforms were introduced moving control over curriculum and schools more towards head teachers and parents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-and-tories-back-john-swinney-s-school-reforms-1-4489307|title=SNP and Tories back John Swinney\u2019s school reforms|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628201324/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-and-tories-back-john-swinney-s-school-reforms-1-4489307|archivedate=28 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Religion in schools===\nThe vast majority of schools are non-[[Religious denomination|denominational]], and include the parish schools, pioneered by the Church of Scotland and other Protestant Churches, which became state schools in 1872.

Of over 2,500 schools in Scotland, there are 366 state schools which are Roman Catholic, three Episcopalian and one Jewish. The [[Education (Scotland) Act 1918]] brought Roman Catholic schools within the State education system, ensuring the promotion of a Roman Catholic ethos within such schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs|title=Frequently Asked Questions|first=Scottish Government, St. Andrew's House, Regent Road, Edinburgh EH1 3DG Tel:0131 556 8400|last=ceu@scotland.gsi.gov.uk|date=1 April 2003|website=www.gov.scot|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721174221/http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Education/Schools/FAQs|archivedate=21 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n\n==Attainment==\n\nIn 2015, the Scottish Government launched the Scottish Attainment Challenge which aims to achieve equity in educational outcomes throughout Scotland.

themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez / El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters.

Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreate their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.<ref name=thewrap>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |title=\u2018Westworld': How Jeffrey Wright Learned About Bernard\u2019s Big Twist |publisher=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216220247/https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Arnold had come to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] his already life-like creations, and made it his goal to bring the Westworld hosts to full sentience, with Dolores as his test bed. When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he loves Dolores, he can't live with what she's made him do, and what she's going to make him do. He makes the choice to shoot himself in the head. Dolores later uploads him to the Sublime, believing he deserves a better place.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]]. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/13/westworld-cast|title=HBO's ''Westworld'' adds cast|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lee Sizemore===\n'''Lee Sizemore''' is portrayed by [[Simon Quarterman]].

She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld.\n\nIn the past, the host played the role of '''El Lazo''', an outlaw who encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\nLawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black. However, in trying to convince her father to come with her for medical help, William still believes she is a host, part of Dr. Ford's game, and kills her.\n\nA '''host replica of Emily Grace''' is introduced in season 2. In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]]. Introduced in season 2, he is a host and a Ghost Nation elder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/zahn-mcclarnon-hospitalized-head-injury-westworld-season-2-1202606667/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Actor Zahn McClarnon Hospitalized, Season 2 Production Paused|last=Stedman|first=Alex|work=Variety|date=November 3, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"S2Recurring\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/westworld-recurring-cast-season-2-1202361538/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Rounds Out Recurring Cast Ahead Of Season 2|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> He has a fearsome reputation in the park, leading raiding parties and taking hosts prisoner. It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb opts to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. He is also portrayed by co-star Zane Rudert as a child and co-star Zane Rudert as a young man. Introduced in season 3, he and his brother Jean were the creators of the [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon aimed to predict and control humanity to prevent major catastrophes, after both had witnessed the nuclear destruction of Paris as teenagers. For seed data, they had to partner with Incite, Inc. and its CEO, Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), who only saw the financial benefit of their system. The system had come to identify individuals that were high-risk that would disrupt humanity if left in the system, including Jean, and Serac created reeducation centers to house these people. Later, he was forced to strip Dempsey Sr. of access to the system and then later kill him, leaving his son Liam Jr. as a figurehead in charge of Incite. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. While he is a trillionaire, he has since made himself nearly invisible to all information detection.\n\nWhen Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2. Serac intends to use the guest data from Westworld to expand Rehoboam's capabilities and use it to protect humanity from itself.\n\nAccording to Cassel, \"Serac\" is French for \"a fault in the ice\", whereas \"Engerraund\" is an atypical Scottish given name in families with long histories.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/westworld-season-3-episode-5-vincent-cassel-burning-questions-1234577697/ | title = \u2018Westworld\u2019: Vincent Cassel Answers 5 Burning Questions From Season 3 Episode 5 | first= Will | last = Thorne | date = April 12, 2020 | accessdate = April 13, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1;

themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez / El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreate their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.<ref name=thewrap>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |title=\u2018Westworld': How Jeffrey Wright Learned About Bernard\u2019s Big Twist |publisher=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216220247/https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Arnold had come to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] his already life-like creations, and made it his goal to bring the Westworld hosts to full sentience, with Dolores as his test bed. When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he loves Delores, he can't live with what she's made him do, and what she's going to make him do. He makes the choice to shoot himself in the head. Dolores later uploads him to the Sublime, believing he deserves a better place.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]]. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/13/westworld-cast|title=HBO's ''Westworld'' adds cast|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lee Sizemore===\n'''Lee Sizemore''' is portrayed by [[Simon Quarterman]].

She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld.\n\nIn the past, the host played the role of '''El Lazo''', an outlaw who encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\nLawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black.

In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]].

It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb opts to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. He is also portrayed by co-star Zane Rudert as a child and co-star Zane Rudert as a young man. Introduced in season 3, he and his brother Jean were the creators of the [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon aimed to predict and control humanity to prevent major catastrophes, after both had witnessed the nuclear destruction of Paris as teenagers. For seed data, they had to partner with Incite, Inc. and its CEO, Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), who only saw the financial benefit of their system. The system had come to identify individuals that were high-risk that would disrupt humanity if left in the system, including Jean, and Serac created reeducation centers to house these people. Later, he was forced to strip Dempsey Sr. of access to the system and then later kill him, leaving his son Liam Jr. as a figurehead in charge of Incite. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. While he is a trillionaire, he has since made himself nearly invisible to all information detection.\n\nWhen Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2. Serac intends to use the guest data from Westworld to expand Rehoboam's capabilities and use it to protect humanity from itself.\n\nAccording to Cassel, \"Serac\" is French for \"a fault in the ice\", whereas \"Engerraund\" is an atypical Scottish given name in families with long histories.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/westworld-season-3-episode-5-vincent-cassel-burning-questions-1234577697/ | title = \u2018Westworld\u2019: Vincent Cassel Answers 5 Burning Questions From Season 3 Episode 5 | first= Will | last = Thorne | date = April 12, 2020 | accessdate = April 13, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1;

Its other borders roughly correspond to Stockport Road, Hathersage Road, Moss Lane East and Boundary Lane. Neighbouring districts are [[Hulme]] to the west, [[Ardwick]] to the east and [[Victoria Park, Manchester|Victoria Park]], [[Rusholme]] and [[Moss Side]] to the south. A large portion of the district along [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] is occupied by the campuses of the [[University of Manchester]], [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]]. To the south of the university's Oxford Road campus a considerable area is occupied by a group of contiguous hospitals including [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]], to the west of which is [[Whitworth Park]].\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Manchester}}\n[[File:Kro Bar, Manchester 1.jpg|upright|Kro Bar, 325 Oxford Road|thumb]]\n[[File:Student Health Centre, Chorlton-on-Medlock.jpg|thumb|upright|Waterloo Place, 176-188 Oxford Road]]\nIn [[medieval]] times, the district was known as Chorlton Row and was a [[township (England)|township]] of the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|ancient parish of Manchester]] in the [[Salford (hundred)|Salford Hundred]] of Lancashire. Towards the end of the 18th century, it developed as a residential suburb of Manchester and in the extreme north of the township a number of [[cotton mill]]s were established. In 1820 the parish church of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] was built. Development began in 1793\u201394 and most of the important streets were given impressive names, Oxford Street, Cambridge Street and Grosvenor Street.\n\nOver the following 30 years residential development spread southwards as far as Tuer Street: and by the mid-1840s to High Street. Few dwellings of that period remain today apart from Waterloo Place, 323, 325, 327 & 333 Oxford Road, and [[Grove House, Manchester|Grove House]] (316\u2013324).<ref>Hartwell (2001)</ref>\n\nIn 1830, the town hall on Cavendish Street was built to the designs of Richard Lane. On the creation of the [[municipal borough]] of Manchester [[History of Manchester#Industrial and cultural growth|in 1838]] the township was absorbed into the borough. At this time the southern area was still partly rural with some larger dwellings of wealthy people (e.g., [[John Owens (merchant)|John Owens]] in Nelson Street). After the Poor Law Reform of 1834 the district became part of the Chorlton [[Poor Law Union]] and the offices of the Board of Guardians were built in Cavendish Street (these are now the Ormond Building of the Metropolitan University). The arrival of Owens College in 1873 was the beginning of a different kind of development leading to the academic campus of today.\n\nThough most of the township was originally middle class in character by the early 20th century it was very much a working class district. The housing conditions were described in 1931 by the Manchester and District Social Survey Society.<ref>Housing Group of the St James', Birch, Fellowship (1931) ''Some Housing Conditions in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester''.</ref>{{-}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:ManchesterMetUni-AllSaintsBldg-20070421.jpg|thumb|The All Saints Building on the Manchester Campus of the Metropolitan University]]\n[[Image:Mancunian Way UMIST.jpg|thumb|A view of the Mancunian Way elevated motorway near what was [[UMIST]] campus]]\nThe [[M postcode area|M13 postcode district]] includes both [[Ardwick]] and Chorlton on Medlock, although the area east of Boundary Lane and west of the [[University Dental Hospital of Manchester|Dental Hospital]] has a [[Hulme]] (M15) postcode, and [[Greenheys, Manchester|Greenheys]] is now in [[Moss Side]] ward rather than Chorlton on Medlock. The River Medlock is the boundary with [[Manchester city centre]], which includes the Sackville Street campus of the [[University of Manchester#Campus and facilities|University of Manchester]] (or \"North Campus\" rather than \"South Campus\"). A large area of Chorlton on Medlock south-west of this is occupied by the [[Manchester Metropolitan University]].\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring districts and places.'''\n|Northwest = [[Hulme]]\n|North     = [[Manchester|Manchester city centre]]\n|Northeast = [[Ardwick]]\n|West      = [[Hulme]]\n|Centre    = Chorlton-on-Medlock\n|East      = [[Gorton]]\n|Southwest = [[Moss Side]]\n|South     = [[Rusholme]]\n|Southeast = [[Rusholme]]\n}}\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Manchester Upper Brook Street geograph-3392290-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|Upper Brook Street]]\nChorlton on Medlock is crossed by the [[Mancunian Way]] (opened 1967), running west to east through its northern part. The main routes through the suburb to south Manchester are (west to east) Cambridge Street (leading to Higher Cambridge Street, Lloyd Street North and Upper Lloyd Street), Oxford Road (leading to [[Wilmslow Road]]; the busiest route, both for private and public transport), and Upper Brook Street (dual carriageway continuing from [[Princess Street, Manchester|Princess Street]] and leading to Anson Road).\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[Image:Royal Eye Hospital.jpg|thumb|Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, 1886\u20132009]]\n[[File:Chorlton New Mill - geograph.org.uk - 712931.jpg|Chorlton New Mill|thumb|left|upright]]\nThe front of the former Chorlton-upon-Medlock Town Hall can be seen at its original location on Cavendish Street at All Saints. The building, with its [[Doric order|Doric]] [[portico]], dates from 1830\u201331 and was designed by [[Richard Lane (architect)|Richard Lane]].<ref>Pevsner, ''The Buildings of England: South Lancashire''</ref> The original interior was removed and a new structure added to the rear in 1970. A red plaque on the building commemorates the Fifth [[Pan-African Congress]], which was held there from 15\u201321 October 1945. Decisions taken at that conference led to independence for a number of [[Africa]]n and [[Caribbean]] countries. In Nelson Street the former home of the [[Pankhurst]] family is now the [[Pankhurst Centre]]. The Ormond Building of the Manchester Metropolitan University was originally the home of the [[Chorlton Poor Law Union|Chorlton Union]] Board of Guardians (responsible under the 1834 [[Poor Law]] for most of what is now south Manchester). Next to the town hall building is the original building of the Manchester College of Art (1880\u201381: architect [[George T. Redmayne]]) in a [[Gothic revival]] style.\n\nFurther down Oxford Road are the University of Manchester (frontage built 1888\u20131902), the former [[Manchester Royal Eye Hospital]] (1886), [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]] (1908) and the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]] (1898\u20131908).\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Upper Brook Street Chapel 9.jpg|thumb|[[Upper Brook Street Chapel, Manchester|Welsh Baptist Chapel]], Upper Brook Street]]\nThe parish church of All Saints (1820) and the earlier Church of St Luke (founded before 1804 but a new church was built by John Lowe in 1865; part of Old Chorlton Hall was used as the rectory)<ref name=\"auto\">Fleetwood-Hesketh, Peter (1955) ''Murray's Lancashire Architectural Guide''.

Charlewood, 1884):<ref name=\"auto\"/> these have all been demolished apart from St Ambrose which was used by the University of Manchester as an Islamic prayer room but  the prayer room is now elsewhere.

St Augustine's, [[Sackville Street (Manchester)|Granby Row]] (demolished in 1908 to allow expansion at the [[UMIST|Municipal College of Technology]]) was replaced by a second St Augustine's in York Street, Chorlton-on-Medlock (ruined by German bombing in 1940 during World War II):<ref>York Street was until 1970 a street parallel to Oxford Road and running from the River Medlock to Rusholme Road (through the site afterwards used for New Broadcasting House, the BBC HQ).--Makepeace, Chris (1995) ''Looking Back at Hulme, Moss Side, Chorlton on Medlock & Ardwick''.

Its other borders roughly correspond to Stockport Road, Hathersage Road, Moss Lane East and Boundary Lane. Neighbouring districts are [[Hulme]] to the west, [[Ardwick]] to the east and [[Victoria Park, Manchester|Victoria Park]], [[Rusholme]] and [[Moss Side]] to the south. A large portion of the district along [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] is occupied by the campuses of the [[University of Manchester]], [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], and the [[Royal Northern College of Music]]. To the south of the university's Oxford Road campus a considerable area is occupied by a group of contiguous hospitals including [[Manchester Royal Infirmary]], to the west of which is [[Whitworth Park]].\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Manchester}}\n[[File:Kro Bar, Manchester 1.jpg|upright|Kro Bar, 325 Oxford Road|thumb]]\n[[File:Student Health Centre, Chorlton-on-Medlock.jpg|thumb|upright|Waterloo Place, 176-188 Oxford Road]]\nIn [[medieval]] times, the district was known as Chorlton Row and was a [[township (England)|township]] of the [[Manchester (ancient parish)|ancient parish of Manchester]] in the [[Salford (hundred)|Salford Hundred]] of Lancashire. Towards the end of the 18th century, it developed as a residential suburb of Manchester and in the extreme north of the township a number of [[cotton mill]]s were established. In 1820 the parish church of [[All Saints' Day|All Saints]] was built. Development began in 1793\u201394 and most of the important streets were given impressive names, Oxford Street, Cambridge Street and Grosvenor Street.\n\nOver the following 30 years residential development spread southwards as far as Tuer Street: and by the mid-1840s to High Street. Few dwellings of that period remain today apart from Waterloo Place, 323, 325, 327 & 333 Oxford Road, and [[Grove House, Manchester|Grove House]] (316\u2013324).<ref>Hartwell (2001)</ref>\n\nIn 1830, the town hall on Cavendish Street was built to the designs of Richard Lane. On the creation of the [[municipal borough]] of Manchester [[History of Manchester#Industrial and cultural growth|in 1838]] the township was absorbed into the borough. At this time the southern area was still partly rural with some larger dwellings of wealthy people (e.g., [[John Owens (merchant)|John Owens]] in Nelson Street). After the Poor Law Reform of 1834 the district became part of the Chorlton [[Poor Law Union]] and the offices of the Board of Guardians were built in Cavendish Street (these are now the Ormond Building of the Metropolitan University). The arrival of Owens College in 1873 was the beginning of a different kind of development leading to the academic campus of today.\n\nThough most of the township was originally middle class in character by the early 20th century it was very much a working class district. The housing conditions were described in 1931 by the Manchester and District Social Survey Society.<ref>Housing Group of the St James', Birch, Fellowship (1931) ''Some Housing Conditions in Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester''.</ref>{{-}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:ManchesterMetUni-AllSaintsBldg-20070421.jpg|thumb|The All Saints Building on the Manchester Campus of the Metropolitan University]]\n[[Image:Mancunian Way UMIST.jpg|thumb|A view of the Mancunian Way elevated motorway near what was [[UMIST]] campus]]\nThe [[M postcode area|M13 postcode district]] includes both [[Ardwick]] and Chorlton on Medlock, although the area east of Boundary Lane and west of the [[University Dental Hospital of Manchester|Dental Hospital]] has a [[Hulme]] (M15) postcode, and [[Greenheys, Manchester|Greenheys]] is now in [[Moss Side]] ward rather than Chorlton on Medlock. The River Medlock is the boundary with [[Manchester city centre]], which includes the Sackville Street campus of the [[University of Manchester#Campus and facilities|University of Manchester]] (or \"North Campus\" rather than \"South Campus\").

The main routes through the suburb to south Manchester are (west to east) Cambridge Street (leading to Higher Cambridge Street, Lloyd Street North and Upper Lloyd Street), Oxford Road (leading to [[Wilmslow Road]]; the busiest route, both for private and public transport), and Upper Brook Street (dual carriageway continuing from [[Princess Street, Manchester|Princess Street]] and leading to Anson Road).\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[Image:Royal Eye Hospital.jpg|thumb|Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, 1886\u20132009]]\n[[File:Chorlton New Mill - geograph.org.uk - 712931.jpg|Chorlton New Mill|thumb|left|upright]]\nThe front of the former Chorlton-upon-Medlock Town Hall can be seen at its original location on Cavendish Street at All Saints.

A red plaque on the building commemorates the Fifth [[Pan-African Congress]], which was held there from 15\u201321 October 1945. Decisions taken at that conference led to independence for a number of [[Africa]]n and [[Caribbean]] countries. In Nelson Street the former home of the [[Pankhurst]] family is now the [[Pankhurst Centre]]. The Ormond Building of the Manchester Metropolitan University was originally the home of the [[Chorlton Poor Law Union|Chorlton Union]] Board of Guardians (responsible under the 1834 [[Poor Law]] for most of what is now south Manchester). Next to the town hall building is the original building of the Manchester College of Art (1880\u201381: architect [[George T.
