As the ship burned wood, which was scarce where the Navy was operating, the Navy turned the ship over to the [[Union Army]] for use at [[Fort Pulaski]] on the Georgia coast. In 1863 Smalls was appointed captain of ''Planter'', the first black man to command a United States ship, and served in that position until 1866.\n\n==Service under the Confederacy==\n''Planter'' was a [[sidewheel steamer]] built at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1860 that was used by the Confederacy as an armed [[dispatch boat]] and transport attached to the engineer department at Charleston, under Brigadier General [[Roswell Ripley]], CSA.\n\n===Robert Smalls, pilot===\nAt 04:00 on 13 May 1862, while her captain, C. J. Relyea, was absent on shore, [[Robert Smalls]], a [[slave]] who was ''Planter''{{'}}s pilot, quietly took the ship from the wharf, and with a [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] flying, steamed past the successive Confederate forts.  He saluted the installation as usual by blowing the steam whistle.

As the ship burned wood, which was scarce where the Navy was operating, the Navy turned the ship over to the [[Union Army]] for use at [[Fort Pulaski]] on the Georgia coast. In 1863 Smalls was appointed captain of ''Planter'', the first black man to command a United States ship, and served in that position until 1866.\n\n==Service under the Confederacy==\n''Planter'' was a [[sidewheel steamer]] built at [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1860 that was used by the Confederacy as an armed [[dispatch boat]] and transport attached to the engineer department at Charleston, under Brigadier General [[Roswell Ripley]], CSA.\n\n===Robert Smalls, pilot===\nAt 04:00 on 13 May 1862, while her captain, C. J. Relyea, was absent on shore, [[Robert Smalls]], a [[slave]] who was ''Planter''{{'}}s pilot, quietly took the ship from the wharf, and with a [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] flying, steamed past the successive Confederate forts.  He saluted the installation as usual by blowing the steam whistle. As soon as the steamer was out of range of the last Confederate gun, Smalls hauled down the Confederate flag and hoisted a white one. Then he turned ''Planter'' over to the {{USS|Onward|1852|6}} of the Union blockading force.\n\nBesides Smalls, ''Planter'' carried 15 other slaves to freedom behind Union lines: seven crewmen, five women, and three children.

The populations of rural areas of the country have been the hardest hit. Teen abuse of opioids has been noticeably increasing since 2006, using prescription drugs more than any illicit drug except [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]; more than [[cocaine]], heroin, and [[methamphetamine]] combined. The crisis has also changed moral, social, and cultural resistance to street drug alternatives such as heroin.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has been described as a uniquely American problem, where prescription rates alone are 40 percent higher than in other developed countries. This has made it one of the worst drug crises in American history, causing more deaths annually than car crashes or guns, and leaving many children orphaned. As a result, the government began cracking down on pharmacists and doctors who were over-prescribing opioid painkillers.\n\nIn 2011, the [[Obama Administration|Obama administration]] began to deal with the crisis, and in 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] authorized millions of dollars in funding for opioid research and treatment, followed by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] director, Dr. [[Thomas Frieden]], stating that \"America is awash in opioids; urgent action is critical.\"  Soon after, many state governors declared a \"state of emergency\" to combat the opioid epidemic in their own states, and undertook major efforts to stop it. In July 2017, opioid addiction was cited as the \"[<nowiki/>[[Food and Drug Administration]]'s] biggest crisis\", followed by President [[Donald Trump]] declaring the opioid crisis a \"national emergency.\" In September 2019, he ordered U.S. mail carriers to block shipments of the most powerful and dangerous opioid, fentanyl, coming from other countries.\n\n==Background==\n[[Opioid]]s are a diverse class of moderately strong, addictive, and inexpensive drugs, which include [[opiate]]s (i.e., morphine and heroin), [[oxycodone]] ([[OxyContin]], [[oxycodone/paracetamol|Percocet]]), [[hydrocodone]] ([[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Vicodin]], [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Norco]]), and [[fentanyl]]. Traditionally, opioids have been prescribed for pain management, as they are effective for treating acute pain but are less effective for treating chronic pain.

Opioids by themselves put older people at risk of respiratory depression and impaired ability to operate vehicles and other machinery.

The populations of rural areas of the country have been the hardest hit. Teen abuse of opioids has been noticeably increasing since 2006, using prescription drugs more than any illicit drug except [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]; more than [[cocaine]], heroin, and [[methamphetamine]] combined. The crisis has also changed moral, social, and cultural resistance to street drug alternatives such as heroin.\n\nThe opioid epidemic has been described as a uniquely American problem, where prescription rates alone are 40 percent higher than in other developed countries. This has made it one of the worst drug crises in American history, causing more deaths annually than car crashes or guns, and leaving many children orphaned. As a result, the government began cracking down on pharmacists and doctors who were over-prescribing opioid painkillers.\n\nIn 2011, the [[Obama Administration|Obama administration]] began to deal with the crisis, and in 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] authorized millions of dollars in funding for opioid research and treatment, followed by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control]] director, Dr. [[Thomas Frieden]], stating that \"America is awash in opioids; urgent action is critical.\"  Soon after, many state governors declared a \"state of emergency\" to combat the opioid epidemic in their own states, and undertook major efforts to stop it. In July 2017, opioid addiction was cited as the \"[<nowiki/>[[Food and Drug Administration]]'s] biggest crisis\", followed by President [[Donald Trump]] declaring the opioid crisis a \"national emergency.\" In September 2019, he ordered U.S. mail carriers to block shipments of the most powerful and dangerous opioid, fentanyl, coming from other countries.\n\n==Background==\n[[Opioid]]s are a diverse class of moderately strong, addictive, and inexpensive drugs, which include [[opiate]]s (i.e., morphine and heroin), [[oxycodone]] ([[OxyContin]], [[oxycodone/paracetamol|Percocet]]), [[hydrocodone]] ([[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Vicodin]], [[Hydrocodone/paracetamol|Norco]]), and [[fentanyl]]. Traditionally, opioids have been prescribed for pain management, as they are effective for treating acute pain but are less effective for treating chronic pain.

It is given in combination with Naloxone because Naloxone works as an [[opioid antagonist]], meaning it will block the effects of the opioid medication. This combination drug can help by reducing a person's withdrawal symptoms while they are discontinuing opioids after a period of chronic use.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nWhile Suboxone is indicated for the treatment of opioid dependence, it does contain an opioid which means a person may be at risk of developing dependence to it as well.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n====Behavioral treatment====\nBehavioral treatment is less effective without medical treatment during the initial [[detoxification]]. It has similarly been shown that medical treatments tend to get better results when accompanied by behavioral treatment.<ref name=\":1\" /> For opioid dependence, popular non-pharmacological treatment options include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[Group therapy|group]] or [[Individual therapy|individual]] therapy, [[residential treatment center]]s, and [[twelve-step program]]s such as [[Narcotics Anonymous]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Since addictive behavior is a learned behavior in opioid dependence, cognitive behavioral therapy aims to promote positive motivation to change that behavior.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK143185/|title=Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence|date=2009|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241547543|series=WHO Guidelines Approved by the Guidelines Review Committee|location=Geneva|pmid=23762965}}</ref><!-- Citation needed --> Studies such as the [[Rat Park]] series indicate that a greater focus on improving the environments of those with opioid use disorders could also be beneficial.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hall |first=Harriet |name-list-format=vanc |author-link=Harriet Hall |date=2019 |title=Opioids: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=19\u201321}}</ref>\n\n===Harm reduction===\n[[Harm reduction]] programs operate under the understanding that certain levels of drug use are inevitable and focus on minimizing adverse effects associated with drug use rather than stopping the behavior itself. In the context of the opioid epidemic, harm reduction strategies are designed to improve health outcomes and reduce overdose deaths.<ref name=\":9\" /> Because many pain sufferers are also depressed, a challenge of harm reduction is that some applications, such as the use of drugs to reverse or avoid opioid overdose can nullify the effects of antidepressant medications which depend on the natural human opioid system.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Barglow |first=Peter |name-list-format=vanc |date=July\u2013August 2019 |title=Confessions of an American Opium-Prescriber |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/2019/07/confessions-of-an-american-opium-prescriber/ |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=53\u201356 |archive-urlhttp://archive.is/ud97s= |archive-date=6 March 2020 |access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Naloxone====\n[[Naloxone]] (most commonly sold under the brand name Narcan) can be used as a rescue medication for opioid overdose or as a preventive measure for those wanting to stop using opiates. It is an [[opioid antagonist]], meaning it binds to [[opioid receptor]]s, which prevents them from being activated by opiates. It binds more strongly than other drugs, so that when someone is overdosing on opioids, naloxone can be administered, allowing it to take the place of the opioid drug in the person's receptors, turning them off. This blocks the effect of the receptors.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany states have made Narcan available for purchase without a prescription. Additionally, police officers in many districts have begun carrying Narcan on a routine basis.<!-- Needs citation  -->\n\nTake-home naloxone overdose prevention kits have shown promise in areas exhibiting rapid increases in opioid overdoses and deaths due to the increased availability of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. Many counties offer Narcan training programs with the aim of educating the surrounding community on how to use Narcan.

Animation studio [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] wanted to duplicate the success their competitors [[Filmation]] were having with ''The Archie Show''. After a failed attempt at developing a teenage-music-band show of their own called ''[[Scooby-Doo|Mysteries Five]]'' (which eventually became ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]''), they decided to go to the source and contacted Archie Comics about possibly adapting one of their remaining properties into a show similar to ''The Archie Show''. Archie and Hanna-Barbera collaborated to adapt Archie's ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie]]'' comic book into a music-based property about a teenage music band, adding new characters (Alan M. and Valerie) while dismissing others.<ref>Shirley, Ian (2005).

From left to right: Melody, Josie, Valerie, Alan, Alexandra and Alexander.]]\n\n===The music===\n{{Main article|Josie and the Pussycats (album)}}\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera began working on putting together a real-life [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] girl group, who would provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also record an album of songs to be used both as radio singles and in the TV series.\n\nThe Josie and the Pussycats recordings were produced by La La Productions, run by Danny Janssen and Bobby Young (a pseudonym for Bob Engemann of The Lettermen vocal group). They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability; early plans, which did not come to fruition, called for a live-action Pussycats segment at the end of each episode.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sue Sheridan |url=http://donosdump.com/Jozine/SueSharidan.html |title=Sue Sheridan liner notes |publisher=Donosdump.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}</ref> After interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Kathleen Dougherty (Cathy Dougher) as Josie, [[Cheryl Ladd|Cherie Moor]] (later known as Cheryl Ladd) as Melody, and [[Patrice Holloway]] as Valerie.\n\nJanssen presented the newly formed band to [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] to finalize the production deal. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast Holloway, because they had decided to portray \"Josie and the Pussycats\" as an all-white trio and had altered Valerie, who had been conceived as [[black]] and was already appearing as such in Archie Comics' revamped ''Josie and the Pussycats'' comic book, to make her white. Janssen refused to recast Holloway and threatened to walk away from the project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented, allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being black.<ref>Liner notes from ''Josie and the Pussycats: Stop Look and Listen: The Capitol Recordings'' [CD Set]. Burbank: Rhino Handmade. Text available at http://www.geocities.com/antlion7/josie.htm.</ref> The Valerie character was the first black female character on a regular Saturday morning cartoon series. ''[[The Hardy Boys (1969 TV series)|The Hardy Boys]]'' drummer Pete Jones had been the first black male to appear on Saturday mornings a year earlier.\n\nOf the songs that were broadcast, Patrice Holloway sang lead on the series' theme song, \"You've Come A Long Way, Baby\", \"Voodoo\", \"It's All Right With Me\", \"The Handclapping Song\", \"Stop, Look And Listen\", \"Clock On The Wall\" and \"Every Beat Of My Heart\".  Holloway was the primary lead vocalist on \"Roadrunner\" which also features verses sung by Kathleen Dougherty and Cheryl Ladd.  Ladd sang lead on \"Inside, Outside, Upside-Down\", \"Dream Maker\", \"I Wanna Make You Happy\", \"The Time To Love\", \"I Love You Too Much\", \"Lie! Lie! Lie!\" and \"Dreaming\".  According to songwriter/vocal arranger Sue Sheridan (known as Sue Steward at the time), Dougherty felt she was stronger on harmony than lead and ceded her spotlight to Ladd.  Essentially then, Josie was the group leader but Valerie and Melody provided the trio with its singing voices. \n\n===Theme song===\nThe show's theme song, titled \"Josie and the Pussycats\", was written by [[Hoyt Curtin]], [[William Hanna]] (under the pseudonym \"Denby Williams\")  and [[Joseph Barbera]] (under the pseudonym \"Joseph Roland\").  The theme song was based on melodies from an incidental tune that had been played on various Hanna-Barbera cartoons since ''[[The Jetsons]]''.\n\nA cover of \"Josie and the Pussycats\" performed by [[Juliana Hatfield]] and [[Tanya Donelly]] is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]].<ref>CD liner notes: ''Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits'', 1995 MCA Records</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n''Josie and the Pussycats'' debuted on the [[CBS]] [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup on September 12, 1970, with the episode \"The Nemo's a No-No Affair\". The animated version of ''Josie'' was an amalgam of plot devices, villain types, settings, moods, and tones from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Space Ghost]]'', and ''[[Shazzan]]''.\n\nLike ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'', ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was originally broadcast with a [[laugh track]]. Later home video and DVD releases omit the laugh track. [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], however, have aired the show its original broadcast format with laughter intact.\n\n===Plot===\nEach episode found the Pussycats and crew en route to perform a gig or record a song in some exotic location where, somehow, often due to something Alexandra did, they became mixed up in an adventure. The antagonist was always a diabolical mad scientist, spy, or criminal who wanted to take over the world using some high-tech device. The Pussycats usually found themselves in possession of the plans for an invention, an item of interest to the villains, a secret spy message, etc., and the villains chased them to retrieve it. Eventually, the Pussycats would ruin the villain's plans, resulting in a final chase sequence set to a Pussycats song.  With the villain captured, the Pussycats would return to their gig or recording session, and the final gag was always one of Alexandra's failed attempts to interfere with the Pussycats' performance or steal Alan away from Josie.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Josephine \"Josie\" McCoy''' (voiced by [[Janet Waldo]]/sung by Cathy Dougher) - The red-headed lead singer, songwriter, guitarist and leader of the band. Josie shares an attraction with Alan, the road manager.  During the 1970s, the character was known as Josie James. A different actress, Judy Waithe, was originally cast as the voice of Josie. Waithe he was dismissed and replaced by Waldo before the show debuted as her readings of the ''Josie and the Pussycats'' hosted ''[[In the News|In the Know]]'' interstitials were not to CBS' liking.<ref>{{Cite podcast |url=https://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2011 |title=PROGRAM 231 - 5/25/11 |website=Stu's Show |publisher=Shostak Video |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=2011-05-25 |access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> Though corrected closing titles were later done, remastered prints of the series use prints which credit Waithe instead of Waldo.\n* '''Valerie Brown''' (voiced by Barbara Pariot/sung by [[Patrice Holloway]]) - The band's Black bassist and backup singer; most often shown playing tambourines. The voice of reason in the group, Valerie is highly intelligent and a mechanical wizard.  During the 1970s, the character was known as Valerie Smith. \n* '''Melody Valentine''' (voiced by [[Jackie Joseph]]/sung by [[Cheryl Ladd|Cherie Moor]]) - The band's drummer and backup singer and a stereotypical [[dumb blonde]]. What Melody lacks in intellect she makes up for in heart; to wit, her perpetual sweetness and optimism.  Her ears twitch when there is danger.  During the 1970s, the character was known as Melody Jones.\n* '''Alan M. Mayberry''' (voiced by [[Jerry Dexter]]) - The group's tall, blond and muscular roadie and Josie's love interest.\n* '''Alexander Cabot III''' (voiced by [[Casey Kasem]]) - the group's manager, highly identifiable by his brightly-colored mod wardrobe, sunglasses, and idiotic promotion schemes; he is the twin brother of Alexandra.  Alexander is an admitted coward but, in sharp contrast to his sister Alexandra, is good-hearted.  Alexander and Valerie have a slight attraction to one another at times. He also seems to be attracted to Melody. Alexander physically resembles [[Shaggy Rogers]] in Scooby-Doo. In ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' crossover episode \"The Haunted Showboat\"; Casey Kasem voices both Alexander Cabot III and Shaggy Rogers.\n* '''Alexandra Cabot''' (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni]]) - The only girl who is not a Pussycat band member of the Josie's trio but still a member of the group, identified by her long black pony-tailed hair with a white streak through the center of it, similar to a skink or a [[polecat]]. Intelligent but also selfish, generally mean-tempered, grouchy and bullying, Alexandra is Alexander's twin sister. She appears to have no identifiable role with the band nor any reason for associating with it, other than the fact that she is Alexander's sister and ally who tries to be the leader. She is constantly bitter and jealous of the band's success without her, believing that she should be \"the ''real'' star of the band\", and she constantly plots to steal the spotlight (and Alan's affections) from Josie only to have every scheme fail in humiliating fashion. Despite her jealousy, she remains very loyal to the group and will usually fight with them against villains, using her brash personality to intimidate the opposition.\n* '''Sebastian''' (voiced by [[Don Messick]]) - Alexandra's snickering cat, whose black and white fur resembles Alexandra's hair and whose utterances sound the same as another Messick character, [[Muttley]].  He enjoys being mean and sometimes appears to go to the enemy's side, but usually only to trick the villain so he can have a chance to help the group escape. He sometimes uses his claws to pick locks. Alexandra sometimes recruits Sebastian to pull dirty tricks on Josie, but even these tricks usually backfire. In ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' crossover episode \"The Haunted Showboat\", Messick voiced both Sebastian and Scooby-Doo at the same time.\n* '''Bleep''' - (also voiced by [[Don Messick]] and appears only in ''[[Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space]]'') Melody's blue fluffy pet alien with pink extremities. He makes a \"bleep\" sound (thus his name) which only Melody can understand. Bleep can also generate invisible sound waves from his mouth and eyes.\n\n==''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space''==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\n| image                    = JosieInOuterSpace.jpg\n| image_alt                =\n| caption                  =\n| genre                    =\n| creator                  =\n| based_on                 = {{based on|[[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)|Josie and the Pussycats]]||[[Dan DeCarlo]]|[[Richard Goldwater]]}}\n| developer                = Bill Lutz<br />[[Arthur Davis (animator)|Art Davis]]<br />Brad Case\n| writer                   =\n| director                 =\n| creative_director        =\n| presenter                =\n| starring                 = [[Janet Waldo]]<br />[[Sherry Alberoni]]<br />[[Casey Kasem]]<br />[[Jackie Joseph]]<br />[[Jerry Dexter]]<br />Barbara Pariot<br />[[Don Messick]]\n| judges                   =\n| voices                   =\n| narrated                 =\n| theme_music_composer     =\n| opentheme                =\n| endtheme                 =\n| composer                 =\n| country                  = [[United States|U.S.]]\n| language                 =\n| num_seasons              =\n| num_episodes             = 16\n| list_episodes            =\n| executive_producer       =\n| producer                 =\n| editor                   =\n| cinematography           =\n| camera                   =\n| runtime                  = 21 minutes\n| company                  = [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]]\n| distributor              = [[Taft Broadcasting|Taft, H-B Program Sales]]<br />[[Warner Bros.

This version of the series launched the characters into outer space; the opening credits sequence shows the group taking a promotional photo at the launch site of a new spaceship and a jealous Alexandra elbowing the cast aside in order to steal the spotlight from Josie yet again. However, Alexandra is jerked inside along with the rest of them and accidentally triggers the launch sequence, sending them and the ship into deep space. Despite never having been in the spaceship before, Val seems to know how to pilot it. Every episode centered on the Pussycats encountering a strange new world, where they would encounter and often be kidnapped by various alien races before escaping and attempting to return home.\n\nMusical numbers and chase sequences set to newly recorded songs were featured in this spin-off series as with the original. ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' also added the character of Bleep, a pet-sized fluffy alien adopted by Melody, who was the only one who could understand the creature (who only says \"Bleep\" repeatedly) and numerous other alien animals encountered.\n\nThe 16 episodes of ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' were re-run for the 1973\u20131974 season until January 26, 1974, when CBS canceled it and ordered no more new ''Josie'' episodes from Hanna-Barbera. ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' contained a laugh track as well, but utilized an inferior [[Laugh track#Making their own|version created by the studio]].\n\n==After cancellation==\n''Josie and the Pussycats'' made a final appearance as animated characters in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973, episode of '' [[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"The Haunted Showboat\". Early production art for Hanna-Barbera's 1977 \"all-star\" ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]'' spoof ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' featured Alexandra, Sebastian, Alexander, and Melody among other Hanna-Barbera characters as members of the \"Scooby Doobies\" team, but legal problems prevented their inclusion in the final program.\n\nIn 1976, [[Rand McNally]] published a children's book based on the ''Josie and the Pussycats'' TV show, ''Hanna-Barbera's Josie and the Pussycats: The Bag Factory Detour''.\n\nThe original ''Josie and the Pussycats'' series was re-run on [[NBC]] Saturday morning for the 1975\u20131976 season and weekdays in syndication from 1977 to 1982. In the mid-1980s, both series, along with a number of other 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoons, were on board [[USA Cartoon Express|USA Network's ''Cartoon Express'']]; they would next appear on [[Cartoon Network]] in 1992, where all 32 episodes were run in the same time slot. Both programs, as of March 3, 2014, are in the library of [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] (Turner Broadcasting's archive cartoon channel).\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===''Josie and the Pussycats'': 1970\u20131971===\n{{Episode table\n|background   = #FACC31\n|overall      = \n|title        = \n|airdate      = \n|prodcode     = \n|episodes     = \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=The Nemo's a No-No Affair\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1970|9|12}}\n |ProdCode=51-1\n |ShortSummary=The gang run afoul of a latter-day descendant of Captain Nemo while on their way to a musical gig on [[Pago Pago]] Island.

Different animation styles are used for each era. That same year, the characters were adapted into a [[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|live action film]]. The film starred [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Josie, [[Tara Reid]] as Melody, and [[Rosario Dawson]] as Valerie.\n\nThe 2004\u20132007 [[Comedy Central]] animated TV series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' featured a character named [[Foxxy Love]]. An African-American mystery-solving musician, she was a direct parody of the ''Josie and the Pussycats'' character Valerie Brown.<ref>M. Keith Booker (2006). ''Drawn to television: prime-time animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy''. Westort, CT: Praeger Publishers/Greenwood Publishing Group. Pg. 158</ref>\n\nSeveral episodes of ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', a later Hanna-Barbera show, had similar plots to some ''Josie and the Pussycats'' episodes, specifically the two ''Josie and the Pussycats'' episodes \"A Greenthumb is Not a Goldfinger\" (\"Island of the Giant Plants\" in ''Speed Buggy'') and \"X Marks the Spot\" (\"Out of Sight\" in ''Speed Buggy''), and the ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' episode \"Warrior Women of Amazonia\" (\"The Hidden Valley of Amazonia\" in ''Speed Buggy'').\n\nThe ship from ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'', along with other iconic ships, appears as space debris in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"[[Mobius Dick (Futurama)|Mobius Dick]]\".\n\nIn 2016, ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was rebooted as a comic book. This update features a new version of the origin of the band, where struggling musician Josie joins up with her roommate Melody and Valerie, a veternarian's assistant, to start The Pussycats, despite the jealousy of Josie's former best friend Alexandra.\n\nThe 2017 live-action TV series ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]'' featured Josie and the Pussycats as African-American students at Riverdale High School, played by [[Ashleigh Murray]] ([[List of Riverdale characters#Josie McCoy|Josie]]), Hayley Law (Valerie) and Asha Bromfield (Melody). Murray later co-starred in the ''Riverdale'' spin-off ''[[Katy Keene]]'' starting in 2020 as an adult Josie, with [[Lucien Laviscount]] as Alexander and [[Camille Hyde]] as Alexandra.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/katy-keene-casts-alexandra-alexander-cabot/ |title=Riverdale Spinoff Katy Keene Casts Two Josie and the Pussycats Characters |date=2019-02-27 |website=CBR |language=en-US |access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cartoon|Animation}}\n* [[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)|''Josie and the Pussycats'' (the Archie comic)]]\n* [[Josie and the Pussycats (album)|Josie and the Pussycats (the music group put together in conjunction with the show)]]\n* [[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|''Josie and the Pussycats'' (the live action movie)]]\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n* Burke, Timothy and Burke, Kevin (1999).

The group consisted of level-headed lead singer, songwriter and guitarist Josie, intelligent bassist Valerie, and air-headed [[blonde]] drummer Melody. Other characters included their cowardly manager Alexander Cabot III,  his conniving sister Alexandra, her cat Sebastian, and muscular [[roadie]] Alan.\n\nThe show, more similar to Hanna-Barbera's successful ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'' than the original ''Josie'' comic book, is famous for its music, the girls' leopard print [[leotard]]s (replete with \"long tails and ears for hats\", as the theme song states), and for featuring Valerie as the first regularly appearing female [[African American|black]] character in a Saturday morning cartoon show.<ref>Charles, Don. ''Long Tails and Ears for Hats: The Story of Josie and the Pussy Cats''.</ref> Each episode featured a Josie and the Pussycats song played over a chase scene, which, in a similar fashion to ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', featured the group running after and away from a selection of haplessly villainous characters.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Origins===\nDuring the 1968-69 television season, the first [[Archie Comics|Archie]]-based Saturday morning cartoon, ''[[The Archie Show]]'', was a huge success, not only in the ratings on [[CBS]], but also on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]: [[The Archies]]' song \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\" hit the #1 spot on the ''Billboard'' charts in September 1969, becoming the number one song of the year. Animation studio [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]] wanted to duplicate the success their competitors [[Filmation]] were having with ''The Archie Show''. After a failed attempt at developing a teenage-music-band show of their own called ''[[Scooby-Doo|Mysteries Five]]'' (which eventually became ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where are You!]]''), they decided to go to the source and contacted Archie Comics about possibly adapting one of their remaining properties into a show similar to ''The Archie Show''. Archie and Hanna-Barbera collaborated to adapt Archie's ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)|Josie]]'' comic book into a music-based property about a teenage music band, adding new characters (Alan M. and Valerie) while dismissing others.<ref>Shirley, Ian (2005). ''Can Rock and Roll Save the World? A History of Music and Comics''. SAF Publishing Ltd. pg. 39</ref>\n\n[[Image:Josie hb.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A scene from episode #14, \"Spy School Spoof\". From left to right: Melody, Josie, Valerie, Alan, Alexandra and Alexander.]]\n\n===The music===\n{{Main article|Josie and the Pussycats (album)}}\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming cartoon series, Hanna-Barbera began working on putting together a real-life [[Josie and the Pussycats (music)|Josie and the Pussycats]] girl group, who would provide the singing voices of the girls in the cartoons and also record an album of songs to be used both as radio singles and in the TV series.\n\nThe Josie and the Pussycats recordings were produced by La La Productions, run by Danny Janssen and Bobby Young (a pseudonym for Bob Engemann of The Lettermen vocal group). They held a talent search to find three girls who would match the three girls in the comic book in both looks and singing ability; early plans, which did not come to fruition, called for a live-action Pussycats segment at the end of each episode.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sue Sheridan |url=http://donosdump.com/Jozine/SueSharidan.html |title=Sue Sheridan liner notes |publisher=Donosdump.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05}}</ref> After interviewing over 500 finalists, settled upon casting Kathleen Dougherty (Cathy Dougher) as Josie, [[Cheryl Ladd|Cherie Moor]] (later known as Cheryl Ladd) as Melody, and [[Patrice Holloway]] as Valerie.\n\nJanssen presented the newly formed band to [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] to finalize the production deal. Hanna-Barbera wanted Janssen to recast Holloway, because they had decided to portray \"Josie and the Pussycats\" as an all-white trio and had altered Valerie, who had been conceived as [[black]] and was already appearing as such in Archie Comics' revamped ''Josie and the Pussycats'' comic book, to make her white. Janssen refused to recast Holloway and threatened to walk away from the project. After a three-week-long stand-off between Janssen and Hanna-Barbera, Hanna-Barbera finally relented, allowed Janssen to keep Holloway, and changed Valerie back to being black.<ref>Liner notes from ''Josie and the Pussycats: Stop Look and Listen: The Capitol Recordings'' [CD Set]. Burbank: Rhino Handmade. Text available at http://www.geocities.com/antlion7/josie.htm.</ref> The Valerie character was the first black female character on a regular Saturday morning cartoon series. ''[[The Hardy Boys (1969 TV series)|The Hardy Boys]]'' drummer Pete Jones had been the first black male to appear on Saturday mornings a year earlier.\n\nOf the songs that were broadcast, Patrice Holloway sang lead on the series' theme song, \"You've Come A Long Way, Baby\", \"Voodoo\", \"It's All Right With Me\", \"The Handclapping Song\", \"Stop, Look And Listen\", \"Clock On The Wall\" and \"Every Beat Of My Heart\".  Holloway was the primary lead vocalist on \"Roadrunner\" which also features verses sung by Kathleen Dougherty and Cheryl Ladd.  Ladd sang lead on \"Inside, Outside, Upside-Down\", \"Dream Maker\", \"I Wanna Make You Happy\", \"The Time To Love\", \"I Love You Too Much\", \"Lie! Lie! Lie!\" and \"Dreaming\".  According to songwriter/vocal arranger Sue Sheridan (known as Sue Steward at the time), Dougherty felt she was stronger on harmony than lead and ceded her spotlight to Ladd.  Essentially then, Josie was the group leader but Valerie and Melody provided the trio with its singing voices. \n\n===Theme song===\nThe show's theme song, titled \"Josie and the Pussycats\", was written by [[Hoyt Curtin]], [[William Hanna]] (under the pseudonym \"Denby Williams\")  and [[Joseph Barbera]] (under the pseudonym \"Joseph Roland\").  The theme song was based on melodies from an incidental tune that had been played on various Hanna-Barbera cartoons since ''[[The Jetsons]]''.\n\nA cover of \"Josie and the Pussycats\" performed by [[Juliana Hatfield]] and [[Tanya Donelly]] is included on the 1995 [[tribute album]] ''[[Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits]]'', produced by [[Ralph Sall]] for [[MCA Records]].<ref>CD liner notes: ''Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits'', 1995 MCA Records</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n''Josie and the Pussycats'' debuted on the [[CBS]] [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup on September 12, 1970, with the episode \"The Nemo's a No-No Affair\". The animated version of ''Josie'' was an amalgam of plot devices, villain types, settings, moods, and tones from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo|Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!]]'', ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Space Ghost]]'', and ''[[Shazzan]]''.\n\nLike ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'', ''Josie and the Pussycats'' was originally broadcast with a [[laugh track]]. Later home video and DVD releases omit the laugh track. [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], however, have aired the show its original broadcast format with laughter intact.\n\n===Plot===\nEach episode found the Pussycats and crew en route to perform a gig or record a song in some exotic location where, somehow, often due to something Alexandra did, they became mixed up in an adventure. The antagonist was always a diabolical mad scientist, spy, or criminal who wanted to take over the world using some high-tech device. The Pussycats usually found themselves in possession of the plans for an invention, an item of interest to the villains, a secret spy message, etc., and the villains chased them to retrieve it. Eventually, the Pussycats would ruin the villain's plans, resulting in a final chase sequence set to a Pussycats song.  With the villain captured, the Pussycats would return to their gig or recording session, and the final gag was always one of Alexandra's failed attempts to interfere with the Pussycats' performance or steal Alan away from Josie.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Josephine \"Josie\" McCoy''' (voiced by [[Janet Waldo]]/sung by Cathy Dougher) - The red-headed lead singer, songwriter, guitarist and leader of the band. Josie shares an attraction with Alan, the road manager.  During the 1970s, the character was known as Josie James. A different actress, Judy Waithe, was originally cast as the voice of Josie. Waithe he was dismissed and replaced by Waldo before the show debuted as her readings of the ''Josie and the Pussycats'' hosted ''[[In the News|In the Know]]'' interstitials were not to CBS' liking.<ref>{{Cite podcast |url=https://www.stusshow.com/archives.php?y=2011 |title=PROGRAM 231 - 5/25/11 |website=Stu's Show |publisher=Shostak Video |last=Shostak |first=Stu |date=2011-05-25 |access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> Though corrected closing titles were later done, remastered prints of the series use prints which credit Waithe instead of Waldo.\n* '''Valerie Brown''' (voiced by Barbara Pariot/sung by [[Patrice Holloway]]) - The band's Black bassist and backup singer; most often shown playing tambourines. The voice of reason in the group, Valerie is highly intelligent and a mechanical wizard.  During the 1970s, the character was known as Valerie Smith. \n* '''Melody Valentine''' (voiced by [[Jackie Joseph]]/sung by [[Cheryl Ladd|Cherie Moor]]) - The band's drummer and backup singer and a stereotypical [[dumb blonde]]. What Melody lacks in intellect she makes up for in heart; to wit, her perpetual sweetness and optimism.  Her ears twitch when there is danger.  During the 1970s, the character was known as Melody Jones.\n* '''Alan M. Mayberry''' (voiced by [[Jerry Dexter]]) - The group's tall, blond and muscular roadie and Josie's love interest.\n* '''Alexander Cabot III''' (voiced by [[Casey Kasem]]) - the group's manager, highly identifiable by his brightly-colored mod wardrobe, sunglasses, and idiotic promotion schemes; he is the twin brother of Alexandra.  Alexander is an admitted coward but, in sharp contrast to his sister Alexandra, is good-hearted.  Alexander and Valerie have a slight attraction to one another at times. He also seems to be attracted to Melody. Alexander physically resembles [[Shaggy Rogers]] in Scooby-Doo. In ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' crossover episode \"The Haunted Showboat\"; Casey Kasem voices both Alexander Cabot III and Shaggy Rogers.\n* '''Alexandra Cabot''' (voiced by [[Sherry Alberoni]]) - The only girl who is not a Pussycat band member of the Josie's trio but still a member of the group, identified by her long black pony-tailed hair with a white streak through the center of it, similar to a skink or a [[polecat]]. Intelligent but also selfish, generally mean-tempered, grouchy and bullying, Alexandra is Alexander's twin sister. She appears to have no identifiable role with the band nor any reason for associating with it, other than the fact that she is Alexander's sister and ally who tries to be the leader. She is constantly bitter and jealous of the band's success without her, believing that she should be \"the ''real'' star of the band\", and she constantly plots to steal the spotlight (and Alan's affections) from Josie only to have every scheme fail in humiliating fashion. Despite her jealousy, she remains very loyal to the group and will usually fight with them against villains, using her brash personality to intimidate the opposition.\n* '''Sebastian''' (voiced by [[Don Messick]]) - Alexandra's snickering cat, whose black and white fur resembles Alexandra's hair and whose utterances sound the same as another Messick character, [[Muttley]].  He enjoys being mean and sometimes appears to go to the enemy's side, but usually only to trick the villain so he can have a chance to help the group escape. He sometimes uses his claws to pick locks. Alexandra sometimes recruits Sebastian to pull dirty tricks on Josie, but even these tricks usually backfire. In ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' crossover episode \"The Haunted Showboat\", Messick voiced both Sebastian and Scooby-Doo at the same time.\n* '''Bleep''' - (also voiced by [[Don Messick]] and appears only in ''[[Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space]]'') Melody's blue fluffy pet alien with pink extremities. He makes a \"bleep\" sound (thus his name) which only Melody can understand. Bleep can also generate invisible sound waves from his mouth and eyes.\n\n==''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space''==\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space\n| image                    = JosieInOuterSpace.jpg\n| image_alt                =\n| caption                  =\n| genre                    =\n| creator                  =\n| based_on                 = {{based on|[[Josie and the Pussycats (comics)|Josie and the Pussycats]]||[[Dan DeCarlo]]|[[Richard Goldwater]]}}\n| developer                = Bill Lutz<br />[[Arthur Davis (animator)|Art Davis]]<br />Brad Case\n| writer                   =\n| director                 =\n| creative_director        =\n| presenter                =\n| starring                 = [[Janet Waldo]]<br />[[Sherry Alberoni]]<br />[[Casey Kasem]]<br />[[Jackie Joseph]]<br />[[Jerry Dexter]]<br />Barbara Pariot<br />[[Don Messick]]\n| judges                   =\n| voices                   =\n| narrated                 =\n| theme_music_composer     =\n| opentheme                =\n| endtheme                 =\n| composer                 =\n| country                  = [[United States|U.S.]]\n| language                 =\n| num_seasons              =\n| num_episodes             = 16\n| list_episodes            =\n| executive_producer       =\n| producer                 =\n| editor                   =\n| cinematography           =\n| camera                   =\n| runtime                  = 21 minutes\n| company                  = [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]]\n| distributor              = [[Taft Broadcasting|Taft, H-B Program Sales]]<br />[[Warner Bros.

This version of the series launched the characters into outer space; the opening credits sequence shows the group taking a promotional photo at the launch site of a new spaceship and a jealous Alexandra elbowing the cast aside in order to steal the spotlight from Josie yet again. However, Alexandra is jerked inside along with the rest of them and accidentally triggers the launch sequence, sending them and the ship into deep space. Despite never having been in the spaceship before, Val seems to know how to pilot it. Every episode centered on the Pussycats encountering a strange new world, where they would encounter and often be kidnapped by various alien races before escaping and attempting to return home.\n\nMusical numbers and chase sequences set to newly recorded songs were featured in this spin-off series as with the original. ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' also added the character of Bleep, a pet-sized fluffy alien adopted by Melody, who was the only one who could understand the creature (who only says \"Bleep\" repeatedly) and numerous other alien animals encountered.\n\nThe 16 episodes of ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' were re-run for the 1973\u20131974 season until January 26, 1974, when CBS canceled it and ordered no more new ''Josie'' episodes from Hanna-Barbera. ''Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space'' contained a laugh track as well, but utilized an inferior [[Laugh track#Making their own|version created by the studio]].\n\n==After cancellation==\n''Josie and the Pussycats'' made a final appearance as animated characters in a guest shot on the September 22, 1973, episode of '' [[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"The Haunted Showboat\". Early production art for Hanna-Barbera's 1977 \"all-star\" ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]'' spoof ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' featured Alexandra, Sebastian, Alexander, and Melody among other Hanna-Barbera characters as members of the \"Scooby Doobies\" team, but legal problems prevented their inclusion in the final program.\n\nIn 1976, [[Rand McNally]] published a children's book based on the ''Josie and the Pussycats'' TV show, ''Hanna-Barbera's Josie and the Pussycats: The Bag Factory Detour''.\n\nThe original ''Josie and the Pussycats'' series was re-run on [[NBC]] Saturday morning for the 1975\u20131976 season and weekdays in syndication from 1977 to 1982. In the mid-1980s, both series, along with a number of other 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoons, were on board [[USA Cartoon Express|USA Network's ''Cartoon Express'']]; they would next appear on [[Cartoon Network]] in 1992, where all 32 episodes were run in the same time slot. Both programs, as of March 3, 2014, are in the library of [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] (Turner Broadcasting's archive cartoon channel).\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===''Josie and the Pussycats'': 1970\u20131971===\n{{Episode table\n|background   = #FACC31\n|overall      = \n|title        = \n|airdate      = \n|prodcode     = \n|episodes     = \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title=The Nemo's a No-No Affair\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1970|9|12}}\n |ProdCode=51-1\n |ShortSummary=The gang run afoul of a latter-day descendant of Captain Nemo while on their way to a musical gig on [[Pago Pago]] Island.

I also can't believe that people like [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] are gonna go to the same place as [[Mother Teresa]].\"<ref name=Decibel/></blockquote>\n\n\n====Biography====\nSteele's biography ''Soul On Fire \u2013 The Life And Music Of Peter Steele'' was penned by [[Metal Maniacs]] editor [[Metal Maniacs|Jeff Wagner]], and was released in 2013.

There is a navigation station on the port side that is normally angled, but can be leveled for use as counter space. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located on the port side and just aft of the bow \"V\"-berth. The cabin woodwork is all of teak.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nVentilation is provided by two [[dorade vent]]s, bow cabin and main cabin deck hatches, plus four opening ports.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe cockpit is a \"T\"-shaped design.

It has a [[masthead sloop]] rig, with [[aluminum]] spars, a [[raked stem]], a raised [[reverse transom]], an internally mounted spade-type [[rudder]] controlled by a [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] and a fixed fin [[keel]]. It displaces {{convert|12000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and carries {{convert|5900|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of ballast.<ref name=\"Data\"/><ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe design was produced with several different keel and rig combinations.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe boat has a draft of {{convert|5.92|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the standard keel and {{convert|4.92|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the optional shoal draft keel.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe boat is fitted with a Japanese [[Yanmar]] 2GMF [[Yanmar 2GM20]] [[diesel engine]] of {{convert|22|or|24|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds {{convert|18|u.s.gal}} and the fresh water tank has a capacity of {{convert|70|u.s.gal}}.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people. There is a bow \"V\"-berth, two settee berths in the main cabin and a quarter berth aft, with a sixth, optional pilot berth above the settee berths. The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] is located aft, on the starboard side and includes a two-burner, alcohol-fired stove and oven, plus a sink with pressurized water. There is a navigation station on the port side that is normally angled, but can be leveled for use as counter space. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located on the port side and just aft of the bow \"V\"-berth. The cabin woodwork is all of teak.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nVentilation is provided by two [[dorade vent]]s, bow cabin and main cabin deck hatches, plus four opening ports.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe cockpit is a \"T\"-shaped design. The [[halyard]]s, [[topping lift]] and [[reefing]] lines are all mounted internally. The cockpit has two [[genoa (sail)|genoa]] [[sheet (sailing)|sheeting]] winches, plus there are two additional winches on the mast for the halyards. There are also genoa sheet tracks mounted inboard. There is an [[anchor]] well in the bow.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe design has a [[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet|PHRF]] racing average handicap of 120 with the deep keel fitted.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn a 1994 review, Richard Sherwood wrote, \"like many Seidelmanns, this one has a very tall rig.
