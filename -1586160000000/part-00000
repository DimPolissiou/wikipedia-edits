Along with other genera in the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Eucalypteae]], they are commonly known as '''eucalypts'''. Plants in the genus ''Eucalyptus'' have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard or stringy, leaves with oil [[Gland (botany)|glands]], and [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s that are fused to form a \"cap\" or [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] over the [[stamen]]s. The fruit is a woody [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] commonly referred to as a \"gumnut\".\n\nMost species of ''Eucalyptus'' are [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. [[Wildfire]] is a feature of the Australian landscape and many eucalypt species are adapted to fire, and resprout after fire or have seeds which survive fire.\n\nA few species are native to islands north of Australia and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast growing and have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, for honey production or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because they are highly flammable.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Eucalyptus camaldulensis seeds00.jpg|thumb|Seeds of ''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis]]'']]\n[[File:Eucalyptus tetragona - glaucous leaves close.jpg|thumb|''[[Eucalyptus tetragona]]'', showing glaucous leaves and stems]]\n\n=== Size and habit ===\nEucalypts vary in size and [[Habit (biology)|habit]] from shrubs to tall trees.

In about half of the species, the dead bark is shed exposing a new layer of fresh, living bark. The dead bark may be shed in large slabs, in ribbons or in small flakes. These species are known as \"smooth barks\" and include ''[[Eucalyptus sheathiana|E. sheathiana]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus diversicolor|E. diversicolor]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus cosmophylla|E. cosmophylla]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus cladocalyx|E. cladocalyx]]''. The remaining species retain the dead bark which dries out and accumulates. In some of these species, the fibres in the bark are loosely intertwined (in stringybarks such as ''[[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha|E. macrorhyncha]]'' or peppermints such as ''[[Eucalyptus radiata|E. radiata]]'') or more tightly adherent (as in the \"boxes\" such as ''[[Eucalyptus leptophleba|E. leptophleba]]''). In some species (the \"ironbarks\" such as ''[[Eucalyptus crebra|E. crebra]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus jensenii|E. jensenii]]'') the rough bark is infused with gum resin.<ref name=\"CANBR\" />\n\nMany species are \u2018half-barks\u2019 or \u2018blackbutts\u2019 in which the dead bark is retained in the lower half of the trunks or stems\u2014for example, ''[[Eucalyptus brachycalyx|E. brachycalyx]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus ochrophloia|E. ochrophloia]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus occidentalis|E. occidentalis]]''\u2014or only in a thick, black accumulation at the base, as in ''[[Eucalyptus clelandii|E. clelandii]]''. In some species in this category, for example ''[[Eucalyptus youngiana|E. youngiana]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus viminalis|E. viminalis]]'', the rough basal bark is very ribbony at the top, where it gives way to the smooth upper stems. The smooth upper bark of the half-barks and that of the completely smooth-barked trees and mallees can produce remarkable colour and interest, for example ''[[Eucalyptus deglupta|E. deglupta]]''.<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\n''[[Eucalyptus globulus|E. globulus]]'' bark cells are able to photosynthesize in the absence of foliage, conferring an \"increased capacity to re-fix internal CO<sub>2</sub> following partial defoliation\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eyles|display-authors=etal|first=A|date=2009|title=Role of corticular photosynthesis following defoliation in Eucalyptus globulus|url=|journal=Plant, Cell & Environment|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1004\u20131014|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01984.x|pmid=19344333}}</ref> This allows the tree to grow in less-than-ideal climates, in addition to providing a better chance of recovery from damage sustained to its leaves in an event such as a fire.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saveyn|display-authors=etal|first=A.|date=Summer 2010|title=Woody tissue photosynthesis and its contribution to trunk growth and bud development in young plants|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x/asset/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x.pdf;jsessionid=2DF8853EB94016F034D5922B3E11AB6A.f01t04?v=1&t=j335k1pl&s=2bcf5c5de958a434bce7596540f55ee86e269f4e|journal=Plant, Cell & Environment|volume=33|issue=11|pages=1949\u20131958|via=Wiley|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x|pmid=20561249}}</ref>\n\nDifferent commonly recognised types of bark include:\n* [[Stringybark]]\u2014consists of long fibres and can be pulled off in long pieces.

'Rosea' showing flowers and buds with [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] present]]\n[[File:Yellow Box blossoms and gumnuts.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Eucalyptus melliodora]]'', showing flowers and opercula]]\n\nNearly all eucalyptus are [[evergreen]], but some tropical species lose their leaves at the end of the dry season. As in other members of the [[Myrtaceae|myrtle]] family, eucalyptus leaves are covered with oil glands. The copious oils produced are an important feature of the genus. Although mature eucalyptus trees may be towering and fully leafed, their shade is characteristically patchy because the leaves usually hang downwards.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe leaves on a mature eucalyptus plant are commonly [[lanceolate]], [[Leaf#Characteristics of the petiole|petiolate]], apparently [[Alternate leaf|alternate]] and waxy or glossy green. In contrast, the leaves of seedlings are often [[Alternate leaf|opposite]], [[Leaf#Characteristics of the petiole|sessile]] and [[Leaf#Surface of the leaf|glaucous]], but many exceptions to this pattern exist. Many species such as ''[[Eucalyptus melanophloia|E. melanophloia]]'' and ''E. setosa'' retain the juvenile leaf form even when the plant is reproductively mature. Some species, such as ''[[Eucalyptus macrocarpa|E. macrocarpa]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus rhodantha|E. rhodantha]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus crucis|E. crucis]]'', are sought-after ornamentals due to this lifelong juvenile leaf form. A few species, such as ''[[Eucalyptus petraea|E. petraea]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus dundasii|E. dundasii]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus lansdowneana|E. lansdowneana]]'', have shiny green leaves throughout their life cycle. ''[[Eucalyptus caesia|E. caesia]]'' exhibits the opposite pattern of leaf development to most eucalyptus, with shiny green leaves in the seedling stage and dull, glaucous leaves in mature crowns. The contrast between juvenile and adult leaf phases is valuable in field identification.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\nFour leaf phases are recognised in the development of a eucalyptus plant: the \u2018seedling\u2019, \u2018juvenile\u2019, \u2018intermediate\u2019, and \u2018adult\u2019 phases. However, no definite transitional point occurs between the phases. The intermediate phase, when the largest leaves are often formed, links the juvenile and adult phases.<ref name=FieldGuide>Brooker & Kleinig (2001)</ref>\n\nIn all except a few species, the leaves form in pairs on opposite sides of a square stem, consecutive pairs being at right angles to each other (decussate). In some narrow-leaved species, for example ''[[Eucalyptus oleosa|E. oleosa]]'', the seedling leaves after the second leaf pair are often clustered in a detectable [[spiral]] arrangement about a five-sided stem. After the spiral phase, which may last from several to many nodes, the arrangement reverts to decussate by the absorption of some of the leaf-bearing faces of the stem. In those species with opposite adult foliage the leaf pairs, which have been formed opposite at the stem apex, become separated at their bases by unequal elongation of the stem to produce the apparently alternate adult leaves.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Flowers ===\nThe most readily recognisable characteristics of eucalyptus species are the distinctive flowers and fruit (capsules or \"gumnuts\"). Flowers have numerous fluffy [[stamen]]s which may be white, cream, yellow, pink, or red; in bud, the stamens are enclosed in a cap known as an [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] which is composed of the fused sepals or petals, or both. Thus, flowers have no petals, but instead decorate themselves with the many showy stamens. As the stamens expand, the operculum is forced off, splitting away from the cup-like base of the flower; this is one of the features that unites the genus. The woody fruits or capsules are roughly cone-shaped and have valves at the end which open to release the seeds, which are waxy, rod-shaped, about 1&nbsp;mm in length, and yellow-brown in colour. Most species do not flower until adult foliage starts to appear; ''E. cinerea'' and ''E. perriniana'' are notable exceptions.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe genus ''Eucalyptus'' was first formally described in 1789 by [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle]] who published the description in his book ''Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum'' along with a description of the [[Type (biology)|type species]], ''[[Eucalyptus obliqua]]''.<ref name=APNI>{{cite web|title=''Eucalyptus''|url= https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/455721 |publisher=APNI|accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"l'Herit.\">{{cite book |last1=L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle |first1=Charles Louis |title=Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum |date=1789 |publisher=Petri Francisci Didot |location=Paris |page=11 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43456#page/35/mode/1up |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> The name ''Eucalyptus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''eu'' meaning \"good\", \"well\", \"true\", \"beautiful\" or \"very\"<ref name=\"RWB\">{{cite book|authorlink1=Roland W.

He collected the specimen on [[Bruny Island]] and sent it to de Brutelle who was working in [[London]] at that time.<ref name=\"CANBR\" />\n\n==Distribution==\nThere are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of [[New Guinea]] and [[Indonesia]]. One species, ''[[Eucalyptus deglupta]],'' ranges as far north as the [[Philippines]]. Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. Species of eucalyptus are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world, including the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the [[Middle East]], [[China]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. However, the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance.<ref name=\"Sellers1910\" />\n\nAustralia is covered by {{convert|92000000|ha|acre|0}} of eucalypt forest, comprising three quarters of the area covered by native forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/profiles/eucalypt-forest|title=Eucalypt forest|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2017}}</ref> The [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] of southeastern Australia have been a centre of eucalypt diversification;<ref name = \"UNESCO_BlueMountains\">{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/917|title= Greater Blue Mountains Area|date= 2019|website= whc.unesco.org|publisher= UNESCO World Heritage Centre|access-date= 2019-05-11}}</ref> their name is in reference to the blue haze prevalent in the area, believed derived from the volatile [[terpenoid]]s emitted by these trees.<ref name=\"Bohlmann2008\">{{cite journal|last1= Bohlmann|first1= J.|last2= Keeling|first2=C.

The oldest reliably dated macrofossil of ''Eucalyptus'' is a 21-million-year-old tree-stump encased in basalt in the upper Lachlan Valley in [[New South Wales]]. Other fossils have been found, but many are either unreliably dated or else unreliably identified.<ref name=\"Hill, R. S 1994\">Hill, R. S. \"The history of selected Australian taxa.\" History of the Australian vegetation: Cretaceous to Recent (1994): 390.</ref>\n\nIt is useful to consider where ''Eucalyptus'' fossils have not been found. Extensive research has gone into the fossil floras of the [[Paleocene]] to [[Oligocene]] of South-Eastern Australia, and has failed to uncover a single ''Eucalyptus'' specimen. Although the evidence is sparse, the best hypothesis is that in the mid-Tertiary, the contintental margins of Australia only supported more mesic noneucalypt vegetation, and that eucalypts probably contributed to the drier vegetation of the arid continental interior. With the progressive drying out of the continent since the [[Miocene]], eucalypts were displaced to the continental margins, and much of the mesic and rainforest vegetation that was once there was eliminated entirely.<ref name=\"Hill, R. S 1994\"/>\n\nThe current superdominance of ''Eucalyptus'' in Australia may be an artefact of human influence on its ecology. In more recent sediments, numerous findings of a dramatic increase in the abundance of ''Eucalyptus'' pollen are associated with increased charcoal levels. Though this occurs at different rates throughout Australia, it is compelling evidence for a relationship between the artificial increase of fire frequency with the arrival of Aboriginals and increased prevalence of this exceptionally fire-tolerant genus.<ref name=\"Hill, R. S 1994\"/>\n\n==Species and hybridism==\nOver 700 [[species]] of ''Eucalyptus'' are known; refer to the '''[[List of Eucalyptus species|List of ''Eucalyptus'' species]]''' for a comprehensive list of species. Some have [[divergent evolution|diverged]] from the mainstream of the [[genus]] to the extent that they are quite isolated [[genetics|genetically]] and are able to be recognised by only a few relatively invariant characteristics. Most, however, may be regarded as belonging to large or small groups of related species, which are often in geographical contact with each other and between which [[gene]] exchange still occurs. In these situations, many species appear to grade into one another, and intermediate forms are common. In other words, some species are relatively fixed genetically, as expressed in their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], while others have not diverged completely from their nearest relatives.\n\nHybrid individuals have not always been recognised as such on first collection and some have been named as new species, such as ''E. chrysantha'' (''E. preissiana'' \u00d7 ''E. sepulcralis'') and ''E.'' \"rivalis\" (''E. marginata'' \u00d7 ''E. megacarpa''). Hybrid combinations are not particularly common in the field, but some other published species frequently seen in Australia have been suggested to be hybrid combinations. For example, ''E. erythrandra'' is believed to be ''E. angulosa'' \u00d7 ''E. teraptera'' and due to its wide distribution is often referred to in texts.<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\n[[Renantherin]], a phenolic compound present in the leaves of some eucalyptus species, allows [[chemotaxonomy|chemotaxonomic]] discrimination in the sections [[renantheroideae]] and [[renantherae]]<ref>Polyphenols in the leaves of eucalyptus: A chemotaxonomic survey\u2014II. : The sections renantheroideae and renantherae.

Much of California is similar in climate to parts of Australia. By the early 1900s, thousands of acres of eucalypts were planted with the encouragement of the state government. It was hoped that they would provide a renewable source of timber for construction, furniture making and [[railway sleeper]]s. It was soon found that for the latter purpose eucalyptus was particularly unsuitable, as the ties made from eucalyptus had a tendency to twist while drying, and the dried ties were so tough that it was nearly impossible to hammer [[Rail fastening system|rail spikes]] into them.\n\n<blockquote>They went on to note that the promise of eucalyptus in California was based on the old virgin forests of Australia. This was a mistake, as the young trees being harvested in California could not compare in quality to the centuries-old eucalyptus timber of Australia. It reacted differently to harvest. The older trees didn't split or warp as the infant California crop did. There was a vast difference between the two, and this would doom the California eucalyptus industry.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://library.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/Bob_Santos-The_Eucalyptus_of_California.pdf |first=Robert L. |last=Santos |publisher=California State University |title= The Eucalyptus of California: Seeds of Good or Seeds of Evil? |year=1997 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne way in which the eucalyptus, mainly the blue gum ''[[Eucalyptus globulus|E. globulus]]'', proved valuable in California was in providing windbreaks for highways, orange groves, and farms in the mostly treeless [[Central Valley (California)|central part of the state]]. They are also admired as shade and ornamental trees in many cities and gardens.\n\n''Eucalyptus'' plantations in California have been criticised, because they compete with native plants and do not support native animals. Fire is also a problem.

The current area under commercial forest plantation is 6% of the total. The main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production (for [[cellulose]] and [[paper]]), [[sawlog]]s, [[plywood]] and [[bioenergy]] ([[thermoelectric]] generation). Most of the products obtained from [[sawmill]]s and [[pulp mill]]s, as well as plywood and [[Trunk (botany)|logs]], are exported.

Eucalypts were introduced to [[Ethiopia]] in either 1894 or 1895, either by Emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]]'s French advisor Mondon-Vidailhet or by the Englishman Captain O'Brian. Menelik II endorsed its planting around his new capital city of [[Addis Ababa]] because of the massive [[deforestation]] around the city for [[firewood]]. According to Richard R.K. Pankhurst, \"The great advantage of the eucalypts was that they were fast growing, required little attention and when cut down grew up again from the roots; it could be harvested every ten years. The tree proved successful from the onset\".<ref>Pankhurst p. 246</ref> Plantations of eucalypts spread from the capital to other growing urban centres such as [[Debre Marqos]]. Pankhurst reports that the most common species found in Addis Ababa in the mid-1960s was ''[[Eucalyptus globulus|E. globulus]]'', although he also found ''[[Eucalyptus melliodora|E. melliodora]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus rostrata (disambiguation)|E. rostrata]]'' in significant numbers. David Buxton, writing of central Ethiopia in the mid-1940s, observed that eucalyptus trees \"have become an integral -- and a pleasing -- element in the [[Shewa|Shoan]] landscape and has largely displaced the slow-growing native 'cedar' (''[[Juniperus procera]]'').\"<ref>David Buxton, ''Travels in Ethiopia'', second edition (London: Benn, 1957), p. 48</ref>\n\nIt was commonly believed that the thirst of the ''Eucalyptus'' \"tended to dry up rivers and wells\", creating such opposition to the species that in 1913 a proclamation was issued ordering a partial destruction of all standing trees, and their replacement with [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] trees. Pankhurst reports, \"The proclamation however remained a dead letter; there is no evidence of eucalypts being uprooted, still less of mulberry trees being planted.\"<ref>Pankhurst p. 247</ref> Eucalypts remain a defining feature of Addis Ababa.\n\n'''Madagascar'''. Much of Madagascar's original native forest has been replaced with ''Eucalyptus'', threatening biodiversity by isolating remaining natural areas such as [[Andasibe-Mantadia National Park]].\n\n'''South Africa'''.

Also, those bird species that glean insects from foliage, such as warblers and vireos, experience population declines when eucalyptus groves replace oak forest.\n\nBirds that thrive in eucalyptus groves in California tend to prefer tall vertical habitat.

There they collected specimens of ''E. gummifera'' and later, near the [[Endeavour River]] in northern ''Queensland'', ''E. platyphylla''; neither of these species was named as such at the time.\n\nIn 1777, on Cook's third expedition, David Nelson collected a eucalypt on [[Bruny Island]] in southern [[Tasmania]]. This specimen was taken to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], and was named ''Eucalyptus obliqua'' by the French botanist [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle|L'H\u00e9ritier]], who was working in London at the time.<ref>{{ cite book | last=L'H\u00e9ritier | first=Charles Louis | author-link=Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle | year=1788 | title=Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum : imprimis in horto regio Kewensi excoluntur, ab anno 1786 ad annum 1787 observatae  | place=Paris | publisher=Petri Francisci Didot | page=11 | language=Latin | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/11832429 }}</ref> He coined the generic name from the Greek roots ''eu'' and ''calyptos'', meaning \"well\" and \"covered\" in reference to the [[operculum (botany)|operculum]] of the flower bud which protects the developing flower parts as the flower develops and is shed by the pressure of the emerging [[stamens]] at flowering. It was most likely an accident that L'H\u00e9ritier chose a feature common to all eucalypts.\n\nThe name ''obliqua'' was derived from the Latin ''obliquus'', meaning \"oblique\", which is the [[botany|botanical]] term describing a [[leaf]] base where the two sides of the leaf blade are of unequal length and do not meet the petiole at the same place.\n\n''E. obliqua'' was published in 1788\u201389, which coincided with the first official European settlement of Australia. Between then and the turn of the 19th century, several more species of ''Eucalyptus'' were named and published. Most of these were by the English botanist [[James Edward Smith]] and most were, as might be expected, trees of the [[Sydney]] region. These include the economically valuable ''E. pilularis'', ''E. saligna'' and ''E. tereticornis''.\n\nThe first endemic Western Australian ''Eucalyptus'' to be collected and subsequently named was the Yate (''[[Eucalyptus cornuta|E. cornuta]]'') by the French botanist [[Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re]], who collected in what is now the [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] area in 1792.<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\nSeveral Australian botanists were active during the 19th century, particularly [[Ferdinand von Mueller]], whose work on ''eucalypts'' contributed greatly to the first comprehensive account of the genus in [[George Bentham]]'s ''Flora Australiensis'' in 1867. The account is the most important early systematic treatment of the genus. Bentham divided it into five series whose distinctions were based on characteristics of the stamens, particularly the anthers (Mueller, 1879\u201384), work elaborated by [[Joseph Henry Maiden]] (1903\u201333) and still further by William Faris Blakely (1934). The anther system became too complex to be workable and more recent systematic work has concentrated on the characteristics of buds, fruits, leaves and bark.\n\n==Photo gallery==\n<gallery>\n<!-- Please only add pictures where the species or variety of tree has been identified and the location \u2014 there are many varieties of eucalyptus and it is not encyclopaedic to say merely \"eucalyptus\"-->\nFile:E.sideroxylon, branchlets, stems, leaves, capsules & buds.jpg|''[[Eucalyptus sideroxylon]]'', showing fruit (capsules) and buds with [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] present.\nFile:Bach dan.jpg|''Eucalyptus'' forest in [[Shire of East Gippsland|East Gippsland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Along with other genera in the [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Eucalypteae]], they are commonly known as '''eucalypts'''.  Plants in the genus ''Eucalyptus'' have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard or stringy, leaves with oil [[Gland (botany)|glands]], and [[sepal]]s and [[petal]]s that are fused to form a \"cap\" or [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] over the [[stamen]]s. The fruit is a woody [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] commonly referred to as a \"gumnut\". \n\nMost species of ''Eucalyptus'' are [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] to Australia, and every state and territory has representative species. About three-quarters of Australian forests are eucalypt forests. [[Wildfire]] is a feature of the Australian landscape and many eucalypt species are adapted to fire, and resprout after fire or have seeds which survive fire. \n\nA few species are native to islands north of Australia and a smaller number are only found outside the continent. Eucalypts have been grown in plantations in many other countries because they are fast growing and have valuable timber, or can be used for pulpwood, for honey production or essential oils. In some countries, however, they have been removed because they are highly flammable.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Eucalyptus camaldulensis seeds00.jpg|thumb|Seeds of ''[[Eucalyptus camaldulensis]]'']]\n[[File:Eucalyptus tetragona - glaucous leaves close.jpg|thumb|''[[Eucalyptus tetragona]]'', showing glaucous leaves and stems]]\n\n=== Size and habit ===\nEucalypts vary in size and [[Habit (biology)|habit]] from shrubs to tall trees.

In about half of the species, the dead bark is shed exposing a new layer of fresh, living bark. The dead bark may be shed in large slabs, in ribbons or in small flakes. These species are known as \"smooth barks\" and include ''[[Eucalyptus sheathiana|E. sheathiana]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus diversicolor|E. diversicolor]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus cosmophylla|E. cosmophylla]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus cladocalyx|E. cladocalyx]]''. The remaining species retain the dead bark which dries out and accumulates. In some of these species, the fibres in the bark are loosely intertwined (in stringybarks such as ''[[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha|E. macrorhyncha]]'' or peppermints such as ''[[Eucalyptus radiata|E. radiata]]'') or more tightly adherent (as in the \"boxes\" such as ''[[Eucalyptus leptophleba|E. leptophleba]]''). In some species (the \"ironbarks\" such as ''[[Eucalyptus crebra|E. crebra]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus jensenii|E. jensenii]]'') the rough bark is infused with gum resin.<ref name=\"CANBR\" />\n\nMany species are \u2018half-barks\u2019 or \u2018blackbutts\u2019 in which the dead bark is retained in the lower half of the trunks or stems \u2014 for example, ''[[Eucalyptus brachycalyx|E. brachycalyx]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus ochrophloia|E. ochrophloia]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus occidentalis|E. occidentalis]]'' \u2014 or only in a thick, black accumulation at the base, as in ''[[Eucalyptus clelandii|E. clelandii]]''. In some species in this category, for example ''[[Eucalyptus youngiana|E. youngiana]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus viminalis|E. viminalis]]'', the rough basal bark is very ribbony at the top, where it gives way to the smooth upper stems. The smooth upper bark of the half-barks and that of the completely smooth-barked trees and mallees can produce remarkable colour and interest, for example ''[[Eucalyptus deglupta|E. deglupta]]''.<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\n''[[Eucalyptus globulus|E. globulus]]'' bark cells are able to photosynthesize in the absence of foliage, conferring an \"increased capacity to re-fix internal CO<sub>2</sub> following partial defoliation\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eyles|display-authors=etal|first=A|date=2009|title=Role of corticular photosynthesis following defoliation in Eucalyptus globulus|url=|journal=Plant, Cell & Environment|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1004\u20131014|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01984.x|pmid=19344333}}</ref> This allows the tree to grow in less-than-ideal climates, in addition to providing a better chance of recovery from damage sustained to its leaves in an event such as a fire.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saveyn|display-authors=etal|first=A.|date=Summer 2010|title=Woody tissue photosynthesis and its contribution to trunk growth and bud development in young plants|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x/asset/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x.pdf;jsessionid=2DF8853EB94016F034D5922B3E11AB6A.f01t04?v=1&t=j335k1pl&s=2bcf5c5de958a434bce7596540f55ee86e269f4e|journal=Plant, Cell & Environment|volume=33|issue=11|pages=1949\u20131958|via=Wiley|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02197.x|pmid=20561249}}</ref>\n\nDifferent commonly recognised types of bark include:\n* [[Stringybark]] \u2014 consists of long fibres and can be pulled off in long pieces.

As in other members of the [[Myrtaceae|myrtle]] family, eucalyptus leaves are covered with oil glands. The copious oils produced are an important feature of the genus.  Although mature eucalyptus trees may be towering and fully leafed, their shade is characteristically patchy because the leaves usually hang downwards.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe leaves on a mature eucalyptus plant are commonly [[lanceolate]], [[Leaf#Characteristics of the petiole|petiolate]], apparently [[Alternate leaf|alternate]] and waxy or glossy green. In contrast, the leaves of seedlings are often [[Alternate leaf|opposite]], [[Leaf#Characteristics of the petiole|sessile]] and [[Leaf#Surface of the leaf|glaucous]], but many exceptions to this pattern exist. Many species such as ''[[Eucalyptus melanophloia|E. melanophloia]]'' and ''E. setosa'' retain the juvenile leaf form even when the plant is reproductively mature. Some species, such as ''[[Eucalyptus macrocarpa|E. macrocarpa]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus rhodantha|E. rhodantha]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus crucis|E. crucis]]'', are sought-after ornamentals due to this lifelong juvenile leaf form. A few species, such as ''[[Eucalyptus petraea|E. petraea]]'', ''[[Eucalyptus dundasii|E. dundasii]]'', and ''[[Eucalyptus lansdowneana|E. lansdowneana]]'', have shiny green leaves throughout their life cycle. ''[[Eucalyptus caesia|E. caesia]]'' exhibits the opposite pattern of leaf development to most eucalyptus, with shiny green leaves in the seedling stage and dull, glaucous leaves in mature crowns. The contrast between juvenile and adult leaf phases is valuable in field identification.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\nFour leaf phases are recognised in the development of a eucalyptus plant: the \u2018seedling\u2019, \u2018juvenile\u2019, \u2018intermediate\u2019, and \u2018adult\u2019 phases. However, no definite transitional point occurs between the phases. The intermediate phase, when the largest leaves are often formed, links the juvenile and adult phases.<ref name=FieldGuide>Brooker & Kleinig (2001)</ref>\n\nIn all except a few species, the leaves form in pairs on opposite sides of a square stem, consecutive pairs being at right angles to each other (decussate). In some narrow-leaved species, for example ''[[Eucalyptus oleosa|E. oleosa]]'', the seedling leaves after the second leaf pair are often clustered in a detectable [[spiral]] arrangement about a five-sided stem. After the spiral phase, which may last from several to many nodes, the arrangement reverts to decussate by the absorption of some of the leaf-bearing faces of the stem. In those species with opposite adult foliage the leaf pairs, which have been formed opposite at the stem apex, become separated at their bases by unequal elongation of the stem to produce the apparently alternate adult leaves.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Flowers ===\nThe most readily recognisable characteristics of eucalyptus species are the distinctive flowers and fruit (capsules or \"gumnuts\"). Flowers have numerous fluffy [[stamen]]s which may be white, cream, yellow, pink, or red; in bud, the stamens are enclosed in a cap known as an [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] which is composed of the fused sepals or petals, or both. Thus, flowers have no petals, but instead decorate themselves with the many showy stamens. As the stamens expand, the operculum is forced off, splitting away from the cup-like base of the flower; this is one of the features that unites the genus. The woody fruits or capsules are roughly cone-shaped and have valves at the end which open to release the seeds, which are waxy, rod-shaped, about 1&nbsp;mm in length, and yellow-brown in colour. Most species do not flower until adult foliage starts to appear; ''E. cinerea'' and ''E. perriniana'' are notable exceptions.{{Citation needed|reason=This section lacks citations|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThe genus ''Eucalyptus'' was first formally described in 1789 by [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle]] who published the description in his book ''Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum'' along with a description of the [[Type (biology)|type species]], ''[[Eucalyptus obliqua]]''.<ref name=APNI>{{cite web|title=''Eucalyptus''|url= https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/455721 |publisher=APNI|accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"l'Herit.\">{{cite book |last1=L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle |first1=Charles Louis |title=Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum |date=1789 |publisher=Petri Francisci Didot |location=Paris |page=11 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43456#page/35/mode/1up |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> The name ''Eucalyptus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''eu'' meaning \"good\", \"well\", \"true\", \"beautiful\" or \"very\"<ref name=\"RWB\">{{cite book|authorlink1=Roland W.

He collected the specimen on [[Bruny Island]] and sent it to de Brutelle who was working in [[London]] at that time.<ref name=\"CANBR\" />\n\n==Distribution==\nThere are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of [[New Guinea]] and [[Indonesia]]. One species, ''[[Eucalyptus deglupta]],'' ranges as far north as the [[Philippines]]. Of the 15 species found outside Australia, just nine are exclusively non-Australian. Species of eucalyptus are cultivated widely in the tropical and temperate world,  including the [[Americas]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]], the [[Mediterranean Basin]], the [[Middle East]], [[China]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]]. However, the range over which many eucalypts can be planted in the temperate zone is constrained by their limited cold tolerance.<ref name=\"Sellers1910\" />\n\nAustralia is covered by {{convert|92000000|ha|acre|0}} of eucalypt forest, comprising three quarters of the area covered by native forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/forestsaustralia/profiles/eucalypt-forest|title=Eucalypt forest|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|year=2017}}</ref> The [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] of southeastern Australia have been a centre of eucalypt diversification;<ref name = \"UNESCO_BlueMountains\">{{cite web |url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/917|title= Greater Blue Mountains Area|date= 2019|website= whc.unesco.org|publisher= UNESCO World Heritage Centre|access-date= 2019-05-11}}</ref> their name is in reference to the blue haze prevalent in the area, believed derived from the volatile [[terpenoid]]s emitted by these trees.<ref name=\"Bohlmann2008\">{{cite journal|last1= Bohlmann|first1= J.|last2= Keeling|first2=C.

The oldest reliably dated macrofossil of ''Eucalyptus'' is a 21-million-year-old tree-stump encased in basalt in the upper Lachlan Valley in [[New South Wales]]. Other fossils have been found, but many are either unreliably dated or else unreliably identified.<ref name=\"Hill, R. S 1994\">Hill, R. S. \"The history of selected Australian taxa.\" History of the Australian vegetation: Cretaceous to Recent (1994): 390.</ref>\n\nIt is useful to consider where ''Eucalyptus'' fossils have not been found. Extensive research has gone into the fossil floras of the [[Paleocene]] to [[Oligocene]] of South-Eastern Australia, and has failed to uncover a single ''Eucalyptus'' specimen. Although the evidence is sparse, the best hypothesis is that in the mid-Tertiary, the contintental margins of Australia only supported more mesic noneucalypt vegetation, and that eucalypts probably contributed to the drier vegetation of the arid continental interior. With the progressive drying out of the continent since the [[Miocene]], eucalypts were displaced to the continental margins, and much of the mesic and rainforest vegetation that was once there was eliminated entirely.<ref name=\"Hill, R. S 1994\"/>\n\nThe current superdominance of ''Eucalyptus'' in Australia may be an artefact of human influence on its ecology. In more recent sediments, numerous findings of a dramatic increase in the abundance of ''Eucalyptus'' pollen are associated with increased charcoal levels. Though this occurs at different rates throughout Australia, it is compelling evidence for a relationship between the artificial increase of fire frequency with the arrival of Aboriginals and increased prevalence of this exceptionally fire-tolerant genus.<ref name=\"Hill, R. S 1994\"/>\n\n==Species and hybridism==\nOver 700 [[species]] of ''Eucalyptus'' are known; refer to the '''[[List of Eucalyptus species|List of ''Eucalyptus'' species]]''' for a comprehensive list of species. Some have [[divergent evolution|diverged]] from the mainstream of the [[genus]] to the extent that they are quite isolated [[genetics|genetically]] and are able to be recognised by only a few relatively invariant characteristics. Most, however, may be regarded as belonging to large or small groups of related species, which are often in geographical contact with each other and between which [[gene]] exchange still occurs. In these situations, many species appear to grade into one another, and intermediate forms are common. In other words, some species are relatively fixed genetically, as expressed in their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], while others have not diverged completely from their nearest relatives.\n\nHybrid individuals have not always been recognised as such on first collection and some have been named as new species, such as ''E. chrysantha'' (''E. preissiana'' \u00d7 ''E. sepulcralis'') and ''E.'' \"rivalis\" (''E. marginata'' \u00d7 ''E. megacarpa''). Hybrid combinations are not particularly common in the field, but some other published species frequently seen in Australia have been suggested to be hybrid combinations. For example, ''E. erythrandra'' is believed to be ''E. angulosa'' \u00d7 ''E. teraptera'' and due to its wide distribution is often referred to in texts.<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\n[[Renantherin]], a phenolic compound present in the leaves of some eucalyptus species, allows [[chemotaxonomy|chemotaxonomic]] discrimination in the sections [[renantheroideae]] and [[renantherae]]<ref>Polyphenols in the leaves of eucalyptus: A chemotaxonomic survey\u2014II. : The sections renantheroideae and renantherae.

Due to their fast growth, the foremost benefit of these trees is their wood. They can be chopped off at the root and grow back again. They provide many desirable characteristics for use as [[Ornamental plant|ornament]], timber, firewood and pulpwood. Eucaplytus wood is also used in a number of industries, from fence posts (where the oil-rich wood's high resistance to decay is valued) and charcoal to [[cellulose]] extraction for [[biofuel]]s. Fast growth also makes eucalypts suitable as [[windbreak]]s and to reduce [[erosion]].\n\nSome eucalyptus species have attracted attention from horticulturists, [[development economics|global development]] researchers, and environmentalists because of desirable traits such as being fast-growing sources of wood, producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural [[insecticide]], or an ability to be used to drain [[swamp]]s and thereby reduce the risk of [[malaria]]. [[Eucalyptus oil]] finds many uses like in fuels, fragrances, insect repellance and antimicrobial activity. Eucalyptus trees show [[allelopathic]] effects; they release compounds which inhibit other plant species from growing nearby. Outside their natural ranges, eucalypts are both lauded for their beneficial economic impact on poor populations<ref name=Peruvian/><ref name=Timbuktu/>{{Rp|22|date=May 2009}} and criticised for being \"water-guzzling\" [[Invasive species|aliens]],<ref name=invasive/> leading to controversy over their total impact.<ref name=SantosProblems/>\n\nEucalypts draw a tremendous amount of water from the soil through the process of [[transpiration]].

Much of California is similar in climate to parts of Australia. By the early 1900s, thousands of acres of eucalypts were planted with the encouragement of the state government. It was hoped that they would provide a renewable source of timber for construction, furniture making and [[railway sleeper]]s.  It was soon found that for the latter purpose eucalyptus was particularly unsuitable, as the ties made from eucalyptus had a tendency to twist while drying, and the dried ties were so tough that it was nearly impossible to hammer [[Rail fastening system|rail spikes]] into them.\n\n<blockquote>They went on to note that the promise of eucalyptus in California was based on the old virgin forests of Australia. This was a mistake, as the young trees being harvested in California could not compare in quality to the centuries-old eucalyptus timber of Australia. It reacted differently to harvest. The older trees didn't split or warp as the infant California crop did. There was a vast difference between the two, and this would doom the California eucalyptus industry.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://library.csustan.edu/sites/default/files/Bob_Santos-The_Eucalyptus_of_California.pdf |first=Robert L. |last=Santos |publisher=California State University |title= The Eucalyptus of California: Seeds of Good or Seeds of Evil? |year=1997 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOne way in which the eucalyptus, mainly the blue gum ''[[Eucalyptus globulus|E. globulus]]'', proved valuable in California was in providing windbreaks for highways, orange groves, and farms in the mostly treeless [[Central Valley (California)|central part of the state]]. They are also admired as shade and ornamental trees in many cities and gardens.\n\n''Eucalyptus'' plantations in California have been criticised, because they compete with native plants and do not support native animals. Fire is also a problem. The 1991 [[Oakland firestorm of 1991|Oakland Hills firestorm]], which destroyed almost 3,000 homes and killed 25 people, was partly fuelled by large numbers of eucalypts close to the houses.<ref>{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Ted |title=America's Largest Weed |publisher=Audubon Magazine |date=January 2002 |url=http://magazine.audubon.org/incite/incite0201.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708221528/http://magazine.audubon.org/incite/incite0201.html |archivedate=2006-07-08 }}</ref>\n\nIn some parts of California, eucalypt plantations are being removed and native trees and plants restored.

Lussich also introduced many other trees, particularly ''[[Acacia]]'' and [[pine]]s, but they have not expanded so extensively.\n\nUruguayan forestry crops using eucalyptus species have been promoted since 1989, when the new National Forestry Law established that 20% of the national territory would be dedicated to forestry.

Menelik II endorsed its planting around his new capital city of [[Addis Ababa]] because of the massive [[deforestation]] around the city for [[firewood]]. According to Richard R.K. Pankhurst, \"The great advantage of the eucalypts was that they were fast growing, required little attention and when cut down grew up again from the roots; it could be harvested every ten years.

Pankhurst reports that the most common species found in Addis Ababa in the mid-1960s was ''[[Eucalyptus globulus|E. globulus]]'', although he also found ''[[Eucalyptus melliodora|E. melliodora]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus rostrata (disambiguation)|E. rostrata]]'' in significant numbers. David Buxton, writing of central Ethiopia in the mid-1940s, observed that eucalyptus trees \"have become an integral -- and a pleasing -- element in the [[Shewa|Shoan]] landscape and has largely displaced the slow-growing native 'cedar' ''[[Juniperus procera]]'').\"<ref>David Buxton, ''Travels in Ethiopia'', second edition (London: Benn, 1957), p. 48</ref>\n\nIt was commonly believed that the thirst of the ''Eucalyptus'' \"tended to dry up rivers and wells\", creating such opposition to the species that in 1913 a proclamation was issued ordering a partial destruction of all standing trees, and their replacement with [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] trees. Pankhurst reports, \"The proclamation however remained a dead letter; there is no evidence of eucalypts being uprooted, still less of mulberry trees being planted.\"<ref>Pankhurst p. 247</ref> Eucalypts remain a defining feature of Addis Ababa.\n\n'''Madagascar'''.

The resulting monocultures have raised concerns about loss of biological diversity, through loss of [[acorn]]s that [[mammal]]s and birds feed on, absence of hollows that in oak trees provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and small mammals and for bee colonies, as well as lack of downed trees in managed plantations. A study of the relationship between birds and eucalyptus in the San Francisco Bay Area found that bird diversity was similar in native forest versus eucalyptus forest, but the species were different.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Equal diversity in disparate species assemblages: a comparison of native and exotic woodlands in California |author= Sax, Dov F. |year=2002 |journal=Global Ecology & Biogeography |pages=49\u201357 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1046/j.1466-822X.2001.00262.x |volume=11 }}</ref> One way in which the avifauna (local assortment of bird species) changes is that cavity-nesting birds including woodpeckers, owls, chickadees, wood ducks, etc. are [[depauperate]] in eucalyptus groves because the decay-resistant wood of these trees prevents cavity formation by decay or excavation. Also, those bird species that glean insects from foliage, such as warblers and vireos, experience population declines when eucalyptus groves replace oak forest. \n\nBirds that thrive in eucalyptus groves in California tend to prefer tall vertical habitat.  These avian species include herons and egrets (possibly because redwood trees are less available), or they have longer bills, which may play a role in preventing their nostrils from being clogged by eucalyptus resin/pitch.<ref>{{cite report |title=Birds and Eucalyptus on the Central California Coast: A Love-Hate Relationship |author=David L.

There they collected specimens of ''E. gummifera'' and later, near the [[Endeavour River]] in northern ''Queensland'', ''E. platyphylla''; neither of these species was named as such at the time.\n\nIn 1777, on Cook's third expedition, David Nelson collected a eucalypt on [[Bruny Island]] in southern [[Tasmania]]. This specimen was taken to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], and was named ''Eucalyptus obliqua'' by the French botanist [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle|L'H\u00e9ritier]], who was working in London at the time.<ref>{{ cite book | last=L'H\u00e9ritier | first=Charles Louis  | author-link=Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle | year=1788 | title=Sertum Anglicum, seu, Plantae rariores quae in hortis juxta Londinum : imprimis in horto regio Kewensi excoluntur, ab anno 1786 ad annum 1787 observatae  | place=Paris | publisher=Petri Francisci Didot | page=11 | language=Latin | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/11832429 }}</ref> He coined the generic name from the Greek roots ''eu'' and ''calyptos'', meaning \"well\" and \"covered\" in reference to the [[operculum (botany)|operculum]] of the flower bud which protects the developing flower parts as the flower develops and is shed by the pressure of the emerging [[stamens]] at flowering. It was most likely an accident that L'H\u00e9ritier chose a feature common to all eucalypts.\n\nThe name ''obliqua'' was derived from the Latin ''obliquus'', meaning \"oblique\", which is the [[botany|botanical]] term describing a [[leaf]] base where the two sides of the leaf blade are of unequal length and do not meet the petiole at the same place.\n\n''E. obliqua'' was published in 1788-89, which coincided with the first official European settlement of Australia. Between then and the turn of the 19th century, several more species of ''Eucalyptus'' were named and published. Most of these were by the English botanist [[James Edward Smith]] and most were, as might be expected, trees of the [[Sydney]] region. These include the economically valuable ''E. pilularis'', ''E. saligna'' and ''E. tereticornis''.\n\nThe first endemic Western Australian ''Eucalyptus'' to be collected and subsequently named was the Yate (''[[Eucalyptus cornuta|E. cornuta]]'') by the French botanist [[Jacques Labillardi\u00e8re]], who collected in what is now the [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] area in 1792.<ref name=FieldGuide/>\n\nSeveral Australian botanists were active during the 19th century, particularly [[Ferdinand von Mueller]], whose work on ''eucalypts'' contributed greatly to the first comprehensive account of the genus in [[George Bentham]]'s ''Flora Australiensis'' in 1867. The account is the most important early systematic treatment of the genus. Bentham divided it into five series whose distinctions were based on characteristics of the stamens, particularly the anthers (Mueller, 1879\u201384), work elaborated by [[Joseph Henry Maiden]] (1903\u201333) and still further by William Faris Blakely (1934). The anther system became too complex to be workable and more recent systematic work has concentrated on the characteristics of buds, fruits, leaves and bark.\n\n==Photo gallery==\n<gallery>\n<!-- Please only add pictures where the species or variety of tree has been identified and the location \u2014 there are many varieties of eucalyptus and it is not encyclopaedic to say merely \"eucalyptus\"-->\nFile:E.sideroxylon, branchlets, stems, leaves, capsules & buds.jpg|''[[Eucalyptus sideroxylon]]'', showing fruit (capsules) and buds with [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] present.\nFile:Bach dan.jpg|''Eucalyptus'' forest in [[Shire of East Gippsland|East Gippsland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].
