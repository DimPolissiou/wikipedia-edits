The electorate was first formed for the {{NZ election link|1866}} and has been abolished three times during its history. It was last re-established for the {{NZ election link|2008}} and has since been held by [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].\n\n==Region and population centres==\nThe electorate is mainly rural, stretching from the [[Southern Alps]] to the [[Banks Peninsula]], its borders broadly defined by the [[Rakaia River]] in the south and the [[Waimakariri River]] in the north. Major towns include [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]], [[Lincoln, New Zealand|Lincoln]], [[Prebbleton]], and [[Darfield, New Zealand|Darfield]], with smaller towns such as [[Tai Tapu]], [[Leeston]] and [[Dunsandel]]. The electorate also includes parts of [[Christchurch]] city's territorial authority.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Existence and changes to area ===\nAn electorate called Selwyn existed between [[1866 New Zealand general election|1866]] and [[1919 New Zealand general election|1919]]. A Selwyn electorate also existed between [[1946 New Zealand general election|1946]] and [[1972 New Zealand general election|1972]] and again from [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978]] until it was absorbed by [[Rakaia (New Zealand electorate)|Rakaia]] for the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=91\u201396}} The latest version of the Selwyn electorate was created for the 2008 election. This followed a review of electoral boundaries conducted after the 2006 Census, because of a general northwards population movement in the South Island. Even though the number of South Island electorates is fixed, the  decline in the population of electorates from Rakaia south has resulted in the boundaries of electorates from [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)|Invercargill]] north to Rakaia shifting further northwards.\n\nDue to the rapid growth of Selwyn relative to Christchurch (which lost population after the earthquakes), the 2013 redistribution had Selwyn losing [[Halswell]] and [[Westmorland, New Zealand|Westmorland]] to [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills]] and Harewood to [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]] while regaining the towns of [[Rakaia]] and [[Chertsey, New Zealand|Chertsey]] back from [[Rangitata (New Zealand electorate)|Rangitata]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Report of the Representation Commission 2014 |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |isbn=978-0-477-10414-2 |publisher=Representation Commission |accessdate=26 September 2014 |page=10 |format=PDF |date=4 April 2014}}</ref> Data from the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]] showed Selywn's population had continued to grow \u2013 it had the largest discrepancy of any electorate \u2013 and so the electorate would need to lose further area for the 2020 boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/116008966/census-new-zealand-to-gain-one-new-seat-in-2020-election|title=Census 2018: New Zealand to gain one new seat in 2020 election|last=Cooke|first=Henry|date=23 September 2019|website=Stuff|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> It shed an area around Hornby South to {{NZ electorate link|Wigram}}, the Banks Peninsula to the recreated {{NZ electorate link|Banks Peninsula}}, the area west of the [[Rakaia]] to {{NZ electorate link|Rangitata}}, and an area around [[Christchurch Airport]] to {{NZ electorate link|Ilam}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Voting history ===\nThe dominant topic for the [[1875\u20131876 New Zealand general election|1875 election]]<!-- election held on 30 December 1875 --> was the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|Provinces]].

The electorate was first formed for the {{NZ election link|1866}} and has been abolished three times during its history. It was last re-established for the {{NZ election link|2008}} and has since been held by [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].\n\n==Region and population centres==\nThe electorate is mainly rural, stretching from the [[Southern Alps]] to the [[Banks Peninsula]], its borders broadly defined by the [[Rakaia River]] in the south and the [[Waimakariri River]] in the north. Major towns include [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]], [[Lincoln, New Zealand|Lincoln]], [[Prebbleton]], and [[Darfield, New Zealand|Darfield]], with smaller towns such as [[Tai Tapu]], [[Leeston]] and [[Dunsandel]]. The electorate also includes parts of [[Christchurch]] city's territorial authority.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Existence and changes to area ===\nAn electorate called Selwyn existed between [[1866 New Zealand general election|1866]] and [[1919 New Zealand general election|1919]]. A Selwyn electorate also existed between [[1946 New Zealand general election|1946]] and [[1972 New Zealand general election|1972]] and again from [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978]] until it was absorbed by [[Rakaia (New Zealand electorate)|Rakaia]] for the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=91\u201396}} The latest version of the Selwyn electorate was created for the 2008 election. This followed a review of electoral boundaries conducted after the 2006 Census, because of a general northwards population movement in the South Island. Even though the number of South Island electorates is fixed, the  decline in the population of electorates from Rakaia south has resulted in the boundaries of electorates from [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)|Invercargill]] north to Rakaia shifting further northwards.\n\nDue to the rapid growth of Selwyn relative to Christchurch (which lost population after the earthquakes), the 2013 redistribution had Selwyn losing [[Halswell]] and [[Westmorland, New Zealand|Westmorland]] to [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills]] and Harewood to [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]] while regaining the towns of [[Rakaia]] and [[Chertsey, New Zealand|Chertsey]] back from [[Rangitata (New Zealand electorate)|Rangitata]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Report of the Representation Commission 2014 |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |isbn=978-0-477-10414-2 |publisher=Representation Commission |accessdate=26 September 2014 |page=10 |format=PDF |date=4 April 2014}}</ref> Data from the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]] showed Selywn's population had continued to grow \u2013 it had the largest discrepancy of any electorate \u2013 and so the electorate would need to lose further area for the 2020 boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/116008966/census-new-zealand-to-gain-one-new-seat-in-2020-election|title=Census 2018: New Zealand to gain one new seat in 2020 election|last=Cooke|first=Henry|date=23 September 2019|website=Stuff|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> It shed an area around Hornby South to {{NZ electorate link|Wigram}}, the Banks Peninsula to the recreated {{NZ electorate link|Banks Peninsula}}, the area west of the [[Rakaia]] to {{NZ electorate link|Rangitata}}, and an area around [[Christchurch Airport]] to {{NZ electorate link|Ilam}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Voting history ===\nThe dominant topic for the [[1875\u20131876 New Zealand general election|1875 election]]<!-- election held on 30 December 1875 --> was the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|Provinces]].

The Miyagawa River has its upper reaches at Mount Odaigahara, the highest mountain in Mie Prefecture (1695m), and its waters are famously pure and clear. The trees making up the environs of Shrines along the way such as Nagashima Shrine and Asuka Shrine are immense. The splendid views of the vast ocean from the tops of mountain passes and from the sands of long beaches are impressive.

Indeed, it was not until the 1980s that much attention was paid to the route used by commoners - the Iseji. Locals had realised the historic importance of the route in the 1970s and had travelled into the mountains and repaired the old trails. They started to participate in \u201cKod\u014d Walking\u201d weekends where the old trails, their nature and views were enjoyed.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Ajiki|first=Kazuhiro|title=\u300e\u6771\u7d00\u5dde\u300f\u300e\u4e2d\u90e8\u570f\u300fJapanese Geography Volume 7 Chubu Area, East Kishu|publisher=Asakura Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-4-254-16767-2|location=|pages=373-381}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994 Mie Prefecture and the eight cities, towns and villages of the Eastern Kishu area formed a committee to consider the restoration of the old Kumano Kodo Iseji. A detailed study of the old road was commenced. Even so the energy devoted to this project through the UNESCO World Heritage Listing Project was far less than the energy devoted by Wakayama and Nara Prefectures. However, an article about the importance of the Iseji in the magazine \u201cIsejin\u201d (a magazine dealing with the culture of the Ise area) caught the imagination of locals and was responsible for the energy which would eventually lead to Iseji\u2019s including in the UNESCO listing. The problem was actually part of the charm of the Iseji in that locals considered the old pilgrimage route as so integral to their lives that they did not even consider a world heritage listing was possible.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn 10 February 2007 the Mie Prefecture Kumano Kod\u014d Center was opened in Mukai, Owase City.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Orito|first=Atsuko|title=\u300c\u4e09\u91cd\u770c\u7acb\u718a\u91ce\u53e4\u9053\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u2015\u718a\u91ce\u53e4\u9053\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u9054\u306b\u3088\u308b\u718a\u91ce\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u767a\u4fe1\u300d\u300eCREC\u300f\"CREC\" No. 158  Mie Prefecture Kumano Kodo Center - features of the Kumano Kodo Iseji as described by Kumano Kodo Specialists.|publisher=Chubu Development Centre|year=2007|isbn=|location=NAID 40015366396|pages=85-92}}</ref> The Center acts as the Eastern gate to the area of the UNESCO \u201cSacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.\u201d It also acts as a research centre for the protection and use of the Iseji and a museum for visitors about the Iseji\u2019s history, nature, and culture.

The food available along the way changes too. The Ise Plain produces high quality rice for the table and for Sake making. The Oku-Ise mountains produce high quality tea. And the plateaus among the mountains are famous for dairy and ice cream. Along the Kumano coastline are a myriad of fishing villages and plentiful catches. The mountains also produce wild boar and deer meat.

Indeed, it was not until the 1980s that much attention was paid to the route used by commoners - the Iseji. Locals had realised the historic importance of the route in the 1970s and had travelled into the mountains and repaired the old trails. They started to participate in \u201cKod\u014d Walking\u201d weekends where the old trails, their nature and views were enjoyed.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Ajiki|first=Kazuhiro|title=\u300e\u6771\u7d00\u5dde\u300f\u300e\u4e2d\u90e8\u570f\u300fJapanese Geography Volume 7 Chubu Area, East Kishu|publisher=Asakura Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-4-254-16767-2|location=|pages=373-381}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994 Mie Prefecture and the eight cities, towns and villages of the Eastern Kishu area formed a committee to consider the restoration of the old Kumano Kodo Iseji. A detailed study of the old road was commenced. Even so the energy devoted to this project through the UNESCO World Heritage Listing Project was far less than the energy devoted by Wakayama and Nara Prefectures. However, an article about the importance of the Iseji in the magazine \u201cIsejin\u201d (a magazine dealing with the culture of the Ise area) caught the imagination of locals and was responsible for the energy which would eventually lead to Iseji\u2019s including in the UNESCO listing. The problem was actually part of the charm of the Iseji in that locals considered the old pilgrimage route as so integral to their lives that they did not even consider a world heritage listing was possible.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn 10 February 2007 the Mie Prefecture Kumano Kod\u014d Center was opened in Mukai, Owase City.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Orito|first=Atsuko|title=\u300c\u4e09\u91cd\u770c\u7acb\u718a\u91ce\u53e4\u9053\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u2015\u718a\u91ce\u53e4\u9053\u306e\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u9054\u306b\u3088\u308b\u718a\u91ce\u306e\u9b45\u529b\u767a\u4fe1\u300d\u300eCREC\u300f\"CREC\" No. 158  Mie Prefecture Kumano Kodo Center - features of the Kumano Kodo Iseji as described by Kumano Kodo Specialists.|publisher=Chubu Development Centre|year=2007|isbn=|location=NAID 40015366396|pages=85-92}}</ref> The Center acts as the Eastern gate to the area of the UNESCO \u201cSacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.\u201d It also acts as a research centre for the protection and use of the Iseji and a museum for visitors about the Iseji\u2019s history, nature, and culture.

The food available along the way changes too. The Ise Plain produces high quality rice for the table and for Sake making. The Oku-Ise mountains produce high quality tea. And the plateaus among the mountains are famous for dairy and ice cream. Along the Kumano coastline are a myriad of fishing villages and plentiful catches. The mountains also produce wild boar and deer meat.

It was designed by the [[type designer|typographer]] [[Hermann Zapf]] in 1978 and licensed by [[International Typeface Corporation]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1977, Zapf created about 1000 (or over 1200 according to Linotype) sketches of signs and symbols. ITC chose from those a subset of 360 symbols, ornaments and typographic elements based on the original designs, which became known as ITC Zapf Dingbats. The font first gained wide distribution when ITC Zapf Dingbats, which consists of the subset chosen by ITC, became one of 35 PostScript fonts built into Apple's [[LaserWriter|LaserWriter Plus]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} \n\nWhen ITC Zapf Dingbats was first announced in [[International Typeface Corporation#U&lc magazine|''U&lc'' magazine]], volume 5-2,<ref>[http://uandlc.com/PDF/Volume%205-2%20%28Low%20Res%29.pdf U&lc. magazine volume 5-2]</ref> the family was divided into the 100 series (ITC-100), 200 series (ITC-200), 300 series (ITC-300). Each series contains 120 symbols.\n\n==ITC Zapf Dingbats Std==\nIt is an OpenType version of the font family, based on the PostScript variant of the font. The [[glyphs]] are mapped to the corresponding Unicode code points. The family consists of 1 font (ITC Zapf Dingbats Medium) with 204 glyphs.\n\n==Availability==\nThe ITC glyph set is included in [[Unicode]] and it is one of the \"Basic 14\" typefaces guaranteed to be available for [[PDF]] files.\n\nZapfDingbats, the [[PostScript]] version of ITC Zapf Dingbats, is distributed with [[Acrobat Reader]] 5 and 5.1.\n\n==Zapf Essentials==\nZapf Essentials is an update to the Zapf Dingbats family which consists of 6 symbol-encoded fonts categorized in Arrows One (black arrows), Arrows Two (white arrows, patterned arrows), Communication (pointing fingers, communication devices), Markers (squares, triangles, circles, ticks, hearts, crosses, check marks, leaves), Office (pen, clock, currency, scissors, hand), Ornaments (flowers, stars), for a total of 372 glyphs. However, not all ITC Zapf Dingbats glyphs are included in the Zapf Essentials collections (e.g.: airplane, letter).<ref>[http://www.linotype.com/1830/adynamicversatilesymbolfontbyhermannzapf.html

Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]], radical editor of experimental music magazine ''[[Ray Gun (magazine)|Ray Gun]]'', lent the font a degree of notoriety in 1994 when he printed an interview with [[Bryan Ferry]] in the magazine entirely in the symbols-only font \u2013 the double-page spread was of course, quite illegible and would have to be interpreted like a [[cryptogram]] for those unfamiliar with the font. He said he did it because the interview was \"incredibly boring\" and that upon searching his typeface collection for a suitable font and ending at Zapf Dingbats, decided to use it with hopes of making the article interesting again.<ref name=\"HelveticaFilm\">[https://www.hustwit.com/helvetica/ Helvetica], 2007 film by [[Gary Hustwit]].</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.linotype.com/5610838/itc-zapf-dingbats-family.html ITC Zapf Dingbats Font Family - by Hermann Zapf]\n*[http://www.linotype.com/en/1460/linotypezapfessentials.html Linotype Zapf Essentials]\n*[https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/DINGBATS.TXT Zapf Dingbats to Unicode mapping] - provided to the Unicode Consortium by Apple.\n*[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2700.pdf Official Unicode Dingbats block code chart] (contains the Zapf Dingbats characters, except those that had already been present in Unicode) - Unicode.org, PDF format\n{{MacOS typefaces}}\n\n[[Category:International Typeface Corporation typefaces]]\n[[Category:Symbol typefaces]]\n[[Category:Typefaces and fonts introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Typefaces designed by Hermann Zapf]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox font\n| name = Zapf Dingbats\n| image = Zapf Dingbats sample.tiff\n| style = [[Dingbat]]s\n| date = 1978\n| creator = [[Hermann Zapf]]\n| foundry = [[International Typeface Corporation|ITC]]\n}}\n{{Infobox character encoding\n|name = Zapf Dingbats Encoding\n|definitions = [https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/APPLE/DINGBATS.TXT Mac OS Dingbats]<br />[https://unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/ADOBE/zdingbat.txt Adobe Zapf Dingbats]\n|alias = <code>x-mac-dingbats</code><ref>[https://l0.cm/encodings/test7/safari_x-mac-dingbats.html Safari x-mac-dingbats]</ref>\n|image = \n|caption = \n|lang = [[Dingbat]] ornaments\n|otherrelated = '''Other dingbats:''' [[Webdings]], [[Wingdings]]<br/>'''Other PS Pi fonts:''' [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]\n|classification = [[PostScript fonts#Core Font Set|PostScript core]] [[pi font]]\n}}\n\n'''ITC Zapf Dingbats''' is one of the more common [[dingbat]] [[typeface]]s. It was designed by the [[type designer|typographer]] [[Hermann Zapf]] in 1978 and licensed by [[International Typeface Corporation]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1977, Zapf created about 1000 (or over 1200 according to Linotype) sketches of signs and symbols. ITC chose from those a subset of 360 symbols, ornaments and typographic elements based on the original designs, which became known as ITC Zapf Dingbats. The font first gained wide distribution when ITC Zapf Dingbats, which consists of the subset chosen by ITC, became one of 35 PostScript fonts built into Apple's [[LaserWriter|LaserWriter Plus]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} \n\nWhen ITC Zapf Dingbats was first announced in [[International Typeface Corporation#U&lc magazine|''U&lc'' magazine]], volume 5-2,<ref>[http://uandlc.com/PDF/Volume%205-2%20%28Low%20Res%29.pdf U&lc. magazine volume 5-2]</ref> the family was divided into the 100 series (ITC-100), 200 series (ITC-200), 300 series (ITC-300). Each series contains 120 symbols.\n\n==ITC Zapf Dingbats Std==\nIt is an OpenType version of the font family, based on the PostScript variant of the font. The [[glyphs]] are mapped to the corresponding Unicode code points. The family consists of 1 font (ITC Zapf Dingbats Medium) with 204 glyphs.\n\n==Availability==\nThe ITC glyph set is included in [[Unicode]] and it is one of the \"Basic 14\" typefaces guaranteed to be available for [[PDF]] files.\n\nZapfDingbats, the [[PostScript]] version of ITC Zapf Dingbats, is distributed with [[Acrobat Reader]] 5 and 5.1.\n\n==Zapf Essentials==\nZapf Essentials is an update to the Zapf Dingbats family which consists of 6 symbol-encoded fonts categorized in Arrows One (black arrows), Arrows Two (white arrows, patterned arrows), Communication (pointing fingers, communication devices), Markers (squares, triangles, circles, ticks, hearts, crosses, check marks, leaves), Office (pen, clock, currency, scissors, hand), Ornaments (flowers, stars), for a total of 372 glyphs. However, not all ITC Zapf Dingbats glyphs are included in the Zapf Essentials collections (e.g.: airplane, letter).<ref>[http://www.linotype.com/1830/adynamicversatilesymbolfontbyhermannzapf.html
