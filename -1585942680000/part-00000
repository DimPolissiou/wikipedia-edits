The series of [[primaries]], [[caucuses]], and state conventions will culminate in the national convention, where the delegates cast their votes to formally select a candidate. A simple majority (1,990) of the total delegate votes (3,979) is required to become the party's nominee. Currently, no candidate has achieved this threshold.\n\nThe campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination began on July 28, 2017, when [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|Maryland Congressman]] [[John Delaney (Maryland politician)|John Delaney]] became the first Democratic presidential candidate to announce his run for [[President of the United States|President]]. By April 2019, more than 20 major candidates were recognized by national and state polls, causing the field of 2020 major Democratic presidential candidates to exceed the field of major candidates in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries]] as the largest presidential candidate field for any single U.S. political party in a single election cycle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/biden-entry-makes-2020-democrats-the-largest-presidential-field-in-history|title=Biden entry makes 20 Democrats in 2020: The largest presidential field in history|date=April 24, 2019|website=Washington Examiner}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5607309/democratic-primaries-with-most-candidates/|title=What the 2020 Democrats Can Learn From One of the Most Crowded Primary Fields in History|website=Time}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/may/02/big-democratic-primary-field-what-need/|title=PolitiFact - The record-setting 2020 Democratic primary field: What you need to know|website=@politifact}}</ref> With the addition of [[Michael Bloomberg]] on November 24, 2019, the total number of major Democratic presidential candidates in the 2020 Democratic primaries totaled 29.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/democratic-party-candidates-running-2020-election/|title=How the Massive Democratic Field Shrank to a Handful of Front-Runners|work=[[Bloomberg News]]|author1=Lauren Leatherby|author2=Paul Murray|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>  \n\nWhen voting began in the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|2020 Iowa caucuses]], 11 major candidates were actively campaigning.

{"title_page": "Tape (play)", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{unreferenced|date=July 2011}}\n'''''Tape''''' is a 1999 [[Play (theatre)|play]] by [[Stephen Belber]]. It was first produced at the [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] as part of the 2000 [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]]. It was later filmed by [[Richard Linklater]] as [[Tape (film)|''Tape'']] starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Robert Sean Leonard]], and [[Uma Thurman]]. It follows [[classical unities]] of action, time and space, featuring three characters in a single [[plot (narrative)|plot]] regarding their differing perspectives of past events, in one unbroken period of real-time, in a single motel room set.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Tape'' is set in a motel room in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. Vince, an outgoing [[drug dealer]]/[[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighter]], is in town to support his old high school friend's entry into the Lansing [[film festival]].\n\nHis friend, [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[filmmaker]] Jon Saltzman, joins Vince in his motel room and the two begin to reminisce about their high school years. They get on the subject of Amy Randall, Vince's former girlfriend. It appears that whilst they dated for some time, Vince and Amy never had [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. However, after their relationship had ended, Amy had slept with Jon. Naturally, Vince was hurt even though he and Amy had broken up some time previously.\n\nVince claims Amy had told him that Jon had [[date rape]]d her. Vince becomes obsessed with, and eventually succeeds in getting a verbal confession from Jon about the alleged rape. Immediately after Jon's admission, Vince pulls out a hidden [[tape recorder]] that had been recording their whole conversation, much to Jon's horror. Vince then tells Jon that he has invited Amy to dinner, and that she will be arriving shortly.\n\nEventually Amy does arrive and even though all three of them feel awkward, they begin to talk. Amy explains that she is now an [[District Attorney|Assistant District Attorney]] in the Lansing Justice Department. Eventually the three discuss what actually happened between Jon and Amy that night at the party.\n\nAmy claims that it was merely rough sex and that Jon did not rape her, leading Jon to believe that she is in denial. After Jon becomes annoyed that Amy is refusing to accept his apology, Amy makes a call with her [[cell phone]] to the local [[police]].

It was first produced at the [[Actors Theatre of Louisville]] as part of the 2000 [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]]. It was later filmed by [[Richard Linklater]] as [[Tape (film)|''Tape'']] starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Robert Sean Leonard]], and [[Uma Thurman]]. It follows [[classical unities]] of action, time and space, featuring three characters in a single [[plot (narrative)|plot]] regarding their differing perspectives of past events, in one unbroken period of real-time, in a single motel room set.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Tape'' is set in a motel room in [[Lansing, Michigan]]. Vince, an outgoing [[drug dealer]]/[[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighter]], is in town to support his old high school friend\u2019s entry into the Lansing [[film festival]].\n\nHis friend, [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[filmmaker]] Jon Saltzman, joins Vince in his motel room and the two begin to reminisce about their high school years. They get on the subject of Amy Randall, Vince's former girlfriend. It appears that whilst they dated for some time, Vince and Amy never had [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. However, after their relationship had ended, Amy had slept with Jon. Naturally, Vince was hurt even though he and Amy had broken up some time previously.\n\nVince claims Amy had told him that Jon had [[date rape]]d her. Vince becomes obsessed with, and eventually succeeds in getting a verbal confession from Jon about the alleged rape. Immediately after Jon's admission, Vince pulls out a hidden [[tape recorder]] that had been recording their whole conversation, much to Jon's horror. Vince then tells Jon that he has invited Amy to dinner, and that she will be arriving shortly.\n\nEventually Amy does arrive and even though all three of them feel awkward, they begin to talk. Amy explains that she is now an [[District Attorney|Assistant District Attorney]] in the Lansing Justice Department. Eventually the three discuss what actually happened between Jon and Amy that night at the party.\n\nAmy claims that it was merely rough sex and that Jon did not rape her, leading Jon to believe that she is in denial. After Jon becomes annoyed that Amy is refusing to accept his apology, Amy makes a call with her [[cell phone]] to the local [[police]]. She asks for a squad car to pick up one person in possession of [[Drug abuse|drugs]] (Vince), and one in relation to a verifiable rape (Jon). After concluding her phone call, Amy warns the men that they only have about four minutes to make a run for it.\n\nIn order to prove to Amy that he is truly remorseful, Jon decides to stay and wait for the police. Vince, realizing that there is nowhere for him to run, flushes his [[narcotics]] down the toilet.\n\nAmy reveals that she didn't really call the police, and leaves.\n\n==Notable Performances==\n*[[New York City]] 2002 produced by [[Naked Angels Theater Company]] at the [[Jose Quintero Theater]] with Dominic Fumusa, Josh Stamberg and Alison West.\n*[[Dublin]] 2002 produced by [[AboutFACE Theatre Company]] at [[Theatre@36]] with Paul Nugent, Anna Olson and Alan Walsh.\n*[[Soho Theatre]], [[London]], 2003 with the original NY cast.\n*[[New York City]] 2008 produced by [[The Group Theatre Too]] at [[the 78th street theatre lab]] with Alex Maxwell, Nicky Romaniello and Cristina Marie\n*[[New York City]] 2010 produced by Duel Theatre at [[Center Stage, NY]] with Brandon McMillen, James Savage, and Jessiee Datino\n*[[Milwaukee]] 2010 produced by Pink Banana Theatre at ([[Site-specific theatre|site specific]]) Best Western Inn Towne, WI with Matt Kemple, Robb Maass, and Gwen Zupan\n*[[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]], [[Massachusetts]] 2011 produced by the [[Williamstown Theatre Festival]] as part of their Workshop Season\n*[[Pauper's Pit Theatre]], [[Buxton]] 2008 \u2013 nominated for 'Best Production\u2019 at Buxton Festival Fringe Awards.

SBA covers 948 acres (384 ha) of land.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nIt is near the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and the city of [[Goleta, California|Goleta]]. The airport was annexed to the city of Santa Barbara by a {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} long, {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}} wide corridor, mostly under the Pacific Ocean (a [[shoestring annexation]]).  Most of the airport is 10 to 15 feet above sea level and borders a [[wetland]] area, the [[Goleta Slough]].\n[[File:Santa Barbara Airport new terminal.JPG|thumb|Santa Barbara Airport, new terminal]]\nSeven airlines serve or plan to serve the airport as of February 2019 with non-stop flights to Denver, Los Angeles, and San Francisco by [[United Airlines]]; Portland and Seattle by [[Alaska Airlines]]; Phoenix and Dallas/Fort Worth by [[American Airlines]]; Denver by [[Frontier Airlines]]; Minneapolis by [[Sun Country Airlines]]; Oakland, Sacramento, and Las Vegas by [[Contour Airlines]], and Salt Lake City by [[Delta Air Lines|Delta Airlines]]. In 2017, more than 710,000 passengers used the airport.\n\nTwo fixed-base operators{{discuss}} are on the field, Signature Flight Support and Atlantic Aviation, and three flight schools, Above All Aviation, Santa Barbara Aviation Inc. and Spitfire Aviation.{{citation needed|date = October 2017}}\n\nIn addition to regularly scheduled flights offered by other airlines, Santa Barbara Aviation offers on-demand Jet Charter in Cessna Citation CJ aircraft to any destination and [[Surf Air]] flies eight-seat [[Pilatus PC-12]]s to Burbank and San Carlos in California via a membership only, pay-as-you-fly program.<ref>Aviation International News, April 2014 edition, Vol. 46, No. 4, page 66, \"Wave Off at Surf Air\"</ref>\n[[File:KSBA Arrivals.jpg|thumb|Central departure/arrival area (pre-security) at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nSanta Barbara's aviation history began in 1914 when [[Lincoln J. Beachey]] flew an airplane across [[Goleta Valley]]. Two years later the Loughead brothers, who later changed their name to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], established a seaplane factory on State Street ([[Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company]]) and constructed a wooden ramp on West Beach to launch their planes. In 1928, Gordon Sackett and Royce Stetson landed a Hisso-powered airplane in a cow pasture near the corner of Hollister and Fairview Avenues and set up a flight school on the spot. That first airstrip marked the beginning of what was to become the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.\n\nAs airplane manufacturing grew in the late 1930s that airstrip developed into an airfield. Western General set up shop and began producing Meteor airplanes, while Santa Barbara Airways' founder Frederick Stearns II built two additional runways and two large hangars. Stearns also installed the first radio equipment at the airfield.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flysba.com/?pageID=99|title=Santa Barbara - Airport|website=www.flysba.com}}</ref>\n\nAirline flights began in 1932 on '''Pacific Seaboard Air Lines'''.  In 1933, Pacific Seaboard was operating two daily round trip flights with single engine [[Bellanca CH-300]]s Los Angeles - Santa Barbara - Santa Maria - San Luis Obispo - Paso Robles - Monterey - Salinas - San Jose - San Francisco.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, Summer 1933 Pacific Seaboard Air Lines timetable</ref> Pacific Seaboard later moved its entire operation to the eastern U.S. and became [[Chicago and Southern Air Lines]], a large domestic and international airline acquired by and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 1953.<ref>http://www.deltamuseum.org, Chicago and Southern (C&S) Air Lines</ref> [[United Airlines]] began flights from Santa Barbara/Goleta in 1936.\n\nAs war approached the United States Government established a program to build 250 airports across the country on a cost-sharing basis with local governments. [[Thomas M. Storke]] secured Santa Barbara's enrollment in the program, and in 1941 groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.\n\nWith the outbreak of WWII the airport became [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara|MCAS Santa Barbara]] (Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara) in 1942, an aviator training base for the U.S Marines. It was expanded further with the addition of many hangars and other buildings, and reverted to a civilian airport in 1946.<ref name=\"MCAS SB\">[[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Santa Barbara Airport Terminal.jpg|thumb|Original passenger terminal building]]\nThe original Spanish-style terminal building, commissioned by United Airlines in 1942 was designed by William Edwards and Joseph Plunkett, an architectural team whose work, including the [[Arlington Theatre]] and the National Armory, helped shape the Mediterranean style of the city.\n\n===Postwar developments===\nIn 1947 the Santa Barbara Flying Club was formed to promote general aviation in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santabarbaraflyingclub.org/|title=Santa Barbara Flying Club|website=santabarbaraflyingclub.org}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1951 war film ''[[Flying Leathernecks]]'', [[John Wayne]]'s character was stationed in Goleta. The movie references the airbase as being in Goleta because, during World War II, the airbase had not yet been annexed by Santa Barbara. The movie has a short clip of the airport and surrounding area.\n\nThree runways are in use: 7/25 and two parallel runways 15/33. The airport originally had an additional strip: runway 3/21.  The development of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (to the southwest) and the construction of hangars in support of production of the [[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy]] (to the northeast) were factors in the removal of this runway.[[File:KSBA UA320.jpg|thumb|[[United Airlines]] [[Airbus A319|Airbus A319-100]] at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport (KSBA) preparing to board passengers for a return flight to [[Denver International Airport|Denver International Airport (KDEN)]] on December 5th, 2019. ]]\n\n[[Image:AESBA.JPG|thumb|Passengers boarding an [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] [[Saab 340|Saab 340B]] turboprop aircraft for a flight to [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] in October 2008|alt=]]\n\n===Southwest Airways and successors===\n\nUntil 2002, Santa Barbara Airport was on a jet route to San Francisco and Los Angeles.  The airport was served by [[Pacific Air Lines|'''Southwest Airways''']] [[Douglas DC-3]]s and [[Martin 4-0-4]]s and by successors '''[[Pacific Air Lines]]''', '''Air West''' and '''[[Hughes Airwest]]''' with [[Fairchild F-27]]s and [[Boeing 727-100]], [[Douglas DC-9-10]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jets. The Southwest March 1, 1947 timetable lists two round trip [[Douglas DC-3]]s flying Los Angeles-Oxnard-Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-San Luis Obispo-Coalinga-Monterey-Santa Cruz/Watsonville-San Jose-San Francisco.  The first jets were Pacific Air Lines [[Boeing 727-100]]s in 1966; the January 4, 1967 timetable lists 727s flying San Francisco-Monterey-Santa Barbara-Los Angeles. Air West served the airport with the B727-100s formerly operated by Pacific Air Lines while Hughes Airwest served Santa Barbara with [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]s.<ref>February 1, 1976 Official Airlines Guide (OAG), North American edition</ref>\n\n===United===\nThe United Airlines timetable for February 1, 1937 listed a daily [[Douglas DC-3]] Los Angeles-Santa Barbara-San Francisco-Oakland and back.  In 1972 the United timetable listed direct [[Boeing 727-100]]s to New York Newark via [[LAX]] and Milwaukee.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1972 United Airlines timetable</ref>  The primary United routes from Santa Barbara were nonstops to Los Angeles and San Francisco with some continuing to other cities.  The first nonstop flights beyond California were United [[Boeing 727]]s to Denver in 1979 and to Chicago O'Hare in 1980. United ceased mainline jet service to SBA in 1990. [[Shuttle by United]], a division of United Airlines (later renamed [[United Shuttle]]) flew [[Boeing 737-300]]s and [[737-500]]s to San Francisco in the 1990s and early 2000s.  United then turned all service over to [[SkyWest Airlines]] which now operates as [[United Express]]. Service was originally on [[Embraer 120]] aircraft to SFO and LAX and [[Canadair Regional Jet|CRJ200]] to Denver. This was later turned over to a mix of SkyWest CRJ200, CRJ700, and [[Embraer Regional Jet|E175]]. On June 8, 2017 United resumed seasonal mainline service to San Francisco and Denver. Beginning June 4, 2020, United will resume service to Chicago-O'Hare, as a red-eye, using a Boeing 737-700 aircraft.\n\n===American===\n[[American Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]s started flying to [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]] in 1984, some on a triangle route DFW-Burbank-SBA-DFW or DFW-Bakersfield-SBA-DFW.  American also flew MD-80s to [[Chicago O'Hare]] via Ontario.  After American Airlines dropped mainline service to SBA, [[American Eagle Airlines]], its affiliate, began flying [[Saab 340B]]s and later [[Embraer ERJ-140]]s between SBA and LAX. American Eagle flew [[Canadair CRJ-700]]s between SBA and DFW until April 2009. The airline flew SBA-LAX until November 14, 2012 when [[SkyWest Airlines]] ([[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]) took over with [[Canadair CRJ-200]]s. [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] suspended its flights to Los Angeles on March 31, 2014, ending American Airlines service at the airport. With the merger of [[US Airways]] and American, [[American Airlines]] returned to SBA with nonstop [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional jet service to Phoenix.  In June 2016 American Eagle relaunched nonstop service to Dallas/Fort Worth ([[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|DFW]]) on [[Mesa Airlines]] [[Canadair CRJ-900]]s.<ref name=\"keyt.com\">{{cite web |url= http://www.keyt.com/news/new-air-service-begins-to-dallasforth-worth-from-santa-barbara/38086854 |title= New Air Service Begins to Dallas/Forth [sic] Worth from Santa Barbara |date=February 19, 2016 |access-date=February 20, 2016}}</ref> On April 4, 2017 [[American Airlines]] began a seasonal mainline [[Airbus A319]] flight to DFW, the first mainline service since 2015 when [[Frontier Airlines]] left Santa Barbara. In September 2019, the DFW flights have been replaced with two daily Envoy Air E-175's but will upgauge both to A319 aircraft for Summer 2020.\n\n===Alaska===\nAlaska-owned regional airline [[Horizon Air]] was the first Alaska affiliate to connect SBA with Seattle and Portland, flying [[Canadair CRJ-700]]s. From 2008 to 2010, Horizon also connected Santa Barbara non-stop to Sacramento and direct to Portland and/or Seattle. In 2011 [[SkyWest Airlines|Skywest Airlines]] took over the Horizon [[Canadair CRJ-700]] jets and later replaced them with [[Embraer E-Jet family|Embraer E175]]s, replacing Horizon for all Alaska-branded flying into Santa Barbara and continues to operate flights via a capacity purchase agreement with Alaska Airlines. From June 15, 2017 to August 26, 2017, Horizon returned to Santa Barbara by taking over the Seattle route from SkyWest with its own Embraer E175s. On August 27, 2017 Alaska Airlines began mainline service to Santa Barbara for the first time when it took over the Seattle route from Horizon with its own Boeing 737s.\n\n=== Sun Country ===\nSun Country Airlines served Santa Barbara twice weekly between August and December to Minneapolis/St. Paul on Boeing 737s. Service began on August 16, 2018, and ended on December 9, 2018. On May 22, 2019, Sun Country resumed seasonal service with an increase to four times a week for the 2019 season. At the end of the 2019 season, Sun Country has indicated that they do not plan to return in 2020.\n\n=== Frontier ===\nFrontier Airlines flew to Denver until 2015 with the Embraer E-190 and Airbus A319/320. After a multi-year hiatus, Frontier resumed service on August 21, 2018 with three times a week year-round service to Denver on the Airbus A320. In November 2019, they went seasonal and will return June 7, 2020.\n\n=== Contour ===\nContour Airlines began service on October 16, 2018. They fly daily to Oakland International Airport and ten times a week to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport using a fleet of 30-seat ERJ-135s. Contour recently announced an expansion of Santa Barbara as a focus city, and added a flight to Sacramento International Airport in April 2019.\n\n=== Delta ===\nDelta Airlines began three daily flights to Salt Lake City International Airport in August 2019. The flights are operated with ERJ-175 aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.com/news/2019/jan/31/delta-adds-santa-barbara-its-destinations/|title=Delta Air Lines Adds Santa Barbara to Its Destinations|last=Hayden|first=Tyler|website=www.independent.com|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Locally based commuter airlines===\n\nIn the 1980s Santa Barbara-based '''Apollo Airways''', a commuter airline which subsequently changed its name to '''Pacific''' '''Coast''' '''Airlines''', flew [[Handley Page HP.137 Jetstream]] propjets from the airport with nonstop service to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Jose, CA, Monterey, Fresno and Bakersfield with direct flights to Sacramento and Lake Tahoe.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, July 1, 1984 Pacific Coast Airlines route map</ref> Another locally based airline was '''Connectair''' operating [[Fairchild F-27]]J turboprops with nonstop flights to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Jose, CA.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com,September 18, 1985 Connectair route map</ref> Both air carriers are no longer in existence.\n\n===Other jet airlines===\n\n[[Frontier Airlines]] [[Airbus A319]]s flew nonstop to Denver until January 6, 2015.

The new facility was built next to the existing terminal and cost approximately $63 million.  Additions to the historic terminal made in 1967 and 1976 were removed and the original building was restored.  It then was raised to meet modern flood plain regulations and moved and incorporated into the new terminal. The aircraft parking ramp was redesigned and a new loop road and short term parking lot were constructed.  The new terminal building features many environmentally sustainable elements and is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). It was originally designed to feature 4 glass passenger boarding bridges and 4 hardstands, but due to decreased flight activity, 3 jetbridges were constructed with 5 hardstands.<ref name=\"Airline Terminal Project Overview\">{{cite web|url=http://flysba.com/inside_sba/airline_terminal_project_overview|title=Santa Barbara - Airport|website=flysba.com}}</ref>\n[[File:KSBA Terminal1.jpg|thumb|Concessions inside departure/arrival terminal at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, including a [[The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf|Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf]]. ]]\n[[File:KSBA Terminal2.jpg|thumb|Gates 3-5 at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.]]\n[[File:KSBA Terminal3.jpg|thumb|Gates 1 & 2 at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.]]\nIn late 2019, the 4th boarding bridge was installed to replace a hardstand to help the airport cope with increased flight activity and upgauging. Relocation of the car rental lot also allowed all 4 jetbridges to accommodate mainline aircraft, up from 2 previously.

Beachey]] flew an airplane across [[Goleta Valley]]. Two years later the Loughead brothers, who later changed their name to [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], established a seaplane factory on State Street ([[Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company]]) and constructed a wooden ramp on West Beach to launch their planes. In 1928, Gordon Sackett and Royce Stetson landed a Hisso-powered airplane in a cow pasture near the corner of Hollister and Fairview Avenues and set up a flight school on the spot. That first airstrip marked the beginning of what was to become the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.\n\nAs airplane manufacturing grew in the late 1930s that airstrip developed into an airfield. Western General set up shop and began producing Meteor airplanes, while Santa Barbara Airways' founder Frederick Stearns II built two additional runways and two large hangars. Stearns also installed the first radio equipment at the airfield.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flysba.com/?pageID=99|title=Santa Barbara - Airport|website=www.flysba.com}}</ref>\n\nAirline flights began in 1932 on '''Pacific Seaboard Air Lines'''.  In 1933, Pacific Seaboard was operating two daily round trip flights with single engine [[Bellanca CH-300]]s Los Angeles - Santa Barbara - Santa Maria - San Luis Obispo - Paso Robles - Monterey - Salinas - San Jose - San Francisco.<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, Summer 1933 Pacific Seaboard Air Lines timetable</ref> Pacific Seaboard later moved its entire operation to the eastern U.S. and became [[Chicago and Southern Air Lines]], a large domestic and international airline acquired by and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 1953.<ref>http://www.deltamuseum.org, Chicago and Southern (C&S) Air Lines</ref> [[United Airlines]] began flights from Santa Barbara/Goleta in 1936.\n\nAs war approached the United States Government established a program to build 250 airports across the country on a cost-sharing basis with local governments.

Storke]] secured Santa Barbara's enrollment in the program, and in 1941 groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.\n\nWith the outbreak of WWII the airport became [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara|MCAS Santa Barbara]] (Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara) in 1942, an aviator training base for the U.S Marines. It was expanded further with the addition of many hangars and other buildings, and reverted to a civilian airport in 1946.<ref name=\"MCAS SB\">[[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Santa Barbara Airport Terminal.jpg|thumb|Original passenger terminal building]]\nThe original Spanish-style terminal building, commissioned by United Airlines in 1942 was designed by William Edwards and Joseph Plunkett, an architectural team whose work, including the [[Arlington Theatre]] and the National Armory, helped shape the Mediterranean style of the city.\n\n===Postwar developments===\nIn 1947 the Santa Barbara Flying Club was formed to promote general aviation in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://santabarbaraflyingclub.org/|title=Santa Barbara Flying Club|website=santabarbaraflyingclub.org}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1951 war film ''[[Flying Leathernecks]]'', [[John Wayne]]'s character was stationed in Goleta. The movie references the airbase as being in Goleta because, during World War II, the airbase had not yet been annexed by Santa Barbara. The movie has a short clip of the airport and surrounding area.\n\nThree runways are in use: 7/25 and two parallel runways 15/33. The airport originally had an additional strip: runway 3/21.  The development of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (to the southwest) and the construction of hangars in support of production of the [[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy]] (to the northeast) were factors in the removal of this runway.[[File:KSBA UA320.jpg|thumb|[[United Airlines]] [[Airbus A319|Airbus A319-100]] at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport (KSBA) preparing to board passengers for a return flight to [[Denver International Airport|Denver International Airport (KDEN)]] on December 5th, 2019. ]]\n\n[[Image:AESBA.JPG|thumb|Passengers boarding an [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] [[Saab 340|Saab 340B]] turboprop aircraft for a flight to [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] in October 2008|alt=]]\n\n===Southwest Airways and successors===\n\nUntil 2002, Santa Barbara Airport was on a jet route to San Francisco and Los Angeles.  The airport was served by [[Pacific Air Lines|'''Southwest Airways''']] [[Douglas DC-3]]s and [[Martin 4-0-4]]s and by successors '''[[Pacific Air Lines]]''', '''Air West''' and '''[[Hughes Airwest]]''' with [[Fairchild F-27]]s and [[Boeing 727-100]], [[Douglas DC-9-10]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]] jets. The Southwest March 1, 1947 timetable lists two round trip [[Douglas DC-3]]s flying Los Angeles-Oxnard-Santa Barbara-Santa Maria-San Luis Obispo-Coalinga-Monterey-Santa Cruz/Watsonville-San Jose-San Francisco.  The first jets were Pacific Air Lines [[Boeing 727-100]]s in 1966; the January 4, 1967 timetable lists 727s flying San Francisco-Monterey-Santa Barbara-Los Angeles. Air West served the airport with the B727-100s formerly operated by Pacific Air Lines while Hughes Airwest served Santa Barbara with [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]s.<ref>February 1, 1976 Official Airlines Guide (OAG), North American edition</ref>\n\n===United===\nThe United Airlines timetable for February 1, 1937 listed a daily [[Douglas DC-3]] Los Angeles-Santa Barbara-San Francisco-Oakland and back.  In 1972 the United timetable listed direct [[Boeing 727-100]]s to New York Newark via [[LAX]] and Milwaukee.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1972 United Airlines timetable</ref>  The primary United routes from Santa Barbara were nonstops to Los Angeles and San Francisco with some continuing to other cities.  The first nonstop flights beyond California were United [[Boeing 727]]s to Denver in 1979 and to Chicago O'Hare in 1980. United ceased mainline jet service to SBA in 1990. [[Shuttle by United]], a division of United Airlines (later renamed [[United Shuttle]]) flew [[Boeing 737-300]]s and [[737-500]]s to San Francisco in the 1990s and early 2000s.  United then turned all service over to [[SkyWest Airlines]] which now operates as [[United Express]]. Service was originally on [[Embraer 120]] aircraft to SFO and LAX and [[Canadair Regional Jet|CRJ200]] to Denver. This was later turned over to a mix of SkyWest CRJ200, CRJ700, and [[Embraer Regional Jet|E175]]. On June 8, 2017 United resumed seasonal mainline service to San Francisco and Denver. Beginning June 4, 2020, United will resume service to Chicago-O'Hare, as a red-eye, using a Boeing 737-700 aircraft.\n\n===American===\n[[American Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]s started flying to [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]] in 1984, some on a triangle route DFW-Burbank-SBA-DFW or DFW-Bakersfield-SBA-DFW.  American also flew MD-80s to [[Chicago O'Hare]] via Ontario.  After American Airlines dropped mainline service to SBA, [[American Eagle Airlines]], its affiliate, began flying [[Saab 340B]]s and later [[Embraer ERJ-140]]s between SBA and LAX. American Eagle flew [[Canadair CRJ-700]]s between SBA and DFW until April 2009. The airline flew SBA-LAX until November 14, 2012 when [[SkyWest Airlines]] ([[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]) took over with [[Canadair CRJ-200]]s. [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] suspended its flights to Los Angeles on March 31, 2014, ending American Airlines service at the airport. With the merger of [[US Airways]] and American, [[American Airlines]] returned to SBA with nonstop [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional jet service to Phoenix.  In June 2016 American Eagle relaunched nonstop service to Dallas/Fort Worth ([[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|DFW]]) on [[Mesa Airlines]] [[Canadair CRJ-900]]s.<ref name=\"keyt.com\">{{cite web |url= http://www.keyt.com/news/new-air-service-begins-to-dallasforth-worth-from-santa-barbara/38086854 |title= New Air Service Begins to Dallas/Forth [sic] Worth from Santa Barbara |date=February 19, 2016 |access-date=February 20, 2016}}</ref> On April 4, 2017 [[American Airlines]] began a seasonal mainline [[Airbus A319]] flight to DFW, the first mainline service since 2015 when [[Frontier Airlines]] left Santa Barbara. In September 2019, the DFW flights have been replaced with two daily Envoy Air E-175's but will upgauge both to A319 aircraft for Summer 2020.\n\n===Alaska===\nAlaska-owned regional airline [[Horizon Air]] was the first Alaska affiliate to connect SBA with Seattle and Portland, flying [[Canadair CRJ-700]]s. From 2008 to 2010, Horizon also connected Santa Barbara non-stop to Sacramento and direct to Portland and/or Seattle. In 2011 [[SkyWest Airlines|Skywest Airlines]] took over the Horizon [[Canadair CRJ-700]] jets and later replaced them with [[Embraer E-Jet family|Embraer E175]]s, replacing Horizon for all Alaska-branded flying into Santa Barbara and continues to operate flights via a capacity purchase agreement with Alaska Airlines. From June 15, 2017 to August 26, 2017, Horizon returned to Santa Barbara by taking over the Seattle route from SkyWest with its own Embraer E175s. On August 27, 2017 Alaska Airlines began mainline service to Santa Barbara for the first time when it took over the Seattle route from Horizon with its own Boeing 737s.\n\n=== Sun Country ===\nSun Country Airlines served Santa Barbara twice weekly between August and December to Minneapolis/St. Paul on Boeing 737s. Service began on August 16, 2018, and ended on December 9, 2018. On May 22, 2019, Sun Country resumed seasonal service with an increase to four times a week for the 2019 season. At the end of the 2019 season, Sun Country has indicated that they do not plan to return in 2020.\n\n=== Frontier ===\nFrontier Airlines flew to Denver until 2015 with the Embraer E-190 and Airbus A319/320. After a multi-year hiatus, Frontier resumed service on August 21, 2018 with three times a week year-round service to Denver on the Airbus A320. In November 2019, they went seasonal and will return June 7, 2020.\n\n=== Contour ===\nContour Airlines began service on October 16, 2018. They fly daily to Oakland International Airport and 10 times a week to Las Vegas McCarran International Airport using a fleet of 30-seat ERJ-135s. Contour recently announced an expansion of Santa Barbara as a focus city, and added a flight to Sacramento International Airport in April 2019.\n\n=== Delta ===\nDelta Airlines began three daily flights to Salt Lake City International Airport in August 2019. The flights are operated with ERJ-175 aircraft.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.com/news/2019/jan/31/delta-adds-santa-barbara-its-destinations/|title=Delta Air Lines Adds Santa Barbara to Its Destinations|last=Hayden|first=Tyler|website=www.independent.com|language=en|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Locally based commuter airlines===\n\nIn the 1980s Santa Barbara-based '''Apollo Airways''', a commuter airline which subsequently changed its name to '''Pacific''' '''Coast''' '''Airlines''', flew [[Handley Page HP.137 Jetstream]] propjets from the airport with nonstop service to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Jose, CA, Monterey, Fresno and Bakersfield with direct flights to Sacramento and Lake Tahoe.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, July 1, 1984 Pacific Coast Airlines route map</ref> Another locally based airline was '''Connectair''' operating [[Fairchild F-27]]J turboprops with nonstop flights to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and San Jose, CA.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com,September 18, 1985 Connectair route map</ref> Both air carriers are no longer in existence.\n\n===Other jet airlines===\n\n[[Frontier Airlines]] [[Airbus A319]]s flew nonstop to Denver until January 6, 2015. [[Pacific Air Lines]] flew [[Boeing 727-100]]s to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Monterey, [[Continental Airlines]] [[Boeing 737-300]]s flew nonstop to Denver (some flights stopped at Bakersfield enroute to SBA), Air West (later [[Hughes Airwest]]) [[Boeing 727-100]]s, [[Douglas DC-9-10]]s, and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30]]s flew to Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities, [[Allegiant Air]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]]s flew to Las Vegas, [[Pacific Express]] [[BAC One-Eleven]]s flew to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bakersfield, [[Air Wisconsin]] ([[United Express]]) [[BAe 146-200]]s and [[BAe 146-300]]s flew to Denver, and [[ExpressJet]] flew [[Embraer ERJ-145]]s nonstop to Sacramento and San Diego.\n\n===Other past commuter airline service===\n\nA number of commuter air carriers served Santa Barbara over the years primarily with turboprop aircraft.  In 1968, Cable Commuter Airlines was operating [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]] service to [[LAX]].<ref>http://www.timetableimages.com, December 1, 1968 Cable Commuter Airlines system timetable</ref>  Cable Commuter was then acquired by [[Golden West Airlines]] which in turn began operating high frequency shuttle service to [[LAX]] with [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7]] and [[Short 330]] aircraft.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, November 15, 1979 & April 1, 1981 editions, Official Airline Guide (OAG), Los Angeles-Santa Barbara flight schedules</ref>  According to the [[Official Airline Guide]] (OAG), by 1981 Golden West was the only airline operating scheduled service between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles with fourteen round trip flights on weekdays.

The new facility was built next to the existing terminal and cost approximately $63 million.  Additions to the historic terminal made in 1967 and 1976 were removed and the original building was restored.  It then was raised to meet modern flood plain regulations and moved and incorporated into the new terminal. The aircraft parking ramp was redesigned and a new loop road and short term parking lot were constructed.  The new terminal building features many environmentally sustainable elements and is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). It was originally designed to feature 4 glass passenger boarding bridges and 4 hardstands, but due to decreased flight activity, 3 jetbridges were constructed with 5 hardstands.<ref name=\"Airline Terminal Project Overview\">{{cite web|url=http://flysba.com/inside_sba/airline_terminal_project_overview|title=Santa Barbara - Airport|website=flysba.com}}</ref>\n[[File:KSBA Terminal1.jpg|thumb|Concessions inside departure/arrival terminal at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, including a [[The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf|Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf]]. ]]\n[[File:KSBA Terminal2.jpg|thumb|Gates 3-5 at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.]]\n[[File:KSBA Terminal3.jpg|thumb|Gates 1 & 2 at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport.]]\nIn late 2019, the 4th boarding bridge was installed to replace a hardstand to help the airport cope with increased flight activity and upgauging. Relocation of the car rental lot also allowed all 4 jetbridges to accommodate mainline aircraft, up from 2 previously. Further changes are being explored to help keep up with the increased passenger counts.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport destination list\n| [[Alaska Airlines]] | [[Portland International Airport|Portland (OR)]], [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|Seattle/Tacoma]]\n| [[American Airlines]] | '''Seasonal: '''[[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]] \n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix\u2013Sky Harbor]]\n| [[Contour Airlines]] | [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Oakland International Airport|Oakland]], [[Sacramento International Airport|Sacramento]] (all suspended)<ref>https://www.contourairlines.com/en-us/about-contour/travel-advisory/</ref>\n| [[Delta Connection]] | [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]]\n| [[Frontier Airlines]] | '''Seasonal: '''[[Denver International Airport|Denver]]\n| [[United Airlines]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]] (resumes June 4, 2020),<ref>https://www.edhat.com/news/santa-barbara-airport-to-add-chicago-as-new-destination</ref> [[Denver International Airport|Denver]]<br />'''Seasonal: '''[[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]]\n| [[United Express]] | [[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]]\n}}\n\n{| class=\"collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:1px #aaa solid; width:50em; margin:0.2em auto\"\n|-\n!

Floyd adapted the story from the [[Apocrypha]]l tale of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susannah and the Elders]], though the latter story has a more positive ending.

In 2019, [[Rhiannon Giddens]] released a vernacular version of \"Trees on the Mountains\" on her album, ''There Is No Other.''\n\n==Synopsis==\nWritten during the McCarthy era, ''Susannah'' is based loosely on the Apocryphal tale of Susannah and the Elders. In New Hope Valley, Tennessee, Susannah \u2013 a pretty and well-mannered young woman of humble origins \u2013 is faced with hostility from her church community. The opera opens at a square dance given by her church; a group of wives, jealous of Susannah's beauty and the attention it brings from their husbands, are gossiping about her. Mrs. McLean, one of the wives, states that you can't expect more from someone who was raised by her drunken brother, Sam. Finally, the Reverend Olin Blitch, newly arrived to lead the congregation, enters and asks Susannah to dance despite the gossip. Later that evening, Susannah tells her admirer Little Bat \u2013 son of Mrs. McLean and her husband, an elder of the church \u2013 about the dance; Little Bat leaves abruptly once her brother Sam returns from hunting.\n\nThe next morning Susannah is innocently bathing naked in the creek near her home; she is discovered by the elders, who are searching for a baptismal stream. They conceal their lust with outrage and tell the community of her wickedness. Susannah arrives at a church dinner that evening and is sent away, much to her confusion. Later, as she is pondering why she has been shunned, Little Bat tells her that the elders have denounced her for bathing in the nude, and admits that he was coerced into saying she seduced him.\n\nSam informs Susannah that she must make a public confession in order to be absolved. Though she claims she has nothing to confess, she goes to the service where Olin Blitch is preaching. When she is singled out to come forward, she runs away. Once the service has ended, Reverend Blitch goes to Susannah's house and offers to pray for her soul. Upon discovering that her brother is away, Blitch rapes her.\n\nThe next day Blitch, having discovered that Susannah was a virgin, comes to her and begs for forgiveness. He throws himself at Susannah's mercy, but she refuses to forgive him. When Susannah tells Sam the story, he threatens to kill Blitch and leaves for the baptismal service carrying his shotgun. Convinced that Susannah led her brother to murder, the community heads to her house to drive her out of the valley. However, Little Bat has warned her in advance, and when the vigilantes arrive she is waiting with a shotgun. They retreat, but she has effectively severed her ties with the community and her world.\n\n==Main roles and world-premiere cast==\n*Susannah Polk &ndash; soprano ([[Phyllis Curtin]])\n*Sam Polk &ndash; tenor (Walter James)\n*Olin Blitch &ndash; bass-baritone ([[Mack Harrell]])\n*Little Bat McLean &ndash; tenor ([[Eb Thomas]])\n*Elder McLean &ndash; baritone (Harrison Fisher)\n*Elder Gleaton &ndash; tenor (Kenneth Nelson)\n*Elder Hayes &ndash; tenor (Dayton Smith)\n*Elder Ott &ndash; baritone (Lee Liming)\n*Mrs. McLean &ndash; mezzo-soprano (Martha Kay Willis)\n*Mrs. Gleaton &ndash; soprano (Catherine Murphy)\n*Mrs. Hayes &ndash; soprano (Joan Nichy)\n*Mrs. Ott &ndash; contralto (Bette Jo Armstrong)\n\n==Production history==\nThe German premiere was 1959 at the [[Theater Oberhausen]].

Convinced that Susannah led her brother to murder, the community heads to her house to drive her out of the valley. However, Little Bat has warned her in advance, and when the vigilantes arrive she is waiting with a shotgun. They retreat, but she has effectively severed her ties with the community and her world.\n\n==Main roles and world-premiere cast==\n*Susannah Polk &ndash; soprano ([[Phyllis Curtin]])\n*Sam Polk &ndash; tenor (Walter James)\n*Olin Blitch &ndash; bass-baritone ([[Mack Harrell]])\n*Little Bat McLean &ndash; tenor ([[Eb Thomas]])\n*Elder McLean &ndash; baritone (Harrison Fisher)\n*Elder Gleaton &ndash; tenor (Kenneth Nelson)\n*Elder Hayes &ndash; tenor (Dayton Smith)\n*Elder Ott &ndash; baritone (Lee Liming)\n*Mrs. McLean &ndash; mezzo-soprano (Martha Kay Willis)\n*Mrs. Gleaton &ndash; soprano (Catherine Murphy)\n*Mrs. Hayes &ndash; soprano (Joan Nichy)\n*Mrs. Ott &ndash; contralto (Bette Jo Armstrong)\n\n==Production history==\nThe German premiere was 1959 at the [[Theater Oberhausen]].

{"title_page": "The Spanish Gypsy", "text_new": "{{For|the 1911 film|The Spanish Gypsy (film)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{italictitle}}\n'''''The Spanish Gypsy''''' is an English [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] [[tragicomedy]], dating from 1621\u201322. The play was likely a collaboration between several dramatists, including [[Thomas Middleton]],  [[William Rowley]], [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]]. Like Shakespeare's lost play ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'', ''The Spanish Gypsy'' is an English reworking of the novellas of [[Miguel de Cervantes]], combining two of Cervantes' ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]'' into a single drama.\n\n==Plot summary==\n'''Act 1'''.  The noble Roderigo sees a beautiful young girl (Clara) walking one night with her family.  Declaring himself bewitched by her beauty, he kidnaps her with the help of his friends, Diego and Lewys, then takes her back to his residence and rapes her.  After the fact, Roderigo feels remorse and lets her go.  Clara studies the room and manages to steal a crucifix before she is returned to town; these are her only clues as to the identity of her attacker.  Later, Lewys realizes with horror that the girl he helped kidnap is the very woman he has been courting.  He confronts Roderigo, who lies and tells him that he let the girl go without harming her.\n\n'''Act 2'''.  There is a group of gypsies in Madrid lodging in the house of Juana Cardochia.  One of them is a gypsy girl of unusual beauty and intelligence, named Pretiosa.  She is courted by the foolish Sancho (the ward of Don Pedro, Clara's father), as well as by the noble Don John.  Despite the difference in their social stations, Don John asks Pretiosa to marry him.  Pretiosa agrees only if Don John consents to live as a gypsy for two years.  Meanwhile, Clara returns to her mother and father (Maria and don Pedro de Cortes) and relates her misfortune.  Her family urges secrecy for the moment.  Lewys arrives to court Clara, but she is reluctant.  Lewys and Clara's father, don Pedro, discuss how Lewys\u2019 father was killed by a nobleman named Alvarez some years earlier.  Alvarez has been living in exile ever since, though no one knows his whereabouts.  Don Fernando, the Corregidor (mayor) of Madrid as well as Roderigo's father, wants Lewys to pardon Alvarez and allow him to return to Madrid.  Sancho returns home and is scolded by his guardian Don Pedro.  Sancho and his servant, Soto, decide to run off and join the troupe of gypsies.\n\n'''Act 3'''.  Roderigo, now wracked with guilt for his crime, meets Sancho and Soto and decides to turn gypsy as well.  The whole troupe goes to perform at the house of Francisco de Carcamo, don John's father.  Meanwhile, Clara is injured near Don Fernando's house, and is brought inside his home to be cared for.  Clara recognizes the room where she was raped, and asks don Fernando if he has any children.  Fernando replies that he has two: his son Roderigo, and a daughter who was lost at sea shortly after her birth.  Clara reveals her rape to Fernando, showing him the crucifix as proof.  Fernando is horrified, and vows vengeance upon his son.\n\n'''Act 4'''.  Don John becomes a gypsy and is formally betrothed to Pretiosa; he is renamed Andrew.  Andrew refuses the hostess Cardochia's advances, but at last consents to take a jewel she offers him.  The gypsy troupe arrives at don Fernando's house and he asks them to act out a play he has written. Fernando pretends not to recognize his son Roderigo, and asks him to play the lead role: that of a son forced to marry an ugly heiress.  The play begins, but is interrupted by a fight between Andrew and Diego (who is Cardochia's admirer).  Seeking revenge, the spurned Cardochia has accused Andrew of stealing the jewel she gave him.  Andrew is arrested and taken away.  Don Fernando confronts his son Roderigo and tells him that the play is real: he must marry the ugly heiress.  Roderigo refuses and expresses his desire to marry the beautiful woman who had been watching the play that evening.  (The woman is Clara, though Roderigo seems not to recognize her from the rape.)  Fernando agrees to the marriage.\n\n'''Act 5'''.  Roderigo has married Clara offstage.  But Fernando then stages an elaborate interrogation, first telling his son that he has been punished by marriage to a wanton, then pressing him to confess his crimes.  Roderigo eventually breaks down and admits to the rape, adding that he wishes he could have married the woman he wronged.  Clara and her family then emerge from hiding and explain everything.  Roderigo vows to love Clara and redeem himself. Seeking to bargain for Andrew's freedom, Alvarez reveals himself to Lewys. He laments his part in the death of Lewys\u2019 father, and offers Lewys his life.  Lewys finds he cannot kill the older man, and the two are reconciled. Soon afterwards, the gypsy girl Pretiosa arrives to beg Fernando for the release of her betrothed, Andrew.  The mother of the gypsy troupe reveals to Fernando that Andrew is really Don John, son of Francisco de Carcamo.  Furthermore, she reveals that the exiled Alvarez is the leader of the gypsy troupe, that she herself is Alvarez's wife and Fernando's own missing sister, and that Pretiosa is Fernando's long-lost daughter.  Cardochia confesses her plot, and is promised to Diego as penance.  Don John and Pretiosa are married.\n\n==Performance and Historical Context==\n''The Spanish Gypsy'' was licensed for performance by Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]], on 9 July 1623; the text includes two mentions of the camels and elephant that arrived in London for exhibit in that month. The play was performed at Court on 5 November that year; Prince [[Charles I of England|Charles]] attended.\n\n==Sources in Cervantes==\n''The Spanish Gypsy'' draws two of its main storylines from Cervantes' ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]''.<ref>Wilson, 38;  Ardila, 5; Fuchs, 70</ref>  From \"La Gitanilla\" it borrows the idea of a young gypsy girl who is actually of noble birth, and of the nobleman who falls in love with her and becomes a gypsy himself as a result.  From \"La fuerza de la sangre\" it takes the idea of a nobleman who rapes a well-born girl; the girl eventually discovers the identity of her attacker, and he is made to repent and make amends by marrying her.  Many of the characters' names are either kept the same as in Cervantes' novellas or simply anglicized: names such as Preciosa, Carducha, and Andres become Pretiosa, Cardochia, and Andrew, for example.\n\n==Problems of Authorship==\nThe London stationer (i.e. bookseller and publisher) [[John and Richard Marriot|Richard Marriot]] published the play in [[book size|quarto]] in 1653 as a collaboration between [[Thomas Middleton]] and [[William Rowley]], one of several the two dramatists had created together. A second quarto was issued in 1661. The assignment of authorship was unquestioned till the 20th century. H. Dugdale Sykes was the first modern scholar to dispute the attribution to Middleton and Rowley; he favored [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] as the author, judging on a range of stylistic and textual features.\n\nFollowing up on Sykes' perception, M. Joan Sergeaunt noted the strong resemblances between the gypsy scenes in this play and similar materials in the works of [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. Later scholars, perhaps most prominently David Lake, have refined and confirmed these studies.<ref>Lake, pp. 215\u201330.</ref> The similarity of the comic subplot of the play to the work of Rowley has also been noticed.<ref>Brittin, p. 97</ref> The clown characters Sancho and Soto in ''The Spanish Gypsy'' show clear resemblances with [[:wikt:Rowleian|Rowleian]] clowns, like Chough and Trimtram in ''[[A Fair Quarrel]]''; Soto is even called Lollio in IV.iii.80\u201386, Lollio being the name of Rowley's clown character in ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]].'' ''The Spanish Gypsy'' dates from the early 1620s, a time when Dekker, Ford, and Rowley were certainly working together: they wrote ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' in 1621, and joined with [[John Webster]] for ''[[Keep the Widow Waking]]'' in 1624.\n\nAs Gary Taylor has recently argued, however, \"If the plot/scenario for the play was written primarily by one author, Middleton is the likeliest candidate.\"<ref>Taylor, 437.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* Ardila, J.A.G., ed.

Don John and Pretiosa are married.\n\n==Performance and Historical Context==\n''The Spanish Gypsy'' was licensed for performance by Sir [[Henry Herbert (Master of the Revels)|Henry Herbert]], the [[Master of the Revels]], on 9 July 1623; the text includes two mentions of the camels and elephant that arrived in London for exhibit in that month. The play was performed at Court on 5 November that year; Prince [[Charles I of England|Charles]] attended.\n\n==Sources in Cervantes==\n''The Spanish Gypsy'' draws two of its main storylines from Cervantes' ''[[Novelas Ejemplares]]''.<ref>Wilson, 38;  Ardila, 5; Fuchs, 70</ref>  From \"La Gitanilla\" it borrows the idea of a young gypsy girl who is actually of noble birth, and of the nobleman who falls in love with her and becomes a gypsy himself as a result.  From \"La fuerza de la sangre\" it takes the idea of a nobleman who rapes a well-born girl; the girl eventually discovers the identity of her attacker, and he is made to repent and make amends by marrying her.  Many of the characters' names are either kept the same as in Cervantes' novellas or simply anglicized: names such as Preciosa, Carducha, and Andres become Pretiosa, Cardochia, and Andrew, for example.\n\n==Problems of Authorship==\nThe London stationer (i.e. bookseller and publisher) [[John and Richard Marriot|Richard Marriot]] published the play in [[book size|quarto]] in 1653 as a collaboration between [[Thomas Middleton]] and [[William Rowley]], one of several the two dramatists had created together. A second quarto was issued in 1661. The assignment of authorship was unquestioned till the 20th century. H. Dugdale Sykes was the first modern scholar to dispute the attribution to Middleton and Rowley; he favored [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] as the author, judging on a range of stylistic and textual features.\n\nFollowing up on Sykes' perception, M. Joan Sergeaunt noted the strong resemblances between the gypsy scenes in this play and similar materials in the works of [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]. Later scholars, perhaps most prominently David Lake, have refined and confirmed these studies.<ref>Lake, pp. 215\u201330.</ref> The similarity of the comic subplot of the play to the work of Rowley has also been noticed.<ref>Brittin, p. 97</ref> The clown characters Sancho and Soto in ''The Spanish Gypsy'' show clear resemblances with [[:wikt:Rowleian|Rowleian]] clowns, like Chough and Trimtram in ''[[A Fair Quarrel]]''; Soto is even called Lollio in IV.iii.80\u201386, Lollio being the name of Rowley's clown character in ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]].'' ''The Spanish Gypsy'' dates from the early 1620s, a time when Dekker, Ford, and Rowley were certainly working together: they wrote ''[[The Witch of Edmonton]]'' in 1621, and joined with [[John Webster]] for ''[[Keep the Widow Waking]]'' in 1624.\n\nAs Gary Taylor has recently argued, however, \"If the plot/scenario for the play was written primarily by one author, Middleton is the likeliest candidate.\"<ref>Taylor, 437.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* Ardila, J.A.G., ed.

In this and related materials, the Chipettes served as female featured characters in their own right, starring in numerous episodes. The title of the show was changed from ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' to simply ''The Chipmunks'' in 1988 to reflect this. In the cartoon series and the accompanying feature films, all of the Chipettes were voiced by their creator, [[Janice Karman]], the wife of [[Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.]] (son of [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.]], the creator of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|The Chipmunks]]). Karman also wrote and voiced the Chipettes' dialogue on their studio albums, while studio singers such as Susan Boyd, Shelby Daniel, and Katherine Coon provided their singing voices. In ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (2015 TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'', Eleanor is voiced by Vanessa Chambers, the daughter of Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and Janice Karman and wife of Brian Chambers.\n\nThe first designs for the Chipettes were drafted by Corny Cole for their 1983 debut. These were later revamped by Sandra Berez for ''[[The Chipmunk Adventure]]'' and the later seasons of the show.\n\n==The Chipettes==\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks}}\n\n===Brittany Miller===\n\nBrittany Miller is the oldest sister and the leader of the Chipettes and is the female counterpart of Alvin. Brittany was born in the United States. Brittany pushes Jeanette around a lot and takes advantage of her kindness, but deep down they love each other very much and are very loyal to each other. \nEleanor always stands up to Brittany when she tries to push Jeanette around and is generally the only person that tries to stand up to her. Despite this, the two of them do share a very nice sisterly relationship. Brittany is secretly smitten with Alvin, though she covers it up by pretending to hate him. The two often quarrel, but deep down, they both love each other and know it. Brittany is known to put her hand on Alvin's shoulder as a way to comfort him when he's down.\n\n===Jeanette Miller===\n\nJeanette is the middle sister and smartest of the Chipettes, as well as the tallest, and the skinniest. Jeanette was born in the United States. Like Simon, she wears glasses because of her poor eyesight. She has brown hair in a bun in the '80s show and a short ponytail in the recent films. Her eyes are green in her TV appearances and ''The Chipmunk Adventure'' but were changed to violet in the live-action/CGI films. She cares about Simon and gets along with him very well. In the third Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, Jeanette was given a bracelet from Simon, who was bitten by a venomous spider and turned into an adventurous side of himself. Jeanette has very strong feelings for Simon and tries to hint at him that she likes him. She is also clumsy and can be shy and insecure of herself at times.\n\n===Eleanor Miller===\n\nEleanor is the youngest sister of the Chipettes. Eleanor was born in the United States. She has a lot in common with Theodore in terms of body shape and color of attire, but she is braver, more fit and has a better memory. She is blonde with pigtails and has brown eyes in the '80s show, which changed to green in the more recent appearances. In the sequel to the first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, Ian Hawke tells Eleanor that she has to work on getting taller, so he gives her a pair of heels to make her look taller. Theodore doesn't think Eleanor's heels are very comfortable for her. Eleanor admits that they're not and tells him why she's wearing them. Theodore then proceeds to tell her that she looks great without the heels. Then they just exchange glances of affection for one another. Eleanor is very affectionate towards Theodore. In the last Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip, Eleanor  calls Theodore \"Theodorable\" and giggles as she catches up with her sisters. She also calls his dancing smooth. Eleanor loves to decorate and design clothes, and has a passion for cooking.\n\n===Miss Beatrice Miller===\n\nMiss Miller, an elderly eccentric friend of Dave and the Chipmunks, became the adoptive mother of the Chipettes in the television series. She is shown to be ditzy and talkative, but also supportive and loving to the Chipettes. Miss Miller is featured in the Chipmunk Adventure movie as a babysitter for the Chipmunks but is tricked by Alvin. She is known for her fanciful manner of dress and occasionally belting out tunes from the 1930s.\n\n==Origins==\nThe origins of the Chipettes can be traced to the 1982 Alvin and the Chipmunks album ''[[The Chipmunks Go Hollywood]]'' (RCA, 1981). On this album, Alvin sings a duet with a female character billed as '''Charlene the Chipette'''. Charlene is featured on the song \"[[You're the One That I Want]]\" from the soundtrack of the motion picture ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''. Charlene was depicted on the album cover as having a long, golden blonde ponytail, and seems to have been the basis for the later character of Brittany.\n\nLike the Chipmunks, the Chipettes were originally created for the musical medium, and later crossed over into cartoons. According to their creator, Janice Karman, she and Ross Bagdasarian, Jr., \"had been doing the albums at that point... We couldn't do the girl songs. I wanted to do female chipmunks that have counter personalities to the Chipmunks so we could do some girl tunes.\"\n\nBagdasarian also added in reference to the Chipettes characters, \"It enables you to deal with issues that girls are going through that boys wouldn't necessarily be dealing with... We had a baby girl at the time. We wanted to let her know she can be president, or a soccer champion, or whatever... With the Chipettes we can handle those sorts of things.\"\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that the Chipettes of the cartoon series (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor) appeared on the small screen before appearing on any albums. Their first appearance on the Chipmunks album was on 1984's ''Songs From Our TV Shows'' which was released on March 4, 1984, nearly seven months after the Chipettes debuted on the first episode of the ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' television series on September 17, 1983.\n\nAlthough the Chipettes featured prominently on many Alvin and the Chipmunks albums, they received equal billing with the Chipmunks only on 1988's ''The Chipmunks and The Chipettes: Born to Rock''.\n\nThe Chipettes, redesigned as far more realistic chipmunks, appear in the 2009 film ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel]]''. In the movie, [[Christina Applegate]], [[Anna Faris]], and [[Amy Poehler]] voice the Chipettes.<ref name=\"chipmunks mtv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1599215/story.jhtml|title='Alvin and the Chipmunks' Producers Reveal 'Squeakquel' Details \u2013 And The Chipettes Are In!|date=July 28, 2008|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}</ref> \"There has been a lot of talk about it,\" noted Janice Karman, one of the film's producers. \"A lot of people have been asking about the little girls.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/07/28/justin-long-confirms-chipmunks-sequel-but-will-the-chipettes-be-in-it/|title='Justin Long Confirms 'Chipmunks' Sequel, But Will The Chipettes Be in It?'|date=July 28, 2008|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}</ref> [[Christina Applegate|Applegate]], [[Anna Faris|Faris]], and [[Amy Poehler|Poehler]] reprised their respective roles in ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked]]'', which was released on December 16, 2011.

In this and related materials, the Chipettes served as female featured characters in their own right, starring in numerous episodes. The title of the show was changed from ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' to simply ''The Chipmunks'' in 1988 to reflect this. In the cartoon series and the accompanying feature films, all of the Chipettes were voiced by their creator, [[Janice Karman]], the wife of [[Ross Bagdasarian, Jr.]] (son of [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.]], the creator of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks|The Chipmunks]]). Karman also wrote and voiced the Chipettes' dialogue on their studio albums, while studio singers such as Susan Boyd, Shelby Daniel, and Katherine Coon provided their singing voices. In ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (2015 TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'', Eleanor is voiced by Vanessa Chambers, the daughter of Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and Janice Karman and wife of Brian Chambers.\n\nThe first designs for the Chipettes were drafted by Corny Cole for their 1983 debut. These were later revamped by Sandra Berez for ''[[The Chipmunk Adventure]]'' and the later seasons of the show.\n\n==The Chipettes==\n{{Main|Alvin and the Chipmunks}}\n\n===Brittany Miller===\n\nBrittany Miller is the oldest sister and the leader of the Chipettes and is the female counterpart of Alvin. Brittany was born in the United States. Brittany pushes Jeanette around a lot and takes advantage of her kindness, but deep down they love each other very much and are very loyal to each other. \nEleanor always stands up to Brittany when she tries to push Jeanette around and is generally the only person that tries to stand up to her. Despite this, the two of them do share a very nice sisterly relationship. Brittany is secretly smitten with Alvin, though she covers it up by pretending to hate him. The two often quarrel, but deep down, they both love each other and know it. Brittany is known to put her hand on Alvin's shoulder as a way to comfort him when he's down.\n\n===Jeanette Miller===\n\nJeanette is the middle sister and smartest of the Chipettes, as well as the tallest, and the skinniest. Jeanette was born in the United States. Like Simon, she wears glasses because of her poor eyesight. She has brown hair in a bun in the '80s show and a short ponytail in the recent films. Her eyes are green in her TV appearances and ''The Chipmunk Adventure'' but were changed to violet in the live-action/CGI films. She cares about Simon and gets along with him very well. In the third Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked, Jeanette was given a bracelet from Simon, who was bitten by a venomous spider and turned into an adventurous side of himself. Jeanette has very strong feelings for Simon and tries to hint at him that she likes him. She is also clumsy and can be shy and insecure of herself at times.\n\n===Eleanor Miller===\n\nEleanor is the youngest sister of the Chipettes. Eleanor was born in the United States. She has a lot in common with Theodore in terms of body shape and color of attire, but she is braver, more fit and has a better memory. She is blonde with pigtails and has brown eyes in the '80s show, which changed to green in the more recent appearances. In the sequel to the first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, Ian Hawke tells Eleanor that she has to work on getting taller, so he gives her a pair of heels to make her look taller. Theodore doesn't think Eleanor's heels are very comfortable for her. Eleanor admits that they're not and tells him why she's wearing them. Theodore then proceeds to tell her that she looks great without the heels. Then they just exchange glances of affection for one another. Eleanor is very affectionate towards Theodore. In the last Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip, Eleanor  calls Theodore \"Theodorable\" and giggles as she catches up with her sisters. She also calls his dancing smooth. Eleanor loves to decorate and design clothes, and has a passion for cooking.\n\n===Miss Beatrice Miller===\n\nMiss Miller, an elderly eccentric friend of Dave and the Chipmunks, became the adoptive mother of the Chipettes in the television series. She is shown to be ditzy and talkative, but also supportive and loving to the Chipettes. Miss Miller is featured in the Chipmunk Adventure movie as a babysitter for the Chipmunks but is tricked by Alvin. She is known for her fanciful manner of dress and occasionally belting out tunes from the 1930s.\n\n==Origins==\nThe origins of the Chipettes can be traced to the 1982 Alvin and the Chipmunks album ''[[The Chipmunks Go Hollywood]]'' (RCA, 1981). On this album, Alvin sings a duet with a female character billed as '''Charlene the Chipette'''. Charlene is featured on the song \"[[You're the One That I Want]]\" from the soundtrack of the motion picture ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''. Charlene was depicted on the album cover as having a long, golden blonde ponytail, and seems to have been the basis for the later character of Brittany.\n\nLike the Chipmunks, the Chipettes were originally created for the musical medium, and later crossed over into cartoons. According to their creator, Janice Karman, she and Ross Bagdasarian, Jr., \"had been doing the albums at that point... We couldn't do the girl songs. I wanted to do female chipmunks that have counter personalities to the Chipmunks so we could do some girl tunes.\"\n\nBagdasarian also added in reference to the Chipettes characters, \"It enables you to deal with issues that girls are going through that boys wouldn't necessarily be dealing with... We had a baby girl at the time. We wanted to let her know she can be president, or a soccer champion, or whatever... With the Chipettes we can handle those sorts of things.\"\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that the Chipettes of the cartoon series (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor) appeared on the small screen before appearing on any albums. Their first appearance on the Chipmunks album was on 1984's ''Songs From Our TV Shows'' which was released on March 4, 1984, nearly seven months after the Chipettes debuted on the first episode of the ''Alvin and the Chipmunks'' television series on September 17, 1983.\n\nAlthough the Chipettes featured prominently on many Alvin and the Chipmunks albums, they received equal billing with the Chipmunks only on 1988's ''The Chipmunks and The Chipettes: Born to Rock''.\n\nThe Chipettes, redesigned as far more realistic chipmunks, appear in the 2009 film ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel]]''.

Established in 1972, CoCo was a label specializing in [[Music of African heritage in Cuba|Afro-Cuban]] and [[Latin American music in the United States|Latin American Popular music]], with special emphasis on the \u201cNew York Sound\u201d, commonly referred to as \u201c[[Salsa music|Salsa]]\u201d. Averne\u2019s gift for identifying and bringing together new and established musical talent, along with the careful management of his artists\u2019 public image, initially made CoCo Records a major label nationally, and subsequently an international success. Over the next decade, he signed internationally known artists and was instrumental in bringing Latin American music into the American cultural mainstream.\n\nIn 1972 Averne signed the iconic artist [[Eddie Palmieri]] to his label, producing and mixing two of Palmieri\u2019s groundbreaking albums; \u201cSentido\u201d and \u201cSun Of Latin Music\u201d. These recordings were considered radical departures from the type of dance oriented music that had prevailed during the previous two decades. The latter album earned Palmieri, Averne and CoCo the first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] ever awarded to an artist in the newly created \u201cLatin Music\u201d category (1975).\n\nThe following year (1976), Averne produced and mixed a third Eddie Palmieri album (\u201cUnfinished Masterpiece\u201d), which also won the coveted Grammy award. In addition, he achieved major successes in 1977 with two Grammy nominations for his productions of the [[Danny Rivera]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9|Eydie Gorme]] hit \u201cPara Decir Adios\u201d (from the album \u201cMuy Amigos\u201d) and The Machito Orchestra with [[Lalo Rodr\u00edguez|Lalo Rodriguez]] (\u201cFireworks\u201d). Both albums were included among the final five nominees.\n\nIn subsequent years, various artists who were signed to the CoCo family of labels also won numerous awards and nominations. The list includes such notables as [[Lissette Alvarez]], [[Wilkins (singer)|Wilkins]], [[Mario Bauz\u00e1|Mario Bauza]] and [[Graciela]], [[Yolandita Monge]], [[Steve Lawrence]], [[Trini Lopez]], [[Rafael Cortijo]], [[Ismael Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Fajardo (musician)|Jose Fajardo]], [[Charlie Palmieri]], Joe Quijano and [[Orquesta Broadway]], among others. The diversity of the CoCo catalogue actually brought a wider awareness of traditional Latin music to a new generation.\n\n==Early life==\nBy the time Averne was fourteen he was a professional musician. During the mid 1950s through the 1970s he appeared in hundreds of reviews and shows, at such popular New York venues as the Boulevard Night Club (Queens), [[Palladium Ballroom|The Palladium Ballroom]], [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], [[Village Gate|The Village Gate]], Jules Podell's [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]], [[Roseland Ballroom]], Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]], [[Cotton Club|The Cotton Club]], [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Basin Street East]], The Cheetah and [[Academy of Music (New York City)|The New York Academy Of Music,]] as well as [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom]], [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum|Coliseo Roberto Clemente]] in [[Puerto Rico]] and the famed [[Hollywood Palladium]]. He found steady work and much inspiration during these years, appearing with such notables as [[Don Rickles]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[James Brown]], [[Jerry Butler]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[The Main Ingredient (band)|The Main Ingredient]], [[Grover Washington Jr.|Grover Washington Jr]], [[Al Green]], and [[Frankie Crocker]], among others. In addition to the New York cabaret and club circuit, he performed with his own band \u201cArvito & His Latin Rhythms\u201d in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill Mountain]] Resort Area (also known as the [[Borscht Belt]], or the Jewish Alps), a popular vacation spot for New Yorkers since the 1920s. He worked there from 1950 through 1963, as well as in [[Long Island|Long Island\u2019s]] [[Lido Beach, New York|Lido Beach]] and [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], a strip which was known for its private beach clubs and hotels. He brought his fiery dance rhythms into the Malibu Beach Club, Colony Beach Club, The Coral Reef, The Monaco, The Sands and The Shelbourne. These venues drew thousands of day-tripper/ members who arrived early to enjoy their cabanas, beaches, pools and tennis courts. Later in the evening, the patrons would dress up elegantly for dinner in the restaurants and take in star-studded shows in the nightclubs. The aforementioned clubs offered such big-name performers as Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, [[Jackie Mason]], Mal Z. Lawrence, [[Al Martino]], [[Buddy Hackett]], Hines, Hines and Dad; as well as the popular Latin bands of [[Tito Puente]], [[Machito]], [[Tito Rodr\u00edguez|Tito Rodriguez]], [[Eddie Palmieri]], [[Larry Harlow (musician)|Larry Harlow]], [[Joe Cuba]], La Playa Sextet and of course Arvito & His Latin Rhythms. All of these stars performed regularly at both the beach clubs and the Catskill resort hotels. Curiously, it was amidst all of this showbiz glitz that Harvey\u2019s love for Latin American music and culture further manifested itself.\n\n==Recording career==\n\nA prolific songwriter in his own right (over fifty of his songs have been recorded), Averne wrote most of the material for his newly formed group \u201cThe Harvey Averne Dozen\u201d. Their album \u201cViva Soul\u201d, for Atlantic Records included the top selling hit \u201cMy Dream\u201d as well as the often recorded and sampled \u201cYou\u2019re No Good\u201d, both of which are Averne-Sheller compositions. A second album for the Fania label, the self-titled \u201cHarvey Averne Dozen\u201d included Averne compositions \u201cAccept Me\u201d, \u201cCan You Dig It\u201d and the international dance hit \u201cNever Learned to Dance\u201d. It also included the movie theme \u201cLullaby from [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary\u2019s Baby]]\u201d (Harvey\u2019s recording was subsequently sampled by Big Daddy Kane on his track \u201cRest In Peace\u201d). He changed the name of the group to \u201cThe Harvey Averne Band\u201d for the [[Fania Records|Fania]] release \u201cBrotherhood\u201d (1970). This album included various Latin crossover hits such as \u201cLovers\u201d, \u201cCome Back Baby\u201d, \u201cCome On And Do Me\u201d and the pop hit \u201cCentral Park\u201d. Around this time he began reinvesting his songwriting success into producing, and after years of hard work as a musician he was able to make the transition.\n\n==Producing Career and Coco Records==\n\nIn addition to his involvement with the Fania label, Averne had other equally important projects that were also well received. In 1969 he produced, directed and mixed \u201cThe Queen Does Her Own Thing\u201d for the extremely popular [[Cubans|Cuban]] artist [[La Lupe]]. The album was released on [[Roulette Records|Roulette]]/[[Tico Records]] and included the hit single \u201cSe Acabo\u201d (Once We Loved). In addition, he produced and mixed the \u201cThe Harvey Averne Barrio Band\u201d and \u201cToro\u201d albums, for Heavy Duty/Fania Records. During his tenure at Fania he either produced or supervised recordings by [[Ray Barretto]], [[Willie Col\u00f3n|Willie Colon]], Orquesta Harlow, [[H\u00e9ctor Lavoe|Hector Lavoe]], [[Ismael Miranda]], [[Bobby Valent\u00edn|Bobby Valentin]], [[Mongo Santamar\u00eda|Mongo Santamaria]], [[Johnny Pacheco]], [[Roberto Roena]], [[Joe Bataan]], [[Ralfi Pagan]], The Latineers and George Guzman, among others. While maintaining a managerial position as Vice President, Averne was still signed to the label as a recording artist and producer (a rarity back then), and freelanced on various productions for [[Scepter Records|Scepter]]/[[Wand Records|Wand]], Heavy Duty, Uptite and [[Atlantic Records]] as well. He was later named Executive Vice President of Fania\u2019s new subsidiary Vaya Records. At Vaya he worked closely with such artists as [[Celia Cruz]], [[Cheo Feliciano]], [[Ricardo Ray]] and [[Bobby Cruz]], Bobby Rodriguez y La Compa\u00f1ia and Markolino Diamond (which featured Angel Canales\u2019s singing debut). Averne ran the Vaya label through 1971, and was responsible for all administrative functions and production. \n \nIn 1971 an obscure studio band known as [[The Chakachas]] recorded the hit single \u201c[[Jungle Fever (song)|Jungle Fever]],\u201d of which Averne became the band leader. This recording sold more than two million copies and won the [[ASCAP Award]] as one of the most performed songs of the year in their catalogue. Averne also produced the crossover hit gold record \u201cI Want To Make It With You\u201d for the artist [[Ralfi Pagan]] (Scepter/ Wand/Fania) and was appointed General Manager and Executive Vice President of [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]\u2019 Latin Music Division (UA Latino). There, he not only signed artists but established new distribution outlets and brought promotional techniques to the label that were innovative. These were the label\u2019s most profitable years, with such international latin stars as Raphael, [[Tito Rodr\u00edguez|Tito Rodriguez]], [[Nelson Ned]], [[Ismael Quintana]], [[Morris Albert]] (\u201c[[Feelings (Morris Albert song)|Feelings]]\u201d), [[Chucho Avellanet]], Martinha, [[Mocedades]], [[Astor Piazzolla|Astor Piazzola]] and Jose Trellis all forming part of its huge roster. \u201cThe Harvey Averne Group\u201d also recorded \u201cLet\u2019s Get It Together You and Me\u201d for United Artists Records.\n\nHarvey Averne remained active as Vice President and General Manager of UA Latino until 1972, when he decided to create his own label, CoCo Records. By 1977 his company had gained international prominence, due to a license agreement with Spain\u2019s Zafiro Records. CoCo acquired Zafiro\u2019s catalogue for distribution in the U.S.A., which also included some Latin American territories. The roster of stars on the Zafiro label included [[Juan Carlos Calder\u00f3n|Juan Carlos Calderon]], [[Paloma San Basilio|Basilio]], Juan Bau, Mocedades (\u201c[[Eres t\u00fa|Eres Tu]]\u201d), Astor Piazzola and [[Joan Manuel Serrat]], among others. In exchange, CoCo was distributed exclusively in Spain by Zafiro. In 1979 Averne partnered with Lenny Fitchelberg and Sam Goff, forming [[Prism Records]]. The Prism label specialized in [[Disco]] dance music (a genre that peaked in popularity during the late 1970s), releasing such top ten hits as the Erotic Drum Band\u2019s \u201cPlug Me To Death\u201d and \u201cNot Too Young\u201d by Alfonso \u201cThe Tap Dance Kid\u201d by Ribeiro. In addition, he produced and re-mixed [[Regine Velasquez|Regine\u2019s]] International Hit \u201cJe Survivrai\u201d (I Will Survive) and a disco version of [[Eric Clapton|Eric Clapton\u2019s]] \u201c[[Cocaine (song)|Cocaine]]\u201d by Chi-Chi Favelas.\n\n==Life after Coco==\n\nAlthough CoCo continued to produce major hits throughout the 1970s, there were numerous financial problems and by the advent of 1980s the record company was no longer the major force it had previously been. Averne had already relocated to [[France]] and [[Belgium]] in 1979 to work on [[Euro disco|Euro-Disco]] productions for Aquarius-Unidans Records, working with Jean Claude Pellerin & Jean Van Loo in production of tracks for various artists, including [[Patrick Hernandez]], whose hit \u201c[[Born to Be Alive (song)|Born To Be Alive]]\u201d sold more than six million copies worldwide. While in Europe, Averne negotiated a license agreement between [[Aquarius Records (Canada)|Aquarius]]/Unidans and [[CBS Records International|CBS]]/[[Atomic Records]] for U.S.A. distribution. He also discovered [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and presented her to Aquarius/Unidans Records. The fledgling singer was hired as back-up dancer for [[Patrick Hernandez]] for his live shows and tours and was subsequently signed to her first recording contract with Aquarius/Unidans. After 1979, Averne divested his interests from his various labels and retired from the music and record business. When gambling was legalized in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] he went into the real estate and time share business there, later branching out into the state of [[Florida]]. During this time he continued to reside in New York\u2019s [[Upper East Side]], where he lived from 1963 to 2004.\n\nAverne has made a bit of a comeback in recent years, re-appearing on the Latin music scene in New York City. In particular, he worked with New York-based boogaloo revival band [[Spanglish Fly]], led by [[Jonathan Goldman]], to produce two of their tracks, \"Brooklyn Boogaloo\" and \"My Shingaling Boy.\"\n\n==Sampling==\n\nIn 1993 the pioneer rapper [[Big Daddy Kane]] sampled Averne\u2019s \u201cLullaby from Rosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d for the track \u201cRest In Peace\u201d and released it in the [[Cold Chillin' Records|Cold Chillin]]/[[Warner Records|Warner Bros]]/ [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] album \u201c[[Looks Like a Job For...]].\u201d. In 1967, American [[Minimalism|minimalist]] composer [[Terry Riley]] got his hands on the song \u201cYou\u2019re No Good\u201d, a latin-[[Soul music|soul]]-[[boogaloo]] type number that had been previously released by Averne that same year. Upon hearing Averne\u2019s original track, Riley went into the studio, sampled it and created what soon became one of his all time classic tracks (Riley\u2019s version is a great tune in its own right and is credited as \u201cthe world\u2019s first remix\u201d).\n\n==Miguelito Documentary==\nCurrently in post-production a [[documentary film]] is being made by [[Australia]]n filmmaker Sam Zubrycki about Averne\u2019s 1973 CoCo Records production entitled 'Miguelito: Canto a Borinquen.' Told by the fans and people that knew of and loved his music,  \u2018Miguelito: Canto a Borinquen\u2019 is a film that goes on a journey that traces the mysterious disappearance of the eleven year old Puerto Rican salsa singer Miguelito and the rediscovery of his life and music decades later.\n\n==Harvey Averne Discography==\n\n1967 The Harvey Averne Dozen \n\u201cVIVA SOUL\u201d Atlantic Records\n\n1967 La Lupe \n\u201cTHE QUEEN DOES HER OWN THING\u201d Tico/Roulete Records\n\n1967 Larry Harlow \u201cEL EXIGENTE\u201d \nfeaturing Ismael Miranda Fania Records\n\n1967 Polito Vega \u201cCANTA PARA TI\u201d \nProducers: Johnny Pacheco/Harvey AverneFania Records\n\n1967 Terry Riley \u201cTHE WORLD'S FIRST REMIX\u201d Sampled the Harvey Averne Dozen track \u201cYou\u2019re No Good\u201d from \u201cViva Soul\u201d \nAtlantic Records and is credited with \u201cThe World\u2019s First Remix\u201d\n\n1968 Ray Barretto \u201cACID\u201d Fania Records\n\n1968 George Guzman \u201cINTRODUCING GEORGE GUZMAN\u201d Fania Records\n\n1968 Latinaires \u201cCAMEL WALK\u201d Fania Records\n\n1969 The Harvey Averne Dozen  \u201cTHE HARVEY AVERNE DOZEN\u201d Fania Records\n\n1970 Joan Manuel Serrat \u201cMI NI\u00d1EZ\u201d Zafiro/CoCo Records\n\n1970 The Harvey Averne Band \u201cBROTHERHOOD\u201d Fania Records\n\n1971 Harvey Averne Barrio Band \u201cROCK \u2018N LATIN\u201d Heavy Duty/Fania Records\n\n1971 Ralfi Pagan \u201cI WANT TO MAKE IT WITH YOU\u201d Scepter/Wand/Fania Records\n\n1971 Markolino Dimond \u201cBRUJERIA\u201d Vocals: Angel CanalesVaya/Fania Records\n\n1971 Nelson Ned \u201cCANCION POPULAR\u201d United Artists Latino (1st Spanish Album)\n\n1971 Martina \u201cMARTINA\u201d United Artists Latino (1st Spanish Album)\n\n1971 Chakachas \u201cJUNGLE FEVER\u201d Polydor Records\n\n1971 Vicentico Valdes  \u201cAMOR Y FELICIDAD\u201d United Artists Latino\n\n1971 Tito Rodriguez \u201cRETURNS TO THE PALLADIUM LIVE\u201d United Artists Latino\n\n1971 Javier Oliva \u201cSENTIMIENTO\u201d Volume No.1 United Artists Latino\n\n1971 Tito Rodriguez \u201cTITO RODRIQUEZ AND HIS ORCHESTRA\u201d United Artists Latino\n\n1972 Massiel \u201cLO MEJOR DE MASSIEL\u201d Zafiro/CoCo Records\n\n1972 Mocedades \u201cEXITOS DE ORO\u201d Zafiro/CoCo Records\n\n1972 Toro (Latin Rock) \u201cTORO\u201d Heavy Duty/Fania Records\n\n1972 Nelson Feliciano \u201cNELSON FELICIANO\u201d Vocals: Junior Cordova Mango/CoCo Records\n\n1972 Orchestra Dee Jay  \u201cORCHESTRA DEE JAY\u201d Vocals: Rafael de Jesus Mango/CoCo Records\n\n1973 Paul Ortiz y La Orquesta Son \u201cMEREMBE\u201d Mango/CoCo Records\n\n1973 Eddie Palmieri \u201cSENTIDO\u201d Vocals: Ismael Quintana Mango/CoCo Records\n\n1973 Nelson Feliciano / Kito Velez \u201cNELSON FELICIANO\u201d Vocals: Joe P.

Established in 1972, CoCo was a label specializing in [[Music of African heritage in Cuba|Afro-Cuban]] and [[Latin American music in the United States|Latin American Popular music]], with special emphasis on the \u201cNew York Sound\u201d, commonly referred to as \u201c[[Salsa music|Salsa]]\u201d. Averne\u2019s gift for identifying and bringing together new and established musical talent, along with the careful management of his artists\u2019 public image, initially made CoCo Records a major label nationally, and subsequently an international success. Over the next decade, he signed internationally known artists and was instrumental in bringing Latin American music into the American cultural mainstream.\n\nIn 1972 Averne signed the iconic artist [[Eddie Palmieri]] to his label, producing and mixing two of Palmieri\u2019s groundbreaking albums; \u201cSentido\u201d and \u201cSun Of Latin Music\u201d. These recordings were considered radical departures from the type of dance oriented music that had prevailed during the previous two decades. The latter album earned Palmieri, Averne and CoCo the first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] ever awarded to an artist in the newly created \u201cLatin Music\u201d category (1975). \n\nThe following year (1976), Averne produced and mixed a third Eddie Palmieri album (\u201cUnfinished Masterpiece\u201d), which also won the coveted Grammy award. In addition, he achieved major successes in 1977 with two Grammy nominations for his productions of the [[Danny Rivera]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9|Eydie Gorme]] hit \u201cPara Decir Adios\u201d (from the album \u201cMuy Amigos\u201d) and The Machito Orchestra with [[Lalo Rodr\u00edguez|Lalo Rodriguez]] (\u201cFireworks\u201d). Both albums were included among the final five nominees. \n\nIn subsequent years, various artists who were signed to the CoCo family of labels also won numerous awards and nominations. The list includes such notables as [[Lissette Alvarez]], [[Wilkins (singer)|Wilkins]], [[Mario Bauz\u00e1|Mario Bauza]] and [[Graciela]], [[Yolandita Monge]], [[Steve Lawrence]], [[Trini Lopez]], [[Rafael Cortijo]], [[Ismael Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Fajardo (musician)|Jose Fajardo]], [[Charlie Palmieri]], Joe Quijano and [[Orquesta Broadway]], among others. The diversity of the CoCo catalogue actually brought a wider awareness of traditional Latin music to a new generation.\n\n==Early life==\nBy the time Averne was fourteen he was a professional musician. During the mid 1950s through the 1970s he appeared in hundreds of reviews and shows, at such popular New York venues as the Boulevard Night Club (Queens), [[Palladium Ballroom|The Palladium Ballroom]], [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], [[Village Gate|The Village Gate]], Jules Podell's [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]], [[Roseland Ballroom]], Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]], [[Cotton Club|The Cotton Club]], [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Basin Street East]], The Cheetah and [[Academy of Music (New York City)|The New York Academy Of Music,]] as well as [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[Aragon Ballroom (Chicago)|Aragon Ballroom]], [[Roberto Clemente Coliseum|Coliseo Roberto Clemente]] in [[Puerto Rico]] and the famed [[Hollywood Palladium]]. He found steady work and much inspiration during these years, appearing with such notables as [[Don Rickles]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[James Brown]], [[Jerry Butler]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[The Main Ingredient (band)|The Main Ingredient]], [[Grover Washington Jr.|Grover Washington Jr]], [[Al Green]], and [[Frankie Crocker]], among others. In addition to the New York cabaret and club circuit, he performed with his own band \u201cArvito & His Latin Rhythms\u201d in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill Mountain]] Resort Area (also known as the [[Borscht Belt]], or the Jewish Alps), a popular vacation spot for New Yorkers since the 1920s. He worked there from 1950 through 1963, as well as in [[Long Island|Long Island\u2019s]] [[Lido Beach, New York|Lido Beach]] and [[Long Beach, New York|Long Beach]], a strip which was known for its private beach clubs and hotels. He brought his fiery dance rhythms into the Malibu Beach Club, Colony Beach Club, The Coral Reef, The Monaco, The Sands and The Shelbourne. These venues drew thousands of day-tripper/ members who arrived early to enjoy their cabanas, beaches, pools and tennis courts. Later in the evening, the patrons would dress up elegantly for dinner in the restaurants and take in star-studded shows in the nightclubs. The aforementioned clubs offered such big-name performers as Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, [[Jackie Mason]], Mal Z. Lawrence, [[Al Martino]], [[Buddy Hackett]], Hines, Hines and Dad; as well as the popular Latin bands of [[Tito Puente]], [[Machito]], [[Tito Rodr\u00edguez|Tito Rodriguez]], [[Eddie Palmieri]], [[Larry Harlow (musician)|Larry Harlow]], [[Joe Cuba]], La Playa Sextet and of course Arvito & His Latin Rhythms. All of these stars performed regularly at both the beach clubs and the Catskill resort hotels. Curiously, it was amidst all of this showbiz glitz that Harvey\u2019s love for Latin American music and culture further manifested itself.\n\n==Recording Career==\n\nA prolific songwriter in his own right (over fifty of his songs have been recorded), Averne wrote most of the material for his newly formed group \u201cThe Harvey Averne Dozen\u201d. Their album \u201cViva Soul\u201d, for Atlantic Records included the top selling hit \u201cMy Dream\u201d as well as the often recorded and sampled \u201cYou\u2019re No Good\u201d, both of which are Averne-Sheller compositions. A second album for the Fania label, the self-titled \u201cHarvey Averne Dozen\u201d included Averne compositions \u201cAccept Me\u201d, \u201cCan You Dig It\u201d and the international dance hit \u201cNever Learned to Dance\u201d. It also included the movie theme \u201cLullaby from [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary\u2019s Baby]]\u201d (Harvey\u2019s recording was subsequently sampled by Big Daddy Kane on his track \u201cRest In Peace\u201d). He changed the name of the group to \u201cThe Harvey Averne Band\u201d for the [[Fania Records|Fania]] release \u201cBrotherhood\u201d (1970). This album included various Latin crossover hits such as \u201cLovers\u201d, \u201cCome Back Baby\u201d, \u201cCome On And Do Me\u201d and the pop hit \u201cCentral Park\u201d. Around this time he began reinvesting his songwriting success into producing, and after years of hard work as a musician he was able to make the transition.\n\n==Producing Career and Coco Records==\n\nIn addition to his involvement with the Fania label, Averne had other equally important projects that were also well received. In 1969 he produced, directed and mixed \u201cThe Queen Does Her Own Thing\u201d for the extremely popular [[Cubans|Cuban]] artist [[La Lupe]]. The album was released on [[Roulette Records|Roulette]]/[[Tico Records]] and included the hit single \u201cSe Acabo\u201d (Once We Loved). In addition, he produced and mixed the \u201cThe Harvey Averne Barrio Band\u201d and \u201cToro\u201d albums, for Heavy Duty/Fania Records. During his tenure at Fania he either produced or supervised recordings by [[Ray Barretto]], [[Willie Col\u00f3n|Willie Colon]], Orquesta Harlow, [[H\u00e9ctor Lavoe|Hector Lavoe]], [[Ismael Miranda]], [[Bobby Valent\u00edn|Bobby Valentin]], [[Mongo Santamar\u00eda|Mongo Santamaria]], [[Johnny Pacheco]], [[Roberto Roena]], [[Joe Bataan]], [[Ralfi Pagan]], The Latineers and George Guzman, among others. While maintaining a managerial position as Vice President, Averne was still signed to the label as a recording artist and producer (a rarity back then), and freelanced on various productions for [[Scepter Records|Scepter]]/[[Wand Records|Wand]], Heavy Duty, Uptite and [[Atlantic Records]] as well. He was later named Executive Vice President of Fania\u2019s new subsidiary Vaya Records. At Vaya he worked closely with such artists as [[Celia Cruz]], [[Cheo Feliciano]], [[Ricardo Ray]] and [[Bobby Cruz]], Bobby Rodriguez y La Compa\u00f1ia and Markolino Diamond (which featured Angel Canales\u2019s singing debut). Averne ran the Vaya label through 1971, and was responsible for all administrative functions and production. \n \nIn 1971 an obscure studio band known as [[The Chakachas]] recorded the hit single \u201c[[Jungle Fever (song)|Jungle Fever]],\u201d of which Averne became the band leader. This recording sold more than two million copies and won the [[ASCAP Award]] as one of the most performed songs of the year in their catalogue. Averne also produced the crossover hit gold record \u201cI Want To Make It With You\u201d for the artist [[Ralfi Pagan]] (Scepter/ Wand/Fania) and was appointed General Manager and Executive Vice President of [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]\u2019 Latin Music Division (UA Latino). There, he not only signed artists but established new distribution outlets and brought promotional techniques to the label that were innovative. These were the label\u2019s most profitable years, with such international latin stars as Raphael, [[Tito Rodr\u00edguez|Tito Rodriguez]], [[Nelson Ned]], [[Ismael Quintana]], [[Morris Albert]] (\u201c[[Feelings (Morris Albert song)|Feelings]]\u201d), [[Chucho Avellanet]], Martinha, [[Mocedades]], [[Astor Piazzolla|Astor Piazzola]] and Jose Trellis all forming part of its huge roster. \u201cThe Harvey Averne Group\u201d also recorded \u201cLet\u2019s Get It Together You and Me\u201d for United Artists Records. \n\nHarvey Averne remained active as Vice President and General Manager of UA Latino until 1972, when he decided to create his own label, CoCo Records. By 1977 his company had gained international prominence, due to a license agreement with Spain\u2019s Zafiro Records. CoCo acquired Zafiro\u2019s catalogue for distribution in the U.S.A., which also included some Latin American territories. The roster of stars on the Zafiro label included [[Juan Carlos Calder\u00f3n|Juan Carlos Calderon]], [[Paloma San Basilio|Basilio]], Juan Bau, Mocedades (\u201c[[Eres t\u00fa|Eres Tu]]\u201d), Astor Piazzola and [[Joan Manuel Serrat]], among others. In exchange, CoCo was distributed exclusively in Spain by Zafiro. In 1979 Averne partnered with Lenny Fitchelberg and Sam Goff, forming [[Prism Records]]. The Prism label specialized in [[Disco]] dance music (a genre that peaked in popularity during the late 1970s), releasing such top ten hits as the Erotic Drum Band\u2019s \u201cPlug Me To Death\u201d and \u201cNot Too Young\u201d by Alfonso \u201cThe Tap Dance Kid\u201d by Ribeiro. In addition, he produced and re-mixed [[Regine Velasquez|Regine\u2019s]] International Hit \u201cJe Survivrai\u201d (I Will Survive) and a disco version of [[Eric Clapton|Eric Clapton\u2019s]] \u201c[[Cocaine (song)|Cocaine]]\u201d by Chi-Chi Favelas.\n\n==Life after Coco==\n\nAlthough CoCo continued to produce major hits throughout the 1970s, there were numerous financial problems and by the advent of 1980s the record company was no longer the major force it had previously been. Averne had already relocated to [[France]] and [[Belgium]] in 1979 to work on [[Euro disco|Euro-Disco]] productions for Aquarius-Unidans Records, working with Jean Claude Pellerin & Jean Van Loo in production of tracks for various artists, including [[Patrick Hernandez]], whose hit \u201c[[Born to Be Alive (song)|Born To Be Alive]]\u201d sold more than six million copies worldwide. While in Europe, Averne negotiated a license agreement between [[Aquarius Records (Canada)|Aquarius]]/Unidans and [[CBS Records International|CBS]]/[[Atomic Records]] for U.S.A. distribution. He also discovered [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and presented her to Aquarius/Unidans Records. The fledgling singer was hired as back-up dancer for [[Patrick Hernandez]] for his live shows and tours and was subsequently signed to her first recording contract with Aquarius/Unidans. After 1979, Averne divested his interests from his various labels and retired from the music and record business. When gambling was legalized in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] he went into the real estate and time share business there, later branching out into the state of [[Florida]]. During this time he continued to reside in New York\u2019s [[Upper East Side]], where he lived from 1963 to 2004.\n\nAverne has made a bit of a comeback in recent years, re-appearing on the Latin music scene in New York City. In particular, he worked with New York-based boogaloo revival band [[Spanglish Fly]], led by [[Jonathan Goldman]], to produce two of their tracks, \"Brooklyn Boogaloo\" and \"My Shingaling Boy.\"\n\n==Sampling==\n\nIn 1993 the pioneer rapper [[Big Daddy Kane]] sampled Averne\u2019s \u201cLullaby from Rosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d for the track \u201cRest In Peace\u201d and released it in the [[Cold Chillin' Records|Cold Chillin]]/[[Warner Records|Warner Bros]]/ [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] album \u201c[[Looks Like a Job For...|Looks Like a Job For....]]\u201d. In 1967, American [[Minimalism|minimalist]] composer [[Terry Riley]] got his hands on the song \u201cYou\u2019re No Good\u201d, a latin-[[Soul music|soul]]-[[boogaloo]] type number that had been previously released by Averne that same year. Upon hearing Averne\u2019s original track, Riley went into the studio, sampled it and created what soon became one of his all time classic tracks (Riley\u2019s version is a great tune in its own right and is credited as \u201cthe world\u2019s first remix\u201d).\n\n==Miguelito Documentary==\nCurrently in post-production a [[documentary film]] is being made by [[Australia|Australian]] filmmaker Sam Zubrycki about Averne\u2019s 1973 CoCo Records production entitled 'Miguelito: Canto a Borinquen.'
