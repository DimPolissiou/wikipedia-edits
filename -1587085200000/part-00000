She was raised in a devout [[Episcopalian]] household. She had three brothers who lived in town, three older sisters, and three younger sisters.<ref name=VirginiaEdu/> She grew up in the [[Carlyle House]] in Alexandria<ref name=VA/> along with her older sister Lydia, her mother Jane Muir Green, and her father [[James Green (Alexandria VA businessman)|James]]. In her youth, Emma Green sometimes stayed at the adjacent [[Mansion House Hospital|Mansion Hotel House]] owned by her family, or stayed at their 232 acre family farm outside town called The Grove.<ref name=VirginiaEdu/>   \n\nHer father, James Green, was the owner of the [[Mansion House Hospital|Mansion House Hotel]] and also the richest man in Alexandria by 1859. His hotel housed boarders, servants, and 16 slaves, including several enslaved children.

He died in exile in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1939.\n\nIn founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]] and discovered [[transference]], establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the [[Oedipus complex]] as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory.<ref>Jones, Ernest (1949) ''What is Psychoanalysis ?'' London: Allen & Unwin. p. 47.</ref> His analysis of [[dream]]s as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]].

His research work in cerebral anatomy led to the publication of an influential paper on the palliative effects of cocaine in 1884 and his work on [[aphasia]] would form the basis of his first book ''On the Aphasias: a Critical Study'', published in 1891. Over a three-year period, Freud worked in various departments of the hospital. His time spent in [[Theodor Meynert]]'s [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] clinic and as a [[locum]] in a local asylum led to an increased interest in clinical work. His substantial body of published research led to his appointment as a university lecturer or [[docent]] in [[neuropathology]] in 1885, a non-salaried post but one which entitled him to give lectures at the University of Vienna.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 42\u201347.</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Freud resigned his hospital post and entered private practice specializing in \"nervous disorders\". The same year he married [[Martha Bernays]], the granddaughter of [[Isaac Bernays]], a chief rabbi in Hamburg. They had six children: Mathilde (b. 1887), Jean-Martin (b. 1889), Oliver (b. 1891), [[Ernst L. Freud|Ernst]] (b. 1892), Sophie (b. 1893), and [[Anna Freud|Anna]] (b. 1895). From 1891 until they left Vienna in 1938, Freud and his family lived in an apartment at [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Berggasse 19]], near [[Innere Stadt]], a historical district of Vienna.\n\n[[File:Freud egykori lakhelye B\u00e9csben (Berggasse 19.).jpg|thumb|right|alt=photograph|Freud's home at [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Berggasse 19]], Vienna]]\nIn 1896, Minna Bernays, Martha Freud's sister, became a permanent member of the Freud household after the death of her fianc\u00e9.

He adopted the approach of his friend and collaborator, [[Josef Breuer]], in a type of hypnosis which was different from the French methods he had studied, in that it did not use suggestion. The treatment of one particular patient of Breuer's proved to be transformative for Freud's clinical practice. Described as [[Anna O.]], she was invited to talk about her symptoms while under hypnosis (she would coin the phrase \"[[talking cure]]\" for her treatment). In the course of talking in this way, her symptoms became reduced in severity as she retrieved memories of traumatic incidents associated with their onset.\n\nThe inconsistent results of Freud's early clinical work eventually led him to abandon hypnosis, having concluded that more consistent and effective symptom relief could be achieved by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition, about whatever ideas or memories occurred to them. In conjunction with this procedure, which he called \"[[free association (psychology)|free association]]\", Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] which, he had concluded, underlay symptom formation. By 1896 he was using the term \"[[psychoanalysis]]\" to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 64\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freudsdoor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Ornate staircase, a landing with an interior door and window, staircase continuing up|Approach to Freud's consulting rooms at Berggasse 19]]\n\nFreud's development of these new theories took place during a period in which he experienced heart irregularities, disturbing dreams and periods of depression, a \"neurasthenia\" which he linked to the death of his father in 1896<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |title=jewishvirtuallibrary Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939) |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509021811/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and which prompted a \"self-analysis\" of his own dreams and memories of childhood. His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his mother's affections led him to fundamentally revise his theory of the origin of the neuroses.\n\nOn the basis of his early clinical work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as [[Freud's seduction theory]].<ref>Freud 1896c, pp. 203, 211, 219; Eissler 2005, p. 96.</ref> In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis can be traced back to the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.<ref>J. Forrester ''The Seductions of Psychoanalysis'' Cambridge University Press 1990, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThis transition from the theory of infantile sexual trauma as a general explanation of how all neuroses originate to one that presupposes an autonomous infantile sexuality provided the basis for Freud's subsequent formulation of the theory of the [[Oedipus complex]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 88\u201396.</ref>\n\nFreud described the evolution of his clinical method and set out his theory of the psychogenetic origins of hysteria, demonstrated in a number of case histories, in ''Studies on Hysteria'' published in 1895 (co-authored with [[Josef Breuer]]). In 1899 he published ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in which, following a critical review of existing theory, Freud gives detailed interpretations of his own and his patients' dreams in terms of [[Wish fulfillment|wish-fulfillments]] made subject to the repression and censorship of the \"dream work\". He then sets out the theoretical model of mental structure (the unconscious, pre-conscious and conscious) on which this account is based. An abridged version, ''On Dreams'', was published in 1901. In works which would win him a more general readership, Freud applied his theories outside the clinical setting in ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'' (1901) and ''[[Humor in Freud|Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' (1905).<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, pp. 55\u201381.</ref> In ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', published in 1905, Freud elaborates his theory of infantile sexuality, describing its \"polymorphous perverse\" forms and the functioning of the \"drives\", to which it gives rise, in the formation of sexual identity.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, p. 91.</ref> The same year he published ''[[Dora (case study)|Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria]]'', which became one of his more famous and controversial case studies.<ref>Charles Bernheimer and Claire Kahane (eds) ''In Dora's Case: Freud \u2013 Hysteria \u2013 Feminism'', London: Virago 1985.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Fliess===\nDuring this formative period of his work, Freud valued and came to rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend [[Wilhelm Fliess]], a Berlin-based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human [[biorhythm]]s and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality \u2014 masturbation, [[coitus interruptus]], and the use of condoms \u2014 in the etiology of what were then called the \"actual neuroses,\" primarily [[neurasthenia]] and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms.<ref name=massonee>{{cite book |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Assault on Truth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=5G0QAQAAIAAJ 1984] |publisher=Untreed Reads |isbn=978-1-61187-280-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&pg=PT18 18]}}</ref> They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas.

According to Freud, her history of symptoms included severe leg pains with consequent restricted mobility, as well as stomach and menstrual pains. These pains were, according to Fliess's theories, caused by habitual masturbation which, as the tissue of the nose and genitalia were linked, was curable by removal of part of the [[Middle nasal concha|middle turbinate]].<ref name=Masson>Masson, Jeffrey M.

At first, though aware of Fliess's culpability \u2013 Freud fled from the remedial surgery in horror \u2013 he could only bring himself to delicately intimate in his correspondence to Fliess the nature of his disastrous role and in subsequent letters maintained a tactful silence on the matter or else returned to the face-saving topic of Eckstein's hysteria. Freud ultimately, in light of Eckstein's history of adolescent self-cutting and irregular nasal (and menstrual) bleeding, concluded that Fliess was \"completely without blame\", as Eckstein's post-operative haemorrhages were hysterical \"wish-bleedings\" linked to \"an old wish to be loved in her illness\" and triggered as a means of \"rearousing [Freud's] affection\". Eckstein nonetheless continued her analysis with Freud. She was restored to full mobility and went on to practice psychoanalysis herself.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 84\u201387, 154\u201356.</ref><ref>Schur, Max. \"Some Additional 'Day Residues' of the Specimen Dream of Psychoanalysis.\" In ''Psychoananalysis, A General Psychology'', ed.

Their friendship came to an acrimonious end with Fliess angry at Freud's unwillingness to endorse his general theory of sexual periodicity and accusing him of collusion in the plagiarism of his work. After Fliess failed to respond to Freud's offer of collaboration over publication of his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' in 1906, their relationship came to an end.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 154\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Early followers===\n[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark.jpg|thumb|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]].

This meeting, which was retrospectively deemed to be the first International Psychoanalytic Congress,<ref>Jones, E. 1955, pp. 44\u201345</ref> was convened at the suggestion of [[Ernest Jones]], then a London-based neurologist who had discovered Freud's writings and begun applying psychoanalytic methods in his clinical work. Jones had met Jung at a conference the previous year and they met up again in Z\u00fcrich to organize the Congress. There were, as Jones records, \"forty-two present, half of whom were or became practicing analysts.\"<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) Sigmund Freud: Life and Work. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books p. 332</ref> In addition to Jones and the Viennese and Z\u00fcrich contingents accompanying Freud and Jung, also present and notable for their subsequent importance in the psychoanalytic movement were [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Max Eitingon]] from Berlin, [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] from Budapest and the New York-based [[Abraham Brill]].\n\nImportant decisions were taken at the Congress with a view to advancing the impact of Freud's work. A journal, the ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr psychoanalytische und psychopathologishe Forschungen'', was launched in 1909 under the editorship of Jung. This was followed in 1910 by the monthly ''[[Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'' edited by Adler and Stekel, in 1911 by ''Imago'', a journal devoted to the application of psychoanalysis to the field of cultural and literary studies edited by Rank and in 1913 by the ''[[Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'', also edited by Rank.<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) ''Sigmund Freud: Life and Work''. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books pp. 334, 352, 361</ref> Plans for an [[International Psychoanalytical Association|international association of psychoanalysts]] were put in place and these were implemented at the Nuremberg Congress of 1910 where Jung was elected, with Freud's support, as its first president.\n\nFreud turned to Brill and Jones to further his ambition to spread the psychoanalytic cause in the English-speaking world. Both were invited to Vienna following the Salzburg Congress and a division of labour was agreed with Brill given the translation rights for Freud's works, and Jones, who was to take up a post at the [[University of Toronto]] later in the year, tasked with establishing a platform for Freudian ideas in North American academic and medical life.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 186</ref> Jones's advocacy prepared the way for Freud's visit to the United States, accompanied by Jung and Ferenczi, in September 1909 at the invitation of [[G.

Freud's audience included the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist [[James Jackson Putnam]], Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System at [[Harvard]], who invited Freud to his country retreat where they held extensive discussions over a period of four days. Putnam's subsequent public endorsement of Freud's work represented a significant breakthrough for the psychoanalytic cause in the United States.<ref name=\"Gaypage212\">Gay 2006, p. 212</ref> When Putnam and Jones organised the founding of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] in May 1911 they were elected president and secretary respectively. Brill founded the [[New York Psychoanalytic Society]] the same year. His English translations of Freud's work began to appear from 1909.\n\n====Resignations from the IPA====\nSome of Freud's followers subsequently withdrew from the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA) and founded their own schools.\n\nFrom 1909, Adler's views on topics such as neurosis began to differ markedly from those held by Freud. As Adler's position appeared increasingly incompatible with Freudianism, a series of confrontations between their respective viewpoints took place at the meetings of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society in January and February 1911. In February 1911, Adler, then the president of the society, resigned his position. At this time, Stekel also resigned his position as vice president of the society. Adler finally left the Freudian group altogether in June 1911 to found his own organization with nine other members who had also resigned from the group.<ref>Three members of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society resigned at the same time as Adler to establish the Society for Free Psychoanalysis. Six other members of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society who attempted to retain links to both the Adlerian and Freudian camps were forced out after Freud insisted that they must choose one side or another. {{cite book|last=Makari|first=George|title=Revolution in Mind: the Creation of Psychoanalysis|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne University Publishing|location=Carlton, Vic.|isbn=978-0-522-85480-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uPWBHwLjeXsC&pg=PA262|edition=Australian|page=262}}</ref> This new formation was initially called ''Society for Free Psychoanalysis'' but it was soon renamed the ''Society for Individual Psychology''.

To distinguish his system from psychoanalysis, Jung called it [[analytical psychology]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ellenberger|first=Henri F.|title=The Discovery of the Unconscious: the History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry|url=https://archive.org/details/discoveryofuncon00ellerich|url-access=registration|year=1970|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01673-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/discoveryofuncon00ellerich/page/456 456]|edition=[Repr.]}}</ref> Anticipating the final breakdown of the relationship between Freud and Jung, Ernest Jones initiated the formation of a secret Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical coherence and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and [[Hanns Sachs]]. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of [[psychoanalytic theory]] before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the ''Jarhbuch'' and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Z\u00fcrich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 229\u201330, 241</ref><!--This might have more meaning if we actually knew what the Z\u00fcrich Society was.-->\n\nLater the same year, Freud published a paper entitled \"[[s:The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement|The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement]]\", the German original being first published in the ''Jahrbuch'', giving his view on the birth and evolution of the psychoanalytic movement and the withdrawal of Adler and Jung from it.\n\nThe final defection from Freud's inner circle occurred following the publication in 1924 of Rank's ''[[The Trauma of Birth]]'' which other members of the committee read as, in effect, abandoning the Oedipus Complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytic theory. Abraham and Jones became increasingly forceful critics of Rank and though he and Freud were reluctant to end their close and long-standing relationship the break finally came in 1926 when Rank resigned from his official posts in the IPA and left Vienna for Paris. His place on the committee was taken by [[Anna Freud]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 474\u201381</ref> Rank eventually settled in the United States where his revisions of Freudian theory were to influence a new generation of therapists uncomfortable with the orthodoxies of the IPA.\n\n===Early psychoanalytic movement===\n{{psychoanalysis}}\nAfter the founding of the IPA in 1910, an international network of psychoanalytical societies, training institutes and clinics became well established and a regular schedule of biannual Congresses commenced after the end of [[World War I]] to coordinate their activities.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 460</ref>\n\nAbraham and Eitingon founded the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society in 1910 and then the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]] and the Poliklinik in 1920. The Poliklinik's innovations of free treatment, and child analysis and the Berlin Institute's standardisation of psychoanalytic training had a major influence on the wider psychoanalytic movement. In 1927 [[Ernst Simmel]] founded the [[Schloss Tegel]] Sanatorium on the outskirts of [[Berlin]], the first such establishment to provide psychoanalytic treatment in an institutional framework. Freud organised a fund to help finance its activities and his architect son, Ernst, was commissioned to refurbish the building. It was forced to close in 1931 for economic reasons.<ref>[[Elizabeth Danto|Danto, Elizabeth Ann]] (2005). ''Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis and Social Justice, 1918\u20131938''.

Freud's Russian followers were the first to benefit from translations of his work, the 1904 Russian translation of ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' appearing nine years before Brill's English edition. The Russian Institute was unique in receiving state support for its activities, including publication of translations of Freud's works.<ref>Miller, Martin (1998) ''Freud and the Bolsheviks'', Yale University Press pp. 24, 59</ref> Support was abruptly annulled in 1924, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, after which psychoanalysis was denounced on ideological grounds.<ref>Miller (1998), p. 94.</ref>\n\nAfter helping found the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] in 1911, Ernest Jones returned to Britain from Canada in 1913 and founded the London Psychoanalytic Society the same year. In 1919, he dissolved this organisation and, with its core membership purged of Jungian adherents, founded the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]], serving as its president until 1944. The Institute of Psychoanalysis was established 1924 and the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis established in 1926, both under Jones's directorship.<ref>Maddox, Brenda (2006).

He kept abreast of developments through a regular correspondence with his principal followers and via the circular letters and meetings of the secret Committee which he continued to attend.\n\nThe Committee continued to function until 1927 by which time institutional developments within the IPA, such as the establishment of the International Training Commission, had addressed concerns about the transmission of psychoanalytic theory and practice. There remained, however, significant differences over the issue of lay analysis \u2013 i.e. the acceptance of non-medically qualified candidates for psychoanalytic training. Freud set out his case in favour in 1926 in his ''[[The Question of Lay Analysis]]''. He was resolutely opposed by the American societies who expressed concerns over professional standards and the risk of litigation (though child analysts were made exempt). These concerns were also shared by some of his European colleagues. Eventually an agreement was reached allowing societies autonomy in setting criteria for candidature.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 490\u2013500</ref>\n\nIn 1930 Freud was awarded the [[Goethe Prize]] in recognition of his contributions to psychology and to German literary culture.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 571</ref>\n\n===Patients===\nFreud used pseudonyms in his case histories. Some patients known by pseudonyms were [[C\u00e4cilie M.]] (Anna von Lieben); [[Dora (case study)|Dora]] (Ida Bauer, 1882\u20131945); Frau Emmy von N. (Fanny Moser); Fr\u00e4ulein Elisabeth von R.

He initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, telling him that the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the [[dermatologist]] Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism \"a bad leukoplakia\" instead of the technical diagnosis [[epithelioma]]. Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a [[rhinologist]] whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled during and after the operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 419\u201320</ref>\n\n===Escape from Nazism===\nIn January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] took control of Germany, and Freud's books were prominent among those they [[Nazi book burnings|burned and destroyed]]. Freud remarked to [[Ernest Jones]]: \"What progress we are making. In the [[Middle Ages]] they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning my books.\"<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 592\u201393.</ref> Freud continued to underestimate the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the [[Anschluss]] of 13 March 1938, in which [[Nazi Germany]] annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent [[antisemitism]] that ensued.<ref name=Gay618>Gay 2006, pp. 618\u201320, 624\u201325.</ref> Jones, the then president of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud to change his mind and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the arrest and interrogation of Anna Freud by the [[Gestapo]] finally convinced Freud it was time to leave Austria.<ref name=Gay618/> Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of \u00e9migr\u00e9s for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the [[Royal Society]], [[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Bragg]], to write to the Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his ex-patient and American ambassador to France, [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]]. Bullitt alerted U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] to the increased dangers facing the Freuds, resulting in the American consul-general in Vienna, [[John Cooper Wiley]], arranging regular monitoring of Berggasse 19. He also intervened by phone call during the Gestapo interrogation of Anna Freud.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 152\u201353.</ref>\n\nThe departure from Vienna began in stages throughout April and May 1938. Freud's grandson Ernst Halberstadt and Freud's son Martin's wife and children left for Paris in April. Freud's sister-in-law, Minna Bernays, left for London on 5 May, Martin Freud the following week and Freud's daughter Mathilde and her husband, Robert Hollitscher, on 24 May.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 157\u201359.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month, arrangements for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. Under regulations imposed on its Jewish population by the new Nazi regime, a [[Reichskommissar|Kommissar]] was appointed to manage Freud's assets and those of the IPA whose headquarters were nearby Freud's home. Freud was allocated to Dr. Anton Sauerwald, who had studied chemistry at [[Vienna University]] under Professor [[Josef Herzig]], an old friend of Freud's. Sauerwald read Freud's books to further learn about him and became sympathetic towards his situation. Though required to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to arrange the destruction of the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, Sauerwald did neither. Instead he removed evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranged the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until the end of the war.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 160.</ref>\n\nThough Sauerwald's intervention lessened the financial burden of the \"flight\" tax on Freud's declared assets, other substantial charges were levied in relation to the debts of the IPA and the valuable collection of antiquities Freud possessed. Unable to access his own accounts, Freud turned to [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], the most eminent and wealthy of his French followers, who had travelled to Vienna to offer her support and it was she who made the necessary funds available.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 166</ref> This allowed Sauerwald to sign the necessary exit visas for Freud, his wife Martha and daughter Anna. They left Vienna on the [[Orient Express]] on 4 June, accompanied by their housekeeper and a doctor, arriving in Paris the following day where they stayed as guests of Marie Bonaparte before travelling overnight to London arriving at [[London Victoria station]] on 6 June.\n\nAmong those soon to call on Freud to pay their respects were [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. Representatives of the [[Royal Society]] called with the Society's Charter for Freud, who had been elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1936|Foreign Member]] in 1936, to sign himself into membership. Marie Bonaparte arrived towards the end of June to discuss the fate of Freud's four elderly sisters left behind in Vienna. Her subsequent attempts to get them exit visas failed and they would all die in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 178, 205\u201307.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freud Museum London 2.jpg|thumb|right|Freud's last home, now dedicated to his life and work as the [[Freud Museum|Freud Museum, {{nowrap|20 Maresfield Gardens,}} Hampstead, London NW3, England]].]]\nIn early 1939 Sauerwald arrived in London in mysterious circumstances where he met Freud's brother Alexander.<ref>Schur, Max (1972) ''Freud: Living and Dying'', London: Hogarth Press, pp. 498\u201399.</ref> He was tried and imprisoned in 1945 by an Austrian court for his activities as a Nazi Party official. Responding to a plea from his wife, Anna Freud wrote to confirm that Sauerwald \"used his office as our appointed commissar in such a manner as to protect my father\".

The last book he read, [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'', prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty and a few days later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, [[Max Schur]], reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: \"Schur, you remember our 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense.\" When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, \"I thank you,\" and then \"Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it.\" Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3&nbsp;am on 23 September 1939.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 650\u201351</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=1i7bxu%2FFMHIpo2b6nEloZg&scan=1 |title=Index entry |accessdate=2 September 2016 |website=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref> However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account.

He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/62292238/History-of-Psychiatry |title=The History of Psychiatry |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2011 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the [[medulla oblongata]]. He intervened in the important debates about [[aphasia]] with his monograph of 1891, ''Zur Auffassung der Aphasien'', in which he coined the term [[agnosia]] and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary [[Eugen Bleuler]], he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.\n\nFreud was also an early researcher in the field of [[cerebral palsy]], which was then known as \"cerebral paralysis\". He published several medical papers on the topic, and showed that the disease existed long before other researchers of the period began to notice and study it. He also suggested that [[William John Little]], the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during birth being a cause. Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom.\n\nFreud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique. The goal of Freudian therapy, or psychoanalysis, was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into [[consciousness]] in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions.\n\nClassically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 59</ref> Another important element of psychoanalysis is [[transference]], the process by which patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come to see it as an essential part of the therapeutic process.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, pp. 185\u201386</ref>\n\nThe origin of Freud's early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to [[Josef Breuer]]. Freud credited Breuer with opening the way to the discovery of the psychoanalytical method by his treatment of the case of [[Anna O.]] In November 1880, Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman ([[Bertha Pappenheim]]) for a persistent cough that he diagnosed as hysterical. He found that while nursing her dying father, she had developed a number of transitory symptoms, including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs, which he also diagnosed as hysterical. Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent, and observed that she entered states of ''absence''. He found that when, with his encouragement, she told fantasy stories in her evening states of ''absence'' her condition improved, and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881. Following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again. Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously, and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom.<ref>Hirschmuller, Albrecht.

New York: New York University Press, 1989, pp. 101\u201316, 276\u2013307.</ref> In the years immediately following Breuer's treatment, Anna O. spent three short periods in sanatoria with the diagnosis \"hysteria\" with \"somatic symptoms\",<ref>Hirschmuller, Albrecht.

According to Freud's later accounts of this period, as a result of his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early [[childhood sexual abuse]]. He believed these stories, which he used as the basis for his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]], but then he came to believe that they were fantasies. He explained these at first as having the function of \"fending off\" memories of infantile masturbation, but in later years he wrote that they represented Oedipal fantasies, stemming from innate [[Drive theory|drives]] that are sexual and destructive in nature.<ref>Freud, ''Standard Edition'', vol. 7, 1906, p. 274; ''S.E. 14'', 1914, p. 18; '' S.E. 20'', 1925, p. 34; ''S.E. 22'', 1933, p. 120; Schimek, J.G.

He believed that cocaine was a cure for many mental and physical problems, and in his 1884 paper \"On Coca\" he extolled its virtues. Between 1883 and 1887 he wrote several articles recommending medical applications, including its use as an [[antidepressant]]. He narrowly missed out on obtaining [[scientific priority]] for discovering its [[anaesthesia|anesthetic]] properties of which he was aware but had mentioned only in passing.<ref>Jones, Ernest.

Fleischl-Marxow developed an acute case of [[Cocaine intoxication|\"cocaine psychosis\"]], and soon returned to using morphine, dying a few years later still suffering from intolerable pain.<ref>[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n08/borc01_.html Borch-Jacobsen (2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012005618/http://lrb.co.uk/v22/n08/borc01_.html |date=12 October 2007 }} Review of Isra\u00ebls, Han.

Freud believed that while poets and thinkers had long known of the existence of the unconscious, he had ensured that it received scientific recognition in the field of psychology.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\" />\n\nFreud states explicitly that his concept of the unconscious as he first formulated it was based on the theory of repression. He postulated a cycle in which ideas are repressed, but remain in the mind, removed from consciousness yet operative, then reappear in consciousness under certain circumstances. The postulate was based upon the investigation of cases of [[hysteria]], which revealed instances of behaviour in patients that could not be explained without reference to ideas or thoughts of which they had no awareness and which analysis revealed were linked to the (real or imagined) repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. In his later re-formulations of the concept of repression in his 1915 paper 'Repression' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV) Freud introduced the distinction in the unconscious between primary repression linked to the universal taboo on incest ('innately present originally') and repression ('after expulsion') that was a product of an individual's life history ('acquired in the course of the ego's development') in which something that was at one point conscious is rejected or eliminated from consciousness.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\">Wollheim, Richard (1971). ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157\u201376</ref>\n\nIn his account of the development and modification of his theory of unconscious mental processes he sets out in his 1915 paper 'The Unconscious' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV), Freud identifies the three perspectives he employs: the dynamic, the economic and the topographical.\n\nThe '''dynamic perspective''' concerns firstly the constitution of the unconscious by repression and secondly the process of \"censorship\" which maintains unwanted, anxiety inducing thoughts as such. Here Freud is drawing on observations from his earliest clinical work in the treatment of hysteria.\n\nIn the '''economic perspective''' the focus is upon the trajectories of the repressed contents \"the vicissitudes of sexual impulses\" as they undergo complex transformations in the process of both symptom formation and normal unconscious thought such as dreams and slips of the tongue. These were topics Freud explored in detail in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]].''\n\nWhereas both these former perspectives focus on the unconscious as it is about to enter consciousness, the '''topographical perspective''' represents a shift in which the systemic properties of the unconscious, its characteristic processes and modes of operation such as condensation and displacement, are placed in the foreground.\n\nThis \"first topography\" presents a model of psychic structure comprising three systems:\n\n*The System Ucs - the unconscious: \"primary process\" mentation governed by the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] characterised by \"exemption from mutual contradiction,{{nbsp}}... mobility of cathexes, timelessness and replacement of external by psychical reality.\" ('The Unconscious' (1915) [[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV).\n*The System Pcs - the preconscious in which the unconscious thing-presentations of the primary process are bound by the secondary processes of language (word presentations), a prerequisite for their becoming available to consciousness.\n*The System Cns - conscious thought governed by the reality principle.\n\nIn his later work, notably in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), a second topography is introduced comprising [[id, ego and super-ego]], which is superimposed on the first without replacing it.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 137-140.</ref> In this later formulation of the concept of the unconscious the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]]<ref name=\"id\">{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Id |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT363&dq=%22Id+%3D+D.\\+Es%22 |title=The Language of Psychoanalysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |year=2018 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-429-92124-7}}</ref> comprises a reservoir of instincts or [[Drive theory|drives]] a portion of them being hereditary or innate, a portion repressed or acquired.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 41.</ref>\n\nIn Freud's theory dreams are instigated by the daily occurrences and thoughts of everyday life. In what Freud called the \"dream-work\", these \"secondary process\" thoughts (\"word presentations\"), governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, become subject to the \"primary process\" of unconscious thought (\"thing presentations\") governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. Because of the disturbing nature of the latter and other repressed thoughts and desires which may have become linked to them, the dream-work operates a censorship function, disguising by distortion, displacement and condensation the repressed thoughts so as to preserve sleep.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 55-58.</ref>\n\nIn the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content, as recounted in the dream narrative, so as to facilitate interpretative work on its latent content \u2013 the repressed thoughts and fantasies \u2013 and also on the underlying mechanisms and structures operative in the dream-work. As Freud developed his theoretical work on dreams he went beyond his theory of dreams as wish-fulfillments to arrive at an emphasis on dreams as \"nothing other than a particular form of thinking.{{nbsp}}... It is the dream-work that creates that form, and it alone is the essence of dreaming\".<ref>Freud, Sigmund ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' (1976 [1900]) Harmondsworth: Pelican Books, p. 650.</ref>\n\n===Psychosexual development===\n{{Main|Psychosexual development}}\nFreud's theory of psychosexual development proposes that, following on from the initial [[polymorphous perversity]] of infantile sexuality, the sexual \"drives\" pass through the distinct developmental phases of the [[oral stage|oral]], the [[anal stage|anal]], and the [[phallic stage|phallic]]. Though these phases then give way to a [[latency stage]] of reduced sexual interest and activity (from the age of five to puberty, approximately), they leave, to a greater or lesser extent, a \"perverse\" and bisexual residue which persists during the formation of adult genital sexuality. Freud argued that [[neurosis]] or [[perversion]] could be explained in terms of fixation or regression to these phases whereas adult character and cultural creativity could achieve a [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] of their perverse residue.<ref>Mannoni 2015 [1971], pp. 93\u201397.</ref>\n\nAfter Freud's later development of the theory of the [[Oedipus complex]] this normative developmental trajectory becomes formulated in terms of the child's renunciation of incestuous desires under the fantasised threat of (or phantasised fact of, in the case of the girl) castration.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 515\u201318</ref> The \"dissolution\" of the Oedipus complex is then achieved when the child's rivalrous identification with the parental figure is transformed into the pacifying identifications of the [[Ego ideal]] which assume both similarity and difference and acknowledge the separateness and autonomy of the other.<ref>Cavell, Marcia ''The Psychoanalytic Mind'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press 1996, p. 225.</ref>\n\nFreud hoped to prove that his model was universally valid and turned to ancient mythology and contemporary ethnography for comparative material arguing that totemism reflected a ritualized enactment of a tribal Oedipal conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Robert A.|title=The Cambridge Companion to Freud|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-37779-9|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=J4UNrJlLGjoC&pg=PA274|editor=James Neu |page=274|chapter=Freud's anthropology}}</ref>\n\n===Id, ego, and super-ego===\n[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another]]\n{{Main|Id, ego and super-ego}}\nFreud proposed that the human psyche could be divided into three parts: Id, ego and super-ego. Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', and fully elaborated upon it in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), in which he developed it as an alternative to his previous topographic schema (i.e., conscious, unconscious and preconscious). The id is the completely unconscious, impulsive, childlike portion of the psyche that operates on the \"pleasure principle\" and is the source of basic impulses and drives; it seeks immediate pleasure and gratification.<ref name=\"Hothersall, D 2004. p. 290\">Hothersall, D. 2004. \"History of Psychology\", 4th ed., Mcgraw-Hill: NY p. 290</ref>\n\nFreud acknowledged that his use of the term ''Id'' (''das Es'', \"the It\") derives from the writings of [[Georg Groddeck]].<ref name=\"id\"/><ref>Freud, S.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 95.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920), Freud inferred the existence of a death drive. Its premise was a regulatory principle that has been described as \"the principle of psychic inertia\", \"the Nirvana principle\",<ref>Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (2018) [1973]. \"[https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT493&dq=%22Nirvana+Principle+%3D+D.:+Nirwanaprinzip%22+%22Term+proposed+by+Barbara+Low%22 Nirvana Principle\"].</ref> and \"the conservatism of instinct\". Its background was Freud's earlier ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'', where he had defined the principle governing the mental apparatus as its tendency to divest itself of quantity or to reduce tension to zero. Freud had been obliged to abandon that definition, since it proved adequate only to the most rudimentary kinds of mental functioning, and replaced the idea that the apparatus tends toward a level of zero tension with the idea that it tends toward a minimum level of tension.<ref name=\"Wollheim\">Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 184\u201386.</ref>\n\nFreud in effect readopted the original definition in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', this time applying it to a different principle. He asserted that on certain occasions the mind acts as though it could eliminate tension entirely, or in effect to reduce itself to a state of extinction; his key evidence for this was the existence of the [[repetition compulsion|compulsion to repeat]]. Examples of such repetition included the dream life of traumatic neurotics and children's play. In the phenomenon of repetition, Freud saw a psychic trend to work over earlier impressions, to master them and derive pleasure from them, a trend was prior to the pleasure principle but not opposed to it. In addition to that trend, there was also a principle at work that was opposed to, and thus \"beyond\" the pleasure principle. If repetition is a necessary element in the binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions. By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both historically primitive and marked by the total draining of energy: death.<ref name=\"Wollheim\" /> Such an explanation has been defined by some scholars as \"metaphysical biology\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Schuster |first=Aaron |title=The Trouble with Pleasure.

Freud claimed that, in normal mourning, the ego was responsible for narcissistically detaching the libido from the lost one as a means of self-preservation, but that in \"melancholia\", prior ambivalence towards the lost one prevents this from occurring. Suicide, Freud hypothesized, could result in extreme cases, when unconscious feelings of conflict became directed against the mourner's own ego.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perelberg|first1=Rosine Jozef|title=Freud: A Modern Reader|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-71373-0|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v7fxQifjxAC&pg=PA168|language=en|date=2008-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Howarth|first1=Glennys|last2=Leaman|first2=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-91378-5|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMi2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT304|language=en|date=2003-12-16}}</ref>\n\n===Femininity and female sexuality===\nInitiating what became the first debate within psychoanalysis on femininity, [[Karen Horney]] of the Berlin Institute set out to challenge Freud's account of the development of feminine sexuality. Rejecting Freud's theories of the feminine [[castration complex]] and [[penis envy]], Horney argued for a primary femininity and penis envy as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or \"injury\", of biological asymmetry as Freud held. Horney had the influential support of [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Ernest Jones]] who coined the term \"[[phallogocentrism|phallocentrism]]\" in his critique of Freud's position.<ref>Appignanesi, Lisa & Forrester, John. ''Freud's Women''. London: Penguin Books, 1992, pp. 433\u201337</ref>\n\nIn defending Freud against this critique, feminist scholar [[Jacqueline Rose]] has argued that it presupposes a more normative account of female sexual development than that given by Freud. She notes that Freud moved from a description of the little girl stuck with her 'inferiority' or 'injury' in the face of the anatomy of the little boy to an account in his later work which explicitly describes the process of becoming 'feminine' as an 'injury' or 'catastrophe' for the complexity of her earlier psychic and sexual life.<ref>Rose, J. ''Sexuality in the Field of Vision'', London: Verso 1986 pp. 91\u201393</ref>\n\nAccording to Freud, \"Elimination of clitoral sexuality is a necessary precondition for the development of femininity, since it is immature and masculine in its nature.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Julie M.L.C.L.

In 1905, he stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. This theory has been criticized on the grounds that Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, and because it made many women feel inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone.<ref name=\"Zastrow\">{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link=Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|page=228|accessdate = 15 March 2014| isbn = 978-0-495-09510-1 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=tco4YjyZab4C&pg=PT248&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Irvine\">{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =978-1-59213-151-8|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37\u201338|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&pg=PA37&dq=Kinsey+criticized+Freud#v=onepage&q=Kinsey%20criticized%20Freud&f=false|author=Janice M.

Freud argues the belief of a supernatural protector serves as a buffer from man's \"fear of nature\" just as the belief in an afterlife serves as a buffer from man's fear of death. The core idea of the work is that all of religious belief can be explained through its function to society, not for its relation to the truth. This is why, according to Freud, religious beliefs are \"illusions\".

Adler originated the approach, although his influence was indirect due to his inability to systematically formulate his ideas. Neo-Freudian analysis places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with the analyst and less on exploration of the unconscious.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Carl Jung]] believed that the [[collective unconscious]], which reflects the cosmic order and the history of the human species, is the most important part of the mind. It contains [[archetype]]s, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the [[anima and animus|anima]] (a man's suppressed female self), the [[anima and animus|animus]] (a woman's suppressed male self), or the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Jacques Lacan]] approached psychoanalysis through [[linguistics]] and literature. Lacan believed Freud's essential work had been done prior to 1905 and concerned the interpretation of dreams, neurotic symptoms, and slips, which had been based on a revolutionary way of understanding language and its relation to experience and subjectivity, and that [[ego psychology]] and [[object relations theory]] were based upon misreadings of Freud's work. For Lacan, the determinative dimension of human experience is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language. Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable.<ref>Mitchell, Stephen A. & Black, Margaret J. ''Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought''. New York: Basic Books, 1995, pp. 193\u2013203</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Reich]] developed ideas that Freud had developed at the beginning of his psychoanalytic investigation but then superseded but never finally discarded. These were the concept of the Actualneurosis and a theory of anxiety based upon the idea of dammed-up libido. In Freud's original view, what really happened to a person (the \"actual\") determined the resulting neurotic disposition. Freud applied that idea both to infants and to adults. In the former case, seductions were sought as the causes of later neuroses and in the latter incomplete sexual release. Unlike Freud, Reich retained the idea that actual experience, especially sexual experience, was of key significance. By the 1920s, Reich had \"taken Freud's original ideas about sexual release to the point of specifying the orgasm as the criteria of healthy function.\" Reich was also \"developing his ideas about character into a form that would later take shape, first as \"muscular armour\", and eventually as a transducer of universal biological energy, the \"orgone\".\"<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Fritz Perls]], who helped to develop [[Gestalt therapy]], was influenced by Reich, Jung and Freud. The key idea of gestalt therapy is that Freud overlooked the structure of awareness, \"an active process that moves toward the construction of organized meaningful wholes{{nbsp}}... between an organism and its environment.\" These wholes, called ''gestalts'', are \"patterns involving all the layers of organismic function \u2013 thought, feeling, and activity.\" Neurosis is seen as splitting in the formation of gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing \"the struggle towards its creative unification.\" Gestalt therapy attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with \"immediate organismic needs.\" Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in gestalt therapy serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge. Gestalt therapy usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated \"workshops\" rather than being spread out over a long period of time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Arthur Janov]]'s [[primal therapy]], which has been an influential post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, he does not have a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it.<ref name=\"Kovel\">{{cite book |author=Kovel, Joel |title=A Complete Guide to Therapy |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1991 |pages=96, 123\u201335, 165\u201398 |isbn=978-0-14-013631-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Janov writes in ''[[The Primal Scream]]'' (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.<ref>Janov, Arthur.

They also found limited and equivocal support for [[Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality|Freud's theories about the development of homosexuality]]. They found that several of Freud's other theories, including his portrayal of dreams as primarily containers of secret, unconscious wishes, as well as some of his views about the [[psychodynamics]] of women, were either not supported or contradicted by research.

By the 1940s, it had come to be seen as conservative by the European and American intellectual community. Critics outside the psychoanalytic movement, whether on the political left or right, saw Freud as a conservative. Fromm had argued that several aspects of psychoanalytic theory served the interests of political reaction in his ''[[The Fear of Freedom]]'' (1942), an assessment confirmed by sympathetic writers on the right. In ''[[Freud: The Mind of the Moralist]]'' (1959), [[Philip Rieff]] portrayed Freud as a man who urged men to make the best of an inevitably unhappy fate, and admirable for that reason. In the 1950s, [[Herbert Marcuse]] challenged the then prevailing interpretation of Freud as a conservative in ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955), as did [[Lionel Trilling]] in ''Freud and the Crisis of Our Culture'' and [[Norman O.

''The Daughter's Seduction: Feminism and Psychoanalysis''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1992</ref>\n\nSome French feminists, among them [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Luce Irigaray]], have been influenced by Freud as interpreted by Lacan.<ref>Gallop, Jane & Burke, Carolyn, in Eisenstein, Hester & Jardine, Alice (eds.). ''The Future of Difference''. New Brunswick and London: Rutgers University Press, 1987, pp. 106\u201308</ref> Irigaray has produced a theoretical challenge to Freud and Lacan, using their theories against them to put forward a \"psychoanalytic explanation for theoretical bias\". Irigaray, who claims that \"the cultural unconscious only recognizes the male sex\", describes how this affects \"accounts of the psychology of women\".<ref>Whitford, Margaret. ''Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine''. London and New York: Routledge, 1991, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nPsychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] writes that \"The penchant of developmental theorists to project a masculine image, and one that appears frightening to women, goes back at least to Freud.\" She sees Freud's criticism of women's sense of justice reappearing in the work of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]. Gilligan notes that [[Nancy Chodorow]], in contrast to Freud, attributes sexual difference not to anatomy but to the fact that male and female children have different early social environments. Chodorow, writing against the masculine bias of psychoanalysis, \"replaces Freud's negative and derivative description of female psychology with a positive and direct account of her own.\"<ref>Gilligan, Carol.

In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape the [[Nazi]]s. He died in exile in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1939.\n\nIn founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]] and discovered [[transference]], establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the [[Oedipus complex]] as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory.<ref>Jones, Ernest (1949) ''What is Psychoanalysis ?'' London: Allen & Unwin. p. 47.</ref> His analysis of [[dream]]s as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]].

It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the [[feminist]] cause.<ref>For its efficacy and the influence of psychoanalysis on psychiatry and psychotherapy, see ''The Challenge to Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy'', [http://americanmentalhealthfoundation.org/a.php?id=24 Chapter 9, Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry: A Changing Relationship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606094737/http://americanmentalhealthfoundation.org/a.php?id=24 |date=6 June 2009 }} by [[Robert Michels (physician)|Robert Michels]], 1999 and Tom Burns ''Our Necessary Shadow: The Nature and Meaning of Psychiatry'' London: Allen Lane 2013 pp. 96\u201397.\n* For the influence on psychology, see [http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-13/edition-12 ''The Psychologist'', December 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231004848/http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-13/edition-12 |date=31 December 2014 }}\n* For the influence of psychoanalysis in the humanities, see J.

His research work in cerebral anatomy led to the publication of an influential paper on the palliative effects of cocaine in 1884 and his work on [[aphasia]] would form the basis of his first book ''On the Aphasias: a Critical Study'', published in 1891. Over a three-year period, Freud worked in various departments of the hospital. His time spent in [[Theodor Meynert]]'s [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] clinic and as a [[locum]] in a local asylum led to an increased interest in clinical work. His substantial body of published research led to his appointment as a university lecturer or [[docent]] in [[neuropathology]] in 1885, a non-salaried post but one which entitled him to give lectures at the University of Vienna.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 42\u201347.</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Freud resigned his hospital post and entered private practice specializing in \"nervous disorders\". The same year he married [[Martha Bernays]], the granddaughter of [[Isaac Bernays]], a chief rabbi in Hamburg. They had six children: Mathilde (b. 1887), Jean-Martin (b. 1889), Oliver (b. 1891), [[Ernst L. Freud|Ernst]] (b. 1892), Sophie (b. 1893), and [[Anna Freud|Anna]] (b. 1895). From 1891 until they left Vienna in 1938, Freud and his family lived in an apartment at [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Berggasse 19]], near [[Innere Stadt]], a historical district of Vienna.\n\n[[File:Freud egykori lakhelye B\u00e9csben (Berggasse 19.).jpg|thumb|right|alt=photograph|Freud's home at [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Berggasse 19]], Vienna]]\nIn 1896, Minna Bernays, Martha Freud's sister, became a permanent member of the Freud household after the death of her fianc\u00e9.

He adopted the approach of his friend and collaborator, [[Josef Breuer]], in a type of hypnosis which was different from the French methods he had studied, in that it did not use suggestion. The treatment of one particular patient of Breuer's proved to be transformative for Freud's clinical practice. Described as [[Anna O.]], she was invited to talk about her symptoms while under hypnosis (she would coin the phrase \"[[talking cure]]\" for her treatment). In the course of talking in this way, her symptoms became reduced in severity as she retrieved memories of traumatic incidents associated with their onset.\n\nThe inconsistent results of Freud's early clinical work eventually led him to abandon hypnosis, having concluded that more consistent and effective symptom relief could be achieved by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition, about whatever ideas or memories occurred to them. In conjunction with this procedure, which he called \"[[free association (psychology)|free association]]\", Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] which, he had concluded, underlay symptom formation. By 1896 he was using the term \"[[psychoanalysis]]\" to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 64\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freudsdoor.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Ornate staircase, a landing with an interior door and window, staircase continuing up|Approach to Freud's consulting rooms at Berggasse 19]]\n\nFreud's development of these new theories took place during a period in which he experienced heart irregularities, disturbing dreams and periods of depression, a \"neurasthenia\" which he linked to the death of his father in 1896<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |title=jewishvirtuallibrary Sigmund Freud (1856\u20131939) |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=20 May 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509021811/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/freud.html |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and which prompted a \"self-analysis\" of his own dreams and memories of childhood. His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his mother's affections led him to fundamentally revise his theory of the origin of the neuroses.\n\nOn the basis of his early clinical work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as [[Freud's seduction theory]].<ref>Freud 1896c, pp. 203, 211, 219; Eissler 2005, p. 96.</ref> In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis can be traced back to the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.<ref>J. Forrester ''The Seductions of Psychoanalysis'' Cambridge University Press 1990, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThis transition from the theory of infantile sexual trauma as a general explanation of how all neuroses originate to one that presupposes an autonomous infantile sexuality provided the basis for Freud's subsequent formulation of the theory of the [[Oedipus complex]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 88\u201396.</ref>\n\nFreud described the evolution of his clinical method and set out his theory of the psychogenetic origins of hysteria, demonstrated in a number of case histories, in ''Studies on Hysteria'' published in 1895 (co-authored with [[Josef Breuer]]). In 1899 he published ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' in which, following a critical review of existing theory, Freud gives detailed interpretations of his own and his patients' dreams in terms of [[Wish fulfillment|wish-fulfillments]] made subject to the repression and censorship of the \"dream work\". He then sets out the theoretical model of mental structure (the unconscious, pre-conscious and conscious) on which this account is based. An abridged version, ''On Dreams'', was published in 1901. In works which would win him a more general readership, Freud applied his theories outside the clinical setting in ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'' (1901) and ''[[Humor in Freud|Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious]]'' (1905).<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, pp. 55\u201381.</ref> In ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', published in 1905, Freud elaborates his theory of infantile sexuality, describing its \"polymorphous perverse\" forms and the functioning of the \"drives\", to which it gives rise, in the formation of sexual identity.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015, p. 91.</ref> The same year he published ''[[Dora (case study)|Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria]]'', which became one of his more famous and controversial case studies.<ref>Charles Bernheimer and Claire Kahane (eds) ''In Dora's Case: Freud \u2013 Hysteria \u2013 Feminism'', London: Virago 1985.</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Fliess===\nDuring this formative period of his work, Freud valued and came to rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend [[Wilhelm Fliess]], a Berlin-based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human [[biorhythm]]s and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality \u2014 masturbation, [[coitus interruptus]], and the use of condoms \u2014 in the etiology of what were then called the \"actual neuroses,\" primarily [[neurasthenia]] and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms.<ref name=massonee>{{cite book |last=Masson |first=Jeffrey Moussaieff |authorlink=Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |title=The Assault on Truth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=5G0QAQAAIAAJ 1984] |publisher=Untreed Reads |isbn=978-1-61187-280-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=jDkkSLkjdJ8C&pg=PT18 18]}}</ref> They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas.

According to Freud, her history of symptoms included severe leg pains with consequent restricted mobility, as well as stomach and menstrual pains. These pains were, according to Fliess's theories, caused by habitual masturbation which, as the tissue of the nose and genitalia were linked, was curable by removal of part of the [[Middle nasal concha|middle turbinate]].<ref name=Masson>Masson, Jeffrey M.

At first, though aware of Fliess's culpability \u2013 Freud fled from the remedial surgery in horror \u2013 he could only bring himself to delicately intimate in his correspondence to Fliess the nature of his disastrous role and in subsequent letters maintained a tactful silence on the matter or else returned to the face-saving topic of Eckstein's hysteria. Freud ultimately, in light of Eckstein's history of adolescent self-cutting and irregular nasal (and menstrual) bleeding, concluded that Fliess was \"completely without blame\", as Eckstein's post-operative haemorrhages were hysterical \"wish-bleedings\" linked to \"an old wish to be loved in her illness\" and triggered as a means of \"rearousing [Freud's] affection\". Eckstein nonetheless continued her analysis with Freud. She was restored to full mobility and went on to practice psychoanalysis herself.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 84\u201387, 154\u201356.</ref><ref>Schur, Max. \"Some Additional 'Day Residues' of the Specimen Dream of Psychoanalysis.\" In ''Psychoananalysis, A General Psychology'', ed.

Their friendship came to an acrimonious end with Fliess angry at Freud's unwillingness to endorse his general theory of sexual periodicity and accusing him of collusion in the plagiarism of his work. After Fliess failed to respond to Freud's offer of collaboration over publication of his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' in 1906, their relationship came to an end.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 154\u201356.</ref>\n\n===Early followers===\n[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark.jpg|thumb|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]].

Prior to the completion of her studies, Spielrein had been a patient of Jung at the Burgh\u00f6lzli and the clinical and personal details of their relationship became the subject of an extensive correspondence between Freud and Jung. Both women would go on to make important contributions to the work of the Russian Psychoanalytic Society founded in 1910.<ref>Martin Miller(1998) ''Freud and the Bolsheviks'', Yale University Press, pp. 24, 45</ref>\n\nFreud's early followers met together formally for the first time at the Hotel Bristol, [[Salzburg]] on 27 April 1908. This meeting, which was retrospectively deemed to be the first International Psychoanalytic Congress,<ref>Jones, E. 1955, pp. 44\u201345</ref> was convened at the suggestion of [[Ernest Jones]], then a London-based neurologist who had discovered Freud's writings and begun applying psychoanalytic methods in his clinical work. Jones had met Jung at a conference the previous year and they met up again in Z\u00fcrich to organize the Congress. There were, as Jones records, \"forty-two present, half of whom were or became practicing analysts.\"<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) Sigmund Freud: Life and Work. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books p. 332</ref> In addition to Jones and the Viennese and Z\u00fcrich contingents accompanying Freud and Jung, also present and notable for their subsequent importance in the psychoanalytic movement were [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Max Eitingon]] from Berlin, [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]] from Budapest and the New York-based [[Abraham Brill]].\n\nImportant decisions were taken at the Congress with a view to advancing the impact of Freud's work. A journal, the ''Jahrbuch f\u00fcr psychoanalytische und psychopathologishe Forschungen'', was launched in 1909 under the editorship of Jung. This was followed in 1910 by the monthly ''[[Zentralblatt f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'' edited by Adler and Stekel, in 1911 by ''Imago'', a journal devoted to the application of psychoanalysis to the field of cultural and literary studies edited by Rank and in 1913 by the ''[[Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse]]'', also edited by Rank.<ref>Jones, Ernest (1964) ''Sigmund Freud: Life and Work''. Edited and abridged by Lionel Trilling and Stephen Marcus. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books pp. 334, 352, 361</ref> Plans for an [[International Psychoanalytical Association|international association of psychoanalysts]] were put in place and these were implemented at the Nuremberg Congress of 1910 where Jung was elected, with Freud's support, as its first president.\n\nFreud turned to Brill and Jones to further his ambition to spread the psychoanalytic cause in the English-speaking world. Both were invited to Vienna following the Salzburg Congress and a division of labour was agreed with Brill given the translation rights for Freud's works, and Jones, who was to take up a post at the [[University of Toronto]] later in the year, tasked with establishing a platform for Freudian ideas in North American academic and medical life.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 186</ref> Jones's advocacy prepared the way for Freud's visit to the United States, accompanied by Jung and Ferenczi, in September 1909 at the invitation of [[G. Stanley Hall|Stanley Hall]], president of [[Clark University]], Worcester, Massachusetts, where he gave five lectures on psychoanalysis.<ref name=\"Gaypage212\" />\n\nThe event, at which Freud was awarded an Honorary Doctorate, marked the first public recognition of Freud's work and attracted widespread media interest. Freud's audience included the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist [[James Jackson Putnam]], Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System at [[Harvard]], who invited Freud to his country retreat where they held extensive discussions over a period of four days. Putnam's subsequent public endorsement of Freud's work represented a significant breakthrough for the psychoanalytic cause in the United States.<ref name=\"Gaypage212\">Gay 2006, p. 212</ref> When Putnam and Jones organised the founding of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] in May 1911 they were elected president and secretary respectively. Brill founded the [[New York Psychoanalytic Society]] the same year. His English translations of Freud's work began to appear from 1909.\n\n====Resignations from the IPA====\nSome of Freud's followers subsequently withdrew from the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA) and founded their own schools.\n\nFrom 1909, Adler's views on topics such as neurosis began to differ markedly from those held by Freud. As Adler's position appeared increasingly incompatible with Freudianism, a series of confrontations between their respective viewpoints took place at the meetings of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society in January and February 1911. In February 1911, Adler, then the president of the society, resigned his position. At this time, Stekel also resigned his position as vice president of the society. Adler finally left the Freudian group altogether in June 1911 to found his own organization with nine other members who had also resigned from the group.<ref>Three members of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society resigned at the same time as Adler to establish the Society for Free Psychoanalysis. Six other members of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society who attempted to retain links to both the Adlerian and Freudian camps were forced out after Freud insisted that they must choose one side or another. {{cite book|last=Makari|first=George|title=Revolution in Mind: the Creation of Psychoanalysis|year=2008|publisher=Melbourne University Publishing|location=Carlton, Vic.|isbn=978-0-522-85480-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uPWBHwLjeXsC&pg=PA262|edition=Australian|page=262}}</ref> This new formation was initially called ''Society for Free Psychoanalysis'' but it was soon renamed the ''Society for Individual Psychology''.

Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and [[Hanns Sachs]]. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of [[psychoanalytic theory]] before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the ''Jarhbuch'' and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Z\u00fcrich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 229\u201330, 241</ref><!--This might have more meaning if we actually knew what the Z\u00fcrich Society was.-->\n\nLater the same year, Freud published a paper entitled \"[[s:The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement|The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement]]\", the German original being first published in the ''Jahrbuch'', giving his view on the birth and evolution of the psychoanalytic movement and the withdrawal of Adler and Jung from it.\n\nThe final defection from Freud's inner circle occurred following the publication in 1924 of Rank's ''[[The Trauma of Birth]]'' which other members of the committee read as, in effect, abandoning the Oedipus Complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytic theory. Abraham and Jones became increasingly forceful critics of Rank and though he and Freud were reluctant to end their close and long-standing relationship the break finally came in 1926 when Rank resigned from his official posts in the IPA and left Vienna for Paris. His place on the committee was taken by [[Anna Freud]].<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 474\u201381</ref> Rank eventually settled in the United States where his revisions of Freudian theory were to influence a new generation of therapists uncomfortable with the orthodoxies of the IPA.\n\n===Early psychoanalytic movement===\n{{psychoanalysis}}\nAfter the founding of the IPA in 1910, an international network of psychoanalytical societies, training institutes and clinics became well established and a regular schedule of biannual Congresses commenced after the end of [[World War I]] to coordinate their activities.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 460</ref>\n\nAbraham and Eitingon founded the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society in 1910 and then the [[Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute]] and the Poliklinik in 1920. The Poliklinik's innovations of free treatment, and child analysis and the Berlin Institute's standardisation of psychoanalytic training had a major influence on the wider psychoanalytic movement. In 1927 [[Ernst Simmel]] founded the [[Schloss Tegel]] Sanatorium on the outskirts of [[Berlin]], the first such establishment to provide psychoanalytic treatment in an institutional framework. Freud organised a fund to help finance its activities and his architect son, Ernst, was commissioned to refurbish the building. It was forced to close in 1931 for economic reasons.<ref>[[Elizabeth Danto|Danto, Elizabeth Ann]] (2005). ''Freud's Free Clinics: Psychoanalysis and Social Justice, 1918\u20131938''.

Freud's Russian followers were the first to benefit from translations of his work, the 1904 Russian translation of ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' appearing nine years before Brill's English edition. The Russian Institute was unique in receiving state support for its activities, including publication of translations of Freud's works.<ref>Miller, Martin (1998) ''Freud and the Bolsheviks'', Yale University Press pp. 24, 59</ref> Support was abruptly annulled in 1924, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, after which psychoanalysis was denounced on ideological grounds.<ref>Miller (1998), p. 94.</ref>\n\nAfter helping found the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] in 1911, Ernest Jones returned to Britain from Canada in 1913 and founded the London Psychoanalytic Society the same year. In 1919, he dissolved this organisation and, with its core membership purged of Jungian adherents, founded the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]], serving as its president until 1944. The Institute of Psychoanalysis was established 1924 and the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis established in 1926, both under Jones's directorship.<ref>Maddox, Brenda (2006).

He kept abreast of developments through a regular correspondence with his principal followers and via the circular letters and meetings of the secret Committee which he continued to attend.\n\nThe Committee continued to function until 1927 by which time institutional developments within the IPA, such as the establishment of the International Training Commission, had addressed concerns about the transmission of psychoanalytic theory and practice. There remained, however, significant differences over the issue of lay analysis \u2013 i.e. the acceptance of non-medically qualified candidates for psychoanalytic training. Freud set out his case in favour in 1926 in his ''[[The Question of Lay Analysis]]''. He was resolutely opposed by the American societies who expressed concerns over professional standards and the risk of litigation (though child analysts were made exempt). These concerns were also shared by some of his European colleagues. Eventually an agreement was reached allowing societies autonomy in setting criteria for candidature.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 490\u2013500</ref>\n\nIn 1930 Freud was awarded the [[Goethe Prize]] in recognition of his contributions to psychology and to German literary culture.<ref>Gay 2006, p. 571</ref>\n\n===Patients===\nFreud used pseudonyms in his case histories. Some patients known by pseudonyms were [[C\u00e4cilie M.]] (Anna von Lieben); [[Dora (case study)|Dora]] (Ida Bauer, 1882\u20131945); Frau Emmy von N. (Fanny Moser); Fr\u00e4ulein Elisabeth von R.

He initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, telling him that the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the [[dermatologist]] Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism \"a bad leukoplakia\" instead of the technical diagnosis [[epithelioma]]. Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a [[rhinologist]] whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled during and after the operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 419\u201320</ref>\n\n===Escape from Nazism===\nIn January 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] took control of Germany, and Freud's books were prominent among those they [[Nazi book burnings|burned and destroyed]]. Freud remarked to [[Ernest Jones]]: \"What progress we are making. In the [[Middle Ages]] they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning my books.\"<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 592\u201393.</ref> Freud continued to underestimate the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the [[Anschluss]] of 13 March 1938, in which [[Nazi Germany]] annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent [[antisemitism]] that ensued.<ref name=Gay618>Gay 2006, pp. 618\u201320, 624\u201325.</ref> Jones, the then president of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud to change his mind and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the arrest and interrogation of Anna Freud by the [[Gestapo]] finally convinced Freud it was time to leave Austria.<ref name=Gay618/> Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of \u00e9migr\u00e9s for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the [[Royal Society]], [[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Bragg]], to write to the Foreign Secretary [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his ex-patient and American ambassador to France, [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William Bullitt]]. Bullitt alerted U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] to the increased dangers facing the Freuds, resulting in the American consul-general in Vienna, [[John Cooper Wiley]], arranging regular monitoring of Berggasse 19. He also intervened by phone call during the Gestapo interrogation of Anna Freud.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 152\u201353.</ref>\n\nThe departure from Vienna began in stages throughout April and May 1938. Freud's grandson Ernst Halberstadt and Freud's son Martin's wife and children left for Paris in April. Freud's sister-in-law, Minna Bernays, left for London on 5 May, Martin Freud the following week and Freud's daughter Mathilde and her husband, Robert Hollitscher, on 24 May.<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 157\u201359.</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month, arrangements for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. Under regulations imposed on its Jewish population by the new Nazi regime, a [[Reichskommissar|Kommissar]] was appointed to manage Freud's assets and those of the IPA whose headquarters were nearby Freud's home. Freud was allocated to Dr. Anton Sauerwald, who had studied chemistry at [[Vienna University]] under Professor [[Josef Herzig]], an old friend of Freud's. Sauerwald read Freud's books to further learn about him and became sympathetic towards his situation. Though required to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to arrange the destruction of the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, Sauerwald did neither. Instead he removed evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranged the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until the end of the war.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 160.</ref>\n\nThough Sauerwald's intervention lessened the financial burden of the \"flight\" tax on Freud's declared assets, other substantial charges were levied in relation to the debts of the IPA and the valuable collection of antiquities Freud possessed. Unable to access his own accounts, Freud turned to [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], the most eminent and wealthy of his French followers, who had travelled to Vienna to offer her support and it was she who made the necessary funds available.<ref>Cohen 2009, p. 166</ref> This allowed Sauerwald to sign the necessary exit visas for Freud, his wife Martha and daughter Anna. They left Vienna on the [[Orient Express]] on 4 June, accompanied by their housekeeper and a doctor, arriving in Paris the following day where they stayed as guests of Marie Bonaparte before travelling overnight to London arriving at [[London Victoria station]] on 6 June.\n\nAmong those soon to call on Freud to pay their respects were [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[H. G. Wells]]. Representatives of the [[Royal Society]] called with the Society's Charter for Freud, who had been elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1936|Foreign Member]] in 1936, to sign himself into membership. Marie Bonaparte arrived towards the end of June to discuss the fate of Freud's four elderly sisters left behind in Vienna. Her subsequent attempts to get them exit visas failed and they would all die in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>Cohen 2009, pp. 178, 205\u201307.</ref>\n\n[[File:Freud Museum London 2.jpg|thumb|right|Freud's last home, now dedicated to his life and work as the [[Freud Museum|Freud Museum, {{nowrap|20 Maresfield Gardens,}} Hampstead, London NW3, England]].]]\nIn early 1939 Sauerwald arrived in London in mysterious circumstances where he met Freud's brother Alexander.<ref>Schur, Max (1972) ''Freud: Living and Dying'', London: Hogarth Press, pp. 498\u201399.</ref> He was tried and imprisoned in 1945 by an Austrian court for his activities as a Nazi Party official.

The last book he read, [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''[[La Peau de chagrin]]'', prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty and a few days later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, [[Max Schur]], reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: \"Schur, you remember our 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense.\" When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, \"I thank you,\" and then \"Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it.\" Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3&nbsp;am on 23 September 1939.<ref>Gay 2006, pp. 650\u201351</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=1i7bxu%2FFMHIpo2b6nEloZg&scan=1 |title=Index entry |accessdate=2 September 2016 |website=FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref> However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account.

He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/62292238/History-of-Psychiatry |title=The History of Psychiatry |format=PDF |accessdate=6 February 2011 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the [[medulla oblongata]]. He intervened in the important debates about [[aphasia]] with his monograph of 1891, ''Zur Auffassung der Aphasien'', in which he coined the term [[agnosia]] and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary [[Eugen Bleuler]], he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.\n\nFreud was also an early researcher in the field of [[cerebral palsy]], which was then known as \"cerebral paralysis\". He published several medical papers on the topic, and showed that the disease existed long before other researchers of the period began to notice and study it. He also suggested that [[William John Little]], the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during birth being a cause. Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom.\n\nFreud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique. The goal of Freudian therapy, or psychoanalysis, was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into [[consciousness]] in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions.\n\nClassically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 59</ref> Another important element of psychoanalysis is [[transference]], the process by which patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come to see it as an essential part of the therapeutic process.<ref>Rycroft, Charles. ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, pp. 185\u201386</ref>\n\nThe origin of Freud's early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to [[Josef Breuer]]. Freud credited Breuer with opening the way to the discovery of the psychoanalytical method by his treatment of the case of [[Anna O.]] In November 1880, Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman ([[Bertha Pappenheim]]) for a persistent cough that he diagnosed as hysterical. He found that while nursing her dying father, she had developed a number of transitory symptoms, including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs, which he also diagnosed as hysterical. Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent, and observed that she entered states of ''absence''. He found that when, with his encouragement, she told fantasy stories in her evening states of ''absence'' her condition improved, and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881. Following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again. Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously, and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom.<ref>Hirschmuller, Albrecht.

According to Freud's later accounts of this period, as a result of his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early [[childhood sexual abuse]]. He believed these stories, which he used as the basis for his [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]], but then he came to believe that they were fantasies. He explained these at first as having the function of \"fending off\" memories of infantile masturbation, but in later years he wrote that they represented Oedipal fantasies, stemming from innate [[Drive theory|drives]] that are sexual and destructive in nature.<ref>Freud, ''Standard Edition'', vol. 7, 1906, p. 274; ''S.E. 14'', 1914, p. 18; '' S.E. 20'', 1925, p. 34; ''S.E. 22'', 1933, p. 120; Schimek, J.G.

He believed that cocaine was a cure for many mental and physical problems, and in his 1884 paper \"On Coca\" he extolled its virtues. Between 1883 and 1887 he wrote several articles recommending medical applications, including its use as an [[antidepressant]].

Freud believed that while poets and thinkers had long known of the existence of the unconscious, he had ensured that it received scientific recognition in the field of psychology.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\" />\n\nFreud states explicitly that his concept of the unconscious as he first formulated it was based on the theory of repression. He postulated a cycle in which ideas are repressed, but remain in the mind, removed from consciousness yet operative, then reappear in consciousness under certain circumstances. The postulate was based upon the investigation of cases of [[hysteria]], which revealed instances of behaviour in patients that could not be explained without reference to ideas or thoughts of which they had no awareness and which analysis revealed were linked to the (real or imagined) repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. In his later re-formulations of the concept of repression in his 1915 paper 'Repression' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV) Freud introduced the distinction in the unconscious between primary repression linked to the universal taboo on incest ('innately present originally') and repression ('after expulsion') that was a product of an individual's life history ('acquired in the course of the ego's development') in which something that was at one point conscious is rejected or eliminated from consciousness.<ref name=\"WollheimChap6\">Wollheim, Richard (1971). ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157\u201376</ref>\n\nIn his account of the development and modification of his theory of unconscious mental processes he sets out in his 1915 paper 'The Unconscious' ([[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV), Freud identifies the three perspectives he employs: the dynamic, the economic and the topographical.\n\nThe '''dynamic perspective''' concerns firstly the constitution of the unconscious by repression and secondly the process of \"censorship\" which maintains unwanted, anxiety inducing thoughts as such. Here Freud is drawing on observations from his earliest clinical work in the treatment of hysteria.\n\nIn the '''economic perspective''' the focus is upon the trajectories of the repressed contents \"the vicissitudes of sexual impulses\" as they undergo complex transformations in the process of both symptom formation and normal unconscious thought such as dreams and slips of the tongue. These were topics Freud explored in detail in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' and ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]].''\n\nWhereas both these former perspectives focus on the unconscious as it is about to enter consciousness, the '''topographical perspective''' represents a shift in which the systemic properties of the unconscious, its characteristic processes and modes of operation such as condensation and displacement, are placed in the foreground.\n\nThis \"first topography\" presents a model of psychic structure comprising three systems:\n\n*The System Ucs - the unconscious: \"primary process\" mentation governed by the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] characterised by \"exemption from mutual contradiction,{{nbsp}}... mobility of cathexes, timelessness and replacement of external by psychical reality.\" ('The Unconscious' (1915) [[#The Standard Edition|''Standard Edition'']] XIV).\n*The System Pcs - the preconscious in which the unconscious thing-presentations of the primary process are bound by the secondary processes of language (word presentations), a prerequisite for their becoming available to consciousness.\n*The System Cns - conscious thought governed by the reality principle.\n\nIn his later work, notably in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), a second topography is introduced comprising [[id, ego and super-ego]], which is superimposed on the first without replacing it.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 137-140.</ref> In this later formulation of the concept of the unconscious the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]]<ref name=\"id\">{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Id |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT363&dq=%22Id+%3D+D.\\+Es%22 |title=The Language of Psychoanalysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |year=2018 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-429-92124-7}}</ref> comprises a reservoir of instincts or [[Drive theory|drives]] a portion of them being hereditary or innate, a portion repressed or acquired.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 41.</ref>\n\nIn Freud's theory dreams are instigated by the daily occurrences and thoughts of everyday life. In what Freud called the \"dream-work\", these \"secondary process\" thoughts (\"word presentations\"), governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, become subject to the \"primary process\" of unconscious thought (\"thing presentations\") governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. Because of the disturbing nature of the latter and other repressed thoughts and desires which may have become linked to them, the dream-work operates a censorship function, disguising by distortion, displacement and condensation the repressed thoughts so as to preserve sleep.<ref>Mannoni, Octave, ''Freud: The Theory of the Unconscious'', London: Verso 2015 [1971], pp. 55-58.</ref>\n\nIn the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content, as recounted in the dream narrative, so as to facilitate interpretative work on its latent content \u2013 the repressed thoughts and fantasies \u2013 and also on the underlying mechanisms and structures operative in the dream-work. As Freud developed his theoretical work on dreams he went beyond his theory of dreams as wish-fulfillments to arrive at an emphasis on dreams as \"nothing other than a particular form of thinking.{{nbsp}}... It is the dream-work that creates that form, and it alone is the essence of dreaming\".<ref>Freud, Sigmund ''The Interpretation of Dreams'' (1976 [1900]) Harmondsworth: Pelican Books, p. 650.</ref>\n\n===Psychosexual development===\n{{Main|Psychosexual development}}\nFreud's theory of psychosexual development proposes that, following on from the initial [[polymorphous perversity]] of infantile sexuality, the sexual \"drives\" pass through the distinct developmental phases of the [[oral stage|oral]], the [[anal stage|anal]], and the [[phallic stage|phallic]]. Though these phases then give way to a [[latency stage]] of reduced sexual interest and activity (from the age of five to puberty, approximately), they leave, to a greater or lesser extent, a \"perverse\" and bisexual residue which persists during the formation of adult genital sexuality.

Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', and fully elaborated upon it in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), in which he developed it as an alternative to his previous topographic schema (i.e., conscious, unconscious and preconscious). The id is the completely unconscious, impulsive, childlike portion of the psyche that operates on the \"pleasure principle\" and is the source of basic impulses and drives; it seeks immediate pleasure and gratification.<ref name=\"Hothersall, D 2004. p. 290\">Hothersall, D. 2004. \"History of Psychology\", 4th ed., Mcgraw-Hill: NY p. 290</ref>\n\nFreud acknowledged that his use of the term ''Id'' (''das Es'', \"the It\") derives from the writings of [[Georg Groddeck]].<ref name=\"id\"/><ref>Freud, S.

''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 1995, p. 95.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920), Freud inferred the existence of a death drive. Its premise was a regulatory principle that has been described as \"the principle of psychic inertia\", \"the Nirvana principle\",<ref>Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (2018) [1973]. \"[https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT493&dq=%22Nirvana+Principle+%3D+D.:+Nirwanaprinzip%22+%22Term+proposed+by+Barbara+Low%22 Nirvana Principle\"].</ref> and \"the conservatism of instinct\". Its background was Freud's earlier ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'', where he had defined the principle governing the mental apparatus as its tendency to divest itself of quantity or to reduce tension to zero. Freud had been obliged to abandon that definition, since it proved adequate only to the most rudimentary kinds of mental functioning, and replaced the idea that the apparatus tends toward a level of zero tension with the idea that it tends toward a minimum level of tension.<ref name=\"Wollheim\">Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 184\u201386.</ref>\n\nFreud in effect readopted the original definition in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'', this time applying it to a different principle. He asserted that on certain occasions the mind acts as though it could eliminate tension entirely, or in effect to reduce itself to a state of extinction; his key evidence for this was the existence of the [[repetition compulsion|compulsion to repeat]]. Examples of such repetition included the dream life of traumatic neurotics and children's play. In the phenomenon of repetition, Freud saw a psychic trend to work over earlier impressions, to master them and derive pleasure from them, a trend was prior to the pleasure principle but not opposed to it. In addition to that trend, there was also a principle at work that was opposed to, and thus \"beyond\" the pleasure principle. If repetition is a necessary element in the binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions. By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both historically primitive and marked by the total draining of energy: death.<ref name=\"Wollheim\" /> Such an explanation has been defined by some scholars as \"metaphysical biology\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Schuster |first=Aaron |title=The Trouble with Pleasure.

Freud claimed that, in normal mourning, the ego was responsible for narcissistically detaching the libido from the lost one as a means of self-preservation, but that in \"melancholia\", prior ambivalence towards the lost one prevents this from occurring. Suicide, Freud hypothesized, could result in extreme cases, when unconscious feelings of conflict became directed against the mourner's own ego.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perelberg|first1=Rosine Jozef|title=Freud: A Modern Reader|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-71373-0|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v7fxQifjxAC&pg=PA168|language=en|date=2008-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Howarth|first1=Glennys|last2=Leaman|first2=Oliver|title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-91378-5|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMi2AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT304|language=en|date=2003-12-16}}</ref>\n\n===Femininity and female sexuality===\nInitiating what became the first debate within psychoanalysis on femininity, [[Karen Horney]] of the Berlin Institute set out to challenge Freud's account of the development of feminine sexuality. Rejecting Freud's theories of the feminine [[castration complex]] and [[penis envy]], Horney argued for a primary femininity and penis envy as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or \"injury\", of biological asymmetry as Freud held. Horney had the influential support of [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Ernest Jones]] who coined the term \"[[phallogocentrism|phallocentrism]]\" in his critique of Freud's position.<ref>Appignanesi, Lisa & Forrester, John. ''Freud's Women''. London: Penguin Books, 1992, pp. 433\u201337</ref>\n\nIn defending Freud against this critique, feminist scholar [[Jacqueline Rose]] has argued that it presupposes a more normative account of female sexual development than that given by Freud. She notes that Freud moved from a description of the little girl stuck with her 'inferiority' or 'injury' in the face of the anatomy of the little boy to an account in his later work which explicitly describes the process of becoming 'feminine' as an 'injury' or 'catastrophe' for the complexity of her earlier psychic and sexual life.<ref>Rose, J. ''Sexuality in the Field of Vision'', London: Verso 1986 pp. 91\u201393</ref>\n\nAccording to Freud, \"Elimination of clitoral sexuality is a necessary precondition for the development of femininity, since it is immature and masculine in its nature.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Julie M.L.C.L.

In 1905, he stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. This theory has been criticized on the grounds that Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, and because it made many women feel inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone.<ref name=\"Zastrow\">{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link=Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|page=228|accessdate = 15 March 2014| isbn = 978-0-495-09510-1 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=tco4YjyZab4C&pg=PT248&dq=#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"Irvine\">{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =978-1-59213-151-8|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37\u201338|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&pg=PA37&dq=Kinsey+criticized+Freud#v=onepage&q=Kinsey%20criticized%20Freud&f=false|author=Janice M.

Freud argues the belief of a supernatural protector serves as a buffer from man's \"fear of nature\" just as the belief in an afterlife serves as a buffer from man's fear of death. The core idea of the work is that all of religious belief can be explained through its function to society, not for its relation to the truth. This is why, according to Freud, religious beliefs are \"illusions\". In ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), he quotes his friend [[Romain Rolland]], who described religion as an \"oceanic sensation\", but says he never experienced this feeling.<ref>Rubin, Jeffrey B., [https://books.google.com/?id=c0CBs5KeujoC&pg=PA79 'Psychoanalysis is self-centred'] in Charles Spezzano and Gerald J.

Neo-Freudian analysis places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with the analyst and less on exploration of the unconscious.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Carl Jung]] believed that the [[collective unconscious]], which reflects the cosmic order and the history of the human species, is the most important part of the mind. It contains [[archetype]]s, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the [[anima and animus|anima]] (a man's suppressed female self), the [[anima and animus|animus]] (a woman's suppressed male self), or the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Jacques Lacan]] approached psychoanalysis through [[linguistics]] and literature. Lacan believed Freud's essential work had been done prior to 1905 and concerned the interpretation of dreams, neurotic symptoms, and slips, which had been based on a revolutionary way of understanding language and its relation to experience and subjectivity, and that [[ego psychology]] and [[object relations theory]] were based upon misreadings of Freud's work. For Lacan, the determinative dimension of human experience is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language. Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable.<ref>Mitchell, Stephen A. & Black, Margaret J. ''Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought''. New York: Basic Books, 1995, pp. 193\u2013203</ref>\n\n[[Wilhelm Reich]] developed ideas that Freud had developed at the beginning of his psychoanalytic investigation but then superseded but never finally discarded. These were the concept of the Actualneurosis and a theory of anxiety based upon the idea of dammed-up libido. In Freud's original view, what really happened to a person (the \"actual\") determined the resulting neurotic disposition. Freud applied that idea both to infants and to adults. In the former case, seductions were sought as the causes of later neuroses and in the latter incomplete sexual release. Unlike Freud, Reich retained the idea that actual experience, especially sexual experience, was of key significance. By the 1920s, Reich had \"taken Freud's original ideas about sexual release to the point of specifying the orgasm as the criteria of healthy function.\" Reich was also \"developing his ideas about character into a form that would later take shape, first as \"muscular armour\", and eventually as a transducer of universal biological energy, the \"orgone\".\"<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Fritz Perls]], who helped to develop [[Gestalt therapy]], was influenced by Reich, Jung and Freud. The key idea of gestalt therapy is that Freud overlooked the structure of awareness, \"an active process that moves toward the construction of organized meaningful wholes{{nbsp}}... between an organism and its environment.\" These wholes, called ''gestalts'', are \"patterns involving all the layers of organismic function \u2013 thought, feeling, and activity.\" Neurosis is seen as splitting in the formation of gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing \"the struggle towards its creative unification.\" Gestalt therapy attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with \"immediate organismic needs.\" Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in gestalt therapy serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge. Gestalt therapy usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated \"workshops\" rather than being spread out over a long period of time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living.<ref name=\"Kovel\" />\n\n[[Arthur Janov]]'s [[primal therapy]], which has been an influential post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, he does not have a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it.<ref name=\"Kovel\">{{cite book |author=Kovel, Joel |title=A Complete Guide to Therapy |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1991 |pages=96, 123\u201335, 165\u201398 |isbn=978-0-14-013631-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Janov writes in ''[[The Primal Scream]]'' (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.<ref>Janov, Arthur.

Their analysis of research literature supported Freud's concepts of oral and anal personality constellations, his account of the role of Oedipal factors in certain aspects of male personality functioning, his formulations about the relatively greater concern about loss of love in women's as compared to men's personality economy, and his views about the instigating effects of homosexual anxieties on the formation of paranoid delusions. They also found limited and equivocal support for [[Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality|Freud's theories about the development of homosexuality]]. They found that several of Freud's other theories, including his portrayal of dreams as primarily containers of secret, unconscious wishes, as well as some of his views about the [[psychodynamics]] of women, were either not supported or contradicted by research. Reviewing the issues again in 1996, they concluded that much experimental data relevant to Freud's work exists, and supports some of his major ideas and theories.<ref name=\"FisherandGreenberg\">Fisher, Seymour & Greenberg, Roger P.

Whereas Plato saw a hierarchy inherent in the nature of reality, and relied upon it to validate norms, Freud was a naturalist who could not follow such an approach. Both men's theories drew a parallel between the structure of the human mind and that of society, but while Plato wanted to strengthen the super-ego, which corresponded to the aristocracy, Freud wanted to strengthen the ego, which corresponded to the middle class.<ref name=\"Gellnerpp140-143\">Gellner, Ernest.

In ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'' (1970), Firestone argues that Freud was a \"poet\" who produced metaphors rather than literal truths; in her view, Freud, like feminists, recognized that sexuality was the crucial problem of modern life, but ignored the social context and failed to question society itself. Firestone interprets Freud's \"metaphors\" in terms of the facts of power within the family. Figes tries in ''Patriarchal Attitudes'' (1970) to place Freud within a \"[[history of ideas]]\". [[Juliet Mitchell]] defends Freud against his feminist critics in ''Psychoanalysis and Feminism'' (1974), accusing them of misreading him and misunderstanding the implications of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. Mitchell helped introduce English-speaking feminists to Lacan.<ref name=\"Mitchell\">Mitchell, Juliet. ''Psychoanalysis and Feminism: A Radical Reassessment of Freudian Psychoanalysis''. London: Penguin Books, 2000, pp. xxix, 303\u201356</ref> Mitchell is criticized by [[Jane Gallop]] in ''The Daughter's Seduction'' (1982). Gallop compliments Mitchell for her criticism of feminist discussions of Freud, but finds her treatment of Lacanian theory lacking.<ref>Gallop, Jane. ''The Daughter's Seduction: Feminism and Psychoanalysis''. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1992</ref>\n\nSome French feminists, among them [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Luce Irigaray]], have been influenced by Freud as interpreted by Lacan.<ref>Gallop, Jane & Burke, Carolyn, in Eisenstein, Hester & Jardine, Alice (eds.). ''The Future of Difference''. New Brunswick and London: Rutgers University Press, 1987, pp. 106\u201308</ref> Irigaray has produced a theoretical challenge to Freud and Lacan, using their theories against them to put forward a \"psychoanalytic explanation for theoretical bias\". Irigaray, who claims that \"the cultural unconscious only recognizes the male sex\", describes how this affects \"accounts of the psychology of women\".<ref>Whitford, Margaret. ''Luce Irigaray: Philosophy in the Feminine''. London and New York: Routledge, 1991, pp. 31\u201332</ref>\n\nPsychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] writes that \"The penchant of developmental theorists to project a masculine image, and one that appears frightening to women, goes back at least to Freud.\" She sees Freud's criticism of women's sense of justice reappearing in the work of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]. Gilligan notes that [[Nancy Chodorow]], in contrast to Freud, attributes sexual difference not to anatomy but to the fact that male and female children have different early social environments. Chodorow, writing against the masculine bias of psychoanalysis, \"replaces Freud's negative and derivative description of female psychology with a positive and direct account of her own.\"<ref>Gilligan, Carol.

After studying at the [[Amherst College#Amherst Academy|Amherst Academy]] for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] before returning to her family's house in Amherst.\n\nEvidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/emily-dickinson-9274190|title=Emily Dickinson biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography.com |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile Dickinson was a prolific poet, only 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emily Dickinson Museum indicates only one letter and ten poems were published before her death|url=https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|website=Emilydickinson,useum.org|accessdate=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807012709/http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|archive-date=August 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique to her era. They contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use [[Half rhyme|slant rhyme]] as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.<ref name=\"Mc2\">McNeil (1986), 2.</ref> Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\n\nAlthough Dickinson's acquaintances were likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\u2014that the breadth of her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] and [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], though both heavily edited the content. A 1998 ''[[New York Times]]'' article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name \"Susan\" was often deliberately removed. At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to sister-in-law [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson]], though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/magazine/beethoven-s-hair-tells-all.html|title=Beethoven's Hair Tells All!|website=The New York Times|date=November 29, 1998}}</ref> A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H.

After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending [[Mary Lyon]]'s [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] (which later became [[Mount Holyoke College]]) in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) from Amherst.<ref>Ford (1966), 46.</ref> She stayed at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there.<ref>Sewall (1974), 368.</ref> The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick.<ref>Sewall (1974), 358.</ref> Whatever the reasons for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to \"bring [her] home at all events\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 211.</ref> Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities.<ref name=\"Pic19\">Pickard (1967), 19.</ref> She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.<ref>Habegger (2001), 213.</ref>\n\n=== Early influences and writing ===\nWhen she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester&nbsp;\u2013 in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 216.</ref> Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.<ref>Sewall (1974), 401.</ref>\n\nNewton likely introduced her to the writings of [[William Wordsworth]], and his gift to her of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\".<ref name=\"Hab221\">Habegger (2001), 221.</ref> Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of [[tuberculosis]], he wrote to her, saying he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.<ref name=\"Hab221\" /> Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862\u2014\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality&nbsp;\u2013 but venturing too near, himself&nbsp;\u2013 he never returned\"\u2014refers to Newton.<ref>Habegger (2001), 218.</ref>\n\nDickinson was familiar not only with the [[Bible]] but also with contemporary popular literature.<ref>Knapp (1989), 59.</ref> She was probably influenced by [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s ''Letters from New York'', another gift from Newton<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> (after reading it, she gushed \"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\"<ref name=\"Ford18\">Ford (1966), 18.</ref>). Her brother smuggled a copy of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[Kavanagh (novel)|Kavanagh]]'' into the house for her (because her father might disapprove)<ref>Sewall (1974), 683.</ref> and a friend lent her [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in late 1849.<ref name=\"Hab226\">Habegger (2001), 226.</ref> ''Jane Eyre''{{'}}s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], she named him \"Carlo\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog.<ref name=\"Hab226\" /> [[William Shakespeare]] was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \"Why clasp any hand but this?\" and to another, \"Why is any other book needed?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 700\u2013701.</ref>\n\n=== Adulthood and seclusion ===\nIn early 1850, Dickinson wrote that \"Amherst is alive with fun this winter&nbsp;... Oh, a very great town this is!\"<ref name=\"Pic19\" /> Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of \"brain congestion\" at age 25.<ref>Sewall (1974), 340.</ref> Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:<blockquote>some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping&nbsp;\u2013 sleeping the churchyard sleep&nbsp;\u2013 the hour of evening is sad&nbsp;\u2013 it was once my study hour&nbsp;\u2013 my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school ''alone'', make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.<ref>Sewall (1974), 341.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Homestead, Amherst, Massachusetts (from left).JPG|thumb|left|The Evergreens, built by Edward Dickinson, was the home of Austin and Susan's family.]]\nDuring the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Gilbert]]. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of \"most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser\" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed.<ref>Martin (2002), 53.</ref> In an 1882 letter to Susan, Emily said, \"With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living.\"\n\nThe importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife.<ref>Pickard (1967), 21.</ref> However, the notion of a \"cruel\" Susan\u2014as promoted by her romantic rival\u2014has been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close.<ref>Longenbach, James.

In ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'' Lena Koski wrote, \"Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings.\"<ref>Koski (1996), 26-31.</ref> She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, \"Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me&nbsp;... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you\u2014that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast&nbsp;... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language.\" The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film ''[[Wild Nights with Emily]]'' and explored in the TV series ''[[Dickinson (TV series)|Dickinson]]''.\n\nSue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it [[Emily Dickinson Museum#The Evergreens|the Evergreens]], a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead.<ref>Habegger (2001), 338.</ref>\n\nUntil 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst.

When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28.<ref>Habegger (2001), 562.</ref> She wrote to Higginson that her father's \"Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 566.</ref> A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral [[paralysis]] and impaired memory.

In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's ''Complete Concordance to Shakespeare'' (1877).<ref>Sewall (1974), 651.</ref> Dickinson wrote that \"While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 652.</ref> She referred to him as \"My lovely Salem\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 592; Sewall (1974), 653.</ref> and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday.

Dickinson referred to him as \"our latest Lost\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 597.</ref> Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson's \"Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\", Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.\n\n=== Decline and death ===\nAlthough she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 604.</ref> Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.\n\n[[File:EmilyDickinsonGrave-color.jpg|thumb|left|Emily Dickinson's tombstone in the family plot]]\nThe 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as \"a lady whom the people call the ''Myth''\".<ref>Walsh (1971), 26.</ref> Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief.<ref>Habegger (2001), 612.</ref> Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote \"We were never intimate&nbsp;... while she was our Mother&nbsp;\u2013 but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 607.</ref> The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert\u2014Emily's favorite\u2014died of [[typhoid fever]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 615.</ref>\n\nAs death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote,  \"The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 623.</ref> That summer she had seen \"a great darkness coming\" and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston.<ref>Habegger (2001), 625.</ref> She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: \"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily\".<ref>Wolff (1986), 534.</ref> On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that \"the day was awful&nbsp;... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six.\"<ref name=\"Hab627\">Habegger (2001), 627.</ref> Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as [[Bright's disease]] and its duration as two and a half years.<ref>Habegger (2001), 622.</ref>\n\nLavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Emily's body upon her death. Susan also wrote Emily's obituary for the ''Springfield Republican'', ending it with four lines from one of Emily's poems: \"Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose.\" Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Sue should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly.<ref>Nell Smith (1998), 265.</ref> Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with [[Heliotropium arborescens|vanilla-scented heliotrope]], a [[lady's slipper]] [[Orchidaceae|orchid]], and a \"knot of blue field [[Viola (plant)|violets]]\" placed about it.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\">Wolff (1986), 535.</ref> The funeral service, held in the Homestead's library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", a poem by [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] that had been a favorite of Dickinson's.<ref name=\"Hab627\" /> At Dickinson's request, her \"coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups\" for burial in the family plot at [[Amherst West Cemetery|West Cemetery]] on Triangle Street.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\">Farr (2005), 3\u20136.</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\nDespite Dickinson's prolific writing, fewer than a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's ''Complete Poems'' in 1955,<ref>Ford (1966), 122</ref> Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n[[File:Emilyrepublican.jpg|thumb|right|\"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013,\" titled \"The Sleeping,\" as it was published in the ''Springfield Republican'' in 1862.]]\nA few of Dickinson's poems appeared in [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles']] ''Springfield Republican'' between 1858 and 1868. They were published anonymously and heavily edited, with conventionalized punctuation and formal titles.<ref>McNeil (1986), 33.</ref> The first poem, \"Nobody knows this little rose\", may have been published without Dickinson's permission.<ref>Habegger (2001), 389.</ref> The ''Republican'' also published \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\" as \"The Snake\", \"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013\" as \"The Sleeping\", and \"Blazing in the Gold and quenching in Purple\" as \"Sunset\".<ref name=\"For32\" /><ref name=\"Wolff245\">Wolff (1986), 245.</ref> The poem \"[[I taste a liquor never brewed]]&nbsp;\u2013\" is an example of the edited versions; the last two lines in the first stanza were completely rewritten.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:18em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nI taste a liquor never brewed&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nFrom Tankards scooped in Pearl&nbsp;\u2013<br />\n''Not all the Frankfort Berries''<br />\n''Yield such an Alcohol!''\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<br />\nI taste a liquor never brewed&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nFrom Tankards scooped in Pearl&nbsp;\u2013<br />\n''Not Frankfort Berries yield the sense''<br />\n''Such a delirious whirl!''\n|\n|}\n\nIn 1864, several poems were altered and published in ''Drum Beat'', to raise funds for medical care for Union soldiers in the [[American Civil War|war]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 402\u2013403.</ref> Another appeared in April 1864 in the ''Brooklyn Daily Union''.<ref>Habegger (2001), 403.</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s, [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson|Higginson]] showed Dickinson's poems to [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], who had coincidentally been at the Academy with Dickinson when they were girls.<ref name=\"Sewall581\">Sewall (1974), 580\u2013583.</ref> Jackson was deeply involved in the publishing world, and managed to convince Dickinson to publish her poem \"[[Success is Counted Sweetest|Success is counted sweetest]]\" anonymously in a volume called ''[[A Masque of Poets]]''.<ref name=\"Sewall581\" /> The poem, however, was altered to agree with contemporary taste. It was the last poem published during Dickinson's lifetime.\n\n=== Posthumous ===\nAfter Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest.<ref name=\"Farr3\">Farr (1996), 3.</ref> Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published.<ref>Pickard (1967), xv.</ref> She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.<ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\" /> A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.<ref>Wolff (1986), 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Poems.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Poems'', published in 1890]]\nThe first volume of Dickinson's ''Poems,'' edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890.<ref name=\"Wol537\">Wolff (1986), 537.</ref> Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity.<ref>McNeil (1986), 34; Blake (1964), 42.</ref> The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years.<ref name=\"Wol537\" /> ''Poems: Second Series'' followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: \"The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published\".<ref>Buckingham (1989), 194.</ref>\n\nNearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson's poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;243</ref> Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.<ref>Mitchell (2009), p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n\nThe first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a complete new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson's [[variorum]] brought all of Dickinson's known poems together for the first time.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;122</ref> Johnson's goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts.<ref name=\"Martin\">Martin (2002), 17.</ref> They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely [[wikt:elliptical|elliptical]] in their language.<ref>McNeil (1986), 35.</ref> Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson's letters, also presented in three volumes.\n\nIn 1981, ''The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson'' was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.\n\nDickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in ''My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson'' (2001) that \"The consequences of the poet's failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 628.</ref>\n\n== Poetry ==\n{{Main|List of Emily Dickinson poems}}\n\nDickinson's poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.\n* '''Pre-1861'''. These are often conventional and [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimental]] in nature.<ref>Ford (1966), 68.</ref> Thomas H. Johnson, who later published ''The Poems of Emily Dickinson'', was able to date only five of Dickinson's poems before 1858.<ref name=\"Pic20\">Pickard (1967), 20.</ref> Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, one of which is about missing her brother Austin. The fifth poem, which begins \"I have a Bird in spring\", conveys her grief over the feared loss of friendship and was sent to her friend Sue Gilbert.<ref name=\"Pic20\" />\n* '''1861\u20131865'''. This was her most creative period\u2014these poems represent her most vigorous and creative work. Johnson estimated that she composed 86 poems in 1861, 366 in 1862, 141 in 1863, and 174 in 1864. He also believed that during this period, she fully developed her themes of life and mortality.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\">Johnson (1960), viii.</ref>\n* '''Post-1866'''. It is estimated that two-thirds of the entire body of her poetry was written before this year.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\" />\n\n=== Structure and syntax ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson \"Wild nights\" manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|Dickinson's handwritten manuscript of her poem \"Wild Nights&nbsp;\u2013 Wild Nights!\"]]\nThe extensive use of [[dash]]es and unconventional [[capitalization]] in Dickinson's manuscripts, and the [[idiosyncratic]] vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is \"far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed\".<ref name=\"Mc2\" /><ref name=\"Hecht153\">Hecht (1996), 153\u2013155.</ref> Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the [[ballad stanza]], a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of [[half rhyme|slant rhyme]].<ref name=\"For63\">Ford (1966), 63.</ref> In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four, while only using tetrameter for line three.\n\nSince many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the [[common meter]], employing alternating lines of [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 186.</ref> Familiar examples of such songs are \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" and \"[[Amazing Grace]]'\".\n\nDickinson scholar and poet [[Anthony Hecht]] finds resonances in Dickinson's poetry not only with hymns and song-forms but also with [[psalms]] and [[riddle]]s, citing the following example: \"Who is the East?&nbsp;/ The Yellow Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Purple if he can&nbsp;/ That carries in the Sun.&nbsp;/ Who is the West?&nbsp;/ The Purple Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Yellow if He can&nbsp;/ That lets Him out again.\"<ref name=\"Hecht153\" />\n\nLate 20th-century scholars are \"deeply interested\" by Dickinson's highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks).<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime&nbsp;\u2013 \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\", published as \"The Snake\" in the ''Republican''&nbsp;\u2013 Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:20em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not<br />\nHis notice sudden is&nbsp;\u2013\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<ref name=\"For32\">Ford (1966), 32.</ref><br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not,<br />\nHis notice sudden is.\n|\n|}\n\nAs Farr points out, \"snakes instantly notice you\"; Dickinson's version captures the \"breathless immediacy\" of the encounter; and ''The Republican''{{'}}s punctuation renders \"her lines more commonplace\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson's structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are \"aesthetically based\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page.<ref>Crumbley (1997), 14.</ref> Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n=== Major themes ===\nDickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]].<ref>Bloom (1998), 18.</ref> However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's \"relentlessly measuring mind&nbsp;... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental\".<ref>Farr (1996), 13.</ref> Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, [[irony]] and [[satire]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 171.</ref>\n\n'''Flowers and gardens''': Farr notes that Dickinson's \"poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers\" and that allusions to gardens often refer to an \"imaginative realm&nbsp;... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\">Farr (2005), 1\u20137.</ref> She associates some flowers, like [[gentian]]s and [[anemone]]s, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and [[nosegay]]s.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Farr notes that one of Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to \"conflate her poetry itself with the posies\": \"My nosegays are for Captives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Dim&nbsp;\u2013 long expectant eyes&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Fingers denied the plucking,&nbsp;/ Patient till Paradise&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To such, if they sh'd whisper&nbsp;/ Of morning and the moor&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ They bear no other errand,&nbsp;/ And I, no other prayer\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" />\n\n'''The Master poems''': Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to \"Signor\", \"Sir\" and \"Master\", who is characterized as Dickinson's \"lover for all eternity\".<ref name=\"Farr7\">Farr (1996), 7\u20138.</ref> These confessional poems are often \"searing in their self-inquiry\" and \"harrowing to the reader\" and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson's day.<ref name=\"Farr7\" /> The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals but this view is frequently rejected by scholars. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, \"human, with specific characteristics, but godlike\" and speculates that Master may be a \"kind of Christian muse\".<ref name=\"Farr7\" />\n\n'''Morbidity''': Dickinson's poems reflect her \"early and lifelong fascination\" with illness, dying and death.<ref name=\"Pollak62\">Pollak (1996), 62\u201365.</ref> Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: \"crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> She reserved her sharpest insights into the \"death blow aimed by God\" and the \"funeral in the brain\", often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar Vivian Pollak considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson's \"thirsting-starving persona\", an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail.<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> Dickinson's most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at \"the interface of murder and suicide\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" />\n\n'''Gospel poems''': Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him.<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\">Oberhaus (1996), 105\u2013119</ref> She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with \"wit and American colloquial language\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the \"salient feature uniting Christian poets&nbsp;... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ\" and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the \"poetic tradition of Christian devotion\" alongside [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]].<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: \"The Savior must have been&nbsp;/ A docile Gentleman&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To come so far so cold a Day&nbsp;/ For little Fellowmen&nbsp;/ The Road to Bethlehem&nbsp;/ Since He and I were Boys&nbsp;/ Was leveled, but for that twould be&nbsp;/ A rugged billion Miles&nbsp;\u2013\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" />\n\n'''The Undiscovered Continent''': Academic Suzanne Juhasz considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\">Juhasz (1996), 130\u2013140.</ref> Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the \"undiscovered continent\" and the \"landscape of the spirit\" and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding\u2014castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms\u2014to create a dwelling place of \"oneself\" where one resides with one's other selves.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" /> An example that brings together many of these ideas is: \"Me from Myself&nbsp;\u2013 to banish&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Had I Art&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Impregnable my Fortress&nbsp;/ Unto All Heart&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ But since myself\u2014assault Me&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ How have I peace&nbsp;/ Except by subjugating&nbsp;/ Consciousness.&nbsp;/ And since We're mutual Monarch&nbsp;/ How this be&nbsp;/ Except by Abdication&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Me&nbsp;\u2013 of Me?\".<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" />\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson\u00b4s (1830-1886) manuscript of \"A route of evanescence\" (1880).jpg|thumb|left|Dickinson wrote and sent this poem (\"A Route of Evanescence\") to Thomas Higginson in 1880.]]\nThe surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson's poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from [[William Dean Howells]], an editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality \"is that of extraordinary grasp and insight\",<ref>Blake (1964), 12.</ref> albeit \"without the proper control and chastening\" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred.<ref>Wolff (1986), 175.</ref> His judgment that her opus was \"incomplete and unsatisfactory\" would be echoed in the essays of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Maurice Thompson]], who was literary editor of ''The Independent'' for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had \"a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality\".<ref>Blake (1964), 28.</ref> Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. [[Andrew Lang]], a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that \"if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much\".<ref>Blake (1964), 37.</ref> [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in January 1892: \"It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and [[grotesque]] fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of [[William Blake|Blake]], and strongly influenced by the mannerism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]&nbsp;... But the incoherence and formlessness of her&nbsp;\u2014 versicles are fatal&nbsp;... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar\".<ref>Blake (1964), 55.</ref>\n\nCritical attention to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s.<ref>Blake (1964), vi.</ref> By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially [[modernism|modern]]. Rather than seeing Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic.<ref>Wells (1929), 243\u2013259.</ref> In a 1915 essay, [[Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant]] called the poet's inspiration \"daring\" and named her \"one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore\".<ref>Blake (1964), 89.</ref> With the growing popularity of [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poetry]] in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a [[cult following]] began to form.<ref>Blake (1964), 202.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, a number of the New Critics&nbsp;\u2013 among them [[R. P. Blackmur]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Yvor Winters]]&nbsp;\u2013 appraised the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenb\u00fcchle pointed out, their \"affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship\".<ref>Grabher (1998), 358\u2013359.</ref> Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: \"...&nbsp;she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of [[antimacassar]]s&nbsp;... She came&nbsp;... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 223.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of [[feminism]] created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 1.</ref> Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book ''This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson'', \"Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman.\" Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 9.</ref> [[Adrienne Rich]] theorized in ''Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson'' (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: \"[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed&nbsp;... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time&nbsp;... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics.\"<ref>Juhasz (1983), 10.</ref>\n\nSome scholars question the poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry.<ref>Martin (2002), 58</ref> Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and [[Martha Nell Smith]] have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.<ref>Comment (2001), 167.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as ''Emily Dickinson Face to Face'' and ''Letters of Emily Dickinson'', which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.<ref>Grabher (1998), p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nEmily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture.<ref>Martin (2002), 1.</ref> Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet.<ref>Martin (2002), 2.</ref> As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that \"If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 24.</ref> Critic [[Harold Bloom]] has placed her alongside [[Walt Whitman]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Robert Frost]], [[T.

After studying at the [[Amherst College#Amherst Academy|Amherst Academy]] for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] before returning to her family's house in Amherst.\n\nEvidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/emily-dickinson-9274190|title=Emily Dickinson biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography.com |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile Dickinson was a prolific poet, only 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emily Dickinson Museum indicates only one letter and ten poems were published before her death|url=https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|website=Emilydickinson,useum.org|accessdate=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807012709/http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|archive-date=August 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique to her era. They contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use [[Half rhyme|slant rhyme]] as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.<ref name=\"Mc2\">McNeil (1986), 2.</ref> Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\n\nAlthough Dickinson's acquaintances were likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\u2014that the breadth of her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] and [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], though both heavily edited the content. A 1998 ''[[New York Times]]'' article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name \"Susan\" was often deliberately removed.

When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from [[typhus]] and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized.<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that \"it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 172.</ref> She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in [[Boston]] to recover.<ref name=\"wolff77\">Wolff (1986), 77.</ref> With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies.<ref>Ford (1966), 55.</ref> During this period, she met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Huntington Gilbert]] (who later married Emily's brother Austin).\n\nIn 1845, a [[Second Great Awakening|religious revival]] took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers.<ref name=\"ford47to48\">Ford (1966), 47\u201348.</ref> Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: \"I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my Savior.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\">Habegger (2001), 168.</ref> She went on to say it was her \"greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\" /> The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years.<ref>Ford (1966), 37.</ref> After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: \"Some keep the Sabbath going to Church&nbsp;\u2013 / I keep it, staying at Home\".<ref>Johnson (1960), 153.</ref>\n\nDuring the last year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending [[Mary Lyon]]'s [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] (which later became [[Mount Holyoke College]]) in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) from Amherst.<ref>Ford (1966), 46.</ref> She stayed at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there.<ref>Sewall (1974), 368.</ref> The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick.<ref>Sewall (1974), 358.</ref> Whatever the reasons for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to \"bring [her] home at all events\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 211.</ref> Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities.<ref name=\"Pic19\">Pickard (1967), 19.</ref> She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.<ref>Habegger (2001), 213.</ref>\n\n=== Early influences and writing ===\nWhen she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester&nbsp;\u2013 in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 216.</ref> Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.<ref>Sewall (1974), 401.</ref>\n\nNewton likely introduced her to the writings of [[William Wordsworth]], and his gift to her of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\".<ref name=\"Hab221\">Habegger (2001), 221.</ref> Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of [[tuberculosis]], he wrote to her, saying he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.<ref name=\"Hab221\" /> Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862\u2014\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality&nbsp;\u2013 but venturing too near, himself&nbsp;\u2013 he never returned\"\u2014refers to Newton.<ref>Habegger (2001), 218.</ref>\n\nDickinson was familiar not only with the [[Bible]] but also with contemporary popular literature.<ref>Knapp (1989), 59.</ref> She was probably influenced by [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s ''Letters from New York'', another gift from Newton<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> (after reading it, she gushed \"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\"<ref name=\"Ford18\">Ford (1966), 18.</ref>). Her brother smuggled a copy of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[Kavanagh (novel)|Kavanagh]]'' into the house for her (because her father might disapprove)<ref>Sewall (1974), 683.</ref> and a friend lent her [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in late 1849.<ref name=\"Hab226\">Habegger (2001), 226.</ref> ''Jane Eyre''{{'}}s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], she named him \"Carlo\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog.<ref name=\"Hab226\" /> [[William Shakespeare]] was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \"Why clasp any hand but this?\" and to another, \"Why is any other book needed?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 700\u2013701.</ref>\n\n=== Adulthood and seclusion ===\nIn early 1850, Dickinson wrote that \"Amherst is alive with fun this winter&nbsp;... Oh, a very great town this is!\"<ref name=\"Pic19\" /> Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of \"brain congestion\" at age 25.<ref>Sewall (1974), 340.</ref> Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:<blockquote>some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping&nbsp;\u2013 sleeping the churchyard sleep&nbsp;\u2013 the hour of evening is sad&nbsp;\u2013 it was once my study hour&nbsp;\u2013 my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school ''alone'', make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.<ref>Sewall (1974), 341.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Homestead, Amherst, Massachusetts (from left).JPG|thumb|left|The Evergreens, built by Edward Dickinson, was the home of Austin and Susan's family.]]\nDuring the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Gilbert]]. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of \"most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser\" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed.<ref>Martin (2002), 53.</ref> In an 1882 letter to Susan, Emily said, \"With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living.\"\n\nThe importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife.<ref>Pickard (1967), 21.</ref> However, the notion of a \"cruel\" Susan\u2014as promoted by her romantic rival\u2014has been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close.<ref>Longenbach, James.

Retrieved June 29, 2010.</ref> Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'' Lena Koski wrote, \"Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings.\"<ref>Koski (1996), 26-31.</ref> She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, \"Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me&nbsp;... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you\u2014that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast&nbsp;... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language.\" The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film ''[[Wild Nights with Emily]]'' and explored in the TV series ''[[Dickinson (TV series)|Dickinson]]''.\n\nSue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it [[Emily Dickinson Museum#The Evergreens|the Evergreens]], a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead.<ref>Habegger (2001), 338.</ref>\n\nUntil 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home.<ref>Sewall (1974), 444.</ref> First, they spent three weeks in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where her father was representing [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district|Massachusetts]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Then they went to [[Philadelphia]] for two weeks to visit family. In Philadelphia, she met Charles Wadsworth, a famous minister of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church, with whom she forged a strong friendship which lasted until his death in 1882.<ref>Sewall (1974), 447.</ref> Despite seeing him only twice after 1855 (he moved to [[San Francisco]] in 1862), she variously referred to him as \"my Philadelphia\", \"my Clergyman\", \"my dearest earthly friend\" and \"my Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 330.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickinson and Turner 1859 (cleaned).jpg|thumb|In September 2012, the Amherst College Archives and Special Collections unveiled this daguerreotype, proposing it to be Dickinson (left) and her friend [[Kate Scott Turner]] (ca.&nbsp;1859); it has not been authenticated.<ref>[https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/holdings/edickinson/new_daguerreotype 'The World Is Not Acquainted With Us': A New Dickinson Daguerreotype?]\" Amherst College Archives and Special Collections Website.

I Know not what to hope of her\".<ref name=\"Hab342\">Habegger (2001). 342.</ref> As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia said that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her.<ref name=\"Hab342\" /> Emily took this role as her own, and \"finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it\".<ref name=\"Hab342\" />\n\nWithdrawing more and more from the outside world, Emily began in the summer of 1858 what would be her lasting legacy. Reviewing poems she had written previously, she began making clean copies of her work, assembling carefully pieced-together manuscript books.<ref name=\"Hab353\">Habegger (2001), 353.</ref> The forty [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] she created from 1858 through 1865 eventually held nearly eight hundred poems.<ref name=\"Hab353\" /> No one was aware of the existence of these books until after her death.\n\nIn the late 1850s, the Dickinsons befriended [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles]], the owner and editor-in-chief of the ''[[Springfield Republican]]'', and his wife, Mary.<ref>Sewall (1974), 463.</ref> They visited the Dickinsons regularly for years to come. During this time Emily sent him over three dozen letters and nearly fifty poems.<ref>Sewall (1974), 473.</ref> Their friendship brought out some of her most intense writing and Bowles published a few of her poems in his journal.<ref>Habegger (2001), 376; McNeil (1986), 33.</ref> It was from 1858 to 1861 that Dickinson is believed to have written a trio of letters that have been called \"The Master Letters\".

Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as \"a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair&nbsp;... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqu\u00e9 & a blue net worsted shawl.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 523.</ref> He also felt that he never was \"with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 524.</ref>\n\n=== Posies and poesies ===\nScholar Judith Farr notes that Dickinson, during her lifetime, \"was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, than as a poet\".<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> Dickinson studied botany from the age of nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> During her lifetime, she assembled a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound [[herbarium]]. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] system.<ref>Habegger (2001), 154.</ref> The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/science/emily-dickinson-lost-gardens.html|title=The Lost Gardens of Emily Dickinson|date=May 17, 2016|website=The New York Times}}</ref> Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered \"carpets of [[Lily of the Valley|lily-of-the-valley]] and [[Pansy|pansies]], platoons of [[Sweet pea|sweetpeas]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinths]], enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were ribbons of [[peony]] hedges and drifts of [[Narcissus (genus)|daffodils]] in season, [[Calendula|marigolds]] to distraction\u2014a butterfly utopia\".<ref name=\"Parker\">Parker, G9.</ref> In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she \"could inhabit the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Isles]] merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets\". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but \"they valued the posy more than the poetry\".<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nOn June 16, 1874, while in Boston, Edward Dickinson suffered a stroke and died. When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28.<ref>Habegger (2001), 562.</ref> She wrote to Higginson that her father's \"Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 566.</ref> A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral [[paralysis]] and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that \"Home is so far from Home\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 569.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=25%|quote=\n<poem>\nThough the great Waters sleep,\nThat they are still the Deep,\nWe cannot doubt&nbsp;\u2013\nNo vacillating God\nIgnited this Abode\nTo put it out&nbsp;\u2013\n</poem>|source=Emily Dickinson, c. 1884<ref>Johnson (1960), 661.</ref>}}\n[[Otis Phillips Lord]], an elderly judge on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] from [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], in 1872 or 1873 became an acquaintance of Dickinson's.

In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's ''Complete Concordance to Shakespeare'' (1877).<ref>Sewall (1974), 651.</ref> Dickinson wrote that \"While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 652.</ref> She referred to him as \"My lovely Salem\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 592; Sewall (1974), 653.</ref> and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that \"Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 591.</ref>\n\nAfter being critically ill for several years, Judge Lord died in March 1884. Dickinson referred to him as \"our latest Lost\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 597.</ref> Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson's \"Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\", Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.\n\n=== Decline and death ===\nAlthough she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 604.</ref> Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.\n\n[[File:EmilyDickinsonGrave-color.jpg|thumb|left|Emily Dickinson's tombstone in the family plot]]\nThe 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as \"a lady whom the people call the ''Myth''\".<ref>Walsh (1971), 26.</ref> Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief.<ref>Habegger (2001), 612.</ref> Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote \"We were never intimate&nbsp;... while she was our Mother&nbsp;\u2013 but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 607.</ref> The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert\u2014Emily's favorite\u2014died of [[typhoid fever]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 615.</ref>\n\nAs death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote,  \"The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 623.</ref> That summer she had seen \"a great darkness coming\" and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston.<ref>Habegger (2001), 625.</ref> She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: \"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily\".<ref>Wolff (1986), 534.</ref> On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that \"the day was awful&nbsp;... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six.\"<ref name=\"Hab627\">Habegger (2001), 627.</ref> Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as [[Bright's disease]] and its duration as two and a half years.<ref>Habegger (2001), 622.</ref>\n\nLavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Emily's body upon her death. Susan also wrote Emily's obituary for the ''Springfield Republican'', ending it with four lines from one of Emily's poems: \"Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose.\" Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Sue should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly.<ref>Nell Smith (1998), 265.</ref> Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with [[Heliotropium arborescens|vanilla-scented heliotrope]], a [[lady's slipper]] [[Orchidaceae|orchid]], and a \"knot of blue field [[Viola (plant)|violets]]\" placed about it.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\">Wolff (1986), 535.</ref> The funeral service, held in the Homestead's library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", a poem by [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] that had been a favorite of Dickinson's.<ref name=\"Hab627\" /> At Dickinson's request, her \"coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups\" for burial in the family plot at [[Amherst West Cemetery|West Cemetery]] on Triangle Street.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\">Farr (2005), 3\u20136.</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\nDespite Dickinson's prolific writing, fewer than a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's ''Complete Poems'' in 1955,<ref>Ford (1966), 122</ref> Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n[[File:Emilyrepublican.jpg|thumb|right|\"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013,\" titled \"The Sleeping,\" as it was published in the ''Springfield Republican'' in 1862.]]\nA few of Dickinson's poems appeared in [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles']] ''Springfield Republican'' between 1858 and 1868. They were published anonymously and heavily edited, with conventionalized punctuation and formal titles.<ref>McNeil (1986), 33.</ref> The first poem, \"Nobody knows this little rose\", may have been published without Dickinson's permission.<ref>Habegger (2001), 389.</ref> The ''Republican'' also published \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\" as \"The Snake\", \"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013\" as \"The Sleeping\", and \"Blazing in the Gold and quenching in Purple\" as \"Sunset\".<ref name=\"For32\" /><ref name=\"Wolff245\">Wolff (1986), 245.</ref> The poem \"[[I taste a liquor never brewed]]&nbsp;\u2013\" is an example of the edited versions; the last two lines in the first stanza were completely rewritten.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:18em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nI taste a liquor never brewed&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nFrom Tankards scooped in Pearl&nbsp;\u2013<br />\n''Not all the Frankfort Berries''<br />\n''Yield such an Alcohol!''\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<br />\nI taste a liquor never brewed&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nFrom Tankards scooped in Pearl&nbsp;\u2013<br />\n''Not Frankfort Berries yield the sense''<br />\n''Such a delirious whirl!''\n|\n|}\n\nIn 1864, several poems were altered and published in ''Drum Beat'', to raise funds for medical care for Union soldiers in the [[American Civil War|war]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 402\u2013403.</ref> Another appeared in April 1864 in the ''Brooklyn Daily Union''.<ref>Habegger (2001), 403.</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s, [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson|Higginson]] showed Dickinson's poems to [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], who had coincidentally been at the Academy with Dickinson when they were girls.<ref name=\"Sewall581\">Sewall (1974), 580\u2013583.</ref> Jackson was deeply involved in the publishing world, and managed to convince Dickinson to publish her poem \"[[Success is Counted Sweetest|Success is counted sweetest]]\" anonymously in a volume called ''[[A Masque of Poets]]''.<ref name=\"Sewall581\" /> The poem, however, was altered to agree with contemporary taste. It was the last poem published during Dickinson's lifetime.\n\n=== Posthumous ===\nAfter Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest.<ref name=\"Farr3\">Farr (1996), 3.</ref> Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published.<ref>Pickard (1967), xv.</ref> She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.<ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\" /> A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.<ref>Wolff (1986), 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Poems.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Poems'', published in 1890]]\nThe first volume of Dickinson's ''Poems,'' edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890.<ref name=\"Wol537\">Wolff (1986), 537.</ref> Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity.<ref>McNeil (1986), 34; Blake (1964), 42.</ref> The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years.<ref name=\"Wol537\" /> ''Poems: Second Series'' followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: \"The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published\".<ref>Buckingham (1989), 194.</ref>\n\nNearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson's poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;243</ref> Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.<ref>Mitchell (2009), p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n\nThe first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a complete new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson's [[variorum]] brought all of Dickinson's known poems together for the first time.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;122</ref> Johnson's goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts.<ref name=\"Martin\">Martin (2002), 17.</ref> They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely [[wikt:elliptical|elliptical]] in their language.<ref>McNeil (1986), 35.</ref> Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson's letters, also presented in three volumes.\n\nIn 1981, ''The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson'' was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.\n\nDickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in ''My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson'' (2001) that \"The consequences of the poet's failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 628.</ref>\n\n== Poetry ==\n{{Main|List of Emily Dickinson poems}}\n\nDickinson's poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.\n* '''Pre-1861'''. These are often conventional and [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimental]] in nature.<ref>Ford (1966), 68.</ref> Thomas H. Johnson, who later published ''The Poems of Emily Dickinson'', was able to date only five of Dickinson's poems before 1858.<ref name=\"Pic20\">Pickard (1967), 20.</ref> Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, one of which is about missing her brother Austin. The fifth poem, which begins \"I have a Bird in spring\", conveys her grief over the feared loss of friendship and was sent to her friend Sue Gilbert.<ref name=\"Pic20\" />\n* '''1861\u20131865'''. This was her most creative period\u2014these poems represent her most vigorous and creative work. Johnson estimated that she composed 86 poems in 1861, 366 in 1862, 141 in 1863, and 174 in 1864. He also believed that during this period, she fully developed her themes of life and mortality.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\">Johnson (1960), viii.</ref>\n* '''Post-1866'''. It is estimated that two-thirds of the entire body of her poetry was written before this year.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\" />\n\n=== Structure and syntax ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson \"Wild nights\" manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|Dickinson's handwritten manuscript of her poem \"Wild Nights&nbsp;\u2013 Wild Nights!\"]]\nThe extensive use of [[dash]]es and unconventional [[capitalization]] in Dickinson's manuscripts, and the [[idiosyncratic]] vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is \"far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed\".<ref name=\"Mc2\" /><ref name=\"Hecht153\">Hecht (1996), 153\u2013155.</ref> Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the [[ballad stanza]], a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of [[half rhyme|slant rhyme]].<ref name=\"For63\">Ford (1966), 63.</ref> In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four, while only using tetrameter for line three.\n\nSince many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the [[common meter]], employing alternating lines of [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 186.</ref> Familiar examples of such songs are \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" and \"[[Amazing Grace]]'\".\n\nDickinson scholar and poet [[Anthony Hecht]] finds resonances in Dickinson's poetry not only with hymns and song-forms but also with [[psalms]] and [[riddle]]s, citing the following example: \"Who is the East?&nbsp;/ The Yellow Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Purple if he can&nbsp;/ That carries in the Sun.&nbsp;/ Who is the West?&nbsp;/ The Purple Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Yellow if He can&nbsp;/ That lets Him out again.\"<ref name=\"Hecht153\" />\n\nLate 20th-century scholars are \"deeply interested\" by Dickinson's highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks).<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime&nbsp;\u2013 \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\", published as \"The Snake\" in the ''Republican''&nbsp;\u2013 Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:20em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not<br />\nHis notice sudden is&nbsp;\u2013\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<ref name=\"For32\">Ford (1966), 32.</ref><br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not,<br />\nHis notice sudden is.\n|\n|}\n\nAs Farr points out, \"snakes instantly notice you\"; Dickinson's version captures the \"breathless immediacy\" of the encounter; and ''The Republican''{{'}}s punctuation renders \"her lines more commonplace\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson's structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are \"aesthetically based\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page.<ref>Crumbley (1997), 14.</ref> Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n=== Major themes ===\nDickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]].<ref>Bloom (1998), 18.</ref> However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's \"relentlessly measuring mind&nbsp;... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental\".<ref>Farr (1996), 13.</ref> Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, [[irony]] and [[satire]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 171.</ref>\n\n'''Flowers and gardens''': Farr notes that Dickinson's \"poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers\" and that allusions to gardens often refer to an \"imaginative realm&nbsp;... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\">Farr (2005), 1\u20137.</ref> She associates some flowers, like [[gentian]]s and [[anemone]]s, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and [[nosegay]]s.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Farr notes that one of Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to \"conflate her poetry itself with the posies\": \"My nosegays are for Captives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Dim&nbsp;\u2013 long expectant eyes&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Fingers denied the plucking,&nbsp;/ Patient till Paradise&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To such, if they sh'd whisper&nbsp;/ Of morning and the moor&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ They bear no other errand,&nbsp;/ And I, no other prayer\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" />\n\n'''The Master poems''': Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to \"Signor\", \"Sir\" and \"Master\", who is characterized as Dickinson's \"lover for all eternity\".<ref name=\"Farr7\">Farr (1996), 7\u20138.</ref> These confessional poems are often \"searing in their self-inquiry\" and \"harrowing to the reader\" and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson's day.<ref name=\"Farr7\" /> The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals but this view is frequently rejected by scholars. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, \"human, with specific characteristics, but godlike\" and speculates that Master may be a \"kind of Christian muse\".<ref name=\"Farr7\" />\n\n'''Morbidity''': Dickinson's poems reflect her \"early and lifelong fascination\" with illness, dying and death.<ref name=\"Pollak62\">Pollak (1996), 62\u201365.</ref> Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: \"crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> She reserved her sharpest insights into the \"death blow aimed by God\" and the \"funeral in the brain\", often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar Vivian Pollak considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson's \"thirsting-starving persona\", an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail.<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> Dickinson's most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at \"the interface of murder and suicide\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" />\n\n'''Gospel poems''': Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him.<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\">Oberhaus (1996), 105\u2013119</ref> She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with \"wit and American colloquial language\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the \"salient feature uniting Christian poets&nbsp;... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ\" and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the \"poetic tradition of Christian devotion\" alongside [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]].<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: \"The Savior must have been&nbsp;/ A docile Gentleman&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To come so far so cold a Day&nbsp;/ For little Fellowmen&nbsp;/ The Road to Bethlehem&nbsp;/ Since He and I were Boys&nbsp;/ Was leveled, but for that twould be&nbsp;/ A rugged billion Miles&nbsp;\u2013\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" />\n\n'''The Undiscovered Continent''': Academic Suzanne Juhasz considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\">Juhasz (1996), 130\u2013140.</ref> Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the \"undiscovered continent\" and the \"landscape of the spirit\" and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding\u2014castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms\u2014to create a dwelling place of \"oneself\" where one resides with one's other selves.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" /> An example that brings together many of these ideas is: \"Me from Myself&nbsp;\u2013 to banish&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Had I Art&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Impregnable my Fortress&nbsp;/ Unto All Heart&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ But since myself\u2014assault Me&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ How have I peace&nbsp;/ Except by subjugating&nbsp;/ Consciousness.&nbsp;/ And since We're mutual Monarch&nbsp;/ How this be&nbsp;/ Except by Abdication&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Me&nbsp;\u2013 of Me?\".<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" />\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson\u00b4s (1830-1886) manuscript of \"A route of evanescence\" (1880).jpg|thumb|left|Dickinson wrote and sent this poem (\"A Route of Evanescence\") to Thomas Higginson in 1880.]]\nThe surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson's poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from [[William Dean Howells]], an editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality \"is that of extraordinary grasp and insight\",<ref>Blake (1964), 12.</ref> albeit \"without the proper control and chastening\" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred.<ref>Wolff (1986), 175.</ref> His judgment that her opus was \"incomplete and unsatisfactory\" would be echoed in the essays of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Maurice Thompson]], who was literary editor of ''The Independent'' for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had \"a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality\".<ref>Blake (1964), 28.</ref> Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. [[Andrew Lang]], a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that \"if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much\".<ref>Blake (1964), 37.</ref> [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in January 1892: \"It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and [[grotesque]] fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of [[William Blake|Blake]], and strongly influenced by the mannerism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]&nbsp;... But the incoherence and formlessness of her&nbsp;\u2014 versicles are fatal&nbsp;... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar\".<ref>Blake (1964), 55.</ref>\n\nCritical attention to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s.<ref>Blake (1964), vi.</ref> By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially [[modernism|modern]]. Rather than seeing Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic.<ref>Wells (1929), 243\u2013259.</ref> In a 1915 essay, [[Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant]] called the poet's inspiration \"daring\" and named her \"one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore\".<ref>Blake (1964), 89.</ref> With the growing popularity of [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poetry]] in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a [[cult following]] began to form.<ref>Blake (1964), 202.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, a number of the New Critics&nbsp;\u2013 among them [[R. P. Blackmur]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Yvor Winters]]&nbsp;\u2013 appraised the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenb\u00fcchle pointed out, their \"affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship\".<ref>Grabher (1998), 358\u2013359.</ref> Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: \"...&nbsp;she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of [[antimacassar]]s&nbsp;... She came&nbsp;... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 223.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of [[feminism]] created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 1.</ref> Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book ''This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson'', \"Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman.\" Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 9.</ref> [[Adrienne Rich]] theorized in ''Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson'' (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: \"[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed&nbsp;... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time&nbsp;... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics.\"<ref>Juhasz (1983), 10.</ref>\n\nSome scholars question the poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry.<ref>Martin (2002), 58</ref> Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and [[Martha Nell Smith]] have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.<ref>Comment (2001), 167.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as ''Emily Dickinson Face to Face'' and ''Letters of Emily Dickinson'', which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.<ref>Grabher (1998), p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nEmily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture.<ref>Martin (2002), 1.</ref> Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet.<ref>Martin (2002), 2.</ref> As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that \"If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 24.</ref> Critic [[Harold Bloom]] has placed her alongside [[Walt Whitman]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Robert Frost]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Hart Crane]] as a major American poet,<ref name=\"Bloo9\">Bloom (1999), 9</ref> and [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|in 1994]] listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.<ref>Bloom (1994), 226</ref>\n\nDickinson is taught in [[American literature]] and [[Poetry of the United States|poetry]] classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as text for art songs by composers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Nick Peros]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[Michael Tilson Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_author_texts.html?AuthorId=697 |title=Vocal music set to texts by Emily Dickinson |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |accessdate=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in [[Bozeman, Montana]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml |title=Mission Statement|publisher=Emily Dickinson School website, Bozeman, Montana |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002033911/http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml|archivedate=October 2, 2007}}</ref>[[Redmond, Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |title=The Real Emily Dickinson |publisher=Emily Dickinson Elementary School website, Redmond, Washington |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094624/http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}</ref> and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/03/M075/default.htm|title=Find a School|website=Schools.nyc.gov|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> A few literary journals\u2014including ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'', the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society\u2014have been founded to examine her work.<ref name=\"journal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/ |title=The Emily Dickinson Journal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press website, Baltimore |accessdate=December 18, 2007}}</ref> An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson was issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] on August 28, 1971 as the second stamp in the \"American Poet\" series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |title=Emily Dickinson commemorative stamps and ephemera |publisher=Harvard University Library |accessdate=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712192306/http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |archive-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dickinson was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1973.<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/emily-dickinson/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Emily Dickinson]</ref> A one-woman play titled ''[[The Belle of Amherst]]'' appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.<ref>\"[http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 Belle of Amherst] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011951/http://emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 |date=November 24, 2010 }}\".
