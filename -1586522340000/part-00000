Around six million Britons have an Irish grandfather or grandmother (approximately 10% of the UK population).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/britain/article/0,,1871753,00.html |title=Six million Britons are entitled to Irish citizenship |work=The Guardian |date= 13 September 2006|accessdate=3 January 2010 | location=London | first=Owen | last=Bowcott}}</ref> 900,000 ethnic Irish people live in the capital (12% of the city's population); despite this, some sources put the population of people of Irish descent in London at 77% (some five and a half million people), although the White British and White Irish populations combined are less than this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merseyreporter.com/history/historic/irish-immigration.shtml |title=Irish in London |publisher=Merseyreporter.com |accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1224611.stm |title=Irish in London 2 |publisher=BBC News |date=16 March 2001 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Jamaicans===\n{{See also|Jamaican British}}\nThere are records that show black people, predominantly from Jamaica, living in London during the 17th and 18th centuries; but it was not until the arrival of the {{HMT|Empire Windrush}}, on 22 June 1948, that significant numbers of Caribbeans, in particular Jamaicans, arrived in the capital. This has since become an important landmark in the history of modern multicultural Britain. During the post [[World War II]] era, the presence of these immigrants was requested to help reconstruct the British economy. Employers such as [[British Rail]], the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and [[London Transport Executive|London transport]] recruited almost exclusively from Jamaica.

The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization.

Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2.

The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

With promotion to Gauliga Bayern in 1933, however, the existing venue proved to be more and more inadequate.\n\nThe club's necessity finally motivated local industrialist [[Willy Sachs]] to the donation of a football stadium to the City of [[Schweinfurt]], where the patron designated a privileged right of use for FC Schweinfurt 05. The new [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]],<ref name=\"Willy Sachs Stadion\"/> built by German architect [[Paul Bonatz]], was opened on 23 July 1936 in the presence of leading politicians of the [[Third Reich]].<ref name=\"Cicero\"/> The stadium saw its first game three days later with a 2\u20132 draw between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1935 German football championship|1935]] German champion [[FC Schalke 04]].<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/> Attandance record was 22,500 at a friendly between Schweinfurt 05 and [[1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2.

FC Schweinfurt 05 team in 1905]]\n\nThe football club was founded on 5 May 1905 and played in the local leagues until beginning of the [[First World War]]. At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. The club had a couple of successful seasons in the [[Gauliga]] era, winning the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]] in [[1939 German football championship|1939]] and [[1942 German football championship|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. In the German football championship 1939 competition, Schweinfurt barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the 1942 German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title. Again in 1936, the club moved into its newly constructed stadium, the [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]], a donation by local industrialist and patron [[Willy Sachs]].<ref name=\"Cicero\">{{cite web|title=Der braune Schatten|trans-title=The brown shadow|publisher=cicero.de|url=http://cicero.de/wirtschaft/der-braune-schatten/37229|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, FC 05 midfielders [[Albin Kitzinger]] and [[Andreas Kupfer|Andreas 'Ander' Kupfer]] became renowned in international football as they formed one of the best half-back duos in Europe. Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

Kennedy's limousine has just turned onto Elm Street, moments before the first shot, and the President is apparently waving.]]\n\nThe '''Zapruder film''' is a silent [[8 mm film|8mm]] color motion picture sequence shot by [[Abraham Zapruder]] with a [[Bell & Howell]] [[home-movie]] camera, as United States President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[motorcade]] passed through [[Dealey Plaza]] in [[Dallas]], Texas,  on November 22, 1963. Unexpectedly, it ended up capturing [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|the President's assassination]].\n\nEven though it is not the only film of the shooting, the Zapruder film has been described as being the most complete one, giving a relatively clear view from a somewhat elevated position on the side from which the president's fatal head wound is visible. It was an important part of the [[Warren Commission]] hearings and all subsequent investigations of the assassination, and it is one of the most studied pieces of film in history. Of greatest notoriety is the film's capture of the fatal shot to President Kennedy's head when his [[SS-100-X|presidential limousine]] was almost exactly in front of, and slightly below, Zapruder's position.\n\n==Creation ==\n{{See also|Abraham Zapruder}}\nAbraham Zapruder stood on a concrete pedestal along Elm Street in Dealey Plaza holding a high-end Model 414 PD [[Bell & Howell]] Zoomatic Director Series Camera. He filmed from the time the presidential limousine turned onto Elm Street {{r|pasternack20121123}} for a total of 26.6&nbsp;seconds, exposing 486 frames of standard [[8 mm film|8 mm]] [[Kodachrome]]&nbsp;II [[safety film]], running at 18.3 frames/second.{{refn|group=\"note\"|The Model 414 PD held a reel of 16mm film which was first run in one direction, with half of the width of the film being exposed. The reel would then be removed from the camera (a process which could take place in subdued light), the feed and take-up reels swapped and reloaded so that the other half of the film could be exposed in a process analogous to half-track audio tape. The FBI later tested Zapruder's camera and found that it filmed an average of 18.3&nbsp;frames/second (slightly deviating from the camera's standard frame rate of 16 frame/s).<ref>Richard B. Trask, ''Photographic Memory: The Kennedy Assassination, November 22, 1963'', Dallas: Sixth Floor Museum, 1996, p. 5.</ref> While earlier 8 mm cameras had used a 16 frame/s rate, the 8 mm standard was moving to 18 frame/s by the 1960s, and that was the frame rate adopted by the Super 8 format in 1966.}}\n[[Image:Clinthill limo.png|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Frame 371 showing [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] reaching out across the back of the presidential limousine as [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]] climbs aboard.]]\nAfter [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Forrest Sorrels promised Zapruder that the film would only be used for an official investigation, the two men sought to develop the footage as soon as possible.

He tried negotiating with ''Life'' for the rights to print important individual frames in his book ''Six Seconds in Dallas''. ''Life'' refused to approve the use of any of the frames, even after Thompson offered to give all profits from the book sales to ''Life.'' Following its publishing in 1967, Thompson's book featured some very detailed charcoal drawings of important individual frames, plus photo reproductions of the four missing ones. Time Inc. filed a lawsuit against Thompson and his publishing company for [[copyright infringement]]. A U.S. District Court ruled in 1968 that the Time Inc. copyright of the Zapruder film was not violated by invoking the doctrine of [[fair use]]. The court held that \"there is a public interest in having the fullest information available on the murder of President Kennedy, saying that Thompson \"did serious work on the subject and has a theory entitled to public consideration\" and that \"the copying by defendants was fair and reasonable.\"<ref>''Time Inc. v.

Pleased with the results, they asked for a [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]] [[internegative]] to be made. Mo Weitzman made several internegatives in 1968, giving the best to ''Life'' and retaining the test copies. Weitzman set up his own optical house and motion picture postproduction facility later that year. Hired in 1969, employee and assassination buff [[Robert Groden]] used one of Weitzman's copies and an optical printer to make versions of the Zapruder film with close-ups and minimize the shakiness of Zapruder's camera.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nBefore the [[Trial of Clay Shaw|1969 trial of Clay Shaw]], a businessman from [[New Orleans]], for conspiracy in connection with the assassination, a copy of the film made several generations from the original was [[subpoena duces tecum|subpoenaed]] from Time Inc. in 1967 by New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] for use at Shaw's [[grand jury]] hearing. Garrison unsuccessfully subpoenaed the original film in 1968. The courtroom showings of Garrison's copy in 1969 were the first time it had been shown in public as a film. Noted conspiracy theorist [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]], author of ''[[Rush to Judgment]]'', was in New Orleans at the time to assist Garrison in his investigation. Lane borrowed Garrison's copy of the film and had several copies printed at a local lab.  These low quality copies began circulating among assassination researchers and were known to many journalists as well. The underground circulation of these copies, as well as the secret screenings to a select few who had the opportunity to see them, added an additional aura of mystery to the film, thus enhancing the idea that there was a secret to be found in it that was being kept hidden from the general public.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nThe first broadcast of the Zapruder film was on the late-night television show ''Underground News'' with Chuck Collins, originating on WSNS-TV, Ch 44, Chicago in 1970.

Time Inc. wanted to donate the film to the U.S. government. The Zapruder family originally refused to consent, but in 1978, the family transferred the film to the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] for appropriate preservation and safe-keeping, while still retaining ownership of the film and its copyright. Director [[Oliver Stone]] paid over $85,000 to the Zapruder family for use of the Zapruder film in his motion picture ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991).{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nOn October 26, 1992, then-U.S. President [[George H.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act]] (the \"JFK Act\"), which sought to preserve for historical and governmental purposes all records related to President Kennedy's assassination. The Act also created the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives. The Zapruder film was automatically designated an \"assassination record\" and therefore became official property of the United States government. When the Zapruder family demanded the return of the original film between 1993 and 1994, National Archives officials refused to comply.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nOn April 24, 1997, the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB), which the JFK Act created, announced a \"Statement of Policy and Intent with Regard to the Zapruder Film\". The ARRB re-affirmed that the Zapruder film was an \"assassination record\" within the JFK Act's meaning and directed it to be transferred on August 1, 1998 from its present-day location in NARA's film collection to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection maintained by NARA.{{refn| group=\"note\"| The film's physical location remained the same, only its record classification changed.}} As required by the [[Constitution of the United States|US federal law]] for such a seizure under [[eminent domain]], payment to Zapruder's heirs was attempted.

When he continued filming, frame 133 already shows the presidential motorcade in view. Holland and Rush suggest that the pause could have had great significance for the interpretation of the assassination.\n\nOne of the sources of controversy with the [[Warren Report]] is its difficulty in satisfactorily accounting for the sequencing of the assassination. A specific mystery concerns what happened to the one shot that missed (and how Oswald came to miss at what was assumed to be close range). Holland and Rush argue that the break in the Zapruder film might conceal a first shot earlier than analysts have hitherto assumed, and point out that in this case a horizontal traffic mast would temporarily have obstructed Oswald's view of his target.

Kennedy]]'s [[motorcade]] passed through [[Dealey Plaza]] in [[Dallas]], Texas,  on November 22, 1963. Unexpectedly, it ended up capturing [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|the President's assassination]].\n\nEven though it is not the only film of the shooting, the Zapruder film has been described as being the most complete one, giving a relatively clear view from a somewhat elevated position on the side from which the president's fatal head wound is visible. It was an important part of the [[Warren Commission]] hearings and all subsequent investigations of the assassination, and it is one of the most studied pieces of film in history. Of greatest notoriety is the film's capture of the fatal shot to President Kennedy's head when his [[SS-100-X|presidential limousine]] was almost exactly in front of, and slightly below, Zapruder's position.\n\n==Creation ==\n{{See also|Abraham Zapruder}}\nAbraham Zapruder stood on a concrete pedestal along Elm Street in Dealey Plaza holding a high-end Model 414 PD [[Bell & Howell]] Zoomatic Director Series Camera. He filmed from the time the presidential limousine turned onto Elm Street {{r|pasternack20121123}} for a total of 26.6&nbsp;seconds, exposing 486 frames of standard [[8 mm film|8 mm]] [[Kodachrome]]&nbsp;II [[safety film]], running at 18.3 frames/second.{{refn|group=\"note\"|The Model 414 PD held a reel of 16mm film which was first run in one direction, with half of the width of the film being exposed. The reel would then be removed from the camera (a process which could take place in subdued light), the feed and take-up reels swapped and reloaded so that the other half of the film could be exposed in a process analogous to half-track audio tape. The FBI later tested Zapruder's camera and found that it filmed an average of 18.3&nbsp;frames/second (slightly deviating from the camera's standard frame rate of 16 frame/s).<ref>Richard B.

In early 1967, ''Life'' released a statement saying that four frames of the original (frames 208\u2013211) were accidentally destroyed, and the adjacent frames damaged, by a ''Life'' photo lab technician on November 23, 1963.

He tried negotiating with ''Life'' for the rights to print important individual frames in his book ''Six Seconds in Dallas''. ''Life'' refused to approve the use of any of the frames, even after Thompson offered to give all profits from the book sales to ''Life.'' Following its publishing in 1967, Thompson's book featured some very detailed charcoal drawings of important individual frames, plus photo reproductions of the four missing ones. Time Inc. filed a lawsuit against Thompson and his publishing company for [[copyright infringement]]. A U.S. District Court ruled in 1968 that the Time Inc. copyright of the Zapruder film was not violated by invoking the doctrine of [[fair use]]. The court held that \"there is a public interest in having the fullest information available on the murder of President Kennedy, saying that Thompson \"did serious work on the subject and has a theory entitled to public consideration\" and that \"the copying by defendants was fair and reasonable.\"<ref>''Time Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates'', 293 F.Supp. 130, 146 (D.C.N.Y. 1968).</ref>\n\nIn 1967, ''Life'' hired New Jersey film lab Manhattan Effects to make a [[16 mm]] film copy of the Zapruder film's original version. Pleased with the results, they asked for a [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]] [[internegative]] to be made. Mo Weitzman made several internegatives in 1968, giving the best to ''Life'' and retaining the test copies. Weitzman set up his own optical house and motion picture postproduction facility later that year. Hired in 1969, employee and assassination buff [[Robert Groden]] used one of Weitzman's copies and an optical printer to make versions of the Zapruder film with close-ups and minimize the shakiness of Zapruder's camera.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nBefore the [[Trial of Clay Shaw|1969 trial of Clay Shaw]], a businessman from [[New Orleans]], for conspiracy in connection with the assassination, a copy of the film made several generations from the original was [[subpoena duces tecum|subpoenaed]] from Time Inc. in 1967 by New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] for use at Shaw's [[grand jury]] hearing. Garrison unsuccessfully subpoenaed the original film in 1968. The courtroom showings of Garrison's copy in 1969 were the first time it had been shown in public as a film. Noted conspiracy theorist [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]], author of ''[[Rush to Judgment]]'', was in New Orleans at the time to assist Garrison in his investigation. Lane borrowed Garrison's copy of the film and had several copies printed at a local lab.  These low quality copies began circulating among assassination researchers and were known to many journalists as well. The underground circulation of these copies, as well as the secret screenings to a select few who had the opportunity to see them, added an additional aura of mystery to the film, thus enhancing the idea that there was a secret to be found in it that was being kept hidden from the general public.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nThe first broadcast of the Zapruder film was on the late-night television show ''Underground News'' with Chuck Collins, originating on WSNS-TV, Ch 44, Chicago in 1970.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act]] (the \"JFK Act\"), which sought to preserve for historical and governmental purposes all records related to President Kennedy's assassination. The Act also created the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection at the National Archives. The Zapruder film was automatically designated an \"assassination record\" and therefore became official property of the United States government. When the Zapruder family demanded the return of the original film between 1993 and 1994, National Archives officials refused to comply.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nOn April 24, 1997, the [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (ARRB), which the JFK Act created, announced a \"Statement of Policy and Intent with Regard to the Zapruder Film\". The ARRB re-affirmed that the Zapruder film was an \"assassination record\" within the JFK Act's meaning and directed it to be transferred on August 1, 1998 from its present-day location in NARA's film collection to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection maintained by NARA.{{refn| group=\"note\"| The film's physical location remained the same, only its record classification changed.}} As required by the [[Constitution of the United States|US federal law]] for such a seizure under [[eminent domain]], payment to Zapruder's heirs was attempted. Because the film is unique, its value was difficult to ascertain; eventually, following arbitration with the Zapruder heirs, the government purchased the film in 1999 for $16 million.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nThe Zapruder family retained copyright to the film, which was not seized. In 1997, the film was digitally replicated and restored under license of the Zapruder family. The 1998 documentary ''Image of an Assassination: A New Look at the Zapruder Film'' shows history of the film, as well as various versions of when it was restored.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nIn December 1999, the Zapruder family donated the film's copyright to the [[Sixth Floor Museum]], in the [[Texas School Book Depository]] building at [[Dealey Plaza]], along with one of the first-generation copies made on November 22, 1963 and other copies of the film and frame enlargements once held by ''Life'' magazine, which had since been returned.<ref>[http://www.jfk.org/Research/Zapruder/Zapruder_Press_Conference.htm Zapruder Film Press Release] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008133947/http://www.jfk.org/Research/Zapruder/Zapruder_Press_Conference.htm |date=October 8, 2006 }}, January 18, 2000.

Each object that appears during the film has its starting position equal to where it appears first in its frames. The objects' positions are updated during visibility in the Zapruder frames, and they stay motionless once each object moves out of those frames.<ref>{{YouTube|Sqk3sdfXFkc|JFK Assassination Zapruder Stabilized Motion Panorama HD plus SloMo - 50th anniversary}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Orville Nix]] film had the same technology applied to it.

It is not clear from the film itself as to when the first and second shots occurred. It is apparent that by frame 225 the President is reacting to his throat wound. However, no wound or blood is seen on either President Kennedy or Governor Connally prior to frame 313. The fatal shot to the President occurred at frame 313<ref>[http://www.assassinationresearch.com/v2n2/zfilm/zframe313.html ''Frame 313''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125081336/http://www.assassinationresearch.com/v2n2/zfilm/zframe313.html |date=November 25, 2013 }} Costella Combined Edit</ref> with the visible effects of the head wound.\n\nThere is also a stabilized high-definition version of the Zapruder film that is synchronized with the Dallas Police Department audio recording.

When he continued filming, frame 133 already shows the presidential motorcade in view. Holland and Rush suggest that the pause could have had great significance for the interpretation of the assassination.\n\nOne of the sources of controversy with the [[Warren Report]] is its difficulty in satisfactorily accounting for the sequencing of the assassination. A specific mystery concerns what happened to the one shot that missed (and how Oswald came to miss at what was assumed to be close range). Holland and Rush argue that the break in the Zapruder film might conceal a first shot earlier than analysts have hitherto assumed, and point out that in this case a horizontal traffic mast would temporarily have obstructed Oswald's view of his target. In the authors' words, \"The film, we realize, does not depict an assassination about to commence. It shows one that had already started.\"<ref name=\"newsweek 112814\">[http://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/28/truth-behind-jfks-assassination-285653.html The Truth Behind JFK's Assassination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205004817/http://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/28/truth-behind-jfks-assassination-285653.html |date=February 5, 2016 }}, by Max Holland, Newsweek, November 20, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe evidence offered by Holland and Rush to support their theory was challenged in a series of 2007\u201308 articles by computer animator [[Dale K.

In addition to being student-managed and student-produced, KURE is also funded by students at [[Iowa State University]] through the Student Government. KURE has always been staffed entirely by student volunteers.\n\nAccording to the station's board of directors, KURE got its start as KMRA, broadcasting out of a Friley dorm room on 640 AM, on Oct. 17, 1949.<ref>http://www.iowastatedaily.com/articles/2006/06/15/pulse/20060615-archive.txt</ref> Friley residents Cedric Curin, Chuck Hawley and Maurice Voland founded the station with two turntables, a small transmitter and a public address system.\n\nPowered by one quarter of a watt, the signal was only able to provide Friley Hall with entertainment. A boost to 50 watts and implementation of the carrier current method allowed the station to use local power lines as its broadcast antennas and make its programming audible across all of campus.\n\nIn 1950, KMRA became KMRI.  In 1961, KMRI became KISU.  KISU applied for new call letters and in 1970 was given them\u2014KPGY.<ref>http://findingaids.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/arch/rgrp/22-9-5.html</ref>\n\n1969 brought the station to its current location in the basement of Friley, and the jump to the FM band was made in 1970.

In addition to being student-managed and student-produced, KURE is also funded by students at [[Iowa State University]] through the Student Government. KURE has always been staffed entirely by student volunteers.\n\nAccording to the station's board of directors, KURE got its start as KMRA, broadcasting out of a Friley dorm room on 640 AM, on Oct. 17, 1949.<ref>http://www.iowastatedaily.com/articles/2006/06/15/pulse/20060615-archive.txt</ref> Friley residents Cedric Curin, Chuck Hawley and Maurice Voland founded the station with two turntables, a small transmitter and a public address system.\n\nPowered by one quarter of a watt, the signal was only able to provide Friley Hall with entertainment. A boost to 50 watts and implementation of the carrier current method allowed the station to use local power lines as its broadcast antennas and make its programming audible across all of campus.\n\nIn 1950, KMRA became KMRI.  In 1961, KMRI became KISU.  KISU applied for new call letters and in 1970 was given them\u2014KPGY.<ref>http://findingaids.lib.iastate.edu/spcl/arch/rgrp/22-9-5.html</ref>\n\n1969 brought the station to its current location in the basement of Friley, and the jump to the FM band was made in 1970.

She rose to prominence for her work in various studio and [[independent film]]s in the 1970s, frequently portraying eccentric and offbeat characters, and established herself as a figure of [[New Hollywood]]. Her career spanned over 50 years, and includes nearly 200 credits in both independent and mainstream films. Black received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two [[Golden Globe Awards]], as well as an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nA native of suburban [[Chicago]], Black studied theater at [[Northwestern University]] before dropping out and relocating to New York City. She performed on Broadway in 1965 before making her major film debut in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). Black relocated to California and was cast as an acid-tripping prostitute in [[Dennis Hopper]]'s road film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969). This led to a lead in the drama ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' (1970), in which she played a hopeless waitress, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]]. Black made her first major commercial picture with the disaster film ''[[Airport 1975]]'' (1974), and her subsequent appearance as Myrtle Wilson in [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|''The Great Gatsby'']] (1974) won her a second Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBlack starred as a glamorous country singer in [[Robert Altman]]'s ensemble musical drama ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), also writing and performing two songs for the soundtrack, which won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Score Soundtrack]]. Her portrayal of an aspiring actress in [[John Schlesinger]]'s drama ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'' (also 1975) earned her a third Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress]]. She subsequently took on four roles in [[Dan Curtis]]' anthology horror film ''[[Trilogy of Terror]]'' (1975), followed by Curtis's supernatural horror feature, ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1976). The same year, she starred as a con artist in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s final film, ''[[Family Plot]]''.\n\nIn 1982, Black starred as a [[trans woman]] in the Robert Altman-directed Broadway debut of ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a role she also reprised in Altman's subsequent [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]]. She next starred in the comedy ''[[Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?]]'' (1983), followed by [[Tobe Hooper]]'s remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986). For much of the late 1980s and 1990s, Black starred in a variety of [[arthouse film|arthouse]], independent, and horror films, as well as writing her own screenplays. She had a leading role as a villainous mother in [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' (2003), which cemented her status as a [[cult film|cult]] horror icon. She continued to star in low-profile films throughout the early 2000s, as well as working as a [[playwright]] before her death from ampullary cancer in 2013.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1939\u20131959: Early life===\nBlack was born Karen Blanche Ziegler on July 1, 1939, in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]],{{sfn|Segrave|Martin|1990|p=85}} the daughter of Elsie Mary ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Reif), a writer of several prize-winning children's novels, and Norman Arthur Ziegler, an engineer and businessman.{{sfn|Segrave|Martin|1990|p=85}}<ref name=mit>{{cite news| last=Frisbie| first=Thomas| title=Elsie \"Peggy\" Ziegler: Wrote history-based books for young adults| newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| date=June 18, 2008| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-1216323741E85B88.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106001031/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-1216323741E85B88.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 6, 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tglaAAAAYAAJ&q=karen%20black%20father%20engineer| title=Current Biography Yearbook| year=1977| publisher=H.

She rose to prominence for her work in various studio and [[independent film]]s in the 1970s, frequently portraying eccentric and offbeat characters, and established herself as a figure of [[New Hollywood]]. Her career spanned over 50 years, and includes nearly 200 credits in both independent and mainstream films. Black received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two [[Golden Globe Awards]], as well as an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nA native of suburban [[Chicago]], Black studied theater at [[Northwestern University]] before dropping out and relocating to New York City. She performed on Broadway in 1965 before making her major film debut in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). Black relocated to California and was cast as an acid-tripping prostitute in [[Dennis Hopper]]'s road film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969). This led to a lead in the drama ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' (1970), in which she played a hopeless waitress, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]]. Black made her first major commercial picture with the disaster film ''[[Airport 1975]]'' (1974), and her subsequent appearance as Myrtle Wilson in [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|''The Great Gatsby'']] (1974) won her a second Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBlack starred as a glamorous country singer in [[Robert Altman]]'s ensemble musical drama ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), also writing and performing two songs for the soundtrack, which won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Score Soundtrack]]. Her portrayal of an aspiring actress in [[John Schlesinger]]'s drama ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'' (also 1975) earned her a third Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress]]. She subsequently took on four roles in [[Dan Curtis]]' anthology horror film ''[[Trilogy of Terror]]'' (1975), followed by Curtis's supernatural horror feature, ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1976). The same year, she starred as a con artist in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s final film, ''[[Family Plot]]''.\n\nIn 1982, Black starred as a [[trans woman]] in the Robert Altman-directed Broadway debut of ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a role she also reprised in Altman's subsequent [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]]. She next starred in the comedy ''[[Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?]]'' (1983), followed by [[Tobe Hooper]]'s remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986).

They are caring and loving to him, while having a daughter, who is like a sister to Mani. Mani's brother-in-law wants to get their daughter married to Mani. But Mani happens to have learn that his cousin is in love with some other guy, who is jobless like him and cancels the wedding plans paving way for his cousin's wedding with her lover. This angers Mani's brother-in-law and he forces him out of his home.\n\nNatarajan Iyer ([[Delhi Ganesh]]) is an innocent man, a [[Brahmin Tamil]], and a house owner in [[Mylapore]], [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]] who lives with his daughter Gayatri ([[Kanika (actress)|Kanika]]), who is a college student near the [[Parthasarathy Temple]]. He is looking for a right tenant for the upper portion of his house.

He rents out the house to five bachelor students, who pretended to be good. Natarajan wants to get rid of the students, who used to stay at a hostel, but were expelled due to bad behavior. They had heard about Natarajan, his house, which includes a spare room apartment, which hasn't been used for about years and his conditions on living there including his fears and his filtering. They pretended to be good college students and were allowed to live in the house by Natarajan.

Natarajan accepted Auto's suggestion and Auto took him to see Mani at a prison.\n\nAuto lied to Natarajan that Mani was in the prison because he killed a house owner, but really, Mani was actually visiting his brother-in-law in there to give him his lunch, as his brother-in-law is the jailer in the prison and has his lunch delivered by Mani every day. Mani was reluctant into acting and pretending to be a rowdy, but Auto convinced him otherwise, as Mani has to pay back a bank loan of interest. Mani receives money from Natarajan as payment and in turn, he gave to his cousin asking her to give it to her lover, so that he can get a job and that she can finally talk about him to her father. Auto introduces Mani to Natarajan as a gangster/rowdy named 'Bottle' Mani, in which coincidentally, there is an actual gangster/rowdy named 'Bottle' Mani.

Although, Priya is not interested in the proposal having learned Raghavan's true nature from the priest, who is conducting her wedding and had conducted Raghavan's first wedding, her father wanted her to agree, just because Raghavan helped him escape from a police case. Priya decides to commit suicide on the day of her wedding with Raghavan, but luckily gets kidnapped and saved by Mani, whom she first met at a shopping mall mistaking him to be Raghavan, which is coincidentally the very day she and Raghavan first met.

This causes Raghavan to kill Dhanapathi and one of the students, while covering up the murders and getting another of his colleagues, a police constable ([[Kanal Kannan]]) to be an eyewitness of this by pinning it all on Mani. Mani, on hearing of this, tries to get revenge by confronting and beating up all of Raghavan's colleagues including the constable, in which this in turn cause Raghavan to put and arrest Mani's brother-in-law, Natarajan, three of the students, and Auto behind bars.\n\nMani confronts Raghavan and a fight happens between them.

Raghavan attempted to use Priya as a hostage, only for him to be shot and killed by Mani, who was armed with Raghavan's gun, having managed to swipe it during the fight. Mani covers both murders by getting Priya to be an eyewitness to this crime, while also getting himself to be innocent by having the constable to reveal the entire truth to the press. Finally in the end, Priya reunites with Mani. They along with Auto and the rest of the tenants depart the house, gave their farewells to Natarajan and Gayatri, and went on their own separate ways. The film ends with a group of bachelors wanting to be the new tenants of the house by being just like the students pretended to be: good boys.
