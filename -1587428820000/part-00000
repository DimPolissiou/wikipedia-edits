A [[Big Bad Wolf]] blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of [[straw]] and [[Branch|sticks]] respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of [[brick]]s. Printed versions date back to the 1840s, but the story itself is thought to be much older. The phrases used in the story, and the various [[moral]]s drawn from it, have become embedded in [[Western culture]]. Many versions of ''The Three Little Pigs'' have been recreated and modified over the years, sometimes making the wolf a kind character.

The first little pig builds a house of [[straw]], but a wolf blows it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house of [[Branch|sticks]], which the wolf also blows down, and the second little pig is also devoured. Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely:\n\n{{poemquote|\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"\n\"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\"\n\"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite book | title = English Fairy Tales | first = Joseph| last = Jacobs | publisher = Oxford University | year = 1890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-EOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA69 | pages = 69}}</ref>}}\n\nThe third little pig builds a house of [[brick]]s, which the wolf fails to blow down. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time. Finally, the wolf resolves to come down the [[chimney]], whereupon the pig catches the wolf in a [[Cookware and bakeware|pot]] of boiling water, slams the lid on, then cooks and eats him.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn some versions, the first and second little pigs are not eaten by the wolf after he demolishes their homes, but instead run to their sister's house, who originally had to take care of the two boys and build a brick house. and after the wolf goes down the chimney he either dies like in the original or runs away and never returns to eat the three little pigs, who all survive in either case.\n\nThe story uses the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.<ref>{{cite book|title = [[The Seven Basic Plots|The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]] | first = Christopher | last= Booker | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2005 | pages = 230\u2013231 | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujDvUEpY10C&pg=PA230 | chapter = The Rule of Three}}</ref>\nVariations of the tale appeared in ''[[Uncle Remus]]: His Songs and Sayings'' in 1881. The story also made an appearance in ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' in 1883, both by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], in which the pigs were replaced by [[Brer Rabbit]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]'', published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing the interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\n\n==Later adaptations==\n\n===Disney cartoon===\n{{Main|The Three Little Pigs (film)}}\nThe most well-known version of the story {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} is the award-winning 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon, which was produced by [[Walt Disney]]. The production cast the title characters as ''Fifer Pig'', ''Fiddler Pig'', and ''Practical Pig''. The first two are depicted as both frivolous and arrogant. The story has been somewhat softened. The first two pigs still get their houses blown down, but escape from the wolf. Also, the wolf is not boiled to death but simply burns his behind and runs away. Three sequels soon followed in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively as a result of the short film's popularity.\n\nFifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf appeared in the 2001 series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' in many episodes, and again in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. The three pigs can be seen in [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as greetable characters.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal|title=In search of the real three little pigs - different versions of the story 'The Three Little Pigs' |magazine=Washington Monthly |date=November 1996 |first=Steven |last=Waldman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134443/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Warner Brothers and MGM versions===\nIn 1943, there was a [[Merrie Melodies]] version, ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'', which was a serious musical treatment, plus the usual [[Friz Freleng]] visual humor. It parodies both the Disney version, and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' itself.\n\nOther versions of the tale were also made. One was an [[MGM]] [[Tex Avery]] cartoon named ''[[Blitz Wolf]]'', a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi. Another animated spoof was a 1952 [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon called ''[[The Turn-Tale Wolf]]'', directed by Robert McKimson. This cartoon tells the story from the wolf's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains. Another Warner Brothers spoof was [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[The Three Little Bops]]'' (1957), which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band and their \"houses\" as the nightclubs they play at, each named accordingly.\n\n===Subsequent retellings===\nOne of [[Uncle Remus]]' stories, \"The Story of the Pigs\" (alt. title: \"Brer Wolf and the Pigs\"), found in ''Nights with Uncle Remus'' (1883), is a re-telling of the story, with the following differences:\n* There are five pigs in this version: Big Pig, Little Pig, Speckle Pig, Blunt and Runt.\n* Blunt is the only male; all the rest are females.\n* Big Pig builds a brush house, Little Pig builds a stick house, Speckle Pig builds a mud house, Blunt builds a plank house and Runt builds a stone house.   \n* The Wolf's verse goes: ''\"If you'll open the door and let me in, I'll warm my hands and go home again.\"''\n\nIn 1953, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]] narrated a jazz version of The Three Little Pigs on a Brunswick Records 78 r.p.m. record album titled \"steve allen's grimm fairy tales for hip kids\" with piano blues accompaniment by Lou Stein. Also in 1953, Tex Avery did a [[Droopy]] cartoon, \"The Three Little Pups\". In it, the wolf is a [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] dog catcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) trying to catch Droopy and his brothers, Snoopy and Loopy, to put in the dog pound. Though successfully blowing the first two houses down, he meets his match when he fails to blow down Droopy's house of bricks. The dog catcher makes several failed attempts to destroy the house and catch the pups. His last failed attempt ends with him \"going into television\" where he is playing a cowboy on the TV show the pups were watching.\n\nIn 1985, the story was re-told as the first episode of Season Four of ''[[Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', with [[Billy Crystal]] as artistic \"Larry Pig\" (the smart third pig), [[Jeff Goldblum]] as henpecked \"Buck Wolf\", [[Stephen Furst]] as capitalistic \"Peter Pig\" (the first pig), [[Fred Willard]] as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] \"Paul Pig\" (the second pig), [[Doris Roberts]] as \"Mother Pig\" and [[Valerie Perrine]] as love interest \"Tina Pig\". In this version, all three pigs buy their building materials from the same junk salesman ([[Larry Hankin]]).\n\nThe 1989 parody ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'' is presented as a first-person narrative by the wolf, who portrays the entire incident as a misunderstanding; he had gone to the pigs to borrow some sugar, had destroyed their houses in a sneezing fit, ate the first two pigs to not waste food (since they'd died in the house collapse anyway), and was caught attacking the third pig's house after the pig had continually insulted him.<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\nThe 1992 [[Green Jell\u00f6]] song, ''[[Three Little Pigs (song)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (and its [[claymation]] music video) sets the story in [[Los Angeles]]. The wolf drives a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, the first little pig is an aspiring [[guitarist]], the second is a [[cannabis smoking]], [[dumpster diving]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and the third holds a [[Master of Architecture]] degree from [[Harvard University]]. In the end, with all three pigs barricaded in the brick house, the third pig calls [[9-1-1]]. [[John Rambo]] is dispatched to the scene, and kills the wolf with a [[machine gun]].\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''[[The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig]]'' inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot: the wolves build a brick house, then a concrete house, then a steel house, and finally a house of flowers. The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List of Shrek characters#Three Little Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List of Shrek characters#The Big Bad Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story.

A [[Big Bad Wolf]] blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of [[straw]] and [[Branch|sticks]] respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of [[brick]]s. Printed versions date back to the 1840s, but the story itself is thought to be much older. The phrases used in the story, and the various [[moral]]s drawn from it, have become embedded in [[Western culture]]. Many versions of ''The Three Little Pigs'' have been recreated and modified over the years, sometimes making the wolf a kind character.

The first little pig builds a house of [[straw]], but a wolf blows it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house of [[Branch|sticks]], which the wolf also blows down, and the second little pig is also devoured. Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely:\n\n{{poemquote|\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"\n\"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\"\n\"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite book | title = English Fairy Tales | first = Joseph| last = Jacobs | publisher = Oxford University | year = 1890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-EOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA69 | pages = 69}}</ref>}}\n\nThe third little pig builds a house of [[brick]]s, which the wolf fails to blow down. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time. Finally, the wolf resolves to come down the [[chimney]], whereupon the pig catches the wolf in a [[Cookware and bakeware|pot]] of boiling water, slams the lid on, then cooks and eats him.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn some versions, the first and second little pigs are not eaten by the wolf after he demolishes their homes, but instead run to their sister's house, who originally had to take care of the two boys and build a brick house. and after the wolf goes down the chimney he either dies like in the original or runs away and never returns to eat the three little pigs, who all survive in either case.\n\nThe story uses the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.<ref>{{cite book|title = [[The Seven Basic Plots|The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]] | first = Christopher | last= Booker | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2005 | pages = 230\u2013231 | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujDvUEpY10C&pg=PA230 | chapter = The Rule of Three}}</ref>\nVariations of the tale appeared in ''[[Uncle Remus]]: His Songs and Sayings'' in 1881. The story also made an appearance in ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' in 1883, both by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], in which the pigs were replaced by [[Brer Rabbit]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]'', published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing the interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\n\n==Later adaptations==\n\n===Disney cartoon===\n{{Main|The Three Little Pigs (film)}}\nThe most well-known version of the story {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} is the award-winning 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon, which was produced by [[Walt Disney]]. The production cast the title characters as ''Fifer Pig'', ''Fiddler Pig'', and ''Practical Pig''. The first two are depicted as both frivolous and arrogant. The story has been somewhat softened. The first two pigs still get their houses blown down, but escape from the wolf. Also, the wolf is not boiled to death but simply burns his behind and runs away. Three sequels soon followed in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively as a result of the short film's popularity.\n\nFifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf appeared in the 2001 series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' in many episodes, and again in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. The three pigs can be seen in [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as greetable characters.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal|title=In search of the real three little pigs - different versions of the story 'The Three Little Pigs' |magazine=Washington Monthly |date=November 1996 |first=Steven |last=Waldman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134443/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Warner Brothers and MGM versions===\nIn 1943, there was a [[Merrie Melodies]] version, ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'', which was a serious musical treatment, plus the usual [[Friz Freleng]] visual humor. It parodies both the Disney version, and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' itself.\n\nOther versions of the tale were also made. One was an [[MGM]] [[Tex Avery]] cartoon named ''[[Blitz Wolf]]'', a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi. Another animated spoof was a 1952 [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon called ''[[The Turn-Tale Wolf]]'', directed by Robert McKimson. This cartoon tells the story from the wolf's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains. Another Warner Brothers spoof was [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[The Three Little Bops]]'' (1957), which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band and their \"houses\" as the nightclubs they play at, each named accordingly.\n\n===Subsequent retellings===\nOne of [[Uncle Remus]]' stories, \"The Story of the Pigs\" (alt. title: \"Brer Wolf and the Pigs\"), found in ''Nights with Uncle Remus'' (1883), is a re-telling of the story, with the following differences:\n* There are five pigs in this version: Big Pig, Little Pig, Speckle Pig, Blunt and Runt.\n* Blunt is the only male; all the rest are females.\n* Big Pig builds a brush house, Little Pig builds a stick house, Speckle Pig builds a mud house, Blunt builds a plank house and Runt builds a stone house.   \n* The Wolf's verse goes: ''\"If you'll open the door and let me in, I'll warm my hands and go home again.\"''\n\nIn 1953, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]] narrated a jazz version of The Three Little Pigs on a Brunswick Records 78 r.p.m. record album titled \"steve allen's grimm fairy tales for hip kids\" with piano blues accompaniment by Lou Stein. Also in 1953, Tex Avery did a [[Droopy]] cartoon, \"The Three Little Pups\". In it, the wolf is a [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] dog catcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) trying to catch Droopy and his brothers, Snoopy and Loopy, to put in the dog pound. Though successfully blowing the first two houses down, he meets his match when he fails to blow down Droopy's house of bricks. The dog catcher makes several failed attempts to destroy the house and catch the pups. His last failed attempt ends with him \"going into television\" where he is playing a cowboy on the TV show the pups were watching.\n\nIn 1985, the story was re-told as the first episode of Season Four of ''[[Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', with [[Billy Crystal]] as artistic \"Larry Pig\" (the smart third pig), [[Jeff Goldblum]] as henpecked \"Buck Wolf\", [[Stephen Furst]] as capitalistic \"Peter Pig\" (the first pig), [[Fred Willard]] as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] \"Paul Pig\" (the second pig), [[Doris Roberts]] as \"Mother Pig\" and [[Valerie Perrine]] as love interest \"Tina Pig\". In this version, all three pigs buy their building materials from the same junk salesman ([[Larry Hankin]]).\n\nThe 1989 parody ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'' is presented as a first-person narrative by the wolf, who portrays the entire incident as a misunderstanding; he had gone to the pigs to borrow some sugar, had destroyed their houses in a sneezing fit, ate the first two pigs to not waste food (since they'd died in the house collapse anyway), and was caught attacking the third pig's house after the pig had continually insulted him.<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\nThe 1992 [[Green Jell\u00f6]] song, ''[[Three Little Pigs (song)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (and its [[claymation]] music video) sets the story in [[Los Angeles]]. The wolf drives a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, the first little pig is an aspiring [[guitarist]], the second is a [[cannabis smoking]], [[dumpster diving]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and the third holds a [[Master of Architecture]] degree from [[Harvard University]]. In the end, with all three pigs barricaded in the brick house, the third pig calls [[9-1-1]]. [[John Rambo]] is dispatched to the scene, and kills the wolf with a [[machine gun]].\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''[[The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig]]'' inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot: the wolves build a brick house, then a concrete house, then a steel house, and finally a house of flowers. The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List of Shrek characters#Three Little Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List of Shrek characters#The Big Bad Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story.

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).  Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese.  Each municipality is further divided into one or more [[parish]]es which each contain one or more congregations. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Deanery (''Prosti'') !!

It is celebrated in honor of [[Haile Selassie]]'s 1966 visit to Jamaica.\n\n==Visit of Selassie to Jamaica==\nHaile Selassie had already met with several Rasta elders in [[Addis Ababa]], and had allowed Rastafari and other [[African diaspora|people of African descent]] to settle on his personal land in [[Shashamane]].\n\nHaile Selassie visited [[Jamaica]] on Thursday, April 21, 1966. Some 100,000 Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on [[Palisadoes Airport]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]],<ref name=\"Dread\">Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica, by Joseph Owens ISBN</ref> having heard that the man whom they considered to be God was coming to visit them.

The day had been overcast and stormy. After about half an hour, the door swung open and the emperor appeared at the top of the mobile steps.

Selassie waved from the top of the steps; some interpreters have claimed that he shed tears, although this is disputed. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras [[Mortimer Planno]], a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor's descent.<ref>''Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley'' by Timothy White p. 15, 210, 211.</ref> When Planno reemerged, he announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land\"<ref>''Black Heretics, Black Prophets: Radical Political Intellectuals'' p. 189 by Anthony Bogues</ref> After Planno escorted the African monarch down the steps, journalists were puzzled by Selassie's refusal to walk on the red carpet on the way to his limousine. (hence ''grounation'', [[Iyaric]] equivalent of ''foundation'', \"uplifted\" with the sound of the word ''ground'' in the sense of \"making contact with the soil\") He was then driven to the [[Official residence# Jamaica|King's House]], the residence of [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]] [[Clifford Campbell]].<ref name=\"White, p. 211\">White, p. 211.</ref> \n\nAs a result of Planno's actions, the Jamaican authorities were asked to ensure that Rastafari representatives were present at all state functions attended by His Majesty,<ref>''Rastafari: From Outcasts to Culture Bearers'' Page 86 by Ennis Barrington Edmonds</ref><ref>''Verbal Riddim: The Politics and Aesthetics of African-Caribbean Dub Poetry'', page 83 by Christian Habekost</ref> and Rastafari elders, including Planno and probably [[Joseph Hibbert]], also obtained a private audience with the Emperor,<ref>Edmonds, p. 86</ref> where he reportedly told them that they should not immigrate to Ethiopia until they had first liberated the people of Jamaica.

It is celebrated in honor of [[Haile Selassie]]'s 1966 visit to Jamaica\n\n==Visit of Selassie to Jamaica==\nHaile Selassie had already met with several Rasta elders in [[Addis Ababa]], and had allowed Rastafari and other [[African diaspora|people of African descent]] to settle on his personal land in [[Shashamane]].\n\nHaile Selassie visited [[Jamaica]] on Thursday, April 21, 1966. Some 100,000 Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on [[Palisadoes Airport]] in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]],<ref name=\"Dread\">Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica, by Joseph Owens ISBN</ref> having heard that the man whom they considered to be God was coming to visit them. They waited at the airport playing [[drum]]s and smoking large quantities of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref name=\"Dread\"/> Today the Rastafari celebrate that Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on {{nowrap|April 21}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/holydays/holydays.shtml |title=Rastafari: Holy days |date=October 20, 2011 |website=BBC  |access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen Haile Selassie's [[Ethiopian Airlines]] flight landed at the airport at {{nowrap|1:30&nbsp;pm}}, the crowd surrounded his plane on the [[Airport apron|tarmac]]. The day had been overcast and stormy. After about half an hour, the door swung open and the emperor appeared at the top of the mobile steps. A deafening tumult was heard from the crowd, who beat [[calabash]] drums, lit firecrackers, waved signs, and sounded [[Abeng]] horns of the [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |title=A Special Gleaner Feature on Pieces of the Past \u2013 All Hail The State Visit of Emperor Haile Selassie I \u2013 The first 500 years in Jamaica |publisher=Jamaica-gleaner.com |accessdate=April 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511172601/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0022.html |archivedate=May 11, 2011 }}</ref> All protocol was dropped as the crowd pressed past the security forces and onto the [[red carpet]] that had been laid out for the reception. Selassie waved from the top of the steps; some interpreters have claimed that he shed tears, although this is disputed. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras [[Mortimer Planno]], a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the Emperor's descent.<ref>''Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley'' by Timothy White p. 15, 210, 211.</ref> When Planno reemerged, he announced to the crowd: \"The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm.
